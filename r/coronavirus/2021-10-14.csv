(1) on the timing of immune-affecting drugs, cdc says:

&gt; Whenever possible, mRNA COVID-19 vaccination doses (including the primary series and an additional dose) or the single dose Janssen COVID-19 vaccine should be completed at least two weeks before initiation or resumption of immunosuppressive therapies, but timing of COVID-19 vaccination should take into consideration current or planned immunosuppressive therapies and optimization of both the patient‚Äôs medical condition and response to vaccine.

&gt; A patient‚Äôs clinical team is best positioned to determine the degree of immune compromise and appropriate timing of vaccination.

(2) cdc recommends deferring vaccination if you receive monoclonal antibodies for covid so the monoclonals don't stomp out the vaccine-generated spikes before your own immune system notices them:

&gt;  Based on the estimated half-life of such therapies and evidence suggesting that reinfection is uncommon within the 90 days after initial infection, vaccination should be deferred for at least 90 days after receiving monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma for treatment. This is a precautionary measure until additional information becomes available, to avoid potential interference of the antibody therapy with vaccine-induced immune responses. This recommendation applies to people who receive passive antibody therapy before receiving any vaccine dose and between doses.

The studies that can be interpreted as ""they have the same viral load"" are all using CT values as a surrogate for viral load. They don't measure actual virus.

The studies that did measure actual virus have had less success getting any from vaccinated people. Turns out that the correlation between viable viral load and CT values don't work the same way in vaccinated people compared to unvaccinated people. 

Imagine a new toenail fungus. We'll call the disease ""ToeFu21"", and the fungus Toecyllium. The vaccine is Toecyvax. 

Imagine we use PCR tests to determine whether or not someone has the fungus. There's a slight delay between when people vaccinated with Toecyvax are infected and when they show symptoms and mount an immune response. People who have had Toecyvax do get infected, and some develop symptoms, but most people never get symptoms after vaccination. Samples for testing are taken from toenail clippings.

Brazil jumps up by about 150k, France loses damn near 350k total cases (i.e. ~350k French people miraculously never caught Covid) and Turkey gains near on 825k cases.

Searching ""France reports drop in total covid cases"" and ""France reduces total covid cases by 300,000"" doesn't get any results.

&gt;Russia reported a new record number of both daily coronavirus deaths and infections Friday, as **health officials warned the country faces a ‚Äúnear-critical‚Äù situation** and pleaded with Russians to get vaccinated against the virus.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The government‚Äôs coronavirus information center reported **999 fatalities** over the past 24 hours, up from Thursday‚Äôs record of 985 deaths.Russia has now set a **new record number of fatalities for 13 of the last 17 days.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The country also **reported an all-time high of 32,196 new coronavirus cases**, up from the previous record 31,299 infections reported Thursday.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Earlier in the week Russia‚Äôs Health Minister said **more than 90% of the country‚Äôs hospital beds for coronavirus patients were occupied**.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Surging cases and fatalities puts Russia at odds with the global trend of a pandemic showing some signs of a retreat. The World Health Organization (WHO) said earlier this week that global deaths from Covid-19 are falling and have reached their lowest levels in almost a year.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The government‚Äôs official death toll since the start of the pandemic stands at 221,313 ‚Äî Europe‚Äôs highest ‚Äî while Russia‚Äôs total excess fatality count during the same period is at least 660,000.Russia‚Äôs total virus caseload is the fifth-highest in the world at 7.9 million.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The **Kremlin has ruled out imposing a lockdown to help stop the spread of the virus.** Dozens of Russian regions have introduced vaccine mandates for certain categories of workers and vaccine passports for entry into crowded indoor venues in an attempt to boost weak uptake.

I'm very much for vaccines, they saved my life when I was born, but this is going too far. Either we bridge the hate gap by helping people and expose them to the truth, or we push them further down the isolating political rabbit hole... this is pushing them down that hole...

Pepe have become so polarized to either say in a knee-jerk fashion ""you're only right"" or ""you are only wrong"" and the truth doesnt accept this kind of logic. Hard truth is that these people need love and support in order to see the light and course correct the error of their ways. Whether you think it is childish of them and selfish is besides the point. The fact of the matter is that doing this doesn't make any one of us a better person, it makes us just as bad if not worse than this other side we have created in the grander scheme of the ""us vs. them"" mentality.

For example, if one of these healthcare workers has a family, those children grow up with the same mentality as they only perceive (or see through it) the effects of this decision and not the causes, or may not yet fully understand it. People fail to realize that things like this have far reaching consequences that we cannot fathom, and in a time like this knee-jerk reactionary positions (both from the center left and right in this country) will only further serve to add to fuel to the metaphorical fire that has been raging for the past two years (with regards to the pandemic only).",,,,1634298600,{},hgq7qqa,False,t3_q8625m,False,True,t3_q8625m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q8625m/no_unemployment_checks_for_maine_health_workers/hgq7qqa/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,25f4d5293ea7d42aa890b3b6fc696936d6659776,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1634298611.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,,

Tom Wolf announced Wednesday.

&gt;As of October 13, Pennsylvania vaccine providers have administered 13,135,136 COVID-19 vaccines.

&gt;""The commonwealth has reached a milestone in our fight against this deadly virus,"" said Wolf. ""Now, 70% of Pennsylvania's adults have accepted their responsibility to stop the spread of COVID-19 and most importantly keep themselves and their loved ones safe. This milestone is critical to protect those not yet eligible for the vaccine, like our children under 12 years of age.""

&gt;The commonwealth currently ranks 7th nationally in first doses administered.

&gt;""To everyone who has gotten vaccinated, thank you,"" said Wolf. ""For those not yet vaccinated, please consider joining us in doing your part. Visit a vaccine provider as soon as possible. Vaccines are safe and effective, and the one scientifically proven way to stop the spread of this deadly virus.""

&gt;The City of Philadelphia hit the 70% milestone on October 7.

&gt;""I'm extremely proud that 70% of adults in Philadelphia have heeded the advice of experts and are fully vaccinated from the dangers of COVID-19,"" said Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney.

But we also know that the immune system keeps developing after the antigen is gone.

&gt;Vaccinated individuals are still part of the problem though, especially if they go on about their lives pretending the pandemic is over.

Covid obviously will not disappear, but if every individual in france who can be vaccinated would be vaccinated, it would be as over as it gets at this point. 

&gt;How does this compare to unvaccinated individuals who wash their hands, wear their mask and social distance whenever possible? How does it compare to individuals who've contracted the virus and built natural immunity?

They still spread the virus at a higher rate than vaccinated people, and they still burden the system at a higher rate. 

&gt;Should people be forced into submission?

Yes. 

&gt;Given the disparity in vaccine availability between developed and developing nations - and all the dangers this entails re: spread and mutation - what is the likelihood that forcing people into submission will end the pandemic? Is there a reliable way to measure this?

""As over as it gets at the moment"". Hiding your own fear behind ""but what about developing countries"" is childish at best. What's the argument here? ""I'll get the shot once every Senegalese has got it""? 

&gt;And to what extent is democracy compromised if this approach is taken?

Not at all. Democracy = the majority/the elected law makers at any given time decides what you can do (smoke, but not snort cocaine) what you can't do (smoke inside) and what you have to do (pay taxes). That fact that you don't like a what you have to do by law doesn't mean its undemocratic, it just means that you don't like it. ""bodily integrity"" is not an argument that serves you - but me - once you realise that your health (and that of others!!) is better protected with the vaccine than without. 

&gt;I should also point out that in many countries, citizens are often required to be tested for high-risk, indoor activities regardless of their vaccination status. Is it really fair if one group has to pay for tests and the other doesn't?

Yes, it's fair, because one of the groups are the sole reason why we still have to test at all. Once ""everyone"" is vaccinated, we can draw a definite line: now we can go on living our lives normally, even though a large number of people still will get sick and die of it. The alternative (worldwide vaccination rates of 99 % whatever your alternative  might be) is not an option, because we can't wait for another 30 years. We will get back to a new normality, without testing everybody all the time. Antivaxxers are making that harder, but without any viable reason and against all and every scientific evidence.

Why can't you people just stop arguing and start accepting what is necessary?

Getting vaccinated is supposed to reduce your already small chances of being hospitalized and dying. It doesn't stop you from getting infected or spreading the disease, especially several months down the road when your antibodies have waned. I'm not recounting a personal anecdote or pushing some political agenda - this is stated explicitly in the latest official recommendations and used as justification to encourage handwashing, mask wearing and social distancing regardless of vaccination status.

&gt;It follows from the above that both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals would benefit from getting tested. It could be argued that, statistically, one group benefits more than the other, but then why aren't we seeing a discounted rate for vaccinated individuals? Why is only one group required to pay for tests? Why is only one group terminated with cause? Why is only one group prohibited from entering certain establishments or travelling to certain countries?

&gt;Seems to me like imperfect circumstances are being met with absolute punishment in an effort to salvage arguably the biggest blunder since 9/11, if you can even call it a blunder. Then again, I'm just some random dude on the internet - what do I know about anything?

The data on boosters helping is even muddier - the Israel paper that gets cited a lot claims huge effects from an analysis comparing those who got a booster to those who didn't, but the very same paper has a secondary analysis comparing people to themselves directly after the booster vs later, and the booster effect is much smaller, and that data still has problems (people are told that they will have better protection in a week, so they stay home/wear masks/etc for that week, we can't know how much of the apparent booster effect is behavioral).

I would be surprised if boosters were not given across the board at some time, but the current data on both waning and the booster effect is weak and uncertain.

Consider [this heat map](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/vaccinations?areaType=nation%26areaName=England#card-vaccination_uptake_by_vaccination_date_age_demographics) showing the vaccination uptake over time in England, by age group.

And then end with this?

&gt; Unfortunately, The position we currently find ourselves in is the product of rampant misinformation and irresponsible entitlement. ""Muh freedoms"" got us here, so the government is forced to act and demand we get vaccinated. If everyone had just followed the damn rules the first time, we probably WOULD have a choice, but as usual people suck and we can't have anything nice.

That first part is misinformation. 

Vaccines are not ‚Äúbandaids‚Äù, they‚Äôre preventative tools. The approved vaccines, especially the mRNA types, have shown to be extremely effective at preventing severe cases, hospitalization, and death. 

They‚Äôre also not ‚Äúexperiments‚Äù. All currently approved vaccines have gone through clinical trials. 

Authorities on vaccines have stated that any serious side effects would have presented themselves directly after injection or within the first few weeks after receiving the shot, and NOT a half a year, a year, or a few years down the line. At best, you‚Äôre just misinformed and ignorant, and at worst, you‚Äôre knowingly spreading misinformation.

If the FDA signs off on Moderna's booster, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will make specific recommendations on who should get the shots. CDC advisers are scheduled to meet next week.

The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee met on Thursday to consider the additional dose of the Moderna vaccine and will weigh whether to make a similar recommendation for Johnson &amp; Johnson's (JNJ.N) vaccine on Friday.

They claim that they chose 50 because 'both 50 and 100 boosted by at least 66 fold'... but have not disclosed the results of that study to show how much higher 100 was; they just thought 50 was good enough. Then they also cited 'worldwide vaccine supply' as a reason. It's basically ""Looks good enough at 50, we want to double our sales.""

They talked about the mix/match study that showed 100ug *does* raise antibody levels even higher than in their 50ug studies; but note participants in that study had higher initial titers. But we know higher initial titers = smaller boost in other studies, so it's not clear that fully explains it.

Aurora-based Children's Hospital Colorado is seeing unusually high pediatric hospitalizations as respiratory illnesses that typically peak in the winter emerge earlier and COVID-19 rates among children remain high, reports The Gazette.  
""Fortunately, we here at Children's Hospital Colorado have been able to meet the recent surge, but we're in a difficult moment in time,"" Sean O'Leary, MD, infectious disease physician and director of pediatric research at the hospital, told reporters Oct. 14. ""Respiratory viruses that we normally see during the winter are at very high levels right now, and those combined with children with COVID-19 have led to a pretty full hospital.""  
Children's is still accepting out-of-state transfers and hasn't hit capacity, Mike DiStefano, MD, CMO at Children's Colorado Springs campus, told The Gazette.  
Colorado pediatric COVID-19 rates have been higher than any other age group during this surge, which began in August, reports The Gazette. Dr. O'Leary said September infection rates were higher for children than any other point of the pandemic.  
""With well over 500 pediatric deaths as I speak, COVID-19 fits squarely in the top 10 causes of childhood deaths in the U.S.,"" Dr. O'Leary said. Children's has treated more than 1,000 COVID-19 patients and several deaths, he said.  
Beginning in August, RSV has already hit unprecedented highs, despite normally peaking in winter. Rhinovirus is also circulating, and COVID-19 surges are driven by the delta variant, children returning to school and inability to receive a vaccine.    
""This is historic. This doesn't happen,"" Dr. DiStefano said. ""I've been doing this for 15, 18-plus years, and this is not when we see our respiratory surge. It's really, highly unusual.""   
He also said the various respiratory illnesses are ""all equal at this point"" in terms of pediatric hospitalizations and hospital visits, noting that one is not more extreme than the other.  
Nearby, Denver-based Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children, while not at capacity, is ""certainly very full, depending on the day,"" spokesperson Stephanie Sullivan wrote in an Oct. 13 email to The Gazette. ""It's really a combination of a variety of medical, surgical and respiratory cases, but not predominantly COVID.""

We got him tested and it came back positive. He was thankfully asymptomatic. The day we called the school nurse to inform that he was positive she said ""and he's asymptomatic? Oh no!""

It follows from the above that both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals would benefit from getting tested. It could be argued that, statistically, one group benefits more than the other, but then why aren't we seeing a discounted rate for vaccinated individuals? Why is only one group required to pay for tests? Why is only one group terminated with cause? Why is only one group prohibited from entering certain establishments or travelling to certain countries?

For example, we can also accurately say that 80% of US individuals earn less than $62,500 per year. Or that if we‚Äôre rounding things off, that the real median household income in the us is a lot closer to $67k than $70k, what with it being $67,521 for 2020. Perhaps more realistically, we might consider the median *disposable* household income (removing taxes, mostly; look it up for details), which the OECD calculation puts at under $35k and the LIS calculation puts at under $27k for US households.

We might also be aware the the national average rent price is currently around $1,836/mo ($22,032/yr), or that the average annual cost of health insurance in the US (not including deductibles or other OOP costs) is $7,470 per individual or $21,342 for a family. For employer-sponsored plans, most of the latter is subsidized by employers and the average employee contribution is closer to $6k/yr; for part time workers, the self-employed (see also: ‚Äúthe gig economy‚Äù), and anyone else not getting employer-subsidized plans, the average household cost for health insurance is around $14k/yr. (Was higher before the ACA.) This works out to be a little backwards, where those typically earning the least end up paying the most out of pocket for their insurance premiums.

Lots of ways to look at statistics and draw conclusions. It sure seems like the median US household is spending something like 40% of their gross income or up to 104% of their disposable income on housing and health insurance alone, from a certain angle. 

Glancing quickly at retirement savings calculators (which assume SSI), it looks like everyone should also be saving upwards of 20% of their gross income toward retirement throughout their adult lives if they want to avoid dying in or near poverty. (Max SSI benefit right now is a bit below the poverty line.)

If you're interested in the history of Plagues, there's an incredible book by William Defoe, 
*A Journal of the Plague Year, 1665.*

 Defoe actually lived through it in London and recorded what he saw. (He also wrote Robinson Crusoe). He saw infected families Quarantined by being forcibly shut up in their houses until they either recovered or died. He describes the wagons carrying the dead to mass burial pits (which are still being discovered in London today.)

My goal is to find the best information to equip myself for a good conversation with our rheumatologist. My high-level questions are (1) should she stop taking Embrel in advance of the vaccine so as not to reduce the response and effectiveness of the vaccine, and if so, for how long should she stop? And (2) are monoclonal antibody injections something we should consider?

I see some information in the [arthritis.org FAQ](https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/about-arthritis/related-conditions/other-diseases/covid-19-faqs-medication-treatment-and-vaccines) indicating that disease modifying drugs may reduce the response of the vaccines ([limited data, not peer reviewed](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.05.21254656v2)). It specifically listed ‚Äúmore modest reductions‚Äù in patients using TNF inhibitors. Has anyone heard anything more authoritative?

Additionally, I see [this article from The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/19/covid-prep-antibody-injections-immunosuppressed-vaccines) indicating reduced antibody production for immunosuppressed.

Here I made an abridged version of the table for Reddit:

Day 15 IgG Serum Binding Antibody

Original | JJ | Moderna | Pfizer
---------|----------|----------|----------
With JJ boost | 326.0 | 3029.4 | 1904.7
With Moderna | 3203.1 | 6799.8 | 6155.0 
With Pfizer | 2549.5 | 5195.6 | 3409.1

Day 15 Neutralizing Antibody Titers

Original | JJ | Moderna | Pfizer
---------|----------|----------|----------
With JJ boost | 31.42 (4.2) | 382.1 (6.2) | 216.4 (12.5)
With Moderna | 676.1 (75.9) | 901.8 (10.2) | 785.8 (31.7)
With Pfizer | 341.3 (35.1) | 677.9 (11.5) | 446.7 (20.0)

In parentheses: Day 15 geometric mean fold rise over previous antibody levels

So you get a 1.76 fold increase by getting a Moderna booster if you got Pfizer originally... with the caveat Moderna went profiteering and cut the booster in half so you'd need to get a 3rd shot instead of a booster to realize the full benefit, since this study reflects a 100ug booster.

We aren't even saving them from themselves, we're just delaying their stupid prizes they win for playing their stupid games.

As to protecting the kids themselves, if someone is seriously worried about their kid getting the disease, they should strongly consider keeping the kids at home until the kid can get vaccinated.  This study shows less than a 50% reduction in spread based on masks, so masks are not really an effective way to keep your vulnerable child safe, again you're just delaying when they'll get it, not really preventing it.

Vaccination and natural immunity are the only way this really ends, and obviously vaccination is preferable.

Regarding myocarditis and the risks associated.  I'm really not even interested in wasting my time right now trying to hunt down the studies that prompted many of the Nordic countries to shift policy in regard to the original regimen.  Not to mention that this still a very evolving situation, so there might not be a simple ""haha I'm right and you're wrong"" answer.  But if you insist, and you don't believe that these countries had any scientific basis for making these decisions, I am sure we can go to /r/COVID19 weekly thread and ask.  In fact I highly suggest you do.

My only claim was that such policies exist, in many developed countries.  We're just now starting the conversation regarding boosters, so having great data on myocarditis and boosters may only be available from Israel, and only in regard to Pfizer.

When you label the risk ""low"", it's a relative term.  It's low, yes.  But Pfizer had a lower rate than Moderna, at least for the original regimen.  This may or may not hold true for the booster, but we'll know soon enough.

Again if you don't believe any of this (or even if you do), I highly suggest posting on r/COVID19 weekly thread.
