**Serrana, SP, complete 16 days without deaths by Covid-19, show data from Health**  

City participating in the study of mass vaccination of the Butantan Institute has not recorded death by disease since June 28. Cases in July also show reduction and only three residents are hospitalized in infirmaries.

Serrana (SP), city chosen for a mass vaccination project with CoronaVac against Covid-19 of the Butantan Institute, complete, on Wednesday (14), 16 days without recorded deaths from the disease. According to the Municipal Health Secretariat, the last death was on June 28.

The folder also states that only three residents of the city are hospitalized in treatment against the disease. All in infirmaries.

In addition, the epidemiological bulletin also points out a reduction in the number of cases compared to recent months. While June had a total of 229 confirmed cases, the first half of July is coming to an end with 55. If the infected rate is maintained, this month will end with half the cases in relation to the previous one.

According to the state government's Vacinometer, Serrana has already vaccinated 34,670 thousand people with the first dose. Of these, 32,363 also received the second dose and are fully immunized, being 27,160 by Project S, of Butantan.

Pandemic after Project S

According to the Health Secretary, Leila Gusm√£o, the deaths registered in June are of residents with comorbidities. Two of them were not vaccinated, one received only one dose and three others completed the immunization.

She points out that no vaccine offers 100% protection and that there is, yes, reduced chances of serious cases. In Serrana, most of those infected after the Butantan project had mild symptoms, according to Leila.



Despite the improvement in indicators, the secretary admits that the city has difficulties in raising awareness among residents about the need to maintain disease prevention protocols, such as the use of masks, for example.

She also reminds that the volunteers of Project S continue to be monitored by the researchers of the study in order to clarify more information about CoronaVac.

Project S

In ""Project S"", Serrana vaccinated, with two doses, 27,160 people over 18 years, except pregnant women, women who gave birth near the day of vaccination, people with comorbidities and infected by Covid during the days of research in the city. The number is equivalent to 98% of residents registered in the survey.

Results presented by Butantan pointed out that symptomatic cases of the disease had an 80% reduction after the two vaccination stages, besides the 95% drop in the number of deaths in the city in April and 86% decrease in hospitalizations.

For scientists, the control of the pandemic occurred after the complete immunization reached 75% of the group of volunteers, which corresponds to about 20,300 people.

This was possible to observe from the moment in which the blue group - last to be immunized - already showed benefits even before receiving the first dose of CoronaVac.

According to Butantan, the clinical study of mass vaccination against Covid-19 also pointed out that the immunized ones cause an indirect effect of protection even to those who did not receive any dose of the vaccine.",,,,1626566457,{},h5kkwmo,False,t3_omf3jg,False,False,t3_omf3jg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/omf3jg/brazilian_city_serrana_completes_16_days_without/h5kkwmo/,1626726520,54,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Overwhelmed hospitals have added thousands of beds, but on average, 10 percent of their health care workers are in isolation after exposure to the virus, said the secretary general of the Indonesian Hospital Association, Dr. Lia G. Partakusuma. Some hospitals are using five times as much liquid oxygen as normal, and distributors are having difficulty keeping up with the demand, she said.  
  
‚ÄúSome hospitals have said, ‚ÄòIf you brought your own oxygen tank, please use it first because we have a limited oxygen supply,‚Äô‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut it is not a requirement for them to bring their own oxygen.‚Äù  
  
With hospitals so overcrowded, many people choose to stay home ‚Äî and many die there. Lapor Covid, a nonprofit group that is tracking deaths from the disease, reports that at least 40 Covid patients a day are now dying at home.  
  
Mr. Joko, the president, has stopped short of a nationwide lockdown but ordered restrictions in Java and Bali, including closing places of worship, schools, shopping malls and sports facilities, reducing public transit capacity and limiting restaurants to takeout. The restrictions are set to expire on Tuesday, but officials are weighing whether to extend them.  
  
Only about 15 percent of Indonesia‚Äôs 270 million people have received a dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and just 6 percent are fully inoculated. Indonesia has relied heavily on the vaccine made by Sinovac Biotech, a Chinese company, which has proved less effective than other shots. At least 20 Indonesian doctors who were fully vaccinated with Sinovac have died from the virus.  
  
This week, the United States donated 4.5 million doses of the Moderna vaccine to Indonesia. Officials said the first priority would be to give booster shots to nearly 1.5 million health workers.  
  
Dr. Budiman, the Indonesian epidemiologist in Australia, predicted more than a year ago that Indonesia would become a pandemic epicenter because of its dense population and weak health care system. He has urged more testing, contact tracing and isolation of infected individuals.  
  
Indonesia‚Äôs health minister, Budi Gunadi Sadikin, said Friday that the country had increased testing to about 230,000 people a day, from about 30,000 in December. His target is 400,000 a day.  
  
But Dr. Budiman contends that testing is still woefully limited, noting that in recent days, the share of tests that came up positive had risen to more than 30 percent. Health experts say a high rate is a sign of too little testing.  
  
‚ÄúFor more than a year, our test positivity rate has almost never been below 10 percent, which means we are missing many cases and we cannot identify the majority of infections and the clusters,‚Äù he said.  
  
Outside the small CV Rintis Usaha Bersama oxygen shop in South Jakarta, more than 100 customers lined up in the street with their oxygen tanks and waited hours for the chance to refill them.  
  
Alif Akhirul Ramadan, 27, said he was getting oxygen for his grandmother, 77, who was being cared for by family members at home. He said that her condition had suddenly worsened and that her tank was running low.

The Pandemic Has a New Epicenter: Indonesia  
The suffering that ravaged places like India and Brazil ‚Äî with deaths soaring, hospitals overwhelmed and oxygen running out ‚Äî has reached Southeast Asia.

BEKASI, Indonesia ‚Äî By the thousands, they sleep in hallways, tents and cars, gasping for air as they wait for beds in overcrowded hospitals that may not have oxygen to give them. Others see hospitals as hopeless, even dangerous, and take their chances at home.  
  
Wherever they lie, as Covid-19 steals their breath away, their families engage in a frantic, daily hunt for scarce supplies of life-giving oxygen.  
  
Indonesia has become the new epicenter of the pandemic, surpassing India and Brazil to become the country with the world‚Äôs highest count of new infections. ‚Äã The surge is part of a wave across Southeast Asia, where vaccination rates are low but countries had, until recently contained the virus relatively well‚Äã. Vietnam, Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand are also facing their largest outbreaks yet and have imposed new restrictions, including lockdowns and stay-at-home orders.  
  
In Indonesia, cases and deaths have skyrocketed in the past month as the highly contagious Delta variant sweeps through densely populated Java island, as well as Bali. In some regions, the coronavirus has pushed the medical system past its limits, though hospitals are taking emergency steps to expand capacity.  
  
Bekasi Regional Public Hospital, where some Covid patients have waited days for treatment, has erected large tents on its grounds, with beds for up to 150 people. Nearby in Jakarta, the capital, a long line of people waited for hours outside a small dispensary, hoping to fill their portable tanks with oxygen.  
  
Among them was Nyimas Siti Nadia, 28, who had been searching for oxygen for her aunt‚Äôs family, all sick with Covid.  
  
‚ÄúShe is a doctor and she is afraid to go to a hospital because she knows the situation,‚Äù Ms. Nyimas said. ‚ÄúThere are many instances where patients do not get beds or oxygen. If we go to the hospital, we have to bring our own oxygen.‚Äù  
  
On Thursday, Indonesian authorities reported nearly 57,000 new cases, the highest daily total yet ‚Äî seven times as many as a month earlier. On Friday, they reported a record 1,205 deaths, bringing the country‚Äôs official toll from the pandemic to more than 71,000.  
  
But some health experts say those figures vastly understate the spread in Indonesia, the world‚Äôs fourth most populous nation, because testing has been limited. Dicky Budiman, an Indonesian epidemiologist at Griffith University in Australia, estimates that the true number of cases is three to six times higher.  
  
In India, where the Delta variant was first identified, daily cases peaked at more than 414,000 in May, but have since dropped to about 40,000.  
  
Despite Indonesia‚Äôs mushrooming caseload, officials say they have the situation under control.  
  
‚ÄúIf we talk about the worst-case scenario, 60,000 or slightly more, we are pretty OK,‚Äù said Luhut Pandjaitan, a senior minister assigned by President Joko Widodo to handle the crisis. ‚ÄúWe are hoping that it will not reach 100,000, but even so, we are preparing now for if we ever get there.‚Äù  
  
Many Indonesians, however, have been facing their worst-case scenarios for weeks.  
  
Family members describe nightmare scenes of trying to get a hospital to admit their sick relatives. Some hospitals were accepting only patients who brought their own oxygen, they said. At others, patients waited wherever they could find space to lie down.  
  
In Bekasi, a city of 2.5 million that adjoins Jakarta, patients have flocked to the regional public hospital. To accommodate the surge, 10 large tents were set up on the grounds, equipped with beds for as many as 150 people.  
  
Lisa Wiliana‚Äôs husband had been in one of the tents since the previous day, waiting for space in a ward. After nine days of sickness, she said, his oxygen saturation level had dropped to 84, well below the range of 95 to 100 that is considered healthy. The hospital was giving him some oxygen, but she had to arrange to get more.  
  
‚ÄúWe are waiting for an available room because it is full,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat else can we do? The important thing is to get the oxygen, because he already had trouble breathing. It was scary.‚Äù  
  
Even being admitted does not make getting oxygen a certainty. At Dr. Sardjito General Hospital in the city of Yogyakarta, 33 patients died this month after the central oxygen supply ran out. The staff switched to tanks donated by the police, but it was too late for many patients.",,,,1626592570,{},h5ltigk,False,t3_omi5m9,False,False,t1_h5l73bm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/omi5m9/the_pandemic_has_a_new_epicenter_indonesia/h5ltigk/,1626750841,22,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That‚Äôs why I made the comparison. It‚Äôs supposed to be ridiculous. Because of course you *cant* stop unwanted pregnancy or STIs with a ‚Äúcondom mandate‚Äù, because obviously, sex (usually!) happens behind closed doors. 

I‚Äôm not disputing at all that masks work *in theory* in the obvious way: by blocking droplets and some aerosols from getting in others‚Äô faces. But most covid transmission (indeed, all respiratory viruses) also happens behind closed doors: in houses, private parties, indoor gatherings among families and friends, etc, where exactly nobody is going to wear a mask 24/7. 

Sure, there‚Äôs some cases where people might get infected while maskless in a grocery store or basketball arena, or other public but indoor place, but that‚Äôs not actually the venues where most people spend the vast majority of our time around other humans. Mask mandates don‚Äôt and can‚Äôt reach into every place we all go, in every situation imaginable.

None of the Covid-19 vaccines approved in the US (or any Western country as far as I know), use actual virus in the vaccine. Some vaccines for other diseases do use a weakened (""attenuated"") or dead form of the real virus, and in rare cases can cause disease due to faulty manufacturing. So the concept of getting infected from a vaccine isn't inherently ludicrous, just ludicrously misinformed in this case.

&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just too new,‚Äù Mrs. Billigmeier said. ‚ÄúIt is like an experiment.‚Äù

Amazing that they'd rather experiment with getting infected with a new virus than take a new vaccine. 

They seem awfully impaired at their ability to assess risk. Out of the hundreds of millions of people vaccinated against Covid-19 in the world, only a handful of people (dozens?) are known to have died from side effects of the vaccine. I'm thinking primarily of the rare blood clots from the adenovirus vector vaccines like AstraZeneca and J&amp;J. Meanwhile, several million people are known to have died from Covid-19, including over 600,000 in the US alone.

Putting aside ideological anti-vaxxers for a moment, I wonder if a significant fraction of vaccine-refusers could be genuinely cognitively impaired?

&gt; Unless they die, they won‚Äôt be changing their mind. Many are lost causes and just here to take up resources and infect others.

Agreed, except for the part about ""unless they die"".

Yes, that is how efficacy numbers work. It's a comparison between vaccinated/unvaccinated.

The REASON is because if people don't get COVID because they aren't exposed to COVID, would be incorrect to attribute that to the vaccine.

I think we'd all like to think that guidance from scientific advisors wasn't based on politics and things like that, but that's obviously not the case. Canada's NACI (equivalent to the UK's JCVI) routinely changed its advice to suit the supply at that time. When supply was thin, they recommended a 16-week interval; when we had some AZ kicking around but not much Pfizer, they wholeheartedly recommended AZ, but then when Pfizer deliveries picked up, they changed their guidance to say that mRNA was the ""preferred"" vaccine; and when Pfizer was in short supply but we had more Moderna than we knew what to do with, they recommended mixing mRNA doses. 

There isn't even anything necessarily wrong with government advisors taking that into account, but we also shouldn't pretend that their advice isn't heavily influenced by things like supply.",,,,1626626145,{},h5nbqjv,False,t3_omnaxe,False,False,t3_omnaxe,/r/Coronavirus/comments/omnaxe/british_ministers_decide_against_mass_vaccination/h5nbqjv/,1626777921,19,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

But measuring antibody levels in the blood is explicitly looking at your body's ability to fight off the virus *without any immune system response*.  We know (from how quickly antibodies ramp up after the second dose versus the first one, for instance) that the immune system responds very quickly if it's seen COVID before.  And that response includes making more antibodies, making more of the B cells that *make* antibodies, making killer T cells that eat infected cells before the virus can reproduce within them, making helper T cells to recognize where in the body the virus is and steer the other cells there, *and* a refinement of the entire system to fine tune both the antibodies and the cellular recognition for the new, always-slightly-different antigen.

Antibody measurements are a good proxy for that whole process, and they're cheap to do.  But they're not actually a big part of protective immunity: vaccinated people are at low risk *to themselves* from Delta.

PARIS ‚Äî When France and Germany launched their coronavirus vaccination programs late last year, officials in both countries assured that the shots wouldn't be mandatory in their societies, where vaccine skepticism is widespread.

But more than half a year later, the two nations are going further than most other Western countries in granting privileges to people who have been vaccinated and making daily life difficult for those who aren't.

These aren't mandates. Not formally. But in practice, some of the measures come close.

In contrast with the U.S. states that have explicitly banned vaccination mandates or passports, the European Union is using digital covid certificates, with scannable QR codes that quickly show if someone has been vaccinated, tested negative or recovered from covid-19. The certificates were designed with the primary goal of easing movement across borders, but many E.U. countries are using them internally, as well.

In Germany, vaccinated people have gained privileged access to restaurants and bars that would otherwise require a recent negative coronavirus test. Some of those restrictions have now been lifted because of low caseloads. But rules could be tightened again, as the European CDC predicts incidence rates across the bloc to triple within the next two weeks because of the delta variant.

German officials have vowed that vaccinated people would not be significantly affected by a fourth-wave lockdown.

In France, President Emmanuel Macron announced this past week that people would have to flash their certificates before entering trains, planes, restaurants, cafes and many other places starting next month.

As in Greece and Italy, vaccination would become mandatory for health workers in France by fall. Most everyone else here would still be in a position to decline vaccines. But the unvaccinated would be largely excluded from social life unless they meet the covid recovery exception or get tested every 48 hours.

In addition, coronavirus tests would no longer be free, unless prescribed by a doctor.

Under a draft law, customers and business owners would risk hefty fines or even jail if they circumvent the rules, which still need to be approved by Parliament.

The French government says the measures are essential to revive a flagging inoculation campaign ‚Äî which had stalled at around 53 percent for first shots ‚Äî and to prevent a deadly fourth wave of the virus.

‚ÄúWe must move toward the vaccination of all French people, because it is the only way to return to normal life,‚Äù Macron said.

People seemed to get the message. Within hours of Macron‚Äôs speech, vaccination booking platforms registered a surge in appointment requests. A record number of shots were administered in France on Tuesday, the day after the announcement.

But thousands of protesters rallied against the measures Saturday, demanding Macron‚Äôs resignation and urging the government to reverse its plans. Protests were held in several cities, including Paris, Marseille and Montpellier, drawing the support of politicians from across the far right and far left of the political spectrum. Nearly 114,000 protesters joined marches across France, according to the Interior Ministry.

Protesters in Paris chanted, ‚ÄúNo to the health dictatorship!‚Äù and ‚ÄúFreedom!‚Äù
Days after French President Emmanuel Macron announced new coronavirus-related restrictions, protesters in Lyon clashed with police on July 17. 

The French plans constitute ‚Äúan obligation in disguise,‚Äù said Fran√ßoise Salvadori, an immunology researcher and author. She added that the proposed changes mark a ‚Äúclear change in tone‚Äù by the president, who vowed in December that ‚Äúthe vaccine will not be compulsory.‚Äù

Pharmaceutical industry scandals and a controversial influenza vaccination campaign in 2009 had turned France from one of the most vaccine-approving nations into one of the most skeptical over the past two decades. As a result, French officials launched an extremely cautious coronavirus vaccine rollout ‚Äî a strategy that was widely criticized by scientists for sending mixed messages on the safety and benefits of vaccines.

Trust in vaccines has since been on the rise in the country, and surveys show a majority of French support the measures announced this past week.

But some research suggests that vaccine mandates can decrease trust in government or in science, and Macron‚Äôs announcement was met with angry reactions from some groups.

The far right sought to capitalize on the discontent. National Rally party leader Marine Le Pen called mandatory vaccination for health workers an ‚Äúindecent brutality.‚Äù

Former Le Pen ally Nicolas Dupont-Aignan said the expanded use of a health pass constitutes a ‚Äúdeprivation of freedoms‚Äù and a ‚Äúhealth coup d‚Äôetat.‚Äù

Macron also took criticism from the far left, with politician Jean-Luc M√©lenchon describing the plan as ‚Äúpresidential monarchy.‚Äù

Salvadori said the debate risks politicizing science ahead of presidential elections in France next year.

‚ÄúI hope that political interests won‚Äôt prevail over the discourse of scientific reason,‚Äù she said.

There is a similar risk of deepening resentment against the government in Germany, where the anti-vaccine movement has attracted a wide range of supporters, ranging from far-right conspiracy theorists to hippie moms. 

But both in Germany and France, experts said, the political risks associated with the recent changes are likely to be outweighed by the potential benefits of higher vaccination rates. Vaccines are now easily available in France, Germany and other E.U. countries, meaning the ethical debate around preferential treatment for vaccinated people has shifted in those nations, too.

‚ÄúAt the beginning, I was shocked when this question came up,‚Äù said Tobias Kurth, the director of the Institute of Public Health at the Charit√© hospital in Berlin. Allowing vaccinated people to resume their lives while their neighbors or colleagues still wait for their shots ‚Äúruns entirely against my understanding of how society should work.‚Äù

But Germany and France are quickly reaching a stage in their vaccination campaigns that resembles the United States‚Äô current dilemma, Kurth said. Whereas only a few months ago, German authorities went to great lengths to prosecute individuals who jumped the vaccine line, they are now trying to convince holdouts. Germans can get vaccines in front of supermarkets, in churches or at the airport.

Still, vaccinations have slowed down.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel excluded the possibility of mandates for certain professions this past week. But earlier this year, she voiced support for a privileged treatment of vaccinated people, saying in an interview that ‚Äî once sufficient supplies are available ‚Äî she might be in favor of an announcement that ‚Äúthose who don‚Äôt want [the vaccine] perhaps won‚Äôt be able to do certain things,‚Äù she said in February.

Unlike in France, where the president wields extensive powers, in Germany the 16 federal states are in charge of their own pandemic policies. In some states, there appears to be a growing perception that the scenario Merkel was referring to is quickly approaching.

Unvaccinated employees in the eastern state of Saxony need a negative coronavirus test to return to work after their summer holidays. Meanwhile, the leader of the southern German state of Bavaria has said that only vaccinated people may be able to party in clubs later this year, and that ‚Äî as in France ‚Äî unvaccinated people may soon need to pay for their coronavirus tests.

Public health expert Kurth cautioned that putting a price tag on tests that are required to participate in social life risks doing more harm than good.

‚ÄúThe social problems that were already exacerbated by the coronavirus will be worsened even more,‚Äù he said.

The debate about tests is not the only controversial question that needs to be resolved. It‚Äôs still unclear how vaccinated American tourists will be able to have their vaccination certified in Europe, to receive the QR codes, without first having to go to a French doctor or pharmacy.

Rules for minors remain in flux, with France saying that the planned regulations will be delayed for 12-to-17-year-olds. It is also unclear how French authorities would be able to control whether restaurants or bars are implementing the rules, leading some to wonder whether Macron‚Äôs announcement could turn out to have been an empty threat that will be watered down in the weeks to come.

Didier Seyler, who leads a preventive health-care center in southern France, said the current proposals may not be far-ranging enough.

With French people once again partying in bars, clubs and on the streets, ‚Äúit seems like the lockdown ‚Äî and everything else ‚Äî it all happened 10 years ago,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm willing to bet that in 12 months, we will have a quasi-universal vaccination obligation, given the threat the virus poses to our freedoms,‚Äù Seyler said.",,,,1626565330,{},h5kisdd,False,t3_omdxgh,False,False,t3_omdxgh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/omdxgh/how_vaccineskeptic_france_and_germany_came_to/h5kisdd/,1626725269,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Not sure where 99.8% comes from. 

Actual reported / confirmed deaths as a percentage of confirmed cases is about 2%, so 98% survival rate.   


Various places that have done population-survey testing have suggested that in well-tested populations the actual number of COVID cases (including asymptomatic) is around 3x as high as the number tested positive. This most likely would be higher in countries with less well developed medical facilities as well, which would push the survival rate closer to 99%.

But at the same time, we know that there has been a lot of excess mortality that *likely* is from covid, but wasn't confirmed (and therefore not counted as part of the stats).  


So I guess I'd argue the actual survival rate hovers around 98-99% without vaccines. And something like 99.9% - 99.95% survival rate, for fully vaccinated people (mRNA at least).",,,,1626573678,{},h5kys28,False,t3_omel96,False,True,t1_h5kwwj6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/omel96/long_covid_defies_understanding_with_some_fearing/h5kys28/,1626734506,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Perhaps they had an open marriage and it's none of my business and I do not care. As for Q, in no way do I think there's a cabal of pedophiles running the government past or present.

This is the first time that an infection has been confirmed for athletes staying in the Olympic Village.


&gt;„ÄÄAccording to the organization committee, two people the day before athletes village the same country as tournament officials one person for the first time was positive in, the competition and the good, the three people that have been quarantined. He also requested that the remaining members of the same group wait in their own room, and the members are following it. He did not say whether he could participate in the match. In addition, the country name, age, gender, etc. of positive persons are not disclosed for reasons such as ""related to privacy"".


&gt;„ÄÄAs a general rule, players can enter the village from 5 days before the start of the game, but there are exceptions such as when acceptance is refused from the pre-camp, and the competition schedule of the players who became positive this time and the prospect of participation in the game are clear. is not.


&gt;„ÄÄThose who stay in the Olympic Village follow the rules of conduct (playbook) and undergo daily saliva antigen quantification tests. The total number of saliva tests for athletes is expected to exceed 500,000 at the Olympics and Paralympics , according to people familiar with the matter. Initially, the number of tests was planned to be ""at least once every four days"", but due to the influence of mutant strains, it was decided to carry out the tests every day.


&gt;„ÄÄThe test is considered so as not to interfere with the athlete's participation in the game, and the saliva sample of the antigen test is submitted at 9 am or 6 pm, and the result is obtained in about 12 hours. If you put it out at 9 am, you can see the result at night, and if it is negative, you can participate in the next day's game.


&gt;„ÄÄThere are 21 accommodations with 14 to 18 floors in the Olympic Village, and 18,000 beds will be placed during the Olympics. Originally, it was supposed to be one of the places that symbolizes the Olympics, where athletes can interact across countries, regions, and competitions, but due to the infection control of the new corona, not only the length of stay but also exchanges are limited. It is very different from the conventional shape.


&gt;„ÄÄAdmission to the ""Village Plaza,"" an exchange facility that houses banks and Internet cafes, is restricted. In the dining room, seats are thinned out from 6 to 4 and acrylic boards are installed. We notify the congestion situation with electronic signboards and encourage people to eat alone as much as possible. In addition, although alcoholic beverages are allowed to be brought into the room, they are required to drink alone in their own room, and it is prohibited to gather and drink alcohol in a common space.


&gt;„ÄÄThe Organizing Committee also announced that eight people involved in the tournament, including one overseas athlete who has not stayed in the Olympic Village, have become positive.


&gt;„ÄÄSince the playbook went live earlier this month, the Organizing Committee has announced a total of 55 infected people. (Daisuke Maeda)

This is a myth that gets repeated over and over.  It's simply not true. The 1918 Flu got deadlier in the second wave.  Smallpox, Polio, Measles, Plague didn't mutate less deadly.  The old belief that viruses mutate more contagious and less deadly has been dropped by the virologist community long ago.  

There is only evolutionary pressure to get less deadly to enable better spread by making victims more able to move around and spread the virus.  But since Covid spreads asymptomatically and pre-symptomatically, there is no such pressure.  

Look how deadly HIV is.  There's no pressure on it to mutate less deadly because it spreads perfectly pre-symptomatically.  Covid has a similar advatage and so can become much deadlier.

China never dismissed mRNA as a promising technology, else Fosun wouldn't be an investor in BioNTech before Pfizer. China also has homegrown mRNA vaccines under development.

However, regardless of how promising/safe the trial results are, it's still the first time mRNA is being used for vaccines. Since the other countries are conducting phase 4 trials in their general public, why not just adopt a wait-and-see approach until the real-life efficacy and as many as possible side effects are identified. After all, China has inactivated vaccines, that despite comparatively lower efficacy can provide enough protection, and also have well-known safety profiles.

I am actually very puzzled that no developed countries attempted to create inactivated vaccines, at least as an option to fall back on, for those patients who are not suitable for other vaccines types.

For starters?  It's not just about people dying from COVID (which still has very, very low fatality numbers----relatively speaking), but rather the concern is Delta causing a spike in LA County's infection numbers. 

And preventing a spike will limit the chances of future mutations of the virus. 

&gt; We're still nowhere near reaching capacity in any of our hospitals.

And the goal is to ensure that the county's hospital capacity isn't tested like it was last winter.  Pre-emptive measures are just wise best-practices.

&gt; Finally:

It's unfortunate that those who ""did the right thing"" will still have to pay for stubborn non-vaxers, but here we are.  

It's ""your"" problem because it's ""everybody's"" problem, unfortunately.

Today, right now, we could be totally back to normal and have been living that normal for several months, even including these issues you've raised.

As of now, we have only delayed things. New strains are evolving and we're racing to make new vaccines while we allow the virus's breeding ground (human beings all being near each other) to continue to act as a massive petri dish.

That is sort of the point of the design of the experiment.

I also don't think the only reason the CDC said vaccinated people could go back to normal was the reported reduced transmission which based on what I can tell seems to be an inferred second-order effect, they also have population data on positivity rate vs. vaccination rate, which I would think is far more important in determining if transmission was reduced.  They have an enormous amount of data and tracking on this stuff, I highly doubt they are relying on one thing.

Testing actual transmission rate would seem to be very difficult as it would require monitoring of the vaccinated and all those that they came in contact with just in case the vaccinated at some point tested positive.

You're such a whiny baby!""**

No, I'm not one of those Q believing anti-mask conspiracy theorists. Otherwise I wouldn't be fully vaccinated!

But the thing about second mask mandates is that it's the government swindling us in a way. We were promised the ability to take off our masks as a reward for getting vaccination. But now they're changing the story, and leading to distrust in the government. I know they're saying that they're doing this because unvaccinated people are lying, *but is it fair to expect vaccinated people to be unfairly roped in for the actions of others?* To carry on the ""baby"" analogy, that's like your teacher taking away playtime from your entire daycare class because one or two kids are misbehaving.

For this reason, many experts, including *Gottlieb and Fauci,* are skeptical or critical of LA's decision. And for the record, the LA police department even said they would refuse to enforce the new mask mandate. In fact, it's not a stretch to say that *almost nothing will change in practice,* because the non-maskers will flout the rules and get away with it like before, and the maskers have already been taking extra steps even though they may be vaccinated.

Not only will the new mandate unfairly impact vaccinated people, it'll also stifle vaccination progress, because now unvaccinated people, probably more so fence-sitters than blatant anti-vaxxers, will see much less point in getting a vaccine. ""If I still have to wear my mask after the vaccine, what's the point? I'm not getting my vaccine!""

Places should rarely implement masks again, unless the situation is *really* catastrophic, and they can guarantee good enforcement. As for the few instances if they do, they must also amplify vaccine encouragement campaigns to compensate for the loss in vaccine interest caused by the new mandate.",,,,1626612109,{},h5mhvad,False,t3_omlkef,False,False,t3_omlkef,/r/Coronavirus/comments/omlkef/daily_discussion_thread_july_18_2021/h5mhvad/,1626763224,46,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

In April I was at my mom's small house where her and both of my siblings tested positive for COVID-19. I was the only person who didn't get tested, because I didn't need to prove to anyone else (like an employer) that I was positive or negative, and I just decided to wait it out. I ended up staying for three weeks and got a negative test, then went back to my own home. During my stay, I slept next to my mom every night, and one of my siblings also slept in the room. However, I didn't experience any symptoms at all. None of us were vaccinated at the time. 

My question is, is there any way to know how likely it is that I just didn't catch it? I feel like it's an extremely small possibility, basically impossible. I'd rather think I was just asymptomatic than consider that I could sleep next to my mom for the entirety of her infection, and not have caught it.

If I never got sick then I would probably take it because you can't really know how you will react to Covid, maybe like you say it will impact you heavily. But I already dealt with it twice, both times I got infected by my family/family friends.

So now I don't really see a point in taking a vaccine and risk a potential side effect or in extreme cases even death.

I already had the virus twice, I think my body developed immunity and even if not I believe the virus does not affect me as in both cases It went by mildly. Now I get that a vaccine as far as I understand is safe in most cases but as with all vaccines and medicine there are the edge case possibilities of getting sick off of it. 

Here is my reasoning that goes on in my head. When I take an airplane from point A to B I risk crashing and dying right? But I do it to achieve a goal, a goal of faster transportation. Reward out weighs the risk so I do it. Especially since airplane crashes are so rare just like the vaccine deaths, etc.

But, since I already really believe the Virus does not threaten me. I don't really see the reason to take the vaccine and risk having some adverse effects even if they are rare to begin with. Because why? I don't feel the need to do that. 

My personal lifestyle is also very sheltered, I work at home and rarely ever go outside so I am not much of an infection risk since I barely interact with anyone as I am a happy introvert and like spending time alone.

And to your first point with the Government not forcing me to do anything. Yeah let's not kid ourselves. If you can't work, travel, etc... Then you are in fact forced to take it if you want to live a normal life. You have to take it or become a second class citizen, which I thought under the law we are equal regardless of our medical history.

At least in the US, they will not issue an EUA if vaccine manufacturers cannot prove that the vaccine will make enough of a difference for that specific cohort (children) to justify administering it ahead of full approval. For adults and children over 12, EUA was relatively easy and made sense statistically given the mortality and morbidity rate for those age groups, but for the lowest risk populations, the numbers they're playing with are much, MUCH smaller. We could make a case for vaccinating young children to help protect vulnerable, high risk populations, but unfortunately, EUA is demographically specific; it's not considered ethical to vaccinate toddlers and babies to save adults.

[],,Molire,,,[],,,,text,t2_174cr0,False,True,[],"&gt;The pace of COVID-19 vaccinations is increasing in a handful of spots around the globe as the more contagious Delta variant spreads and governments expand their efforts to try to reach more people.  
        
&gt;In Israel the vaccination rate had plateaued in April as new COVID infections were on a months-long steady decline. But when the arrival of Delta brought a spike of cases in June, the government jumped in quickly with a new campaign urging teenagers to get the shot and parents to vaccinate their children aged 12 to 15.  
           
&gt;In many countries, vaccination drives slowed before reaching 70% or more of the population - a threshold some experts say could help largely curb COVID-19 transmission through so-called herd immunity, when combined with people who developed immunity following an infection.  
          
&gt;The ability of the coronavirus to mutate quickly into new variants, such as Delta, that reduce the effectiveness of vaccines has cast doubt on whether herd immunity can be achieved. However, various governments have still set national vaccination goals close to that number to encourage citizens to get inoculated. The European Union, for instance, has distributed enough vaccines for 70% of its population.  
           
&gt;Younger people have lagged older ones in seeking vaccines while shots among Black and Hispanic Americans have trailed those of Asian and white Americans, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

(First shot) üíâüí™ü©π,dark,text,t2_lvqbm1h,False,False,[],"For people with at least partial immunity, covid-19 could become more like influenza or even a cold, which are caused by viruses that are at least somewhat familiar to our immune systems. Four other coronaviruses are endemic in humans and are responsible for a significant fraction of colds.

This scenario ‚Äî call it Scenario A ‚Äî has been the general assumption or hope of many infectious-disease experts since the start of the pandemic. The dialing down of the lethality of the disease would be an example of history repeating itself: The 1918 influenza pandemic was caused by a virus that never vanished, but instead became the cause of the seasonal flu.

SARS-CoV-2 and covid-19 are often referred to as if they were interchangeable. But the trajectory of the virus increasingly is distinct from the trajectory of the disease. As time goes on, more people will have immunity from a previous natural infection or from vaccination, and SARS-CoV-2 will pose less of a threat to them than it will to people unvaccinated or never previously infected.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really teasing apart SARS-CoV-2 the virus from covid-19, the disease,‚Äù said Jennie Lavine, an Emory University researcher and lead author of a paper in Science earlier this year showing how the virus may become endemic. There won‚Äôt be a single moment when the virus becomes endemic, she said. It will happen gradually, as the virus loses its virulence. In Scenario A, the pandemic as we know it comes to an end.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not saying you won‚Äôt get infected again, it‚Äôs saying that you won‚Äôt get really sick from it,‚Äù she said.

Janis Orlowski, chief health-care officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges, offers one version of Scenario B: ‚ÄúDelta goes on to epsilon which goes on to lambda, and that becomes another ugly virus.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ. The virus mutates to a strain that we are not effectively vaccinated against ‚Äî and that leads us into another ugly year.‚Äù

(For the record: There already is an epsilon and a lambda.)

Orlowski adds, ‚ÄúI think Scenario B is less likely, but is still a concern because we are not vaccinated at the rate we should be.‚Äù

New scientific research, including two reports highlighted by Collins on his NIH blog, indicates that important elements of immunity appear to remain durable against the virus even when antibodies begin to wane. And although Pfizer-BioNTech ‚Äî the companies behind one of the three authorized vaccines in the United States ‚Äî put the idea of boosters into play with a recent news release saying people may need them six to 12 months after being fully vaccinated, many experts, including Collins, regarded the announcement as premature.

Some people who are immunocompromised ‚Äî for example, from taking powerful drugs to reduce chances of organ rejection after undergoing a transplant ‚Äî may need another vaccine dose in the near term, especially if tests show they have not mounted any immune response to the vaccines. But Collins doesn‚Äôt consider that a ‚Äúbooster‚Äù so much as another attempt to get people to the initial stage of immunity.

The bigger question for public health officials is whether they can persuade millions more people to get jabbed in the arm for the first time. Roughly one-third of adults in the United States remain unvaccinated. Vaccine uptake is lowest among younger age groups that are also at lower risk of severe illness from covid-19, but they represent a growing percentage of cases in hospitals.

Misinformation has run rampant. The vaccines are not, contrary to one rumor, ‚Äúgene therapy.‚Äù They do not implant microchips. They are not part of a plot. And although they can cause side-effects ‚Äî and on rare occasions, dangerous ones ‚Äî the vaccines have passed rigorous safety reviews.

Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy released a report Thursday decrying the epidemic of misinformation. On Friday, he called out ‚Äútechnology companies‚Äù that he said enabled misinformation ‚Äúto poison our information environment with little accountability to their users.‚Äù President Biden doubled down on that Friday as he boarded the Marine One helicopter for a trip to Camp David: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre killing people,‚Äù he said of the social media platforms that spread misinformation.

Even if, through vaccination and prudent behavior, the virus is brought under control, the rattling psychological effects of the pandemic could persist.

As Lavine points out, people have been told repeatedly for a year and a half that this virus is a potential killer. For many of those people, it will be difficult to let go of covid-19 fears. The many unknowns about covid-19 will make risk tolerance calculations difficult. This remains a new virus and a new disease, and scientists and doctors are still trying to understand what they‚Äôre looking at.

‚ÄúNobody has had covid for 10 years. So there‚Äôs an unknown factor, and that is going to make it scary for a while because people are scared of the unknown,‚Äù said David W. Dowdy, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Meanwhile, many people are not scared at all, don‚Äôt feel vulnerable, or simply are done ‚Äî done, done, done ‚Äî with the pandemic. Van Kerkhove, the WHO epidemiologist, was upset last Sunday at the sight of unmasked people across Europe crowding into bars to watch the European championship soccer match between Italy and England.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really disheartening, and it‚Äôs really devastating to see situations where we can facilitate spread,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI want to go to those football matches, too. I want to go to the bar and have a drink. I want to go out to dinner.‚Äù

Maria Van Kerkhove, a World Health Organization epidemiologist, was in her Geneva office last weekend preparing for a keynote address when a simple phrase came to mind. She had been pondering the dismaying rise in coronavirus infections globally during the previous three weeks, a reversal of promising trends in late spring. The surge came as people across much of the Northern Hemisphere were moving around again in a suddenly freewheeling summer ‚Äî as if the pandemic were over.

She wrote in her notebook: ‚ÄúThe world needs a reality check.‚Äù

Van Kerkhove‚Äôs subsequent comments on Twitter pointing out the lack of social distancing drew predictable flak from the social media trolls, something she has gotten used to in the past year and a half. But she is not an outlier. Around the world, scientists and public health officials fear that the world‚Äôs protracted battle against the coronavirus is at a delicate and dangerous moment.

Reality checks abound. Coronavirus infections are surging in places with low vaccination rates. SARS-CoV-2 is continuing to mutate. Researchers have confirmed the delta variant is far more transmissible than earlier strains. Although the vaccines remain remarkably effective, the virus has bountiful opportunities to find new ways to evade immunity. Most of the world remains unvaccinated.

And so the end of the pandemic remains somewhere over the horizon.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting further away from the end than we should be. We‚Äôre in a bad place right now globally,‚Äù Van Kerkhove said.

Similarly dismayed is Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. Last summer, he watched cases in the United States spike, particularly in the Sun Belt, after what he felt was a premature end to spring restrictions. This summer, he is not surprised by the rise in infections across a country where many people haven‚Äôt gotten their shots and have returned to pre-pandemic behavior.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like we‚Äôve been to this movie several times in the last year and a half, and it doesn‚Äôt end well. Somehow, we‚Äôre running the tape again. It‚Äôs all predictable,‚Äù Collins said.

Coronavirus infections in the United States rose nearly 70 percent in a single week, officials reported Friday, and hospitalizations and deaths rose 36 percent and 26 percent, respectively. Almost every state has experienced a rise in cases. Florida, populous and not highly vaccinated, is seeing a surge in cases. In hot spots such as Arkansas and Missouri, covid wards are opening up again in hospitals.

Los Angeles County this past week announced that it had to reinstate indoor mask requirements for everyone, regardless of vaccination status. Breakthrough infections among vaccinated people provide another reality check. Thursday night‚Äôs prime-time baseball game between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox was canceled when six Yankees players ‚Äî most of them vaccinated ‚Äî tested positive for the virus.

Many breakthrough infections will produce no symptoms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decided in May to track only breakthrough infections leading to hospitalization.

The vaccines, though marvels of basic and applied science, do not form an impenetrable shield against SARS-CoV-2. They work as advertised, meaning they usually prevent severe illness and death, but they do not deliver what is known as ‚Äústerilizing immunity.‚Äù

The CDC issued a statement Friday saying the agency has multiple programs, working with state and local partners, to track vaccine effectiveness.

‚ÄúCOVID-19 vaccines are effective and are a critical tool to help bring the pandemic under control. However, no vaccines are 100% effective at preventing illness in vaccinated people. There will be a small percentage of fully vaccinated people who still get sick, are hospitalized, or die from COVID-19. As with other vaccines, this is expected. As the number of people who are vaccinated goes up, the number of breakthrough cases is also expected to increase,‚Äù the CDC said.

The next reality check comes from the virus itself. The delta variant has mutations that significantly enhance transmissibility, and it is responsible for a majority of new infections in the United States as it outcompetes other strains. Mutations in the virus are inevitable and complicate forecasts of how the pandemic will play out. The world is in the midst of a global experiment in which a single virus is turning into a full Greek alphabet of distinct strains, each with its own suite of mutations.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre evolving. Even the delta variant, we have two sublineages we are monitoring,‚Äù Van Kerkhove said. ‚ÄúEveryone is fixated on the delta, but we should be prepared for more.‚Äù

Amid these concerns are positive signs of long-term progress against covid-19, the illness caused by the virus. That‚Äôs a reality check on the positive side of the ledger. This isn‚Äôt 2020. The increase in hospitalizations has been less dramatic than the increase in reported infections. That‚Äôs because the vaccines ‚Äî a tool the world lacked a year ago ‚Äî usually prevent severe illness.

‚ÄúThe game changer is if and when we see large numbers of vaccinated individuals returning to hospitals. But we are not seeing that,‚Äù said David Rubin, director of PolicyLab at Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia.

This hints at how the pandemic may eventually play out: The virus would become endemic. It would not be eradicated ‚Äî and would still cause occasional clusters of infection ‚Äî but it would not ignite runaway outbreaks nor be nearly as lethal as when it emerged into the human population. That drop in lethality will be driven less by changes in the virus itself than by the changed immunological landscape.",,,,1626571245,{},h5ktys6,False,t3_omf3x2,False,False,t1_h5khq9s,/r/Coronavirus/comments/omf3x2/in_this_summer_of_covid_freedom_disease_experts/h5ktys6/,1626731758,15,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Though making it mandatory is likely not as easy as taking smallpox as an example. Different type of virus, significantly more deadly, those who survived had scarring for the rest of their lives so in that regard it's incomparable.

I don't know what the solution is going to be, I think the world will probably end up handling it like climate change. Just terrible with failures across the board.

So that equates to a 90% lower probability of a vaccinated person giving someone covid vs an unvaccinated person.   


But then there's the secondary attack rate to consider - i.e. the chance that an infected person will infect someone else. For a household member according to PHE it's about 16% with Delta - yes surprisingly low.   
[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/991343/Variants\_of\_Concern\_VOC\_Technical\_Briefing\_14.pdf](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/991343/Variants_of_Concern_VOC_Technical_Briefing_14.pdf)

However, vaccines may play a part in that figure, also PHE acknowledge that this should be considered the lower bound due to data limitations. So let's just notice that it's roughly 50% higher than with Alpha.  


Separately the SAR of Alpha has been calculated to be 16.6%  
[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774102](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774102)  


So let's increase that by 50% to get the SAR for Delta = 24.9% (remember this is for household contacts).  


Finally there's the protective effect of the vaccine on the 2nd person (PE2) - reducing their risk by 80% also.  


So the overall risk of an infected vaccinated person passing it on to another vaccinated person within a household is SAR \* PE2 \* TR = 24.9% \* 0.2 \* 0.5 = 2.49% i.e. for every 200 vaccinated people who share homes with infected vaccinated people, just 5 will contract covid themselves.  


Obviously need to factor in the risk of the first person being infected - which is impossible to gauge without knowing their exposure levels, but it's 80% lower than if they weren't vaccinated :D",,,,1626558891,{},h5k6oid,False,t3_ojyx2n,False,True,t1_h588etl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ojyx2n/daily_discussion_thread_july_14_2021/h5k6oid/,1626718215,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Overweight, alcoholic, smokes, nearing 60, can't walk a mile to save their life. First few days were pretty gentle; now they're stuck in bed most of the time with one of the worst coughs, can't taste a thing and not hungry, body aches, etc.. 

*If they live*, the work issues will be severe. Prior to the vaccine, they could have two weeks off if they caught covid. But after the vaccine came out, they were offered them in the first stage because they're an essencial government worker. Welp, vaccine hoax shit and whatnot. First they thought covid was a hoax, then they said they caught it, then all the negative covid tests were wrong, then they said it was a hoax, then bullshit about the vaccine, and on and on and on. Never got the vaccine.

The work issue is: Since it was decided you didn't have to wear your mask if you got the vaccine, they didn't wear one at work. When she caught it and was forced to get a test by work, their boss questioned them. The doctor sent the results prior. No vaccine, no mask, trying to work while sick. 

They were told to leave work for 10 days straight *without pay*. And for someone who lives paycheck to paycheck in heavy debt... not a good thing. Top that off, they cried to HR saying it was just a cold, that their boss was breaking the law asking questions. HR and their boss has gone quiet. My bet: A serious write-up for this, or just simply fired for health and safety violations. Like, their boss is literally contacting the governor's office over this. 

The kicker too: When they first got sick, they were bitching to all their friends about it being as weak as a cold. Now they won't even talk to their friends by how much it hurts because of how wrong they are now. 

I live with them, got the vaccine, young and healthy and whatnot. Perfectly fine.

We should have delineated areas of low risk because the point should not have been endless rolling lockdowns, it should have been allowing people some sustainable lifestyle. We could have announced, for example, that touch transmission was non-existent.

I kept expecting this to happen, and it never fricking did. This was true worldwide. The WHO was still pushing hand washing a year later and blew off studies that showed ventilation was the #1 cause of COVID. In fact, trying to talk about this stuff brought an avalanche of negative reaction because people were programmed to reject any information that wasn't simply limited to ""masks good.""

This makes me particularly angry because I now live in Indonesia. People here know that the COVID spread is bad but they don't care anymore because they are literally at risk of starving and they'd prefer the former over the latter. On the numbers, you can't blame them. And that's not a good situation for fighting COVID, is it? If we'd channeled our energy to actual risk instead of just doubling down on broad-based measures with limited effectiveness but high visibility (e.g. hand washing, outdoor masking), and that were never sustainable over the long term - especially for people with limited financial resources - we'd be in better shape today.

They're complex inanimate proteins of a peculiar construction that some of our cells eagerly adopt and replicate until they die.

It has no innate mobility functions. It doesn't eat, drink or excrete. It can't reproduce on its own. It doesn't produce or consume any energy whatever. Once it is constructed there are no chemical reactions performed in it until it breaks down and becomes inactive, other than interaction with target cells which deconstruct it to perform the replication. It is an inanimate thing, with peculiar properties.

The failures of replication that cause viral mutation are actually processes performed in and by our cells, not theirs. They don't have any cells.

""Antibodies that an individual produces when they‚Äôve been exposed to the virus are slightly different from the antibodies that an individual produces when they‚Äôve been vaccinated. When an individual has been infected with a virus, they produce antibodies to multiple regions of a virus. At the Red Cross, we use two antibody tests to generate our results on blood, platelet and plasma donations. One test ‚Äì Ortho‚Äôs total test ‚Äì detects antibodies to the spike protein of the virus. The other detects antibodies to a different protein of the virus called the nucleocapsid protein. If a donor has had the COVID-19 vaccine, they will generate an antibody against the spike protein but not the nucleocapsid protein, which will only occur in the event of a COVID-19 infection.""

When an individual has been infected with a virus, they produce antibodies to multiple regions of a virus.

One test ‚Äì Ortho‚Äôs total test ‚Äì detects antibodies to the spike protein of the virus. The other detects antibodies to a different protein of the virus called the nucleocapsid protein. If a donor has had the COVID-19 vaccine, they will generate an antibody against the spike protein but not the nucleocapsid protein, which will only occur in the event of a COVID-19 infection.""

She knows too much 
While our world is digital the Vaccine is not a one or zero solution. 
Its a layer of protection, analog and messy at best 

All numbers given for effectiveness are relative - that confuses people on many levels. 
Everyone thinks from their pov ""it protects me"" well not really it protects the population by trying to make outbreaks to fade instead of spreading out. 

Well relative to what you might say ... 
Turns out a 60 yo vaccinated could be at the same risk as a younger unvacinated person (wsj). 
Its also relative to a low infected environment when the clinical trials were conducted. 

In delta world a house will get infected if one is infected with increased probability. So getting into a bar is the same thing vaccinated or not. 

Vaccines work in absolute terms in the world of the sir model to reduce r0 to an effective r number hopefully below 1 so that any out break will fade away. 

As r0 jumped by as much as x4 (delta) the vaccines need more people to take the jab to be effective in stopping the spread. And when people are in close proximity the odds change in favor of the virus. 

So people should keep their masks and distance till the vaccine does it job in stopping the spread 

This is going to play out many times till we get it right 
So sacrificing people morbidity and mortality is not advisable 

Think of the nuke attempt in the movie 4th of July ...

According to Hutchinson Arkansas can‚Äôt do a lottery like that due to state laws. But $20 scratch-off lottery tickets are okay. No idea how the two are different. 

Well, they could start with getting healthcare workers vaccinated. Only 40% of those in the medical field are vaccinated in Arkansas. That‚Äôs scary when you realize Delta is a wildfire, not a slow burn. 

They could go door-to-door talking to people. But residents here are (supposedly) distrustful of federal intervention. Maybe try door-to-door with locals making the pitch. 

They could get pastors from all the churches to encourage their parishioners to get vaccinated. 

Hutchinson could have doctors or nurses speaking to folks on his vaccination tour. Make the intro, step back, and let the person with the medical degree speak. He could even have former anti-vaxxers explain why they changed their mind. (I‚Äôm pretty sure Hutchinson is the one speaking.)

&gt;**Majority of Covid misinformation came from 12 people, report finds**  
&gt;  
&gt;CCDH finds ‚Äòdisinformation dozen‚Äô have combined following of 59 million people across multiple social media platforms  
&gt;  
&gt;The vast majority of Covid-19 anti-vaccine misinformation and conspiracy theories originated from just 12 people, a report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) cited by the White House this week found.  
&gt;  
&gt;CCDH, a UK/US non-profit and non-governmental organization, found in March that these 12 online personalities they dubbed the ‚Äúdisinformation dozen‚Äù have a combined following of 59 million people across multiple social media platforms, with Facebook having the largest impact. CCDH analyzed 812,000 Facebook posts and tweets and found 65% came from the disinformation dozen. Vivek Murthy, US surgeon general, and Joe Biden focused on misinformation around vaccines this week as a driving force of the virus spreading.  
&gt;  
&gt;On Facebook alone, the dozen are responsible for 73% of all anti-vaccine content, though the vaccines have been deemed safe and effective by the US government and its regulatory agencies. And 95% of the Covid misinformation reported on these platforms were not removed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Among the dozen are physicians that have embraced pseudoscience, a bodybuilder, a wellness blogger, a religious zealot, and, most notably Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nephew of John F Kennedy who has also linked vaccines to autism and 5G broadband cellular networks to the coronavirus pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kennedy was since removed from Instagram, which Facebook owns, but not from Facebook itself.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúFacebook, Google and Twitter have put policies into place to prevent the spread of vaccine misinformation; yet to date, all have failed to satisfactorily enforce those policies,‚Äù wrote CCDH‚Äôs CEO, Imran Ahmed, in the report. ‚ÄúAll have been particularly ineffective at removing harmful and dangerous misinformation about coronavirus vaccines.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Although platforms have since taken measures to remove many posts and even remove three of the 12 from one platform, the CCDH is calling on Facebook and Instagram, Twitter and YouTube to completely deplatform the disinformation dozen they believe are dangerous and instrumental in creating vaccine hesitancy at a crucial moment in the pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúUpdated policies and statements hold little value unless they are strongly and consistently enforced,‚Äù the report said. ‚ÄúWith the vast majority of harmful content being spread by a select number of accounts, removing those few most dangerous individuals and groups can significantly reduce the amount of disinformation being spread across platforms.‚Äù",,,,1626580522,{},h5lbwz1,False,t3_oma3dm,False,False,t3_oma3dm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oma3dm/majority_of_covid_misinformation_came_from_12/h5lbwz1/,1626741527,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

For this reason, many experts, including *Gottlieb and Fauci,* are skeptical or critical of LA's decision. And for the record, the LA police department even said they would refuse to enforce the new mask mandate. In fact, it's not a stretch to say that *almost nothing will change in practice,* because the non-maskers will flout the rules and get away with it like before, and the maskers have already been taking extra steps even though they may be vaccinated.

Not only will the new mandate unfairly impact vaccinated people, it'll also stifle vaccination progress, because now unvaccinated people, probably more so fence-sitters than blatant anti-vaxxers, will see much less point in getting a vaccine. ""If I still have to wear my mask after the vaccine, what's the point? I'm not getting my vaccine!""

JAKARTA, July 18 (Reuters) - Deaths of doctors from COVID-19 in Indonesia rose sharply in the first half of July, according to the profession's association, as the Delta variant of the coronavirus fuelled a surge in infections across the country.

A total of 114 doctors died during July 1-17, the highest number reported for any period of similar length and more than 20% of the 545 total doctor deaths from COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic, officials from Indonesia's doctors association (IDI) said during a virtual news conference.

Mahesa Paranadipa, a senior IDI official, said the association was concerned that the medical system may not be able to cope, according to a recording of the event.

""We are worried about the potential of a functional collapse,"" Paranadipa. ""This is the reported data, not yet data that may not have been reported to us.""

Doctors deaths have increased in Indonesia, the world's fourth most-populous nation, despite a 95% vaccination rate among health workers. This has prompted the government to use a batch of Moderna vaccines as booster shots to China's Sinovac for healthcare workers. read more

Fuelled by the spread of the more virulent Delta variant, Indonesia has reported more new coronavirus cases than any country in the world in recent days, data from the latest seven-day average from a Reuters tracker showed. It was second only to Brazil in terms of the number of deaths.

Health experts are calling the country the new epicentre of the pandemic. Indonesia reported 44,721 cases and 1,093 new deaths from the virus on Sunday.

The government imposed strict mobility curbs on July 3 to slow the spread of the virus. They are set to end on Tuesday, but may be extended. read more

Adib Khumaidi, head of the IDI's mitigation team, did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comments.

My concern is some states have a very individualistic culture and a distrust of government - it‚Äôs all about me and my rights, rather than collective responsibility to care for others. You don‚Äôt just get the vaccine for yourself, you get it so that you reduce the spread and therefore help those who are immune compromised or children not yet eligible to be vaccinated. You get it so that you don‚Äôt traumatize the health care workers (who are already exhausted) who might otherwise have to watch you die of covid. It‚Äôs this same belief system that results in underfunded education and very expensive health care.

The available vaccines do not contain the live virus and the technology/science used to create the MRNA vaccines is one that has been decades in the making.

Check out this 
[great article about how unlikely it is for ""long term"" side effects from the vaccines to show up a few months or years later.](https://www.chop.edu/news/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine)

The J&amp;J vaccine manufacturing mixup that you heard about [isn't a problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/mhhf8x/johnson_johnson_statement_on_us_covid19_vaccine/) There are no tainted or flawed doses from J&amp;J being distributed, all our doses of J&amp;J came from a different manufacturer in the Netherlands and are both safe and effective.

Vaccines given EUA are safe even if you hear about [clotting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mh39g4/blood_clots_and_the_az_vaccine_revisited/) or [growing a third arm.](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/04/get-ready-for-false-side-effects)

That the vaccine manufacturers are not liable (you can't sue them, etc.) if you die from their Covid vaccine is a [logical error], that's [true of all vaccines, and really, most medical practices/drugs/etc.]  They just have to warn you about potential risks, [which they actually do a good job of, even though those risks are miniscule.]  Note that this would also be the case (you can't sue them if it hurts you) for any future ""cures"", therapeutics, or other treatments for the disease. 

The vaccine isn't killing anyone. You heard wrong.  Great discussion [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/oc45h0/scientists_quit_journal_board_protesting_grossly/) 

Clotting is so rare from the vaccine and so common from the virus, it's basically not worth talking about.

Should we be excited about a vaccine [that's not 90%+ effective?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lv3h8e/daily_discussion_thread_march_01_2021/gpbwgkf/) Excellent question!

Especially to [Alpha/Beta.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgxpre/vaccineinduced_immunity_provides_more_robust/) Natual immunity from clearing an infection is highly protective of future infections, but you have to risk the disease in order to get it.

 This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a great reduction in ability to spread the virus. [Maybe even with just one dose!](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242) You should [get both doses though.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m2mtnv/immune_response_to_sarscov2_variants_of_concern/)

Reinfections are rare, some studies show [less than 1 in 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kyj0bx/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/) (maybe in the 1 in 10,000 range, you'll have to read the study, it's awesome).  Reinfections tend to be much milder than previous infections, even those new variants.

The problem is that you have to wait longer for the second dose, and therefore, full protection.

[Pfizer says not more than 6 weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/liakcb/covid19_vaccine_doses_shouldnt_be_more_than_six/). 

[Dose intervals might increase efficacy if extended past 3 or 4 weeks,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/mudvjd/questin_about_vaccine_intervals/gv58byt/) CDC says you have up to 42 days between doses (but that may be extended at some point).

Did you accidentally get mixed doses? [All good.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html)

They then applied an age filter to discount those deaths because vaccinations were more common in older people who die more.  

Now, here's the issue with that: They applied a filter based on the alpha variant age profile, when there's some evidence that delta hits younger people relatively harder than they were from the alpha filter. That would make the numbers off by a bit.

But yeah, it's shitty that vaccinated people have to get screwed. What you need is a policy that shifts the burden of controlling the pandemic onto the unvaccinated instead. The most straightforward way to do that would be to deny the unvaccinated access to non-essential public spaces (restaurants, movies, nightclubs etc.), while giving full access, with no mask requirement, to those who can prove that they're fully vaccinated. 

Even if some fully vaccinated people choose to wear a mask voluntarily, that hardly means vaccines are ineffective. Vaccines are effective at reducing the risk from Covid-19, but they don't reduce the risk by 100%. Some people may want to get even more risk reduction, ""defence in depth"".

Yes those who are immunocompromised should always be careful anyway. But one of the underpinnings of modern day society is we try to protect those who are vulnerable. In this case, we should be striving to reduce transmission for those where vaccines are ineffective, and that means wearing masks in the public areas while the second dose rate is still not high enough to significantly reduce transmission.

They refused to wear a mask to slow both the spread and consequent mutation of the virus. But since most of us got vaccinated, the only strains that can keep R&gt;1 and even spread are the most virulent strains that also seem to bring more severe disease. As more people get vaccinated, those who refuse will face increasingly virulent and dangerous strains due to the selection pressures provided by large proportions being vaccinated. AND!!! They will celebrate nobody wearing a mask. So now the vaccinated will be able to contract the virus, walk around asymptomatically, and pass it to those who refuse. So now these same people who won‚Äôt get vaccinated or wear a mask will expect other insurance customers (or tax payers for Medicare) to cover the tab when they end up in the ICU? And what makes them think their insurance is going to cover novel, exotic (and expensive) treatments for an easily prevented virus? 

AND IF THAT AIN‚ÄôT CRAZY ENOUGH, when the really dangerous strains keep mutating out of third word countries, I (and most sane people) will get boosters against those strains for free while the same anti-vaxxers face rising mortality rates due to ever more lethal variants. 

I have to say it never occurred to me natural selection could be this efficient.

This town is full of ""fringe"" denominations, but to answer your question, how religion plays a role, many feel that to accept science is to accept evolution. That vaccines poison their bodily ""temple"" or that God will protect from the virus. I've had these conversations with my christian friends. These conversations took place well before the pandemic too. I couldn't understand how they refused to vaccinate their kids, and ""because it makes my kids autistic"" wasn't the only reason they flat out refused to vaccinate. I'm not saying \_all\_ religious people are against vaccination, and my experiences are different from yours and of course anecdotal. This is just one of those things you have to live here to experience. If you can somehow track down the city counsel public forum for the mask mandate last year, you're in for some comic gold.

This is just straight up wrong. Pfizer, as a capitalist private enterprise, has profit as its raison-d'√™tre. Seeking profit is 100% of their purpose

&gt; You clearly have far too much good faith in our government to believe they won't cut corners to cut costs at the expense of human life. That's what this entire pandemic has been.

I don't have good faith in the government, nor do I think they will necessarily eagerly spend what is needed. That doesn't mean that I'm suddenly blind to the prime motivator of capitalists being the search for more profit.

&gt; They didn't even admit the virus was airborne until a full ass year into the pandemic because that would've implied us needing heavier restrictions and that might hurt muh economy.

&gt; The reason over half a million are dead in America and the reason we never had any national rules for covid isn't because we can't, it's because we won't due to the economic impact.

And that's different from appropriating a few billion dollars to pay for boosters. Locking down the economy hurt the government's interests in ways that simply paying for boosters doesn't.

From unvaccinated people. 

It's only a SMALL number of unvaccinated people that can't get it because of medical issues, or for whom they are not effective. Those people should continue to take additional precautions for their UNIQUE situation. This includes children if their parents find it prudent. 

For those who are vaccinated. They're protected, period. The data is clear that even if you are one of the very few that get a breakthrough infection, it's almost guaranteed to be mild or asymptomatic because vaccines work (hooray!). 

For those who choose to not get the vaccines...oh well. They deserve whatever they get. 

&gt;The longer this goes on, the more likely a strain comes that can break through the protection vaccines provide and we have to start again, virtually from scratch. 

There is zero indication that there will be a breakthrough variant to this extent. None. This idea that we would go back to square one is just straight hyperbole without any kind of objective support. 

So again, the fact that only .0005% of the vaccinated population in LA county has died, which is pretty comparable to the rates around the country, shows that vaccines are doing exactly what they are supposed to be doing.

You used terms earlier like ""cede ground"" as if everyone is at war.

I wonder if the part that we see as different is the proportion of people who disagree *in good faith* about something. I would say it's the vast majority. e.g., Different religions result in different ideas about the right thing to do? generally not intentionally done to antagonize each other. Still can result in big arguments. But that doesn't mean that a middle ground can't be found.

Sometimes someone believes something in good faith that seems so different to what you believe that it seems like it must be in bad faith. But what if, say a group of 3 of my friends thought I was a child molester, because someone told them some elaborate lie? Wouldn't it be better for me to talk with them and ask them why they think so, thereby finding out where they got their information (1 instigator) and also sharing with them my information (presenting my side of whatever the claimed situation was so that they have more information to make up their minds)? Otherwise I leave them with only 1 side of information (4 people who continue to falsely accuse me, and 3 of them think it's actually true) and I am also in the dark about why they think that, what the cause of the problem is (that instigator stays hidden, probably continues to spread their lie).

I mean, that is how our justice system solves things too, right? I could be accused of a crime, but this is neither immediately accepted or rejected. The first thing done is to collect more information from both sides. In a case of a completely false accusation, we would hope that would become plainly obvious after the information is gathered. And then starts the suit about libel against the accuser... and this may all take a while and it definitely would have been better if I was just never falsely accused, but justice is eventually done.

Yes, everyone should still be careful about spreading active virus, or harboring it inside their own bodies, but being vaccinated gives you that 95% reduced risk of spreading, even if you get infected, because the viral load will be squashed before it has a chance to shed a dangerous amount to unvaccinated people.

If I let a bunch of violent crackheads into my house because I didn't bother to lock the door, and give them plenty of time to invite all their crackhead friends, that's a much higher risk that one of them might decide to break into my neighbor's house and cause trouble.

All of the compiled knowledge about vaccination and contagious viruses support this idea, that the more your body fights a virus, the less time it has to replicate and spread.  Seems like pretty basic science to me.

I feel like people see all the numbers on deaths and hospitalizations (which are easy to track) and the lack of numbers on ""illness w/o hospitalization"" (which is more difficult to track), and then assume that covid-related illness is scarcely affected by vaccination. I completely disagree with that take.

My understanding here is that --

Being vaccinated does not prevent viral particles from being transmitted to you and starting to reproduce themselves within your body.

If someone's immune system is unprepared for covid (or immuno-suppressed, or just weak), then the virus gets a couple days of free reign to reproduce, build its numbers, and be exhaled by the human to other people. It takes a few days for the immune system to learn to recognize the virus, then build cells to manufacture its own army of antibodies and killer T cells to fight back against the virus.

Vaccination means that your immune system will bring out the big guns on the very first day, cutting off the infection at the knees before it has a chance to start running the race.

Let's look at the pool of possible outcomes from being infected by outcome.

* You might fight off the infection in the first day or two, before you even notice it and before it has any chance to spread.
* You might have a very mild case.
* You might be sick for a couple days.
* You might be severely sick for more than a week.
* You might require hospitalization.
* You might require oxygen and ICU.
* You might die.

Vaccination shifts that entire probability distribution of possible outcomes massively to the left.

I'm in central FL and have found [this site](https://covidactnow.org/us/florida-fl/county/orange_county/?s=2064985) to have reliable info on Covid in the area.
[
This site](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-hospitals-near-you.html) makes it easy to see which hospitals are getting overwhelmed by Covid.

Florida stopped publishing data daily and removed non-residents from the data, which seems super weird. For those reasons, I know look at the [CDC site](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases) to get Florida data. Hint: the numbers are *real* bad. 

I also use that chart to view death data. And the numbers are actually OK right now even 3 weeks into a spike.

I also use [this CDC site](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#new-hospital-admissions) for FL hospitalization data, which again is bad - the hospitals are getting to overflowing, they are locking down and overflow tents may soon follow.

I'd also check out /r/FloridaCoronavirus and posts like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/FloridaCoronavirus/comments/olo0m7/45449_new_resident_cases_231_new_resident_death/) by u/ishkoten.

The new variants are so potent that every infected is a superspreader event that should peak by year end.

We've seen enough for good confidence it doesn't evolve into something like airborne ebola. After deaths peak in December through May is still the long tail as the virus routes around various obstructions to access the unexposed with diminishing returns.

Assuming (hoping) that the trauma doesn't induce power struggles and regional conflicts that could turn into global war, a year from now the survivors should be dusting ourselves off and getting on with it.

Swine and bird flu were also treated as a major threat, but weren‚Äôt anymore than influenza is generally. Ebola was never spreading rampant through the US (there were 11 cases here.

To put this into perspective, about 608k people have died of COVID-19 in the US alone. There are over 4 million deaths worldwide. That‚Äôs nearly 7x the worst case swine flu death numbers. Certainly a factor here is that SARS and Ebola are dangerous enough that they can potentially kill a person before they infect others, so it‚Äôs very unlikely for them to reach true pandemic status. However, even swine flu was pretty much a normal flu in terms of impact (WHO notes an average of 250k-500k deaths per year worldwide from influenza).

Hopefully the vaccines will be approved as safe for children, and that will also help suppress transmission. 
Being fully-vaccinated is great, but being fully vaccinated in a country that also has low transmission rates of the virus would be even safer. In some sense Covid-19 is here to stay, but it could and should be at a much lower transmission rate than today.

Also consider that we're still only on first-generation Covid-19 vaccines, and significantly improved vaccines are under heavy development. We may even be able to create a Pan-Coronavirus vaccine - not only resilient in the face of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, but protective against other coronaviruses as well.

[Rational Design of a Pan-Coronavirus Vaccine Based on Conserved CTL Epitopes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7926959/).

Another opportunity to make things even safety: finally start taking seriously the reality of airborne transmission by aerosols. Transmission rates are believed to be at least 20 times lower outdoors, which lines up aerosols being the dominant mode of transmission ‚Äì exhaled aerosols are massively diluted outdoors. Improving ventilation and indoor air quality would make a huge difference, I saw one estimate of a 50% reduction in transmission rate just from relatively minor improvements. Require improvements to the ventilation of indoor spaces, including a requirement for businesses to post a report on air quality at a highly visible location. There ought to be some sort of tax credit or reimbursement program to reduce the burden on businesses of implementing this requirement. Encourage people to get an inexpensive C02 meter, so they can tell whether or not they‚Äôre in a properly-ventilated space.

**Abstract** 

The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant was first identified in the state of Maharashtra in late 2020 and has spread throughout India, displacing the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant and other pre-existing lineages. Mathematical modelling indicates that the growth advantage is most likely explained by a combination of increased transmissibility and immune evasion. Indeed in vitro, the delta variant is less sensitive to neutralising antibodies in sera from recovered individuals, with higher replication efficiency as compared to the Alpha variant. In an analysis of vaccine breakthrough in over 100 healthcare workers across three centres in India, the Delta variant not only dominates vaccine-breakthrough infections with higher respiratory viral loads compared to non-delta infections (Ct value of 16.5 versus 19), but also generates greater transmission between HCW as compared to B.1.1.7 or B.1.617.1 (mean cluster size 1.1 versus 3.3 p=0.03). In vitro, the Delta variant shows 8 fold approximately reduced sensitivity to vaccine-elicited antibodies compared to wild type Wuhan-1 bearing D614G. Serum neutralising titres against the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant were significantly lower in participants vaccinated with ChadOx-1 as compared to BNT162b2 (GMT 3372 versus 654, p&lt;0001). **These combined epidemiological and in vitro data indicate that the dominance of the Delta variant in India has been most likely driven by a combination of evasion of neutralising antibodies in previously infected individuals and increased virus infectivity.** Whilst severe disease in fully vaccinated HCW was rare, breakthrough transmission clusters in hospitals associated with the Delta variant are concerning and indicate that infection control measures need continue in the post-vaccination era.",,,,1626632638,{},h5nr2ub,False,t3_omjanv,False,True,t3_omjanv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/omjanv/covid19_delta_variant_could_be_to_blame_for/h5nr2ub/,1626786021,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

No.   It's a longer-term relative risk measure.   Exposures can't be observed (outside of laboratory challenge experiments which are generally not done on human subjects for lethal diseases for what should be obvious reasons...).

Here's how you measure effectiveness:

Inject 10,000 people with vaccine, and inject another 10,000 people with a placebo, all double-blinded so that neither patient nor the person doing the injection knows which is which. Seal the records of who got what.

Monitor all 20,000 for several months.

At the end of this period, you discover that 105 people got sick of the 20,000.

Break the seal on the records, and you discover that:

100 people in placebo group got sick

5 people in vaccine group got sick.

You conclude that the vaccine prevented 95% of potential cases in the vaccine group -&gt; it's 95% effective.

This assumes that placebo and vaccine group members faced the same risk (which is why it has to be blinded, or else vaccinated people might take additional risk and control group people might be extra careful).

Note that this does not measure absolute risk for exposure; for instance, you have no idea if the placebo group's 100 cases came from 100 exposures or 1000 exposures.",,,,1626622556,{},h5n2w94,False,t3_omlkef,False,False,t1_h5n0r6c,/r/Coronavirus/comments/omlkef/daily_discussion_thread_july_18_2021/h5n2w94/,1626773511,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

""On February 20, 1905, the Supreme Court rejected Jacobson‚Äôs arguments. Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote about the police power of states to regulate for the protection of public health: ‚ÄúThe good and welfare of the Commonwealth, of which the legislature is primarily the judge, is the basis on which the police power rests in Massachusetts,‚Äù Harlan said  ‚Äúupon the principle of self-defense, of paramount necessity, a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.‚Äù""

""When a separate question of vaccinations‚Äîstate laws requiring children to be vaccinated before attending public school‚Äîcame up in 1922 in Zucht v. King, Justice Louis Brandeis and a unanimous court held that Jacobson ‚Äúsettled that it is within the police power of a state to provide for compulsory vaccination‚Äù and the case and others ‚Äúalso settled that a state may, consistently with the federal Constitution, delegate to a municipality authority to determine under what conditions health regulations shall become operative.‚Äù More recently, in 2002, a federal district court declined to find a exemption to mandatory vaccinations laws for ‚Äúsincerely held religious beliefs‚Äù or a fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning medical procedures of their children.""",,,,1626639654,{},h5o6uhf,False,t3_omcpwz,False,False,t1_h5l5rze,/r/Coronavirus/comments/omcpwz/how_covid19_has_upended_life_in_undervaccinated/h5o6uhf/,1626794777,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
