[],,toontje18,,,,,,[],"Summer technically starts the 21st of June, so mostly yes. Probably almost all willing eligible citizens (85% of adult pop.) will be partially vaccinated by then. But more importantly, the entire elderly and at risk groups will be vaccinated for a while by then, and are probably fully vaccinated already. For example the Dutch expect to have the entire willing (85%) eligible population at least partially vaccinated by the first week of July, over two-thirds fully vaccinated and all elderly and at risk population at least partially vaccinated in the next few weeks. The only problem is the time between vaccines. For AstraZeneca it has to be 12 weeks. For Moderna they use 4 weeks and Pfizer 6 weeks, the maximum interval within the known research I think, to give everyone a first dose as quickly as possible. But after the first week of July, there will be a huge amount of supply with no demand, this means intervals can be cut to the acceptable minimum (2/3 weeks for the mRNA vaccine, Janssen 1-dose and AstraZeneca will not be used for a while anymore by then).

The question if things will be open when summer starts? 100%. If they are already crazy enough in the Netherlands to start opening things up while there are 8,000 cases per day and the ICU's are basically full (although deaths are very low due to vaccinations), nothing will stop them to just open everything up when almost everyone will be vaccinated (and thus relatively almost no deaths, which is currently already the case, and hospitalisations).

What counts for the Netherlands, probably counts for the rest of Europe in most ways. Some countries might be a bit ahead or behind in terms of vaccinations and some might be a bit more responsible/slow at opening things up.

The wording on the CDC site is very specific for a reason.  The mRNA vaccines protect against the spike protein on the virus that it uses to attach to our cells.  This keeps the rate of infected cells below the threshold of symptomatic COVID, in most cases.

The CDC has an info graphic that shows the mRNA vaccine uses your cells to make copies of the spike protein and does not contain any genetic data of the virus. 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html

This is also why you wouldn't test positive for a viral test or antibody test if you didn't have COVID before getting a vaccine. 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html

Regarding the prevention of infection, I have not found a source that shows the metric for breakthrough infections that includes asymptomatic infections. All I can find is consistent advice to keep taking precautions to reduce the spread to unvaccinated people.  See ""I'm vaccinated. What can I do now?"" at the link below.  
https://www.health.harvard.edu/coronavirus-and-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines

We are also administering fewer COVID tests.  Peak was 2.3M per day in January, and we are down to 1M per day.  We should see a decline in the number of cases and tests - most people have either had it, are vaccinated, or are low risk of a severe case. A decrease should be expected.  
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-vaccinations-increasing-happened-covid-19-testing/story

All of this infers that some vaccinated people are still capable of reproducing Coronavirus, even if their COVID-19 symptoms are nonexistent or minimal.  If they truly had a lower risk of spreading COVID, none of us would need to mask anymore (note: I'm in an area where the vaccine is available at no charge to anyone over 16 who wants it).  

Again, if you have a link with the info about post-vaccinated people regularly testing for COVID, either viral test or antibody test, I'm happy to take a look and include it in my future posts.

Well obviously no one is forcing you to get the vaccine. But I think the big issue here is that you are thinking about yourself and only yourself here. All of your objections to masks and vaccines revolve around you. YOU will probably live (unless you have a health condition you are unaware of), but it's not about YOU. It's about the millions of people that are living with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancer, respiratory disease, the elderly, immunocompromised people, etc etc. You can be healthy as a horse, get the disease and pass it to someone who is also young and healthy, who could pass it to someone who is not young or healthy and they could end up dying, or passing it on themselves. The vaccine and masks go a long way in stopping this transactional process, and you could potentially stop someone from dying just by taking a vaccine. That is how it effects you. So start thinking about the community around you. I get this pandemic sucks and many of us, myself included, have been through a year of misery, so help put a stop to it and get a gosh darn jab.

On top of that, and I know this is anecdotal, but I know someone who is young and healthy who has had months of lethargy and loss of smell from Covid, and another young person who went to the hospital and now has a massive hospital bill to pay.

[],,chilladipa,,,,,,[],"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Pankaj Solanki, a doctor and the director of a small hospital in New Delhi, rushed to an oxygen vendor earlier this week to secure enough cylinders to keep 10 COVID-19 patients on the ICU ward breathing.

His supplies would only last until Thursday night, and so he has sent a driver out to try to find more.

""It is mental agony. I can't bear it any more. What if something happens to the patients?"" he told Reuters.

The last-minute scramble for oxygen at Dharamveer Solanki Hospital is playing out across the city and the country, which is facing the world's largest surge in COVID-19 cases.

Hospitals in India's capital, renowned for some of the best medical care in the country, are unable to guarantee basic services and thousands of lives hang in the balance - a stark warning of how India's healthcare system is buckling amid the pandemic.

Big private hospital chains have not been spared.

This week in New Delhi, which has been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus, seven Max Healthcare hospitals treating more than 1,400 COVID-19 patients were down to between 2 and 18 hours of oxygen left.

Staff at a major facility of the Apollo group had a harrowing night wondering if oxygen to 200 patients would run out. A tanker arrived at around 3 a.m., just in time, a source at the hospital said.

As panic breaks out at hospitals unable to admit some people with severe COVID-19 symptoms, police are being deployed to secure oxygen. In court, judges are challenging the central government to do more to address shortages.

In a late-night court hearing on Wednesday, Delhi justices called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to ""beg, borrow, steal or import"" to meet the city's needs. Officials said they were arranging supplies, but the judges weren't convinced.

The state ""cannot say 'we can provide only this much and no more', so if people die, let them die; that cannot be an answer by a responsible sovereign state,"" said Justice Vipin Sanghi.

OXYGEN EMERGENCY

Demand for medical oxygen has soared. India recorded 314,835 new COVID-19 infections on Thursday, the highest tally anywhere during the pandemic. In Delhi alone, the daily rise is around 25,000.

Modi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal have been criticised for failing to plan for the upsurge in cases.

On April 13, when Delhi recorded 13,000 new cases, Kejriwal told a news channel there was ""no shortage of oxygen"". Five days later, he tweeted, ""OXYGEN HAS BECOME AN EMERGENCY"".

""It is poor forecasting. Maybe they are not able to understand the gravity of the situation,"" said Anant Bhan, an independent researcher of global health and bioethics.

""This is a reminder again - we should have extra reserves of oxygen. It shows poor planning.""

A senior gas industry source directly involved in supplying oxygen to Delhi hospitals said the city had moved too slowly in recent days in liaising with authorities and suppliers.

The city has few production units nearby and transportation is a challenge.

The Delhi government and federal health ministry did not respond to Reuters questions for this story.

At an INOX gas plant in the state of Uttar Pradesh, around an hour's drive from Delhi, 12 trucks from cities across northern India were waiting to load oxygen on Thursday.

Six drivers told Reuters they had faced long delays, as surging demand from hospitals in the capital and elsewhere outstripped supply.

""We have been waiting for three days,"" said Bhure Singh, one of the drivers. ""Demand has increased and there is no gas.""

The plant has been visited by government officials and police, some carrying assault rifles. An Uttar Pradesh police officer said they had been given orders to escort trucks in some instances to make sure they reached their destination.

LAWYERS' BARBS

At one Max facility in west Delhi treating 285 COVID-19 patients, oxygen supplies this week ran dry as authorities diverted their tanker to another hospital, the healthcare group wrote in a letter to Delhi's health minister.

Staff had to borrow cylinders from another facility.

The medical superintendent at the Shanti Mukund Hospital, Kulwinder Singh, told Reuters on Thursday they were asking families of 85 patients who needed high-flow oxygen to make other arrangements because they had only two hours' worth of supply.

Some hospitals in Delhi have run out of oxygen altogether, putting lives at risk, the city's deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said in a televised address. ""After some time, saving lives would be difficult,"" he warned. In the capital, the fight for oxygen has reached the High Court, where judges convened late on Wednesday night to hear a plea from Max hospitals.

For around two hours, lawyers for Delhi and the federal government traded barbs over transportation challenges and supplies. Other lawyers shared real-time updates on oxygen tanks reaching hospitals in the city, and a judge took notes on demand and supply statistics for the capital.

The Supreme Court also intervened, saying Modi's administration should draw up a plan to address shortages of oxygen and critical supplies.

""The situation is alarming,"" the court said.

What if there's a reclusive, rural person who doesn't have a car or friends who could drive them to a vaccination site? Are they responsible for their bills if they get infected? Why shouldn't the government body enforcing this policy be responsible for bringing the vaccine to them? If they can call an ambulance to go to the hospital when they get infected, can they call one now to go to a hospital and get vaccinated? If not, why is it ethical to make them pay for the former when they can't even do the latter?

What if someone isn't mentally well enough to go through the process of getting both doses? There's an incoherent homeless man who spends all day outside a Dunkin' near my house and I'm almost positive there's no one who knows him well enough to get vaccinated, much less follow up on his second dose, I'm honestly not even sure if he knows there's a vaccine. If he gets sick, do you make him pay because he ""chose"" not to get vaccinated? Hell, let's make it a little harder: What if someone is a schizophrenic individual who actually could be convinced there are microchips or DNA rewriting proteins inside the vaccine? Should they be punished for being afraid of it when they're mentally prone to that fear?

This kind of statement gets made by someone who has a nauseatingly diminished view of the world informed by their own self superior attitude. When you spend all day on Reddit or Twitter or watching the news, you think that anyone who doesn't get vaccinated must just be an idiot or someone who believes in some ridiculous conspiracy theory. But it's never that simple. You cannot base your policy and world view around the easiest ethical questions in the world because then you're responsible when the harder ones come up. I'm sure this doctor is brilliant and understands the medical world they've been researching for their entire adult life, but they clearly don't understand people and shouldn't attempt to inform policy on something they're not well versed in.",,,1619464764,{},gvyqii2,False,t3_mz545f,False,False,t3_mz545f,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mz545f/an_idea_from_a_member_of_the_medical_council/gvyqii2/,1619473659,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_c64km,False,False,,

All this other talk is hot air -- the US allowing export of some of its raw ingredients won't lead to more vaccines being produced, just where they end up being produced at (and thus whom controls them).  As you mentioned, if we had/will open up export of some raw ingredients to India, they would have just nationalized it for themselves at this point also because their outbreak is on-pace to be as bad or worse per capita than America's -- so they're doing what America did when they had the worst outbreak in the world -- pull whatever levers they can to make it better.

Shitfting precursors and supplies around is a net-zero game, unless you can point me to where a bunch is going into the trash, or capacity is being idled.  I believe that every single ounce of ingredients is getting used to be turned into vaccinations already currently.  If it isn't, then shame on those companies/nations.

The proposal to temporarily waive the WTO‚Äôs intellectual property rules was put forward by South Africa and India in October, and will be a focus at the body‚Äôs meeting early next month. Over 60 former heads of state and 100 Nobel Prize winners Wednesday signed a letter to Biden backing the effort. In February, more than 400 prominent U.S. health, faith, consumer, labor, development and other organizations wrote Biden urging him to reverse Trump‚Äôs block on the waiver. 

 

Many developing nations argue that the United States and other wealthy Western countries could rapidly boost global vaccine supplies by temporarily suspending pharmaceutical companies‚Äô intellectual property rights. That could allow poorer countries to produce their own versions of trademarked vaccines, such as Pfizer‚Äôs or Moderna‚Äôs. In March, the United States, Britain and members of the European Union blocked a World Trade Organization proposal backed by roughly 80 nations, including India and South Africa, to waive patent protections for coronavirus vaccines. The WTO plans to revisit the issue in May. A group of U.S. senators led by Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., along with former heads of state and Nobel laureates, have urged Biden to support a temporary waiver.

 India, a massive vaccine maker ‚Äì mostly producing the AstraZeneca formula ‚Äì has largely stopped exporting as its own surge worsens, dealing a major setback to the slow COVAX rollout. The global initiative had expected 71% of its initial doses to come from India‚Äôs Serum Institute, the country‚Äôs largest vaccine maker. But so far, COVAX has delivered 43 million doses of its 2 billion-dose goal this year.  Critics in India, in turn, have blamed the United States for policies that have curbed the export of vaccines ‚Äì as well as the supplies used to make them.

A number of things could make the breakthrough rates go up. One possible scenario being only like half of people get vaccinated, and society at large relaxes its mask-wearing and distancing standards from where they were the previous four months. Under those circumstances, the unvaccinated half of the population could spread so much virus that there could easily be a rise in breakthrough infections for the vaccinated.

Based on current run rate of doses administered (7-day moving average for each state) and the available supply (doses delivered minus doses administered), I calculate ""days of supply"" as a proxy for likely constraint. 

If there are more than 21 days of supply, I assume that the state is demand constrained: the state is probably not able to effectively use all of its doses. 

If there are between 14 and 21 days of supply, it is unclear whether that state is either demand constrained or supply constrained (or just has bad logistics). 

if there are less than 14 days of supply, then I assume the state is supply constrained - if they had more doses, they could probably get more shots in arms. 

On a week over week basis, one state moved from ""demand constrained"" to ""supply constrained"" (Hawaii) - indicated below with a double asterisk. Note that this is a data dump issue.. it is likely still demand constrained but one day of extra shots reported moved it up. 

8 states became demand constrained (noted with an asterisk below): Florida, Nebraska, Washington D.C., Kentucky, New Hampshire, Nevada, Michigan, Ohio. As a ""bonus"", the US as a whole has now flipped to demand constrained. 

8 states moved from ""supply constrained"" to ""unclear"": North Dakota, Rhode Island, New York, Iowa, Maryland, Vermont, Virginia, and Utah. 

No states moved from ""Unclear"" to ""Supply Constrained"". 

While there is some potential impact from unused JnJ vaccines in this data, the reality is that the underlying trend is very clear: demand is becoming a limiting factor in more and more states. Barring major changes in vaccine demand characteristics, we are likely past the peak of vaccine administration.

Paranoia - June 2020:

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2020/06/25/major-incident-u-k-thousands-crowd-beaches-amid-pandemic/3258949001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2020/06/25/major-incident-u-k-thousands-crowd-beaches-amid-pandemic/3258949001/)

&gt;Three beach towns on England's southern  coast¬†declared¬†a ""major incident"" Thursday after¬†thousands defied  coronavirus social-distancing rules and flocked to the shore¬†on what has  been¬†the hottest day of the year in the United Kingdom so far, with  temperatures in the low 90s.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúWe are absolutely  appalled at the scenes witnessed on¬†our¬†beaches, particularly at  Bournemouth¬†and Sandbanks, in the last 24-48 hours,""¬†Vikki Slade, leader  of the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council¬†said in a [statement on their website](https://www.bcpcouncil.gov.uk/News/News-Articles/Major-incident-declared-after-services-overstretched-by-thousands-flocking-to-Bournemouth-beaches.aspx).¬†""The  irresponsible behaviour and actions of so¬†many people¬†is¬†just shocking  and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt¬†trying to keep  everyone safe.""  
&gt;  
&gt; The decision¬†to declare a ""major incident,"" as Slade  said,¬†gives¬†additional powers to local authorities and emergency  services to tackle the issue. She said they are also ""deploying  additional resources to provide increased patrols in the vicinity to  help tackle any issues of anti-social behavior and other offenses being  committed.""¬† 

Reality - Feb 2021:

[https://uk.news.yahoo.com/not-single-covid-outbreak-linked-crowded-beaches-124027364.html](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/not-single-covid-outbreak-linked-crowded-beaches-124027364.html)

&gt;There has ‚Äúnever‚Äù been a COVID outbreak linked to a crowded beach, a leading government adviser has said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Professor  Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the  University of Edinburgh and an adviser to the government's Scientific  Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), told the Commons science and  technology committee that beaches are not a hotbed for [coronavirus](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/tagged/coronavirus/) transmission.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Beaches packed full of people](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/uk-beach-town-raises-alarm-151106126.html) were a common sight last summer as the UK experienced a heatwave while lockdown restrictions were still in place, [drawing international criticism](https://uk.style.yahoo.com/coronavirus-britain-pandemic-international-press-175737325.html) over an apparent lack of social distancing during the pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, Woolhouse dismissed any notion that there was an uptick in cases as a result.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúBut, for example, over the summer we were treated to all this on the  television, news, pictures of crowded beaches and there was an outcry  over this.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThere were no outbreaks linked to crowded beaches.  There has never been a COVID-19 outbreak linked to a beach ever anywhere  in the world to the best of my knowledge.‚Äù

Not a single outbreak connected to a beach anywhere in the world.  

Most of the outdoor transmission is assumed to happen outside because **some** outdoor activity took place.  

[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/outdoor-transmission-accounts-for-0-1-of-state-s-covid-19-cases-1.4529036](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/outdoor-transmission-accounts-for-0-1-of-state-s-covid-19-cases-1.4529036)

&gt;Just one confirmed case of Covid-19 in every thousand is traced to outdoor transmission, new figures reveal.  
&gt;  
&gt;Of  the 232,164 cases of Covid-19 recorded in the State up to March 24th  this year, 262 were as a result of outdoor transmission, representing  0.1 per cent of the total.  
&gt;  
&gt; The HPSC data, provided in response to a query from The Irish Times, was  based on ‚Äúlocations which are primarily associated with outdoor  activities, ie outdoor sports and construction sites, or outbreaks that  specifically mention in comments that an outdoor location or activity  was involved‚Äù. The HSPC said, however, that it ‚Äúcannot determine where  transmission occurred‚Äù.",,,1619393376,{},gvvee1k,False,t3_myge44,False,True,t1_gvuy5rf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/myge44/dr_fauci_i_think_its_pretty_common_sense_now_that/gvvee1k/,1619401796,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_6q9t4gbi,False,False,,

Your second point is not fair, though. There is simply no way the US could have used this strategy. We have a MUCH larger pop than Israel and no centralized healthcare system. We are giving out vaccines at pharmacies, grocery stores, and sports stadiums - how the heck would they be able to verify if someone already had COVID? I go to two hospitals/doctors for different things and they‚Äôre not even allowed to share my medical info with each other. It‚Äôd be a logistical nightmare. 

I‚Äôm sorry the vaccine rollout is slow in Canada but it isn‚Äôt the US‚Äôs fault. Can you imagine us telling our frontline workers and indigenous population (who have some of the highest covid death rates in the world) that those of them who already had covid can‚Äôt get a vaccine because we‚Äôre giving them to a country that never had as many get sick as they did?

[],,LeafsInSix,,,,,,[],"It's complicated here in Canada because of how public health and the federal government have (mis)handled the pandemic since January. Long post ahead, but I see lots of things to consider.

I wouldn't be surprised if there's no progress in negotiations between the EU and Canada on the matter until this fall at the earliest. Canada's achievement of herd immunity through mass vaccination will be affected by the big backlog of older and high(er)-risk people who'll need/demand their second doses this summer and that will displace the queue for vaccinating low(er)-risk young people over the same period.

A related problem is the 16-week gamble used to justify the gross prioritization of first doses now. NACI has hinted that it'll recommend shorter intervals whenever supply improves but how much will it shorten those intervals? Will it shorten them as followed by the USA and Israel (and incidentally approved by Health Canada in the first place) or will it keep going its own way and recommend something shorter than 16 weeks but still longer than what has been found effective in trials and/or ""real-world"" data? If I were to be vaccinated for the first time in early July with Pfizer or Moderna, it's a huge difference to me to get the second shot of the mRNA vaccine right before Civic Holiday (\~ 3-4 weeks later) rather than around Labour Day (\~ 8 weeks later) never mind right before Halloween (\~16 weeks later). My best chance to avoid being a hostage to continued politicking over the dosing intervals is to get a shot of Johnson &amp; Johnson this summer (fingers crossed).

Until that time, we're still stuck on 16 weeks for giving the doses of all two-shot vaccines. Would a Canadian vaccinated with both doses of Moderna, Pfizer or AZ be treated the same as a fully-vaccinated non-Canadian whose country didn't choose to be the outlier in mass vaccination? Namely, how would the EU regard Canadians who got their two doses of Moderna, Pfizer or AZ at 16 weeks apart as opposed to people who got theirs at 4, 3-6 or 4-12 weeks apart respectively? (these intervals come from the trials and/or empirical observations).

On a related note, I'd be very surprised if any country were to grant the same level of freedom to incoming visitors who are only half vaccinated. First doses are good only for reducing the chances of hospitalization and developing severe illness in the short term. Letting in half vaccinated people would undermine the rationale for allowing entrance to fully vaccinated people and add more public health risk than the EU is willing to stand even when their tourism-dependent members are screaming for business.

[Since Trudeau has already talked down vaccine passports, how would Canadians then be able to prove their vaccination status?](https://www.immigration.ca/covid-19-vaccine-passports-trudeau-says-no-airlines-say-yes) Unless foreign countries are really OK with a receipt or email that I'd get from public health, I expect to show a standardized certificate of COVID-19 vaccination with the same authority or legitimacy as my passport or multiple-entry visa in my passport.

What about preflight testing? Would fully vaccinated people be exempted from the requirement to provide a very recent negative result? Since the current set of vaccines offers *protective* instead of *sterilizing* immunity, what would happen if you were vaccinated but tested positive anyway before your outbound or homebound flight? Are you stuck in Canada and forced to forgo your flight and vacation? Are you stuck in a foreign country for 10 more days and forced to quarantine at your expense during that time?

It also remains to be seen when Trudeau will drop the hotel quarantine for incoming air passengers (at least for those who are fully/properly vaccinated). It'd be great to travel to the EU again when properly and fully vaccinated, but I wouldn't bother to go if I'd still need to quarantine at my expense in a hotel upon returning to Canada.",,,1619397788,{},gvvmel5,False,t3_myhy3a,False,True,t1_gvv1nrs,/r/Coronavirus/comments/myhy3a/eu_set_to_let_vaccinated_us_tourists_visit_this/gvvmel5/,1619406208,-2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_49mmyaur,False,False,,

Not bothering is one of many reasons people are choosing to opt out of the vaccine.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Most hesitancy polls I've seen place the people who don't want the vaccine at around 20% 

Latest poll I've seen was from NPR in late March which had about a quarter of people giving hard nos and another 5% on the fence. We'll have to see where the numbers finally fall. There's pressure on both sides forcing people to say either yes or no regardless of their feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; why would you bother going through the trouble of scheduling and driving  to get vaccinated, and to probably feel very sick for a day, when  you're still going to be told to wear a mask, keep your distance, skip  travel, and so on 

Not spreading it to others who may not be as fortunate as me. Our country is chock-full of people with co-morbidities.

Also the fewer people getting infected the fewer chances the virus has in mutating into something more deadly, transmissible, and/or able to avoid current vaccines.

&gt; The ""Better safe than sorry"" attitude has given the people the  impression that the vaccine doesn't actually solve anything. So why *should* they bother? 

This is pretty dumb reasoning considering many of the things we use aren't fool-proof. Why bother with seatbelts and airbags when they don't solve ""anything"".

They have dropped dramatically quickly after vaccination.

If this were a thing though (and I don't think we can rule it out), lower mortality wouldn't be an explanation.

The CDC informs us that vaccinated people still spread a small number of COVID cases. It says in bold ""We're still learning"" and not ""stops the virus cold"" 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html

I was surprised by one metric in my research.  College students are 10x more likely to die of COVID and 6x more likely to be hospitalized than a child in the 5-17 age group.  While this still much lower than for older groups, I see why colleges would want them to be vaccinated to be on campus. 

 I hope we can clear the Emergency Use Authorization phase soon.  Mandating an experimental vaccine is an ethical issue.  It's far less of an issue when the vaccine has the same status as traditionally required vaccines.",,,1619406580,{},gvw1v8s,False,t3_myevzu,False,True,t1_gvvaigz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/myevzu/more_than_30_colleges_wont_let_students_back/gvw1v8s/,1619414551,-7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5q0aqayx,False,False,,

You should be embarrassed at the amount of labels you just throw around. You have got to be delusional if you think that the reason for the second wave was election rallies in one remote state and the kumbh. 

Both were highly irresponsible and the ineptitude and irresponsibility shown by the government is a national shame. But to put the reasons for the covid outbreak SOLELY on these two events is equally jingoistic and frankly, embarrassing. 

You're the one putting your head in the sand. I will say it once more. The ONLY way for India to recover from Covid is to get a majority of the population vaccinated. There are way too many people to control, way too many variables and reasons for constant breakouts. Implementing a total lockdown is just not going to work in a country where hundreds of millions live hand to mouth and literally rely on their daily and weekly wages to survive and be able to afford food.

No other solution is going to work except for mass immunization. And absolutely yes, the government needs to stop the ridiculous nonsense it is doing like election rallies or allowing millions to gather for religious events. And they need to do their job in terms of providing basic healthcare support for the people. This needs to be done on a war footing.

Examples of Swedish officials saying ‚Äúcrazy stuff‚Äù about Denmark:

- Tegnells frontal attack on the danish measures in March 2020. Claiming no science supported the measures, they would therefore have no effect and they were based on political populism.  

- Tegnell in April 2020 claiming the situation in Denmark ‚Äúdoes not look promising‚Äù, despite the curves clearly having peaked around April 1st. 


- Sweden‚Äôs minister of Nordic relations accusing Denmarks border control of discriminating against Swedes despite the same rules applying to all countries. Half a year later Sweden closes the border to only Denmark and the U.K., with just a few hours warning and almost none of the exceptions Denmark has had in place for swedes. The border is kept closed for months after the reasons no longer applies. 

- The same minister vaguely threatening Denmark that they risk jeopardising the Nordic cooperation for years to come. 

- The same minister repeatedly claiming in spring and early summer 2020 there‚Äôs less new cases in the Swedish border region than in Denmark, when in reality Sk√•ne (Sweden‚Äôs least hit region) passed Copenhagen (Denmark‚Äôs hardest hit region) in late April. A false claim you still see in the Swedish debate. 

- Sweden‚Äôs minister of foreign affairs making all these same accusations as her colleague. 

- Sweden‚Äôs minister of foreign affairs lying about receiving numerous letters from worried citizens complaining about Danish tourists in southern Sweden. 

- Sweden‚Äôs minister of foreign affairs claiming, as you reiterated, that there were more B117 in Denmark in December despite Sweden simply not looking for it. As expected it turned out not to be true within 2-3 weeks. The border still stayed closed.

Some of them would be violently coughing intermittently or more often‚Äî like coughing attacks. And then many others wouldn‚Äôt cough at all. Or sometimes they would be very febrile, and then we‚Äôd have other patients for 2 weeks straight without a single fever (but they were still sick, not able to keep their oxygen levels up).

The worst cases we saw time and time again always ended the same though. Gasping for breath and no amount of oxygen was ever enough. We keep increasing it and applying more advanced oxygen delivery devices ‚Äî and they ultimately say ‚Äú*I‚Äôm not getting enough air, I don‚Äôt think the machine is working*‚Äù (and we‚Äôd be giving them 60L of high flow oxygen). Their levels would not maintain, and at that point it gets scary. We try everything not to put them on a ventilator. Ultimately, for a lot of patients, especially older ones, the doctors would have to have difficult conversations with the family :( 

One thing we found that works very well for keeping their oxygen levels up was placing the patients in prone position (lying them on their stomachs). I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre doing this in hospitals in the UK and India. It‚Äôs really incredible how much the prone position helps. The patients didn‚Äôt always like being on their stomachs but it saved a lot of people from requiring higher levels of oxygen (aka the ventilator). If the patient was unable to go prone, then laying on their side was the next best thing. 

Here‚Äôs an article about proning:

However, as the situation has developed or the past year, the general idea of lockdowns is sound and based on our modern understanding of public health.

[],,LiveLaughLoath,,,,,,[],"I mean, to be fair the EU has definitely acted as if it's only benevolence which has prevented them blocking exports, and plenty of posters here have been acting like the rest of the world should be eternally grateful for that. Imagine a possible scenario where Oxford had developed the only working vaccine and naively agreed for production to be based solely in the EU (or worse, the US). There's still massive production issues (because scaling up adreno vaccines always seems to be difficult, regardless of the company) and with the third wave in full swing and the bodies piling up, people are clamouring for an export ban. The EU/US agrees, and the UK is utterly fucked. 

Sure, it didn't work out like that in the end, but it very well could have.

They were using four main production sites, one in Belgium, one in the Netherlands and two in the UK. One site in the USA was also listed as a backup facility, but it was never supposed to be anything but a replacement for production issues in Europe. What is their production capacity? That's not well known, but solid estimates I have seen puts the Belgian plant at 8 million doses per Month, the Dutch one at 4 million and the UK ones together at 8 million. This is peak production capacity by the way, not average.

Together, they could produce 20 million doses per month. And there lies the problem. That's 120 million doses over 6 months. If it was operating for a year, that's still 160 million doses short of what it was supposed to deliver to the UK and the EU. There is thus no way they could have ever fulfilled their contract. 


Furthermore, they had a contractual obligation to inform the European Commission of production problems ASAP and the EC was contractually obliged to help them resolve it.

Let's assume you and your friends are all vaccinated with Pfizer (so a 95% protection against catching it - note that this means that if you vaccinate 100 people with it, 5 people will catch it, not that all 100 people individually only have a 5% chance of catching it). If you go to the airbnb with a vaccinated friend, the likelihood  that both of you are 'one of the 5' = 5% x 5% = 0,25%. 

So really low. It's also reasonable to assume that, since being vaccinated lowers your risk of heavy symptoms, you're less likely to be super contagious even if you do catch it (because you're not sneezing and coughing a lot). Which in turn would mean even if you do spread it to your brother, it's less likely to make him sick (it's also reasonable to assume that infection with a low viral load leads to less serious symptoms).

You could also mitigate the risk further by wearing a mask around your brother until you keep testing negative until two weeks after the trip. At this point, the risk is pretty infinitesimal. But still not 0,00%.

Given how serious you're taking this, if you trust your friends to be fully vaccinated, I'd say go ahead.

[],,scotticusphd,,,,,,[],"Risk multiplies, so it depends on how risky your other behaviors are.  Keep in mind that the vaccine efficacy numbers we're seeing are all based on a population that is, for the most part, continuing to distance and wear masks. Efficacy can and will drop in populations of people that are swapping aerosols without masks on. If you put yourself in a situation where an individual has a near 100% chance of being infected, say, putting yourself in a room with someone who is infected, without masks on, you have somewhere between a 1-in-3 at the high end (J&amp;J numbers) and 1-in-10 at the low end (Moderna real-world numbers) of being infected. Your risk goes up as you increase your exposure, because having more viral particles enter your body makes it more difficult for your immune system to keep up. 

So... if you're indoors and maskless with vaccinated folks, your risk is quite low. If you're indoors and maskless with someone who has COVID, your personal risk is significant. It's up to you whether or not you're willing to tolerate that risk, but I just want people to understand what they're signing up for because the population-level statistics on vaccine efficacy can be misleading. My personal recommendation, and the recommendation of the CDC, is to only be indoors and maskless with other vaccinated folks for right now, at least until community spread plummets, which it will soon, hopefully.

COVID has a 20-25% attack rate (learned from the Diamond Princess incident). That is your base risk of catching it indoors in close proximity without any mitigation strategies.

A more accurate statement is that based off the initial phase 3 data, there was sufficient evidence to show the benefits outweigh the risks for the EUA.  A key part of the complete phase 3 is understanding long term efficacy and safety, typically studied over 1-4 years ([https://www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-research](https://www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-research)).  Obviously the pandemic helped speed up the short term efficacy data, which helped achieve the EUA, but one thing the pandemic can't do is speed up time for long term safety and efficacy.

Additionally, as stated in the FDA fact sheet for the Pfizer (the vaccine with the most history and available data) EUA ([https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download)):

&gt; The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved or cleared product. FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that **there are no adequate, approved, available alternatives**. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that the product **may be effective** to prevent COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic and that the **known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks** of the product. All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used in the treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I think a fair question back to you is why do you think the fact that EUA was given means phase 3 was completed?  Do you not question why if EUA was as good as a full FDA approval why there hasn't been a full FDA approval given yet?  Please share any links.  As much as I've personally researched on the topic, I'm always open to being wrong or missing key information if shown the facts.

The facts (as I understand them in good faith) are that the vaccines have NOT completed phase 3 long term safety and efficacy studies simply due to the fact that not enough time has passed and FDA has reviewed the data and approved the vaccines.  Btw, I'm pro-vaccine and even got vaccinated myself too. But I think it's wrong to push vaccines with misinformation, just as much as I think it's wrong to push anti-vaxx narratives with false misinformation.  It all adds to the mistrust.  It's probably too late now, but we would've all been better off if we stuck to the facts and science and gave everyone to determine for themselves and those that they're around whether the benefits outweigh the risks in their own personal situation.",,,1619463529,{},gvynjv0,False,t3_myevzu,False,True,t1_gvx9ugc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/myevzu/more_than_30_colleges_wont_let_students_back/gvynjv0/,1619471867,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_16b1fm,False,False,,

[],,rockstorm125,,,,,,[],"I am an indian and the situation here is truly horrible, there are several reasons which mixed together to form a perfect storm.

1. The government ove rhere still does not want to go through with a complete lockdown which was suggested several weeks ago when the number of cases started to increase once again. Only because they are scared mor abput the economy than the people who are dying (atleast in my state).

2.general lack of people following protocol, there are many people who do not really care or understand how bad the situation is, people form packs outside wine shops and drink to there hearts content with everyone present their, and of course to drink they remove their mask, once drunk the minimum amount of distance that they might've maintained is no longer present. 
Due to lack of knowledge some people just dont know why they have to follow what they are doing, things like wearing masks incorrectly or not bothering with it, i have personally seen a guy on a crossroad sneeze inside his mask after which he precedeed to flip his mask inside out and wear it again.

3. Panic buys have once again started because its obvious that there will be a lockdown (by common sense, we do not know if there will even be one), this has lead to many people just rushing and buying stuff in bulk to prepare themselves. My family has only gone out a handful of times and we always get groceries online which is delivered to our house and then we sanitize them, but due to the shortage of groceries we cannot get them, I cannot go out and get groceries because of how much the spread has increased, I live in a relatively small apartment complex which already has around 10 families which have contracted covid, i cannot take the risk of going out to even get groceries in fear of the elders who live with me might get covid. The only saving grace for me is that we have rice which we buy 5kg's at a time which can last us another weak, heres to hoping I amm able to order groceries before that period.

So yeah we need as much help as possible thank you UK!.

basically, from my perspective, a middle class income in India is a poor persons income from my country. homeless people literally often make more money than Indian middle class. so that number being high really doesn't mean anything to other countries because from our perspective its artificially high.",,,1619396413,{},gvvjw8n,False,t3_my9xw6,False,True,t1_gvveerg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/my9xw6/uk_to_send_ventilators_to_india_as_country_faces/gvvjw8n/,1619404850,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_e2raf,False,False,,

As for religious exemptions, it reminds me that at least 172 children died from easily curable diseases between 1975 and 1995 due to Christian Science and other faith healing organizations. Forgive me if I don't have a ton of respect for these cults. And I have equally little respect for the people who cry ""religious exemption"" because they read some anti-vax nonsense at Google University and think they've found a way to get out of it by lying about their religion.  

There is court precedent in the U.S. for public health overriding private religious conviction when it comes to vaccines, but I doubt most institutions -- even private ones -- want to pick a big fight about it and would rather just cater to the tiny number of people who insist God has exempted them from reality.

But the EUA isn't nuance enough with the breakdown by demographic.

One thing I do wonder though is that I see that Michigan is considered to be Demand constrained. I don't necessarily doubt your conclusion, but I'm just wondering why it is then that Governor Whitmer asked the federal government to allocate more vaccines to them. Presumably that would only work if Michigan was having a lack of supply.

Perhaps the answer is that the Governor really wants to avoid the unpopular lockdowns (so unpopular that they caused people to plot to kidnap her and put her on ""trial"") and so made a grand gesture asking the federal government for more vaccines to make it look like she was searching for a solution, even if that solution wouldn't have been very effective.

In any case, its very telling and quite disturbing even that so many states are constrained by demand rather than supply, given that it has been only a week in my State where it has been open to all adults.

The guy whose messaging on mask wearing has an extremely sketchy history that includes lying to the public early on to make sure masks were available to health workers is now telling us again that masks aren't necessary when a potentially deadlier third wave could be coming from India.

We have less than 1/3 of the US vaccinated. As the article states, demand for the vaccine has dropped here. Too many people have relaxed and think that the threat is over. We have set the stage to have the third wave decimate us just like it has done to the population of India. Also note that the variants that have popped up there have even caused vaccinated people to go to the hospital.

[],,Viewfromthe31stfloor,,,,,,[],"&gt;A global coronavirus surge that is driven by the devastation in India continues to break daily records and run rampant in much of the world, even as vaccinations steadily ramp up in wealthy countries and more than one billion shots have now been given globally.

&gt;On Sunday, the world‚Äôs seven-day average of new cases hit 774,404, according to a New York Times database. That is a jump of 15 percent from two weeks earlier, and higher than the peak average of 740,390 during the last global surge in January.

&gt;Despite the number of shots given around the world ‚Äî more than one billion, according to a New York Times tracker ‚Äî far from enough of the world‚Äôs estimated population of nearly eight billion have been vaccinated to slow the virus‚Äôs steady spread.

&gt;And vaccinations have been highly concentrated in wealthy nations: 82 percent of shots worldwide have been given in high- and upper-middle-income countries, according to data compiled by the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford. Only 0.2 percent of doses have been administered in low-income countries.

&gt;Israel is far ahead of much of the world in vaccinations: More than half of the population is now fully vaccinated. In Britain, where a highly contagious and deadly variant was discovered, nearly two thirds of the population is at least partly vaccinated and the rate of new cases is now among the lowest in Europe.

&gt;The United States has also partly vaccinated about 41 percent of its population and has loosened a ban on the export of raw materials for vaccines to help India control the world‚Äôs worst outbreak.

&gt;India is recording more than a third of all new global cases each day, averaging more than 260,000 new daily cases over the past week. The country‚Äôs sudden surge, driven by the spread of a newer variant, is casting increasing doubt on the official death toll of nearly 200,000, with more than 2,000 people dying every day.

&gt;Experts say the official numbers, however staggering, represent just a part of the virus‚Äôs spread, with hospitals overwhelmed and lacking critical supplies like oxygen.

&gt;India is home to the Serum Institute of India, the world‚Äôs largest vaccine maker. But only about 8.6 percent of India‚Äôs population has received at least one shot of a vaccine. Its surge led to the Indian government‚Äôs decision to withhold exports of doses that many low- and middle-income countries were relying on. The vaccine rollout in Africa, which was already slower than it is in any other continent, could soon come to a near halt because of the suspension.

&gt;Public health experts say the number of global cases is most likely surging because more contagious virus variants are spreading just as people are starting to let their guards down.

&gt;In Thailand, where cases were kept at bay for months with strict quarantines and lockdowns, the virus has spread rapidly, in part by unmasked people partying. Daily cases, still low by global standards, have increased from 26 on April 1 to more than 2,000 three weeks later. And in India, many people stopped taking precautions after officials eased a lockdown that was imposed early last year.

&gt;‚ÄùIndia let their guard down when the numbers fell and they thought they were over their last peak,‚Äù said Barry Bloom, a research professor and former dean of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He added that the United States should ‚Äútake a lesson from other countries before we become complacent and decide everything‚Äôs OK.‚Äù

&gt;As bad as India‚Äôs situation is, the numbers have room to grow worse: Its daily caseloads, adjusted for its huge population, rank well below other countries‚Äô.

&gt;The rate of new cases in the United States is falling but remains alarmingly high ‚Äî similar to last summer‚Äôs surge.

&gt;The rates of new coronavirus cases also remain high across much of South America. In Brazil, reported cases are starting to drop but remain high after a more contagious variant tore through the country and overwhelmed hospitals.

&gt;In Europe, the pace of vaccinations lags that in the United States and Canada, and the number of new coronavirus cases remains particularly high in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. Turkey, at the crossroads between Europe, the Middle East and Asia, is another hot spot.

&gt;Dr. Robert Murphy, the executive director of the Institute for Global Health at Northwestern University, said the United States had a responsibility to send unused vaccine doses to other countries as supplies increase.

&gt;‚ÄùWe have to start thinking on a global scale and do what we can to help these other countries,‚Äù Dr. Murphy said. ‚ÄúOtherwise we‚Äôre never going to put out the whole fire.‚Äù

&gt;People who don‚Äôt have paid sick leave, for instance, may worry about getting a vaccine with side effects that could cause them to miss work. People who don‚Äôt have a regular medical provider may be uncertain where they can go to get good information. People who have been discriminated against in the medical system may not trust that health professionals have their best interests at heart.

I think this is something we need to recognize more. Anti-vaxxers are not the main issue here, outreach to marginalized and low income groups will be super important. 

For example, something like 1/6 adult Americans are functionally illiterate in their daily lives. And somewhere around 2/5 have literacy issues. Could you imagine how difficult it would be to navigate vaccine booking systems, learn about vaccines and feel comfortable getting one ? 

There's an overwhelming urge on Reddit to blame, shame, criticize and make fun of people who are nervous or uncomfortable with vaccination. I think this is counterproductive, and often very mean-spirited and unhelpful. Blame and shame is only going to make people dig in their heels.

How have they? Explain how they attempted to increase production for the EU by not expanding production to have more than 2 EU based plants?

&gt;Source? There's been a shortfall. But if there hadn't been, there would be no issue.

[Halix said it started producing vaccines for the EU in December and has a capacity to produce about 5 million doses per month.](https://www.reuters.com/world/astrazeneca-vaccine-doses-found-italy-export-ban-table-french-official-2021-03-24/)
The Belgian plant I believe is 8m a month however let's double both to assume ""shortfalls"" despite those numbers are the published maximum yields. That's a total of 26m a month. They promised by Q2 270m doses to the EU. So running at double the max production, constantly 24/7 in order to have successfully reached this target they would have had to have been producing since September 2020.

AZ have not reached out to other places to produce, they did not alert the EU (Who is contracted to aid in this process if AZ fails, yet they did not reach out for this help)

What sort of shortfall accounts for this miscalculation?

&gt;The one that the UK funded? Maybe if the EU hadn't spent months trying to beat them down on price and instead invested, they could have spent a few extra months increasing capacity.

[Two officials said the EU‚Äôs contract committed it to paying 336 million euros \($406 million\) to AstraZeneca, mostly to finance production of vaccines at four named factories. Two of these, run by Oxford Biomedica and Cobra Biologics, are in Britain, while the others are in Germany and Belgium. ‚ÄúPart of the money went to the UK,‚Äù one of the officials said.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-astrazeneca-idUSKBN29Y0UL)
The EU did invest large swaths of money and promised to help with production. They helped fund the UK plants which ended up not even allowed to produce for them. The EU did everything it could and AZ still bungled it.

Daniel Kahneman, the 2002 Nobel laureate in economics, has observed, we are often quite poor at assessing risk. We often make fast intuitive decisions, when sober reflection would lead to far better outcomes.

Part of the problem is that humans evolved from a time when quick reactions to imminent threats meant survival, and delay meant death. Now, in a complex social and technological environment, the perception and measurement of risk is more complex, requiring deeper analytical skills. First instincts are usually wrong.
... 

One researcher has observed that taking an aspirin poses more risk than receiving the vaccine. However, when the media attend each instance of adverse reaction as breaking news, it‚Äôs little wonder that vaccine hesitancy grows.

Getting shots in arms must be the priority. The record of governments in Canada and Europe will taint the current leaders, but more important is the delay in vaccinating the world. Every unvaccinated person is a petri dish for new variants that are more efficient at survival and therefore likely more contagious and perhaps more deadly.

""VAERS received 113 reports of death after COVID-19 vaccinations; two thirds of these deaths occurred among LTCF residents. All-cause mortality is high in LTCF populations because underlying medical conditions are common. Based on expected rates of background mortality, among the approximately 1 million LTCF residents vaccinated in the first month of the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program, approximately 7,000 coincidental, temporally associated deaths from all causes would be expected during the analytic period (7). In contrast, VAERS received 78 reports of death after COVID-19 vaccination in LTCF (long term care facility) residents, and approximately one half were in residents who were in hospice or who had a do-not-resuscitate status. Reported causes of death in LTCF residents after COVID-19 vaccination are consistent with expected all-cause mortality in this population. Among deaths in persons with available death certificate and autopsy information who were not LTCF residents, causes of death were consistent with background all-cause mortality and did not indicate any unexpected pattern that might suggest a causal relationship with vaccination (8).""",,,1619446258,{},gvxj6p7,False,t3_myuich,False,True,t1_gvxhlqe,/r/Coronavirus/comments/myuich/pissed_off_dr_fauci_cites_567000_dead_americans/gvxj6p7/,1619446952,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_32xslg8l,False,False,,

*pp are* [*percentage points*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point)*, the arithmetic difference between today's percentage and a prior date.  For example, if a group was 55.0% today and 50.0% before, this is a 5.0 pp difference.*

* The raw data can be downloaded exact totals for every age group can be downloaded from the [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) as a CSV.  The CDC indicates the data is by ""Date Administered"", but it actually appears to be by ""Date Reported"".
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC demographic data, so the tables do not match national totals.

Fortunately the immune system fights on and hopefully  wins in the end, but sometimes not.

But they also found frustratingly few papers that detailed the settings or clearly compared indoor and outdoor situations.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúOur takeaway from this is that it‚Äôs not impossible to get an infection outdoors, even though from what is published, clearly the proportion of when that happens is much lower,‚Äù Razani said.

&gt;Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto, said he supports the anticipated guidance from the CDC. He added that more research is showing that very few Covid-19 infections happen in outdoor settings.

&gt;But masks should still be mandated in indoor settings, he said, **until most of the U.S. population is vaccinated** and it is difficult for the virus to spread from one person to the next.

We're a couple weeks away from most of the country being vaccinated. I'm wondering if we'll be seeing these experts advocate for an end to the mask mandate when that occurs. Considering how strongly the CDC has been suggesting that vaccinated people aren't transmitting the virus, we'll be at a point where there are more Americans who *don't* need to wear a mask than Americans who should be wearing one.

     [The following denominations do have a theological objection to vaccination:

        Dutch Reformed Congregations - This denomination has a tradition of declining immunizations. Some members decline vaccination on the basis that it interferes with divine providence. However, others within the faith accept immunization as a gift from God to be used with gratitude.
        Faith healing denominations including:
        Faith Tabernacle
        Church of the First Born
        Faith Assembly
        End Time Ministrie
        Church of Christ, Scientist -  One of the basic teachings of this denomination is that disease can be cured or prevented by focused prayer and members will often request exemptions when available. However, there are not strict rules against vaccination and members can receive required vaccinations.]

&gt;  
&gt;Data released by the NCDC says more than 400 cases of the UK strain and 76 of the Indian double mutant were found in Delhi.

I'd be very surprised if the EU or any country would make that kind of exception. It'd send a bad message about getting immunized as directed. By the same logic, CBSA would grant half-vaccinated visitors as much freedom as they would to fully-vaccinated visitors. I don't think that it would go down well here. A lot of people were/are freaking out about flights from India to the point Trudeau that quickly and practically reversed himself [from saying earlier this week that travel restrictions are/were effective](https://www.kelownanow.com/news/news/National_News/Trudeau_defends_Canada_s_travel_restrictions_as_effective_could_suspend_flights_from_India/).

By the way, [the reality that not all vaccines are equal is a simmering problem in Ireland](https://www.independent.ie/world-news/coronavirus/60s-age-group-may-facemore-restricted-summer-due-to-three-month-astrazeneca-vaccine-interval-40345829.html). People who are getting vaccinated with AZ this spring are cluing in that they won't be in the clear for this summer as soon as others getting Pfizer or Moderna at the same time because of the 12-week spread for giving AZ's doses versus the 3 to 6 week spread used for the mRNA vaccines. Being half vaccinated doesn't ultimately count for much beyond reducing the rate of hospitalization and severe illness for the short run.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Not many people in Canada will have the double vaccination by then.

This is all an unfortunate and emerging downside of the gross prioritization up to now in giving out first doses. It sounds good that someone may get the first shot earlier than expected (by late June?) but we're building a huge backlog of people who will need/demand their second shots this summer. Given constraints of time, labour and capital, this backlog would naturally decrease the rate at which young(er), low(er) risk people as a whole get their first shots. Nowadays, over 90% of the appointments at a clinic are for the first shot but by the summer, the mix of people lining up for their shot will be a more balanced mix of old(er), high(er)-risk people getting their second shot and young(er), low(er) risk people getting their first shot.

[],,thaeli,,,,,,[],"I'll answer this. I'm not as extreme as the poster you're replying to; the end of mask _mandates_ won't drive me out of all stores. However, I'm also not in this sub's meta of ""yep I'm fully vaxxed so the moment mandates end the mask goes in the trash"". There are several reasons. 

One is that it makes other people around me more comfortable (I live in a very ""pro mask"" area) and frankly, putting a piece of cloth over my mouth isn't a big deal for me. If it was I might feel differently, but.. it really doesn't bother me? It's already been nice to be able to step down to an earloop mask instead of double-masking an N95, I really don't mind continuing to mask up for the comfort of others. 

Another factor is that I have other non-COVID reasons for wanting to wear a mask sometimes, and I want to help promote masking as a normal thing to do. No, I'm not saying ""promote making every American wear a mask all the time forever"", I'm saying ""make it not weird when someone wears a mask because they WANT to"" - because I want to wear a mask when it's pollen season. And I want it to be normalized during flu season, because I have seasonal allergies, and I often don't know that cold symptoms are cold symptoms and not just more allergies until moderately into it. So why not wear a mask anytime I feel a little off and maybe spare someone a cold?

And frankly, I'll probably take my N95 with me anytime I'm on public transit from now on, because the subway is a disgusting pit and I don't want whatever minor cold someone next to me has. Again, not COVID, but a greater awareness of how many respiratory illnesses can be better protected against. Plus I really don't want to breathe in diesel fumes on the bus.

So a lot of it is having gotten used to wearing unobtrusive masks, and others having gotten used to _me_ wearing them. And I expect some of the places I most want to go, and some of the friends I want to hang out with, to have stricter requirements than the relevant government requirements, so there's that as well.

The final bit, and this is ""controversial"" here, is that vaccine efficacy is very high but not 100%, and might be somewhat lower against some variants. Yeah, I'm pretty much 100% protected against _dying_ from COVID now, but some variants look like the efficacy may be more like 75% for infection, and even if my viral load is low I still have contact with immunocompromised people, so I'd rather be extra careful. If cases surge to very high levels again - say in an area that has low vaccine uptake - I'll be masking back up because I don't see any reason to roll the dice any more than I have to. Ditto for the peak of flu season in a bad year, even though I get my flu shot every year - more relevant for flu, really, since the flu vaccine has that whole thing with strain prediction and sometimes they don't guess right.",,,1619469384,{},gvz13d5,False,t3_myh4yr,False,True,t1_gvwj4hd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/myh4yr/even_after_being_fully_vaccinated_many_still/gvz13d5/,1619479901,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_bkph4,False,False,,

I'd rather have 60% at 90% and 10% at 70%!). 

In addition, protection from hospitalization will likely track headline efficacy - higher headline efficacy means better protection from severe COVID and hospitalization. [This is a good collection of studies](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/covid-wwksf/2021/04/wwksf-vaccine-effectiveness.pdf?la=en). Basically, the tl;dr is that Pfizer is likely about 85-95% effective from hospitalization / severe COVID after the second dose and about 60-80% effective against hospitalization/severe COVID 14+ days after the first dose. There is very limited real world JnJ data, but it is likely JnJ will closely track 1-dose of AZ or Pfizer which would give it around 70-80% effectiveness against hospitalization. 

The clinical studies themselves are unfortunately limited - most studies get the headline of ""100% efficacy against severe COVID"", but that is with very low statistical power - and with a biased population (most clinical studies looked at relatively healthy &lt;65 year olds). The vaccines are tragically *least* effective in the elderly because of weaker immune systems (or even worse, the immunocompromised - it is safe to take it for them, but less than half of immunocompromised individuals get a high antibody response).

Most of the bottlenecks are in bottles and needles (don't need to release patents to get those facilities up and running) and on raw ingredients themselves (again, don't need patents released there; just raw ingredients).  That, and finishing/filling locations.  Moderna just today announced a deal with Sanofi to have them finish/bottle since that's the easiest step to not mess up and require dumping double digit millions of doses down the drain.

So, where are all the new bottle and needle manufacturing plants going up at?  Are finishing and bottling plants showing up in these countries?  No, because the raw material to make the glass is the shortage, and opening a new mine and getting it up and running takes years.

The numbers will always be skewed, this doesn‚Äôt discount the people who lost their lives or the fact the worldwide death toll is under 3% of those known to be infected.

Do I think the preventative measures we have taken during COVID helped reduce that number? Absolutely. 

I also think we did more harm to our populations then good in the economical sections with stay at home orders, closures and mask mandates. I feel them to be to strict and heavy handed. 

I do wonder if those preventive measures are ‚ÄúHindsight is 20/20 (haha a pun)‚Äù or if it truly was good ‚ÄúForesight‚Äù in those measures and that is why the fatality rate is under 3%. 

I wonder this when [out of 5million severe cases of influenza the casualty rate is 10% worldwide. ](https://www.medscape.com/answers/219557-3459/what-is-the-global-incidence-of-influenza) I find it hard to support those stricter methods, since we haven‚Äôt made ‚Äúflu season‚Äù mask mandated or flu shots mandatory prior to COVID with a significantly higher fatality rate. Even this article suggests those numbers are skewed, since it states the US doesn‚Äôt report or count deaths from influenza. 

COVID is of course a different beast, and I do believe we should adopt wearing a mask if you are sick or not feeling well like other countries outside of the US have been doing for years. I also support better time off and sick time practices for business, both for employe and employers that would help reduce the number of many viruses and there cause and effects. 

I do not support mask mandates, or mandatory vaccinations, even if I support vaccines but again that is a separate beast I won‚Äôt get into. My stance is hard enough for me to define to myself, let alone openly discuss at this moment. 

It isn‚Äôt fun to put numbers and percentages to human lives but from a neutral view with logic and reason it can be done, the problem is people viewing such numbers and percentages can‚Äôt always take away their emotions behind it and thus have irrational and damaging reactions to these kind of conversations and thought sharing. 

There are far to many negative emotional reactions nowadays then attempts at solutions, discussion or information sharing. 

The common theme is to verbally attack another human, berate and belittle, be derisive and even make it common place to suggest physical punishment for not thinking the same and conforming. Those are Dark Age ideals. 

It shouldn‚Äôt be common to do those things to strangers, neighbors and our families. Asking someone why they think that, what is their experiences and or their reasoning behind their opinion and moral compass is what should be asked.

If you get into a car accident and lose a leg, is that still not a big deal because at least you lived? 

We still don't know enough about the long term effects of even asymptomatic cases. Throwing this stat at someone concerned about the health of their kid feels pretty condescending; like you're assuming they haven't already familiarized themselves with it. You have no idea what that kid's asthma was like. Just like you have no idea the impact covid could have on a high risk kid. 

Listening to your kid cough all night, every night, for long periods of time is heart wrenching. Trying everything their doctor recommends and more just to have it not make a difference is disheartening.

&gt;All adults can now be vaccinated in the canton of Vaud. The canton is opening the appointment for vaccination to the entire population aged 18 and over, it said in a statement on Monday. ""As of Monday, April 26 at 12:30 p.m., all persons born before 2003 and living in the canton of Vaud can make an appointment, preferably via the website [www.coronavax.ch](https://www.coronavax.ch), or by calling 058 715 11 00 if registration via the Internet is not possible,"" the text states.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""With the increased deliveries of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, the reinforcement of the cantonal system and the progress of vaccination in the previous groups, the conditions are in place to offer the possibility of being vaccinated to the entire population over 18 years of age who wish to be vaccinated,"" it explains. To date, more than 83% of the chronically ill are vaccinated, two-thirds of those over 75 and more than half of those aged 65-74, the canton said. When the program was first opened to 50-64 year olds, the response was enthusiastic and about half of this category has already made an appointment, he says.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The over-18s can therefore be vaccinated in turn, in order to offer prospects, the statement said. The Federal Council's three-phase plan currently under consultation mentions vaccination coverage as one of the criteria for relaxing measures so that social, cultural and sporting life can gradually resume, it recalls.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Montreux not included this Monday  
&gt;  
&gt;If the appointment process could be extended, it is also thanks to the inauguration this Monday of the new mass vaccination center in Montreux. Open from Monday to Saturday, from 8am to 10pm, and on Sunday from 9am to 4pm, it operates with a capacity of 4000 injections per week for the first 4 weeks, then about 8000. It should also be noted that it is now possible to be vaccinated since Monday at the Unisant√© center in Lausanne, as well as in the Bois-Cerf and Genolier private clinics.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The Vaud system now includes 14 vaccination centers and sites throughout the canton, namely the HIB in Payerne, the EHNV in Yverdon, the HRC in Rennaz, La Ligni√®re in Gland, the EHC in Morges, the GHOL in Nyon, the Genolier clinic, the CHUV in Lausanne, Beaulieu, Unisant√© and the Bois-Cerf clinic in Lausanne, the 2M2C center in Montreux, as well as the P√¥le Sant√© du Balcon du Jura and the Vall√©e de Joux. Not to mention a vast network of doctors and pharmacies throughout the canton.

The article says that that rate of 1 in 20,000 applies to the population aged 16-30.  Presumably that's close to 1 in 10,000 for men aged 16-30, since most of the cases have been in men.

By comparison, the background rate of viral myocarditis is [usually estimated at](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459259/#_article-25470_s4_:~:text=Incidence%20is%20usually%20estimated%20between%2010%20to%2020%20cases%20per%20100%2C000%20persons) 10 to 20 cases per 100,000 people per year.  That's 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 10,000.  However, Israelis haven't been vaccinated for a whole year; on average they were vaccinated about 3 months ago. So in that period of 3 months we'd expect to see maybe 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 40,000 cases of myocarditis.

On these (admittedly crude) numbers it looks like there's nothing to panic about yet, but it's worth investigating. The incidence of myocarditis isn't necessarily higher than you'd expect. But as we've seen with the AZ clotting issue, once researchers suspect a specific vaccine complication and start re-examining the records, they may find other cases which were missed at first. (That's perfectly natural, because finding patterns in big datasets is hard, but it's even harder when you don't even know if there's a pattern in there.)

These guidelines are ever changing and signaling a return to normalcy.

Pseudoscientists here claiming there was no spread outdoors are misleading you. All outdoor areas are not the same and a yr back, your risk in crowded areas outdoors would have been much worse.

[],,annoyedatlantan,,,,,,[],"The numbers are pretty comparable. The study approaches were broadly similar in approach and structure and even broadly timing (e.g. the headline efficacy numbers both represent PCR-confirmed symptomatic cases and not asymptomatic testing). There are two things to compensate for: 

1) J&amp;J's overall numbers got hit by the SA variant that does have some muting effect on efficacy but even excluding SA entirely the efficacy is still far below the mRNA vaccines. 

2) The J&amp;J vaccines do continue to increase antibody response up until about 6-8 weeks post vaccination, whereas the study efficacy window began sooner than this. However, the difference is not *that* significant and unlikely to dramatically impact efficacy. The mRNA vaccines had a longer ""window"" because they started 5 weeks (Pfizer) to 7 weeks (Moderna) after the first dose.  

There's really no reason to believe why JnJ - as a single shot vaccine - would be superior to a two shot mRNA vaccine. Both vaccines work in a similar fashion (trick your cell into producing a spike protein) - the only difference is that the viral vector approach is a bit more complicated because it relies on a virus to deliver the payload and transcription into mRNA rather than just dropping the mRNA directly into the cell. 

It seems like one shot of mRNA vaccine is roughly equal to one shot of the JnJ vaccine (plus or minus a bit). The second dose of the mRNA vaccine helps increase efficacy significantly above the first dose. 

The two shot AZ is very similar to JnJ in terms of how it works and has closer efficacy to the mRNA vaccines, although it is inhibited a bit against some variants because it does not use a stabilized spike protein (whereas JnJ, Pfizer, and Moderna do) that seems to impact response to some variants. 

That said, it is good to have a single shot option for the reasons stated above around access and convenience. So this doesn't mean that JnJ doesn't play a key role in the US's vaccination strategy. But I don't know why people are so quick to try to pretend like there is not an efficacy difference between JnJ and the two mRNA vaccines.

Colorado has reached a critical pivot point in its vaccination efforts. Approximately 2.5 million people ‚Äî roughly 43% of the state‚Äôs total population and 53% of the population eligible to receive a shot ‚Äî have gotten at least a first dose of vaccine.

But the number of shots given per day appears to be falling, after hitting a high of 79,480 doses administered on April 9. Colorado vaccine providers administered more than 411,000 doses during the week of April 4. The following week, the number dropped to just under 399,000 doses. More recent data is not yet available because of reporting delays.

The first thing to understand about vaccine hesitancy, say those who have studied it closely, is that it‚Äôs not what you think it is.

While the people who get the most attention are those opposed to all vaccines based on arguments that often lack scientific merit, they make up a small portion of vaccine holdouts. Instead, most people who are hesitant to receive a vaccine think of themselves as pro-vaccination, and their concerns are grounded in something rational, said Jennifer Reich, a sociologist at the University of Colorado Denver who has written extensively about vaccines.

‚ÄùI start with the premise that everyone is trying to do the best they can with what information they have and to make a decision that feels authentic to them and aligns with their beliefs and values,‚Äù Reich said.

People who don‚Äôt have paid sick leave, for instance, may worry about getting a vaccine with side effects that could cause them to miss work. People who don‚Äôt have a regular medical provider may be uncertain where they can go to get good information.

[],,Kayactual,,,,,,[],"More than 93 million Americans are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. Despite so many invigorated immune systems, the populace still needs to keep wearing masks, public health specialists say.The country is not yet so protected it can forgo face coverings. Case counts have spiked in some hot spots. Meanwhile, it‚Äôs clearer than ever that masks protect wearers as well as those nearby.‚ÄúMasks are one of the best interventions that we have to prevent viral transmission from one person to another,‚Äù said Lisa Maragakis, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.But the newly vaccinated would be forgiven for giving their masks a second look. In the first wave of vaccinations, after the Food and Drug Administration authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in December, even front line health-care workers had these kinds of questions.‚ÄúI was caught off-guard at the beginning,‚Äù Maragakis said. ‚ÄúMy own colleagues started saying, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm vaccinated, let‚Äôs roll back all of our policies.‚Äô And it‚Äôs been very difficult to hold the line and say, ‚ÄòWait, wait, wait, it‚Äôs not time yet.‚Äô ‚ÄùWhat are mask recommendations for people who are vaccinated?In March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines for what fully vaccinated people can do. Some restrictions were loosened: People who are fully immunized can socialize with each other, ignoring masks and physical distancing. It‚Äôs also okay to relax those precautions when meeting with non-vaccinated, low-risk members of a single household.But, in public, everyone should continue to wear masks, the agency said.Those guidelines ‚Äúare absolutely appropriate for this moment in time,‚Äù said Megan Ranney, an emergency medicine physician and professor at Brown University. ‚ÄúThere just aren‚Äôt enough of us who have immunity yet for it to be safe to take those masks off in public.‚ÄùThe country will get there, she said. There‚Äôs no precise percentage at which the nation suddenly becomes virus-proof; achieving herd immunity is not like toggling on a switch. But Ranney suggested that, as the country reaches 70 to 80 percent of adults vaccinated, ‚Äúthen we‚Äôre going to be able to operate in public more like we currently do in private.‚ÄùThere are a few reasons the CDC‚Äôs current advice depends on the setting. The coronavirus vaccines authorized by the FDA protect people from severe disease and death, although in extremely rare cases people who are vaccinated can still test positive.‚ÄúThis is not to undermine or discredit the vaccine in any way ‚Äî because we know they‚Äôre highly efficacious at preventing severe disease ‚Äî but they‚Äôre not 100 percent,‚Äù Maragakis said.Likewise, there are encouraging signs that vaccines reduce transmission, but it is not yet definitive that they halt spread completely. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre vaccinated, then you have that protection for your own health,‚Äù Maragakis said. ‚ÄúThere is still that chance that you could be a vector and put other unvaccinated individuals at risk.‚ÄùMasks complement vaccines. There are persuasive observations that facecoverings are protective. States with the lowest levels of mask-wearing were more likely to have higher infection rates, according to a recent PLOS One analysis of the 50 states plus D.C., which examined caseloads and masks from late spring 2020 into early fall.And, if everyone wore them, masks were nearly 80 percent effective at stopping coronavirus transmission within a home in an observational study of Beijing households. The authors of a scientific review in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, who compiled evidence from the Beijing study and others, arrived at a strong endorsement of ‚Äúwidespread face masks in public.‚ÄùYou‚Äôre vaccinated and headed to an event. Do you need to wear a mask?Fans are back at ballparks. High schools and colleges are planning in-person graduation ceremonies this spring. States that had banned large gatherings are once again permitting events, such as New York‚Äôs 150-person-maximum wedding rule.When tailoring the CDC‚Äôs mask recommendations for spring events that may have numerous attendees ‚Äî events that may be bigger than a dinner party but not quite public ‚Äî experts told The Washington Post that people should assess their risk and their tolerance for it.Risk depends on a variety of factors, such as attendance numbers, a venue‚Äôs ventilation, vaccination status and whether people may be immunosuppressed or have other susceptibilities to severe disease.‚ÄúWhat we know is that outdoors is a much lower risk ‚Äî orders of magnitude lower risk ‚Äî than gathering indoors,‚Äù Maragakis said. But she‚Äôd still recommend wearing masks and distancing at large open-air gatherings like ballgames, until the rate of vaccination among the general population is higher. Plus, private venues such as stadiums are allowed to have rules requiring mask-wearing.At a high school graduation, younger students might not have had access to the vaccine, or there could be older adults in attendance at higher risk of getting sick, making masks appropriate. But at a small wedding ceremony where everyone is vaccinated, Ranney said, ‚Äúit may be okay to be without masks.‚Äù She, for instance, is planning to attend a get-together with about 15 other doctors and health care providers ‚Äî they‚Äôre all vaccinated, and later this month, they‚Äôll share a drink for the first time since the pandemic began.When will we stop wearing masks?Israel, whose population is among the most highly vaccinated in the world, removed its outdoor mask mandate April 18.That could be a sign of what‚Äôs to come in the United States in the warmer months. ‚ÄúI fully expect and support mask mandates, by and large, being lifted by early summer,‚Äù Ranney said, as long as every American who wants a vaccine has had a chance to get one.But even if that comes to pass, that doesn‚Äôt mean masks will vanish. People should still be allowed to wear masks if they desire, Ranney said, especially those who are particularly vulnerable.And it‚Äôs likely mask-wearing will be encouraged, if not enforced, in higher-risk environments. Such candidates include crowded or poorly ventilated areas, at transportation hubs and while aboard buses, trains and planes.‚ÄúCertainly, I‚Äôm going to wear masks on long-distance flights,‚Äù said Jose-Luis Jimenez, an aerosol chemist at the University of Colorado at Boulder who studies how the virus spreads in the air. ‚ÄúThe U.S. can be a curious place, sociologically, but I think I won‚Äôt be the only one,‚Äù he said, suggesting masks on transit could become as ubiquitous as ball caps.And masks may be needed again during the fall and winter seasons, when respiratory viruses spread more readily. For the past several flu seasons, wearing masks has been the rule for patients, staff and visitors alike at Johns Hopkins‚Äô oncology center, Maragakis pointed out.What might our mask-wearing future look like?Some public health researchers believe masks could transition into a commonplace habit, much like placing toddlers in car seats or slathering sunscreen at the beach. After the pandemic, more than half of Americans expect to wear masks at least some of the time, according to a YouGov survey in March. And 1 in 4 people said they predict frequent mask-wearing.Helene-Mari van der Westhuizen, a physician who is studying infection control at Oxford University, said masks have become a social practice that transcends their medical purpose, as she wrote with colleagues in the British Medical Journal. She said mask guidance that treats the public by ‚Äúpretending that we are all in a giant medical ward‚Äù misses something: People want masks that are meaningful or accessible.‚ÄúThat might mean the mask needs to have a nice pattern and fit with the outfit,‚Äù she said. (See: the matching masks at last month‚Äôs Grammy Awards.) ‚ÄúIt should mean that they‚Äôre able to pop it in the laundry with their clothing.‚Äù To those who wear them, masks can be visual symbols of solidarity against the shared threat of the pandemic ‚Äî particularly valuable at a time when distancing restrictions can hinder a sense of community.Masks certainly will not be universal. People have violently acted out their anti-mask sentiment, such as a woman caught on video who coughed on an Uber driver and tore off his mask. Van der Westhuizen said she was flooded with abuse on social media after publishing the BMJ article.‚ÄúI hope that we normalize mask-wearing a little bit more, like Japan or South Korea or other countries where people can choose to mask ‚Äî not because they‚Äôre forced to ‚Äî but because they see it as a way to protect their health,‚Äù Ranney said.The public health experts get that everyone is tired of masks. But, Maragakis said, ‚Äúwe would be foolish‚Äù to not consider wearing our masks in the future.",,,1619448682,{},gvxoi0l,True,t3_myy4ww,False,True,t1_gvxkhq0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/myy4ww/vaccinated_great_you_should_still_wear_a_mask_in/gvxoi0l/,1619450178,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_6hstehm4,False,False,,

Can you see a difference between 'masks don't work,' which is obviously false, and ""stop buying masks, they don't protect you""? Or do you think those are the same statement?

&amp;#x200B;

You know the second part of that quote is still known to be true today, right? That the point of masks is to protect others, not yourself?

&amp;#x200B;

And then you point to the Fauci interview, where he is expressly clear both that masks **ARE effective** in preventing the spread of corona for people who 'need' them (the sick and healthcare workers) and that the **reason** he was saying not to buy them was because of concerns over shortages for those people who do need them, because of those buying and hoarding medical supplies.

&amp;#x200B;

Also remember that this was at a time when our new cases was in the single digits, and we had less data on pre-symptomatic spread. Seems like he was both honest and considered in everything he said in that interview, just like I said.

So while a booster may be desired for those who want to keep their titer high constantly, or perhaps a variant booster (I'm still thinking this isn't terribly likely to be 100% necessary), you likely won't see major community spread through a population after somewhere north of 60% are vaccinated.

After that, you just have to worry about reserves in animals, mice, rats, etc, reintroducing the virus to a population after the titers drop (which is why we may want to boost yearly or biannually).

&gt;A pandemic can get you a shorter trial because the high number of cases can help demonstrate efficacy faster than the average slow-moving disease.

Neither of these points you made refute my point.  I 100% agree that the initial clinical trials benefited from the fast spreading disease and there was justification for EUA and that initial trials showed at least short term safety and efficacy.

[],,SteveGroper,,,,,,[],"I understand the point and have been lectured to already in the replies to my comment about how it‚Äôs unscientific and disingenuous, and I get it. But the scenario you‚Äôre describing is also misleading, as I see it, because it assumes that vaccinations from the time of the 0.005% calculation have stopped, and therefore the community spread remains constant, thereby giving the fully vaccinated every opportunity to experience more breakthrough infections, which would bring the rate of breakthroughs up beyond what we‚Äôre currently seeing. But realistically, more people are getting vaccinated and will continue to be, even though it‚Äôs starting to slow down now. (And even though there are plenty of people who will not or cannot get vaccinated, there are those among them who have been infected and are highly unlikely to be reinfected and transmit.) So I wouldn‚Äôt expect the *rate* of breakthrough infections to increase much at all. I think it‚Äôs more likely we‚Äôll approach herd immunity (or community immunity) before the rates of breakthrough infections become a serious concern. 

There‚Äôs currently a study of college students that just began, to examine the vaccines‚Äô protection against infection and spread. It began less than a month ago, I believe, and is to last 5 months. Is 5 months long enough to make any sort of satisfactory determination? 4 months isn‚Äôt long enough, but 5 is? Granted, there‚Äôll be a control group in that study and regular testing, but is that enough? 

My point is, it‚Äôs never going to be enough for some people. Most people just want to have some concrete idea in their head about the vaccines‚Äô effectiveness in preventing infection and spread, and sadly because it‚Äôs been so poorly communicated from virtually everyone in any position of influence, people still think a fully vaccinated person has a 1 in 10 chance of being infected. Other people think the vaccines don‚Äôt prevent infection and spread *at* *all*. 

But yes, I take your point about how the lightning strike analogy is highly misleading.

Imagine there's a fatal disease or condition which kills 1 per million people, but after we've started giving them ""Vaccine X"" we notice an rate of 10 per million. It seems highly likely that those extra 9 per million were caused by the vaccine. Meanwhile imagine there's anither fatal disease which kills 200 per million people, and after we start giving them ""Vaccine Y"" the rate goes uo to 220 per million. We probably would not even spot that amidst all the statistical noise, comorbidities and whatnot. So we'd be in the uncomfortable position where Y is killing twice as many people as X, but X would be perceived as dangerous and Y would be perceived as safe.

You aren't either and thank god for that. We don't need more gambling nutjobs or science deniers in the medical field. 

You are citing a retrospective study as a fact. Which has flaws. You don't get that and you still spout low risk. The risk is upto 10%. And you are nowhere near accurate when you can't explain how it spreads and what factors contribute to it. 

The attack rate is also not a base 25%. It varies from as low as 4% to as high as 50%. But of course you don't care about those.

Infection fatality rates is 0-5 to 4% also depending on the place and how it is spread and the mechanisms to combat it.

So you keep downplaying risk, have no accurate info about outdoor spread, don't care about a dangerous disease and then scoff at wearing a mask when there is sufficient risk. Its because of people like you that we need these till vaccinations reach a thershold. 

You still haven't said why a minimal measure like a mask is problem beyond stats that you clearly don't care beyond the lowest possible number. Those stats have lives behind them. People who lose wages, jobs or even loved ones or their own lives. But you are happy to gamble with that because you don't want to see data in it's entirety. 

You have absolutely no proof beyond a retrospective study I pointed out and that too you choose to take the lowest risk possible and not consider the median or the possible risk or the factors that contribute to it. You keep harping about compliance for a simple thing and then complain govt should focus on better things. Guess what they are with vaccinations. 

The only wide reaching regulation would be locking you in your home. Mask is hardly an inconvenience and the simplest of measures. And that too till vaccinations. And this is a fact.

Vaccinated people could potentially still get COVID-19 and spread it to others. However, the benefits of relaxing some measures such as testing and self-quarantine requirements for travelers, post-exposure quarantine requirements and reducing social isolation may outweigh the residual risk of fully vaccinated people becoming ill with COVID-19 or transmitting the virus to others. 

""Vaccinated travelers may thus be less likely to be infected (VES: susceptibility) and to transmit to others if infected (VEI: infection). Early estimates of VES¬†for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are on the order of 60‚Äì92%. Therefore, a range of combined VES¬†and VEI¬†estimates from 60‚Äì90% for vaccinated travelers was assessed. For example, with a combined VE of 60%, a traveler, who if unvaccinated would be infected and infectious 100% of the time, was assumed to be infected and infectious 40% of the time and a combined VE of 90%, the traveler was assumed to be infected and infectious 10% of the time.¬†""",,,1619443042,{},gvxcry5,False,t3_myuich,False,True,t1_gvxb1fx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/myuich/pissed_off_dr_fauci_cites_567000_dead_americans/gvxcry5/,1619443129,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5zdqxs06,False,False,,

[],,imfinefinefine,,,,,,[],"I don‚Äôt usually talk about this, but my dad (infectious disease specialist/pulmonologist/critical care physician) agrees that the COVID vaccines can, and likely should to some degree, be nuanced. Those with natural infection do have T-cell memory and do not necessarily need to have both doses of the vaccine, depending on a number of factors that may impact their immune response to the vaccine. For example, he said that some elderly patients who survived COVID have died within 2-3 days of their second vaccine dose, and their cause of death is attributed to cardiac arrest. But they don‚Äôt actually know if the cardiac arrest was caused by the immune response to the vaccine (the timing is suspicious, and should probably be looked into). He also has concerns about giving all children an EUA vaccine when they are technically not in a state of emergency, which is also a matter of debate with physicians. Maybe it should be required. Maybe it should be optional. Though there are many passionate opinions, there is no One Right Answer for that yet in medicine.

This is very complicated, not everyone‚Äôs bodies are the same, and like it or not, there‚Äôs still some things that we do not know (just look at what happened in the last few weeks with the J&amp;J vaccine). There are different risk/benefit analyses for different people that can be considered when also thinking about what is best for the ‚Äúherd.‚Äù

What bothers me is that there seems to be a mentality that it is not okay to ask questions or challenge viewpoints. Doing so often elicits an immediate response of categorization (evil republican/Cov-idiot/selfish/anti-vaxxer, etc.) rather than actual discourse about concerns and possible nuance for guidelines.

The problem with the production capacity numbers you've got there is they're the numbers with hindsight to help us.  A year ago, when contracts were being negotiated and no one had made vaccines like the AZ one before at the scale needed, the best knowledge they had about capacity was educated guesses, which have ultimately proved to be wrong.

The contract negotiators probably wouldn't have agreed contracts without delivery dates in, so what could they have done in that situation? The only option for AZ really was to give estimated dates and say that they'd give their best efforts to meet those dates, which is what they did.

The real question comes down to whether their estimates were reasonable given the data they had at the time, and none of us can know that with the data publicly available just now.

It also sounds like one of the issues with adenovirus vaccines is that if a batch is going to fail, it'll be right at the end of the production process which is likely to be only a few weeks before it's due to be delivered.

[],,MyFriendMadison,,,,,,[],"&gt;The attack rate is also not a base 25%. It varies from as low as 4% to as high as 50%. But of course you don't care about those.

The only controlled situation we have is Diamond Princess. Everything else since then is an estimation. Granted that was before variants, but even if you're correct that it's up to 50% that still doesn't equal as you said ""10% risk of catching it outdoors""

&gt;You are citing a retrospective study as a fact. Which has flaws. You don't get that and you still spout low risk. The risk is upto 10%. And you are nowhere near accurate when you can't explain how it spreads and what factors contribute to it.

I'm doing no such thing. I am stating that the aggregate of studies which fluctuates between &lt;1%-&lt;10% is indicative of an accurate range of risk as there are no major outliers and successive studies show similar data. Including the recent studies showing UV light breaks down the virus much faster than previously thought. Combined with constantly moving air the ability for transmission is severely reduced outdoors, which we have enough proof of now that we can accept this as more than likely true. 

So let's see...you disregard the aggregate of studies that directly address outdoor spread, as well as the way in which the virus is transmitted altogether and how outdoor conditions disrupt that, as well as all our data about infectious respiratory viruses that have been collected over the last century, as well as more and more doctors and medical professionals coming forward to say that the risk of transmission outdoors is low, as well as the fact that in states where outdoor mask mandates have been lifted haven't seen an uptick in cases...but still want to make decisions for millions of people about how they should manage risk?

Sorry, doesn't work that way. 


In order to implement mandatory and sweeping policies there has to be a compelling reason that shows those policies are necessary to manage risk. It doesn't matter how minimal or innocuous YOU may think it is, there has to be compelling evidence to show that it needs to be mandatory. 

The fact is that medical opinions and studies are actually stacking up in the other direction, and each day more people come out to say that outdoor masking is just not necessary in the vast majority of situations, and especially not to the point that it supports mandating that millions of people comply. 

There is sufficient data to show that masking indoors is helpful and necessary.

So these ""safety reviews"" are not Emergency Approval for use in the US, but rather quality control to ensure the doses that have been manufactured were manufactured to safety standards.

For sure.  I adore Dr Fauci as a scientist and a public servant.  But his scientific ""assess new data as it comes in, give the best answer I know at the time, as unvarnished truth""... while being good science, it is not always good policy.

In retrospect, the policy we needed the entire time was, get as many people to mask as possible right until the moment a vaccine is available, then roll out the vaccine as fast as possible.

If we are establishing that a very small percentage of the population has extreme reactions to COVID (as most are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms) AND those individuals were able to be vaccinated, thus reducing their chances of extreme health problems AND there isn't enough evidence to show that being vaccinated stops you from spreading the disease, then the only real reason to get vaccinated is to prevent yourself from becoming very ill or worse.  If someone isn't concerned about that, then what is the reason to get vaccinated?   It 100% tracks logically....

That is, until you bring up the idea that the fewer people who contract COVID means fewer chances of replication.  However, this is also predicated upon the concept that vaccination slows transmission and mutation.  I have not seen where this has been reported.

I don't know precisely what European country you live in, but in every ""well off European country"", you will be able to receive your vaccine if you want one by July. 

The EU [received](https://www.dw.com/en/covid-eu-pulls-out-all-stops-to-boost-vaccine-rollout/a-57117948) 100 million vaccines in Q1, and is [expecting](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/breton/announcements/beating-covid-19-scale-vaccine-production-europe_en) 360 million vaccines in Q2. This figure does not include the extra 50 million will be getting from Pfizer/BioNTech in Q2, but I won't adjust the figure because it leaves room for some of the other vaccine developers to underdeliver. For now, let's also leave aside that 55 million of those are J&amp;J which only require a single shot, and say for the sake of simplicity that the EU will have had received 460 million doses by the end of June. The population of the EU is about 448 million, so that would be enough to give a first shot to literally everybody, including babies and vaccine sceptics. More realistically, there are about 80 million children in the EU, which means that there are approximately 370 million adults, so the EU would have enough vaccines to have fully vaccinated 60% of adults (it would probably look something like 70% having received a first dose and 50% having received been fully vaccinated). If you do factor in J&amp;J being a single shot, there would be enough vaccines to fully vaccinate around 65% of the adult population. Considering those sceptical of the vaccines, that would likely be enough to cover almost everyone who wants one.  Even if you include the time to distribute these vaccine deliveries, the EU has already committed to giving 70% of adults their first shot by [July](https://www.euronews.com/2021/04/23/eu-to-vaccinate-70-of-adults-by-july-two-months-ahead-of-schedule-says-von-der-leyen).

Looking beyond June, I cannot find a general EU delivery schedule, but the [Swedish](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/statistik-och-analyser/leveranser-av-vaccin/prognos-av-vaccinleveranser/) and the [Spanish](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov/documentos/Informe_GIV_comunicacion_20210406.pdf) delivery schedules show both countries expect to have enough doses to be able to fully vaccinate 100% of their populations (again, including every age range and every vaccine sceptic) by the end of September. 

The only ""well off European country"" that isn't in the EU's procurement scheme is Switzerland (aside from the UK, but I don't think anyone here has doubts about their vaccination programme), and they are also on a similar track.

All 65 people, most of them students, have been asked to stay in isolation and observe self-health management, according to a Taiwan Tech spokesperson.

The contact tracing was carried out after Taiwan health authorities were informed on April 21 that a pilot with the country's major carrier China Airlines (CAL) had tested positive for COVID-19 in Australia, a few days after he attended a religious gathering in Taipei, the spokesperson said.

Taiwan's Central Emergency Command Center (CECC) on Sunday confirmed that two other CAL pilots had tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the total number of positive cases among CAL pilots over the past week to seven.

According to the CECC, two of the pilots, including the one in Australia who is an Indonesian man in his 40s, had participated in the religious gathering at Taipei Grand Mosque on April 16. The teenage son of one of the pilots also tested positive, said the CECC, which had traced 58 contacts of the pilot in Australia.

Upon learning of the cases, Taiwan Tech conduced its own contact tracing, in view of the fact that many of its students and some teachers are Muslims from Indonesia and Pakistan, the school's Secretary General Leu Jenq-shiou (ÂëÇÊîø‰øÆ) said.

The university was able to identify 65 people -students and teachers -- who had participated in the April 16 gathering at the mosque, he said.

Those who live on school dormitories have been asked to stay in self-isolation at least until April 30, while those who live off-campus are required to practice practice self-health management at home for the same period, Leu said, adding that remote learning arrangements have been made for the students.

Meanwhile, the school campus is being disinfected, and students have been advised to take preventative measures such as wearing a mask and observing social distancing, he said.

Five studies related to SARS-CoV-2 transmission found that less than 10% of reported transmission occurred in outdoor settings, less than 5% of cases were related to outdoor occupations, and the odds of transmission or super-spreading are much lower outdoors (Table 1) [14‚Äì17].

&gt;Study 1: 2/7324 or &lt;1% of transmissions happened outdoors.

&gt;Study 2: 4/103 or ~5% of transmissions happened outdoors.

&gt;Study 3: Odds of indoor transmission between 6 and 20 times more likely than outdoors.

On Michigan specifically - when the governor asked for additional doses, that was week of April 5th.

This even has a great little table that details a bunch of other studies that come to similar conclusions that you can link to.


&gt;Five studies related to SARS-CoV-2 transmission found that less than 10% of reported transmission occurred in outdoor settings, less than 5% of cases were related to outdoor occupations, and the odds of transmission or super-spreading are much lower outdoors (Table 1) [14‚Äì17].



&gt;Study 1: 2/7324 or &lt;1% of transmissions happened outdoors.


&gt;Study 2: 4/103 or ~5% of transmissions happened outdoors.


&gt;Study 3: Odds of indoor transmission between 6 and 20 times more likely than outdoors.


&gt;Study 4: Odds of super-spreader events indoors between 4 and 290 times more likely than outdoors.


&gt;Study 5: 95/10,926 or &lt;1% of transmissions occurred outdoors.



This study simply says there are gaps in the research that need to be filled in, but admits that based on evidence from past influenza outbreaks and virus behavior that these systemic studies are in line with what they expect to see.

What that means is that studies of outdoor transmissions don't tend to give all the details like indoor ones. The number of people around, time spent, distances, etc.  Indoor environments tend to be more controlled environments.

For instance, like this:

[https://www.foxla.com/news/person-caught-covid-19-after-5-minutes-in-restaurant-20-feet-from-infected-patron-researchers-say](https://www.foxla.com/news/person-caught-covid-19-after-5-minutes-in-restaurant-20-feet-from-infected-patron-researchers-say)

&gt;Person caught COVID-19 after 5 minutes in restaurant 20 feet from infected patron, researchers say

And it makes sense because it is more difficult. Indoor transmissions can be more easily reconstructed and described. For example, it is easier to show what direction and force the air was flowing from an indoor air conditioner than the wind outside at an exact moment.

An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Under an EUA, FDA may allow the use of unapproved medical products, or unapproved uses of approved medical products in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when certain statutory criteria have been met, including that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. Taking into consideration input from the FDA, manufacturers decide whether and when to submit an EUA request to FDA.

Once submitted, FDA will evaluate an EUA request and determine whether the relevant statutory criteria are met, taking into account the totality of the scientific evidence about the vaccine that is available to FDA.

I did point out that I was just grumping about a recurrent pattern-- I speculated, albeit with some inferred certainty, because women have had a higher instance of reactions/side effects versus men, it fit the pattern  --because it's annoying to always be considered non-standard.

Being critical of the medical community for their bad practices wrt vaccine gender equality and being vaccine positive are not mutually exclusive. And suggesting that just *discussing* a legitimate issue in medicine is somehow causing harm is... dangerous, really.

Well over here in reality I can just remember how people were hoarding literal truck fulls of medical grade masks early in the pandemic, and the reports of shortages for medical professionals. If you have to appeal to 'common sense' then maybe you have less reason for your position than you might think.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  even the WHO said masks didnt work and they had no such concern about a shortage. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can you source this claim for me? Because I have never seen a quote even close to 'masks don't work' coming from any medical professional, but people keep acting like this was said over and over.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The surgeon general said masks ‚Äòdon‚Äôt work to prevent the coronavirus 

&amp;#x200B;

And this is still understood to be true. They work to **prevent the spread by people already infected**, not to protect the person wearing the mask from contracting the virus.

However, at some point it should have been obvious to AstraZeneca the odds of them resolving their yield problems was not going to be a timely occurance, if at all, and that in order to compensate they would need to triple their manufacturing in order to get close to their delivery targets for late 2021Q1 and 2021Q2. There's even provision in their contract with the EU to do just that by setting up additional facilities, except AZ didn't do it, for whatever reason (it'll be money).  

Legally the problem with the 'best efforts' term is... compared to what. Traditional vaccine manufacturing took more like five years, and most other vaccines for this pandemic have taken longer than AZ to be ready. More likely the EU lawyers will go for the failure to notify about production shortages and not setting up additional facilities to increase production when those problems failed to be resolved in a timely manner (but again what is traditionally a 'timely manner' for making vaccines?).

[],,oh_okay_,,,,,,[],"When Emily Viegas started exhibiting some of the same COVID-19 symptoms that had put her mother in hospital ‚Äì difficulty breathing, an inability to stand ‚Äì her father, Carlos, faced an agonizing situation.

He was the only one in his family of four who had tested negative for COVID-19 and was at home in Brampton, Ont., with his two children while his wife was at Brampton Civic Hospital on oxygen. Mr. Viegas was under strict self-isolation orders from public health and wasn‚Äôt sure if he should call an ambulance. He also knew Brampton Civic was one of the most strained hospitals in the country and he feared his daughter might be taken to a hospital further away in another Toronto suburb, Oakville. He didn‚Äôt like the idea of her being separated from both her parents.

He routinely checked her temperature, gave her Tylenol to bring her fever down, and urged her to drink lots of water and eat some of her favourite foods ‚Äì hot dogs and multi-grain pasta ‚Äì even though she didn‚Äôt have much of an appetite. She was 13, Mr. Viegas reasoned, and she would probably be back to normal quickly.

The next day, April 22, she became one of the youngest Canadians to die from COVID-19 ‚Äì and part of a growing trend of younger victims in the pandemic‚Äôs third wave.

Severe outcomes from COVID-19 infections remain exceedingly rare in children. Though 208,195 people under 19 have been infected with COVID-19 as of April 23, the majority have had mild cases. In total, 142 have been admitted to ICU and eight have died, according to national statistics.

Though Mr. Viegas was the only one in the family to leave the apartment over the past many months ‚Äì he was the sole breadwinner and worked at a warehouse ‚Äì he was somehow the only one spared from COVID-19. His wife was the first one to fall ill, though she stayed at home for a week before getting tested and learning she had the coronavirus. During that period, Mr. Viegas continued going to work and his children occasionally went into their mother‚Äôs room to bring her food and water. On April 14, the day after Mr. Viegas‚Äôs wife got her test results, she had so much trouble breathing that she was taken to hospital and put on oxygen.

Back at the apartment, Emily had developed a stubborn cough, but otherwise felt well. Well enough to engage in the moody sparring most 13-year-olds have with their parents. Mr. Viegas would tell her to stop playing Minecraft or texting her friends and do her homework.

‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù she‚Äôd respond, often with colourful language. ‚ÄúGet lost, old man.‚Äù

But after a week, as a fever came on and Emily‚Äôs breathing became laboured, their father-daughter exchanges shifted.

Mr. Viegas occasionally noticed Emily struggling to inhale, which would cause her to panic, which would only make it harder to take in air.

‚ÄúIt scared me, but I kept telling her, ‚ÄòSlow down. Slow your breathing down so you‚Äôre not using all the energy you have to get air,‚Äô‚Äù he recalled.

On April 22, Emily woke up in the bedroom she shares with her younger brother, went to the bathroom, then returned to bed, lying beneath posters of mermaids and characters from the film Frozen. Just after 9 a.m., Emily‚Äôs brother noticed she wasn‚Äôt moving and raced to get their father.

Mr. Viegas found his daughter laying eerily still, her eyes partly open, and completely unresponsive.

He called 911 and was instructed to give his daughter CPR. When paramedics arrived, they cleared Mr. Viegas and his son out of the room and tried to resuscitate Emily, too, and briefly got her heart beating again, but she still wasn‚Äôt breathing. They tried again. After she was rushed to hospital, a doctor called Mr. Viegas and said they would try once more but if they failed, they‚Äôd pronounce her dead. Three hours after Mr. Viegas had put his head on his daughter‚Äôs chest, he got another call she was gone. Doctors said she not only had COVID-19, but also pneumonia.

‚ÄúTo tell you the truth, it felt real when I found her in bed. I put my head to her chest and I couldn‚Äôt feel nothing. No heartbeat. No nothing. No breathing,‚Äù Mr. Viegas said.

Sudden deaths in young people have become more common in this third wave of the pandemic. In the first three weeks of April, Ontario‚Äôs coroners have seen 25 cases of people in Southern and Central Ontario who have died at home from the illness, some in their 20s and 30s.

The Viegases live in a two-bedroom apartment in a COVID-19 hot spot in east Brampton, a city with a 22-per-cent test positivity rate, the highest in Ontario. That‚Äôs in large part because of the high volume of essential workers in the city, many of whom live in crowded housing where it‚Äôs difficult to physically distance. Mr. Viegas, 58, got vaccinated on April 12, but his wife, still recovering in hospital, hasn‚Äôt received her jab yet.

While a patchwork of mobile vaccination clinics have opened across Toronto hot spots to offer vaccines to anyone over 18, there is only one such clinic housed at a large Hindu temple for hot-spot residents of Brampton ‚Äì and, technically, it‚Äôs in Toronto.

Mr. Viegas‚Äôs wife‚Äôs oxygen levels are up to 80 per cent now and he‚Äôs hopeful she‚Äôll come home soon. Informing her of their daughter‚Äôs death was ‚Äúas hard as it could be,‚Äù he said. As Mr. Viegas is still in isolation, the business of sharing the news with friends and making funeral arrangements have fallen to other members of the family.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know details. I don‚Äôt even know if we‚Äôre going to have the viewing or not,‚Äù Mr. Viegas said. ‚ÄúAnd my mother‚Äôs not going because she doesn‚Äôt want to see her granddaughter in a box.‚Äù",,,1619461662,{},gvyj3g1,False,t3_mz14j4,False,False,t1_gvy7ig7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mz14j4/emily_victoria_viegas_13_is_one_of_the_youngest/gvyj3g1/,1619469120,13,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_67s7g,False,False,,
