It has recently been hypothesized that vitamin K could play a role in COVID-19. We aimed to test the hypotheses that low vitamin K status is a common characteristic of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to population controls and that low vitamin K status predicts mortality in COVID-19 patients. In a cohort of 138 COVID-19 patients and 138 population controls, we measured plasma dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein (dp-ucMGP), which reflects the functional vitamin K status in peripheral tissue. Forty-three patients died within 90 days from admission. In patients, levels of dp-ucMGP differed significantly between survivors (mean 877; 95% CI: 778; 995) and non-survivors (mean 1445; 95% CI: 1148; 1820). Furthermore, levels of dp-ucMGP (pmol/L) were considerably higher in patients (mean 1022; 95% CI: 912; 1151) compared to controls (mean 509; 95% CI: 485; 540). Cox regression survival analysis showed that increasing levels of dp-ucMGP (reflecting low vitamin K status) were associated with higher mortality risk (sex- and age-adjusted hazard ratio per doubling of dp-ucMGP was 1.49, 95% CI: 1.03; 2.24). The association attenuated and became statistically insignificant after adjustment for co-morbidities (sex, age, CVD, diabetes, BMI, and eGFR adjusted hazard ratio per doubling of dp-ucMGP was 1.22, 95% CI: 0.82; 1.80). In conclusion, we found that low vitamin K status was associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 in sex- and age-adjusted analyses, but not in analyses additionally adjusted for co-morbidities. Randomized clinical trials would be needed to clarify a potential role, if any, of vitamin K in the course of COVID-19. View Full-Text

There's a long history of this kind of thing; science always gets rejected when it conflicts with politics, even by people who would otherwise trust it.

People with organ transplants have to take medications that wipe out their immune response so that their body doesn't reject their transplant. They will die without their medication and don't have the option of pausing it. 

People on chemo or chemo-related drugs like methotrexate don't have a good immune response due to the drug itself - they usually have to go off their medication or wait until they're in between chemo rounds to get the vaccine.

Every variant ""breaks through"" vaccines, because they're not 100% effective.  The Delta variant isn't significantly better at it than the others.  And when a breakthrough happens, the resulting infection is almost always mild.

This has been speculated on since the beginning, but it turns out the antibodies are still around and kicking.

You just made that up.

&gt;As we get more immunity the virus also mutates and gets stronger

That is not how mutations work. The majority of mutations actually produce weaker variants.  It's not some video game where the virus ""levels up"".

&gt;Not until you get to like 85% recently vaxxed/very recently recovered for herd immunity. 45% fully vaxxed...is just not there yet, thus....around 10,000 cases per day still.

This doesn't take into account natural immunities.  The pandemic is dropping off despite not reaching your arbitary 85% vaccination, even when cities open up completely.

You're conflating different things.  Yes they're saying that everyone over 18 should be vaccinated, but no they're actually saying very clearly that people under 18 should hold off for now on getting vaccinated. 

&gt;Which to me means that if you have kids who are 12 and up, they should be getting vaccinated as soon as they can, so they can be protected from potential problems/issues that can result from COVID-19.

How exactly did you derive that from this WHO statement?:

&gt;""Children should not be vaccinated for the moment.
There is not yet enough evidence on the use of vaccines against COVID-19 in children to make recommendations for children"" 

&gt;The WHO is really pushing hard to try to increase the number of vaccine doses that are going to the less economically developed countries, and this is why the messaging is this way.

So, more vaccines for the brown and black skinned countries, and less doses for children of the mostly white western countries?

&gt;I would only be concerned if the WHO came out and said that it was dangerous to vaccinate people under 18, and well, that's really unlikely to happen.

So the fact they came out and said children under 18 should not be vaccinated at this time for COVID, until more information and studies are done on this age group doesn't bother you or cause you to even think twice?

They are not saying that it's unsafe or that vaccines are not approved for under 18's but instead are just saying that everyone 18 and over should be vaccinated, and simply not saying anything about those who are under 18.

In the US the CDC and FDA are who decides what vaccines are safe and who is eligible to get vaccinated, and certain vaccines have been approved for 12 and up.

Which to me means that if you have kids who are 12 and up, they should be getting vaccinated as soon as they can, so they can be protected from potential problems/issues that can result from COVID-19.

The WHO is really pushing hard to try to increase the number of vaccine doses that are going to the less economically developed countries, and this is why the messaging is this way.

I would only be concerned if the WHO came out and said that it was dangerous to vaccinate people under 18, and well, that's really unlikely to happen.

I hope this made sense and was helpful.

The country in May said it would open a trade representative office this year in Taiwan, which China considers its own territory, prompting anger in Beijing.

The vaccines, donated in response to Taiwan’s request, will be transferred by the end of September.
“We’d like to do more, but we do what we can,” Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said during broadcast government meeting.

The government in May decided to donate 100,000 vaccine doses to Ukraine, 15,000 to Georgia and 11,000 to Moldova.

Taiwan, which has been battling a rise in coronavirus infections since last month, is trying to speed up a vaccination programme that has been hobbled by supply delays.

Breakthrough cases are at least common enough that the Tennessee department of health is publicly tracking them. [See here](https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov.html) - the critical indicator report, page 5. As of June 10th the state of Tennessee (not my state btw, but where my mom lives, and we had been discussing it) had 940 breakthrough cases. 

See this [article](https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/st-louis-county-health-department-has-seen-212-breakthrough-covid-cases/63-0bb5f94c-1257-4285-ac39-2d1254fe0620) from June 3rd in St Louis. It does say that breakthrough cases are ""extremely rare."" But then it goes on to say:

&gt;The department has identified 212 breakthrough infections.

&gt;More than 350,000 adults in St. Louis County are fully vaccinated, according to the state of Missouri.

&gt;Even with vaccine effectiveness of 90% or higher, a small percentage of people still will get sick.

&gt;Some evidence shows that vaccination may make illness less severe in breakthrough cases.

&gt;Still, some of those people may be hospitalized or die from COVID-19.

&gt;Most breakthrough infections present with very minor symptoms. In 17% of the health department's cases, the person is asymptomatic and was tested because of exposure, usually to a household member with COVID-19 who was unvaccinated.

The vaccines are less effective against the Delta variant. The Delta variant is prevalent in my community, cases are growing in my region, and while most of the people getting sick are not vaccinated, we have seen a handful of fully vaxxed people test positive. Given the data listed above, I'd say my clinic's experience is pretty typical.

In my country we can get tested for free with rapid antigen tests at pharmacies and test stations. also we get 5 tests per week to test ourselves at home.  
  
  
  
I'm a competitive athlete so through the recent lockdowns we were allowed to continue training and competing in a contact sport. As a result our team had an extensive testing protocol which involved getting tested at an official capacity (pharmacy, drive in testing stations, etc.) on all training days, days before games and days of games. That resulted in 5-6 weekly tests.  
  
6 weeks ago i tested positive at a pharmacy. After that i took all the necessary steps, called the government hotline, my club and got a pcr test done right away. The same day i got the positive ag result i tested myself 3 times, all positive. Tested my GF with the same batch twice, both negative.  
  
Next day the PCR test comes back negative. Tested myself again right away, positive again, tested my gf, negative again.  
  
Since that episode i've gotten weekly pcr tests and they've never been positive, but antigen tests are on and off, sometimes with varying results between nose and throat swabs. Tested my gf and brother with the same tests and those have been consistently negative. so far it's happened with RealyTech and Lungene manufactured tests, because these are the ones I've gotten for free.  
  
I've talked to doctors, pharmacists and no one has any clue what it could be. it sure as hell isn't covid.  
I'm just pissed off at this point so i had to find out if anyone knows anything or has had a similar experience.  
  
Just got my first Pfizer jab so it shouldn't bother me for too long, but it's still extremely frustrating.  
  
tl;dr: antigen tests mostly say i have had covid for 6 weeks (until now), but pcr tests all come back negative. why?",,,1624371961,{},h2nkwap,False,t3_o5gsgb,False,True,t3_o5gsgb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o5gsgb/daily_discussion_thread_june_22_2021/h2nkwap/,1624667732,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,GORbyBE,,,[],,,,text,t2_rrgdl,False,False,[],"TL;DR higher the vaccination rate and more measures to lower the spread, make mutations less likely to get out of control.

I'm not an expert, but as I understand it, viruses only get eradicated with high vaccination rates. Which rate is needed depends on how infective the virus is and how effective the vaccines are.

When a virus doesn't get eradicated, it inevitably mutates over time and existing vaccines may not protect us to the same extent. Even if they do, the risk for unvaccinated people may be higher because the virus can be more infective (it will spread better with a certain percentage of vaccinated people) or have more severe consequences.

The base reproduction number indicates how many people are infected by reach infected person on average of nobody is protected.
The effective reproduction number is influenced by protection given by measures like distancing, better hygiene and masks on one side and immunity (whether through infection or vaccination).

If a virus has a base reproduction number of 6 for example, it can infect a large percentage of the population very quickly.
If 80% of people are vaccinated with a vaccine that's 100% effective and nobody yet has immunity, the resulting reproduction number is 6 * 0.2 = 1.2. for numbers over 1, the number of cases grows exponentially. For these hypothetical numbers, the vaccination rate combined with the effectiveness of the vaccine isn't enough. You'd need more than 5/6 of the population with immunity. Alternatively, measures like distancing and masks make it harder for the virus to infect people. If those measures make it 40% harder for the virus to spread, that would change the resulting number to 1.2 * 0.6 = 0.72. This means it will gradually disappear.

Now if a certain variant is twice as infectious, those measures aren't enough (1.44 &gt; 1). That same strain with 90% immunity would still be under control. A strain that the vaccines don't protect against as well, will also result in a higher resulting number.

That is why vaccination rates are important, combined with other preventative measures. Measles for example has a very high reproduction number (12 - 18), which is why high immunity rates (95%+) are needed to keep it under control. As long as the resulting reproduction number is low enough mutations can't thrive and don't pose a significant risk.",,,1624371385,{},h2njouv,False,t3_o44201,False,True,t1_h2hc9l4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o44201/covid19_uks_longestknown_coronavirus_patient_dies/h2njouv/,1624667096,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

But to properly analyze the data (and I am willing to believe that the authors of this paper did this correctly) you have to do something to the effect of:

1. Divide everyone into groups (vaccinated/unvaccinated/partially vaccinated).  These groups will have different sizes.

2. Divide each of those groups into subgroups based on age and pre-existing conditions.

3. Then, for each subgroup, compute (#of deaths)/(# of people in group).  

4. Then you compare the vaccinated/unvaccinated/partially vaccinated subgroups. For a 96% efficacy, you should find that the above value is 96% smaller for the vaccinated group than the unvaccinated.

The reason the number of deaths is comparable between groups is that the vaccinated group is so much larger than the unvaccinated group, for the demographics that make up the vast majority of deaths.

It is not by chance that most of the Northern Hemisphere had major surges at the same time last year as weather cooled despite the major variants of concern that have higher rates of spread not becoming predominant until late winter. 

I am not sure where you are getting your 81,000 deaths estimate from for the 2017-2018 season.

I am unsure where masking and social distancing came into play with my comments. I was only stating that COVID is still killing more people than the flu.

The number one intervention right now should be vaccination - not continuing involuntary masking, social distancing, or restrictions.

If for example you are put in a small enclosed room with three others positive for covid, all giving you huge viral loads, for a few days. Even if you have been double vaxxed your immune system might still be overloaded from the huge viral load, and the virus overwhelms and wins. Thereby causing the effect in the brain the article suggests, leading to cognitive impairment.

So the key, after vaccination is that you now have some protection. But don't go putting yourself in huge viral load situations.

There does seem like there is the potential for some weird game theory-like situation where the combined decision of masking/vaccination comes into play, where one is known and the other is unknown.  

Depending on where you are in the country, wearing or not wearing the mask signals something while the vaccination decision is largely unknown but can be inferred. Imagine a 2x2 box of outcomes where it's masked/vaccinated, masked/unvaccinated, unmasked/vaccinated and unmasked/unvaccinated, and everybody in your peer group is trying to guess the unknown vaccination decision based on the masked decision and all the other variables they know about you and the local area.

Combine this with your usual office politics/drama and it could create some interesting/awkward/uncomfortable situations. Or it could all be in my head.

[Original Comment 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnzwri/daily_discussion_thread_april_10_2021/gu2011a/) - Vaccines and why variants aren't an issue.

Still totally worth checking out if you haven't already. Hasn't gone out of date yet. 

[Original Comment 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnzwri/daily_discussion_thread_april_10_2021/gu200jr/) - Additional stuff, thoughts. Much less worth checking out, but there are a few things in there that are still good. 

***

The vaccines are FREE in the US.  FREE FREE, not like ""Copay free"", like fuckin FREE. You don't need insurance. Go get one. Now.  Is there something stopping you from going to get one today? Talk to me about it, we'll get it worked out.  

If your doctor offers to give you the vaccine, take it, right away. It *will be absolutely free*. If you get a bill for the vaccine, call the cops or something, [it's *ILLEGAL* to charge you for the vaccine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nvzofq/government_warns_doctors_and_insurers_dont_bill/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

[Dose intervals might increase efficacy if extended past 3 or 4 weeks,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/mudvjd/questin_about_vaccine_intervals/gv58byt/) CDC says you have up to 42 days between doses (but that may be extended at some point).

**More variant stuff:**

Please don't say ""strain"" when you mean ""variant"". 

There [might not be much room left for SARS-CoV-2 to mutate](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/mpcc5k/weekly_question_thread_april_12_2021/gui5xn3/) into.

CDC [doesn't think](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n94zxm/no_evidence_that_pfizer_vaccine_needs_updating/) we'll need boosters/updates/etc for the mRNA vaccines.

Pfizer/Moderna work on the [Double/Triple/Indian Variant](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/n9q3q8/infection_and_vaccineinduced_neutralizing/).

Pfizer (and Moderna, probably) [works on B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 Variants](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/n5r2ry/effectiveness_of_the_bnt162b2_covid19_vaccine/)

T-Cells are really important.  Probably [more important than antibodies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/n5015i/highly_functional_cellular_immunity_in_sarscov2/)

Moderna works great against variants, even [seven months out from the second dose.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ne0wx8/durability_of_mrna1273induced_antibodies_against/)

**The vaccine is better than the disease:**

[Penis issues from Covid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nbh3ez/covid19_endothelial_dysfunction_can_cause/) (but [not the vaccine\).](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/narbhn/researchers_report_covid19_found_in_penile_tissue/)

[Neurological problems](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/na1eri/82_of_people_hospitalized_with_covid19_develop/) from Covid Infection (but not the vaccine).

[Loss of smell](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n88qwv/daily_discussion_thread_may_09_2021/gxiiusd/) is both [common](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6sj6g/daily_discussion_thread_may_07_2021/gxb6wah/) and way [more devastating](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n1efrf/joe_rogan_walks_back_antivaccination_comments/gwcvd0m/) than you'd think.  This does not occur with the vaccines.

Loss of smell [really sucks.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nqkiz5/cdc_touts_smell_training_after_covid19_but_it/) There's a whole subreddit about it ([anosmia](https://www.reddit.com/r/anosmia/comments/nkcta1/3_months_and_minimal_recovery/)), and the people who didn't lose their sense of smell from Covid are tired of everyone asking Covid-loss-of-smell questions.  

[Fewer symptoms = less spread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6sj6g/daily_discussion_thread_may_07_2021/gxbfbt1/)  Vaccines make you have fewer symptoms (*if* you get an infection after vaccination).

If you got infected, recovered, and then got at least one dose of Pfizer, you have immunity not only to multiple variants, but also SARS-CoV-1, the virus for which we named SARS in 2003.  Turns out much of [the ""breadth"" of that immunity is from the vaccine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/net65c/sarscov2_mrna_vaccines_induce_a_greater_array_of/)

&gt;COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. have dipped below 300 a day for the first time since the early days of the disaster in March 2020, while the drive to put shots in arms hit another encouraging milestone Monday: 150 million Americans fully vaccinated.

&gt;The coronavirus was the third leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But now, as the outbreak loosens its grip, it has fallen down the list of the biggest killers.

&gt;CDC data suggests that more Americans are dying every day from accidents, chronic lower respiratory diseases, strokes or Alzheimer’s disease than from COVID-19.

&gt;The U.S. death toll stands at more than 600,000, while the worldwide count is close to 3.9 million, though the real figures in both cases are believed to be markedly higher.

This is not necessarily true.

The spike protein is what attaches to our cells.  It is also what is targeted by the vaccines.  It needs to change enough to evade the vaccines but little enough to latch on to the lining of our respiratory tract.

It is not a foregone conclusion that it will be possible to completely evade the vaccine while still being able to do its thing.

People there need to be ok with taxes more .

Even if your money goes towards helping house some lazy person. If they were on the street they’re gonna commit crimes more . 

That in turn puts more strain on other tax paid facilities , from street sweeping to policing to healthcare . 

Sometimes spending money on one thing actually saves you in others .

And sometimes money being spent on what you view as freeloaders actually makes your life safer, happier and healthier .

I want everyone housed in my country because I think it would make our cities cleaner . 

Canada is sort of similar to the US in terms of social welfare , we too are against keeping people off the steeet when we don’t realize having a bunch of homeless people around actually makes society worse .

There are still large quantities of the world with extremely dense populations and areas that are not fully vaccinated. These variants thrive in those areas.

 a resistance to the antibodies from survivors in less than a year. That was with just a few variants (from the original strain) running around. If you don't think, with our current actions &amp; choices,  that it could easily do that (or worse) again. There's something wrong with you.

COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. have dipped below 300 a day for the first time since the early days of the disaster in March 2020, while the drive to put shots in arms approached another encouraging milestone Monday: 150 million Americans fully vaccinated.  
  
The coronavirus was the third leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But now, as the outbreak loosens its grip, it has fallen down the list of the biggest killers.  
  
CDC data suggests that more Americans are dying every day from accidents, chronic lower respiratory diseases, strokes or Alzheimer’s disease than from COVID-19.  
  
The U.S. death toll stands at more than 600,000, while the worldwide count is close to 3.9 million, though the real figures in both cases are believed to markedly higher.  
  
About 45% of the U.S. population has been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Over 53% of Americans have received at least one dose of vaccine. But U.S. demand for shots has slumped, to the disappointment of public health experts.  
  
New cases are running at about 11,400 a day on average, down from over a quarter-million per day in early January. Average deaths per day are down to about 293, according to Johns Hopkins University, after topping out at over 3,400 in mid-January.  
  
In New York, which suffered mightily in the spring of 2020, Gov. Andrew Cuomo tweeted on Monday that the state had 10 new deaths. At the height of the outbreak in the state, nearly 800 people a day were dying from the coronavirus.  
  
Some states are faring worse than others. Missouri leads the nation in per-capita COVID-19 cases and is fourth behind California, Florida and Texas in the number of new cases per day over the past week despite its significantly smaller population.

And we are securing a contract for the flexibility we need to procure a new generation of adapted COVID-19 vaccines, that are effective against variants. This will enable us to protect citizens from new variants of the virus.” Stella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: “As agreed with all Health Ministers, we are securing a diversified portfolio of future vaccines, with yet another mRNA vaccine that has already proven its worth. We must be ready for any scenario and think one step ahead. Our portfolio approach has clearly showed its value and we will continue on this path, including by looking at other technologies.” Today's contract with Moderna builds upon the broad portfolio of vaccines that will ensure Europe has access to up to 4.4 billion doses, once all the vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective.

This isn't anything written in stone, but the risks the government is willing to take here are far less than those of the US government.

For example, our last hard lockdown that ended a week or so ago applied to *everyone* in the applicable area regardless of whether or not they are vaccinated. It's kind of an all or nothing ordeal here, not an every man for himself approach.

There were times we could travel around the country freely, and I'm sure that'll be back on the table in the next week or two. We were also able to go to/from New Zealand for a good while (and I think it recently opened back up). Currently we don't have to wear masks outdoors, don't have to stay at home, etc. And I'm well aware of the status of things in the States as I talk to American family, co-workers, and friends every day. I know you don't need masks anymore, can travel, etc.

I know everybody wants to do right by their kids but the numbers don’t lie: covid is not particularly dangerous to children. In total, 322 kids (17 and younger) have died from covid in the US. That’s out of 74 million kids. The odds of your kid dying from covid are extremely small. It’s comparable to the odds of dying from pneumonia or influenza, two diseases you probably never lost sleep over before. Yes of course there are other poor health outcomes besides death for covid but the same is true of pneumonia and flu, and again, you probably never lost sleep over those. 

Humans are bad at analyzing risk. Covid is literally tens of thousands of times more dangerous for the very old than it is for kids. We all have to take a deep breath and recognize that covid just isn’t a serious threat for children.

Their conclusion is
""This study suggests that both the BNT162b2 vaccine and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection are effective against both subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection and other COVID-19–related outcomes. Moreover, the effectiveness seems similar for both cohorts. This puts into question the need to vaccinate recent (up to six month) previously-infected individuals.""

Note that, just like the long term vaccine efficacy studies, they can only say 6 months because there was only six months of data available. You are correct that it doesn't focus on the Delta variant, which is why the article mentions next the method used by the immune system to protect against variants. 

The cell mediated (t-cell) response is what protects against the variants and is true for both natural immunity and vaccines.  More info is assembled and linked in this article:
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/covid-19-variants-vaccines_l_607d86ace4b058846f274868

The main point in your post, that the vaccines targeted the spike protein of the Delta variant is a false premise.  The vaccines targeted the spike protein in original COVID, not variants. The spike protein is part of the mutation in Delta, which is why t-cell response is so important.  

The issue we are going to run into with data is that non-hospitalized COVID infections after vaccination are no longer counted in our numbers, but recovered individuals who test positive ARE counted as reinfected, even if they are not symptomatic or hospitalized.  Using this method will always show a higher number of reinfections, even if the true reinfections rate is equivalent.

2. There is a large and growing body of evidence that the vaccines significantly lower actual infection risk and lower viral load if one were to become “infected,” both of which are factors that significantly reduce spread. The “it just stops symptoms” thing is a false narrative from early in the vaccination campaign when there simply wasn’t enough information yet to say one way or another. In my opinion, the messaging was quite poor, even though it was rooted in erring on the side of caution.

Wearing a condom alone is most likely good enough, but maybe you REALLY don't want to get pregnant and risk it.  For most people, a condom is sufficient protection and the vaccine is sufficient protection to not worry about it.

2) False.  The initial studies only looked at symptoms and this narrative is a holdover from that.  The vaccines reduce spread.

3) I've worn it for short periods of time while driving.  It's a minor inconvenience to wear it and if you're doing it for long periods of time it's like glasses or a hat.  You still realize it's there but sometimes you're just not thinking about it.  I've gotten in the car, started heading out on the road, then remembered it was on and took it off.

Yes, the variants of concern have become more infectious as this pandemic has progressed.

The original coronavirus was infectious with an R0 of around 2.5-3.5, so, without mitigation, each infected person on average spreads it to 2.5-3.5 other people.  In comparison, seasonal flu has an R0 of around 1.5.

The Alpha variant is more infectious, in that the R0 likely was 3.5 - 4.5.  Delta is more infectious than Alpha by around 50%, with an R0 of around 6.

Think of what an R0 of around 6 means.  If your mitigations (so-so lockdown, cloth masks, etc.) can knock the original virus down 2/3 of transmission, so you wind up with an R of around 1 (slow burning pandemic), those same mitigations against Alpha gets you to an R of around 1.5 (much like flu), and Delta to an R of around 2 (much like unmitigated original strain).

So my assumption is that if 10% of infected unvaccinated people with the delta variant go to the hospital, only 4% (and 8% of AZ) of the 10% ie. 0.4% of vaccinated people go to the hospital. 

But: 

* Most vaccinated people are more vulnerable so I'd expect that in the 'natural' distribution of the vaccine this is more likely to say; 10% of 30 year olds go to hospital as a result of the Delta variant and 0.4% of 80 year olds go to hospital once vaccinated. 
* Assuming you are less likely to catch the virus if you are vaccinated your overall chance fo catching the virus AND going to hospital is further reduced by whatever factor you have to not catch the virus. 
* Assuming you are more likely to live with other vaccinated people the R-factor in your environment is likely further reduced. 

I'm not sure if they correct for the 1st point but I'd love to see the overall benefit estimated if they did because I'd be surprised - given the current mortality rates - if this was not at least 99% less likely to be actually hospitalized no matter which vaccination you took.",,,1624374282,{},h2nptyl,False,t3_o5lc6t,False,True,t3_o5lc6t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o5lc6t/vaccines_highly_effective_against_hospitalisation/h2nptyl/,1624670375,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

How would you interpolate from that to the general population, make assumptions on the likelihood of those vaccinated to catch the virus is altered not only because they would likely be surrounded by more vaccinated people than those who are not vaccinated.

And if they did this why would they not state that the study was based on whatever actual vaccinated population they assumed to be the baseline that could have been infected.

Protection moderate to severe disease is the goal of any vaccine, NOT the infection. After a year or two, even best mRNA vaccine will not protected you from infection unless you got another booster shot. A lot of people on this forum and popular media don't seem to understand the basic of virology and is always worry about efficacy against infection while we should be concern about efficacy against moderate/severe disease.  
  
""Not clear to me why boosters are needed. So far most of the vaccines appear to prevent severe disease with all the variants. Infection is not prevented, only moderate to severe disease. That is how most human vaccines work. I think there is a tendency to extrapolate from influenza virus where a decrease in antibody neutralization titer against current strains triggers reformulation of the vaccine. But SARS-CoV-2 is not influenza virus. I think we need to observe how vaccinated people respond to infection and keep track of disease severity. If it seems like more severe disease is occurring in vaccinated people, then we might change the vaccine. But remember that T cells protect against severe disease and their epitopes do not change in the variants.""  
  
""Those studies were done shortly after vaccination when antibody levels are very high. In a year the serum and mucosal antibody levels will be very low and will not prevent infection. However the memory response will kick in in 2-3 days and prevent extensive replication, shedding, and disease.""  
  
""The benefit of the inactivated vaccines is that they contain other viral proteins, not just spike. Those other viral proteins have T cell epitopes which can only be beneficial and help prevent disease. The need for booster probably comes from not having enough inactivated virus, or it not generating a good memory response.""

We analyze the tone of COVID-19 related English-language news articles written since January 1, 2020. Ninety one percent of stories by U.S. major media outlets are negative in tone versus fifty four percent for non-U.S. major sources and sixty five percent for scientific journals. The negativity of the U.S. major media is notable even in areas with positive scientific developments including school re-openings and vaccine trials. Media negativity is unresponsive to changing trends in new COVID-19 cases or the political leanings of the audience. U.S. major media readers strongly prefer negative stories about COVID-19, and negative stories in general. Stories of increasing COVID-19 cases outnumber stories of decreasing cases by a factor of 5.5 even during periods when new cases are declining. Among U.S. major media outlets, stories discussing President Donald Trump and hydroxychloroquine are more numerous than all stories combined that cover companies and individual researchers working on COVID-19 vaccines.",,,1624378240,{},h2nyirl,True,t3_o5qpfv,False,True,t3_o5qpfv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o5qpfv/why_is_all_covid19_news_bad_news/h2nyirl/,1624675015,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
[],,Molire,,,[],,,,text,t2_174cr0,False,True,[],"They can choose what to do with their bodies even if it kills millions of people. Every person who has died from COVID-19 died because someone with COVID-19 infected them. Today, a cumulative total of about 3.9 million children, women, and men worldwide have died from COVID-19. If each one of the dead got their COVID-19 infection from a different person, the dead arguably were killed by about 3.9 million other people who infected them with COVID-19.    
         
Some people infected with COVID-19 arguably might not infect others, but arguably many do, including superspreaders who can infect a large number of persons, as in the case of the happy, friendly, healthy-looking, and well-dressed person who unknowingly was infected with COVID-19 and was traveling on a crowded train with a lot of people partying from Washington DC to New York.   
            
After the superspreader reached his or her destination, the person became visibly sick and tested positive for COVID-19. A team of medical investigators and contact tracers quickly found, identified, and tested more than 50 people the superspreader had contacted and unknowingly infected during the train trip.  
               
Nobody knows how many infected strangers, neighbors, coworkers, family members, and others might be circulating among us, while they appear to be happy, friendly, beautiful, or handsome, but, unknowingly are infected and spreading a virus that can sicken, hospitalize, kill, or cause long-haul COVID in any of us having any contact with the unknowingly infected person.  
            
Arguably, not all persons infected with COVID-19 are superspreaders. Some infected persons knowingly or unknowingly might infect 0, 1, 2, or some other number of persons.    
              
One thing about COVID-19 that we all can be certain about is that before we can become infected, before we can become sick, before we can become hospitalized, before we can have an airtube snaked into our mouths and down into our lungs so we don't suffocate while struggling to breathe and lying unconscious in an ICU bed, before we can die from COVID-19, or before we can develop long-haul COVID, we will have to be infected by a stranger or someone familiar, who is knowingly or unknowingly infected with COVID-19.  
                
That's the main requirement for getting COVID-19. Someone has to infect you, and that someone can be any unknowingly infected friend or any unknowingly infected stranger. Flip a coin.     
           
Sadly, I have observed that some friends and relatives don't seem to be as upset about the death of a loved one who died from COVID-19 if they think one of themselves was the person who infected the deceased. Like it's OK if someone who was recently known to be infected with COVID-19 realizes they infected a person within their own family, and that person died from COVID-19 nineteen days later.  
           
They act like as long as a friend or relative was the one who infected the deceased, it's not so bad. It's kind of OK. It's just one of those quiet family things. It will go away after a while.  
                
But, what might be as sad is not knowing how many strangers someone infected before that someone realized he or she was infected or before he or she tested positive, and how many of those strangers died from COVID-19 that someone had given them. It seems to me that there may be no shortage of people who know they were infected, but seem to have little or no concern about how many strangers or other people they might have infected, and how many of those other people ended up with a $200 thousand hospital bill, ended up dead in a  hospital, or ended up suffering from the agony, pain, and indescribable hell of unending suffering from long-haul COVID.",,,1624378227,{},h2nyhqc,True,t3_o54gmb,False,True,t1_h2ndcoa,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o54gmb/25_of_young_adults_most_likely_wont_get_covid19/h2nyhqc/,1624675001,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

They use that high death count for vaccinated on that day as the reason for why freedom day (remove covid restrictions) in UK is postponed from June to July just few days ago.

Again, THE STUDY itself included 1 dose as part of the ""vaccinated"" group, which I gave, but then I, personally, made sure to note the 14+ days after 2 doses group.  I did this in the comment to which you objected.

I was standing in line at the cash register and suddenly my vision started going grey. I squatted on my knees and it came back but I still felt like I was going to pass out any moment.

I stayed there on the curb for a good couple minutes before regaining enough energy to get up and walk to my car which was less than 30m away.

Again, this is an underexplored area of research. At this time, it's clear that being unvaccinated is generally bad and there are a lot of questions about just how bad it might be.

My county went from plateauing at 600 cases a day from the start of February through early April to then plummeting down to less than 30 cases a day by the end of May, which was a period of *loosening* restrictions and almost exactly corresponds with a few weeks after the vaccine became widely available.

1) Even if you don't get hospitalizated, you can get long COVID, which could be months of fatigue, loss of taste, etc. If you are very active, long COVID could put you on your ass for months since you lose your endurance. 

2) Most COVID cases are symptomatic. If you did not get symptoms you most likely did not get COVID. Further, the vaccines provide much better coverage against COVID than previous infection. 

3) COVID cases may not stay low forever, and if they start to increase it is probably too late to get the vaccine since it takes 6-7 weeks to be effective. 

4) Do you go to bars, restaurants, clubs, etc? If so, you are at risk from COVID in these spaces. Also, vaccinated people can spread it, it is just less common. 

5) The rate of myocarditis is still much lower than the rate of severe COVID in young, unvaccinated people. 

6) 2 days (1 after each shot) of feeling bad is much better than COVID which lasts for 10+ days. Also, it sounds like you have a job that gives you good benefits, so you can just take off. 

7) No vaccine has ever had effects that take months/years to show. The mRNA leaves your body a couple days later. This is impossible, not unlikely. 

8) I'm not sure the point of this? I don't want to get into a political debate but not getting vaccinated only hurts you, not the politicians. They are vaccinated and immune, and aren't personally hurt if you get infected. 

I hope you decide to get vaccinated! The more people that do lessens the risk of spread in our entire community and bring us closer to ending the pandemic worldwide. Also, since you are younger, your antibody levels will be higher than in older people. Younger people are the best to get vaccinated!

I used to drive down the freeway and see my family that lives an hour away once or twice a month if not more. I enjoyed going to bars with my old friends and drinking a Saturday away . I miss taking my girlfriend out to nightclubs to dance  .  Hell when the world lockdown I used one day of my Disneyland 3 day pass and  those other 2 days i kind of assume are gone and I wouldn't feel comfortable using them now anyway.  


I've spent the majority of the past year largely locked in my apartment , sparsely heading out and freaking the fuck out if I forget the mask  and walk more than two steps away from my front door.   


I need a  mental therapist but I got laid off so I can't afford a mental therapist and so I just got a new job and I hope with my first real check in months I can afford mental support.  


The amount of people happy with lockdowns has to be very very small I don't think mot lockdown supporters WANT to be locked down . You do it to hopefully reduce spread, and help manage those most vulnerable amongst the population and those communities . The rest of us who are vaccinated intermingling and possibly spreading the virus because we want to pretend it's gone and bringing it to those people who are more vulnerable than us is not acceptable in my eyes.   


Everybody keeps pretending like most of the country is vaccinated and that's not true a significant portion have accepted and pursued vaccination but not everyone and large pockets are gonna be ravaged by delta , delta plus, and the inevitable delta ultra super max and the reason we lockdown is to try to as we did at the beginning try to curb the spread...you know what won't curb the spread?   


Opening everything and resuming life so that the antivaxxers intermingle among us and then we're right back where we are and if God forbid some super resistant variant develops all of this is for nothing.   


They say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure , Let's work to prevent covid from decimaitng us like it did for all of 2020 .  I feel like we're in groundhogs day and people keep rooting to dive back into opening everything up so that we get to see an other wave happen . It's ludicrous to me and just like before some shit is going down across the world and we pretend it won't show up on our doorstep like it has EVERY OTHER SINGLE TIME  


I and most people do not want lockdowns  we accept them because the alternative is a nightmare and you will never get ""normal "" back if we don't work to preserve what little progress we've made.   


Australia lockdowns were far more restrictive than ours and they suffered fewer casualties and have managed the virus infinitely better than all of us  , and returned to a version of normalcy most of us envy for longer periods than most of us have seen in the last year.

Most people are healthy and won't suffer from lack of health coverage. But in the pool of people who have life threatening diseases, which is much much smaller than the total population (although I don't know the exact number), 45 000 of them died directly from lack of healthcare.

For reference, ""only"" 3 000 000 Americans die every year. Lots of those are due to old age and accidents and a few other factors, but even then, 45 000 out of 3 000 000 is a much higher and scarier number than 45 000 out of 300 000 000. 

And finally, you have to consider that those deaths are preventable. Cancer is a big killer, half a million a year, and we spend an enormous amount of resources to lower that number, without much effect unfortunately. Same situation with heart disease, all those deaths are hard to prevent. But universal healthcare is a known solution that is proven effective in every country in the world and could prevent those 45 000 deaths, and according to many economists, do it while spending even less money than currently.

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

Detecting spike proteins is also what the instructions in the vaccines do.  In order for the virus to mutate in a way that would hide its spike proteins from your immune system, it would also lose its ability to latch onto cells, and in the process become a virus that cannot infect humans.

The only ""choice"" it has is to try to thread the needle and find the least-detectable spike proteins that still allow it to latch onto cells properly. Too far in either direction makes it either a virus that can't affect humans, or can't spread to other humans, thus ending its life cycle.

The Delta variant is about as close to ideal as it gets, finding the efficient middle ground between the two extremes.  And it's STILL not able to evade the vaccines.

My wife and I both work full-time and 18 months before the pandemic we decided to take a risk by purchasing the worst house in our neighborhood and fixing it up from top to bottom to be a rental in order to eventually help put my kids through college. 

With two little kids at home working full-time I spent countless hours (mostly weekends and from 9pm-3am) with my own hands fixing it up (and basically a year of my salary on supplies) from top to bottom and turned it into a clean beautiful rental property.   I can’t tell you how many people in the neighborhood have told me that they were so happy that somebody took this house I made it into something beautiful. Right as I was getting ready to rent it out the pandemic hit. Luckily after waiting a few months a friend of mine who is looking for a place ended up becoming my tenant. It’s been an amazing experience and I feel very blessed to have the situation work out the way that it did. With that being said I would be devastated frustrated and heartbroken with immeasurable stress on my marriage if I had a tenant in there who literally just decided to not pay me a dollar.  This would be  especially frustrating when there is almost a year of unemployment benefits that were amped up with $600 plus a number of stimulus checks that I’ve been doled out along the way.   

I get that people had hard times but to just be like eff those landlords seems to be a symptom of this pandemic that is frustrating.   Everyone says eff the teachers it’s the students, or eff the students it’s the teachers.   Or screw the young or screw the old.  This whole thing has taught us that we are intertwined quite a bit.  

Even if you look at the moratorium on evictions as something that was necessary I remember reading articles and hearing people complain about the fact that landlords would not sign new contracts and leases with people who hadn’t paid them for the better part of the year. The whole point of a contract is that you were entering into it in good faith with an understanding that there would be repercussions On both sides of the terms were not met. On what planet should someone be expected to re-enter into a contract where is someone has already shown that they will not fulfill their part of the obligations. Obviously there are predatory landlords that are pieces of garbage but let’s not forget that the trope of the tenant takes advantage doesn’t come from a fantasy either.",,,1624364483,{},h2n6zmv,False,t3_o58g1y,False,False,t1_h2mkev6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o58g1y/california_to_pay_off_unpaid_rent_accrued_during/h2n6zmv/,1624660221,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Taipei, June 22 (CNA) Taiwan will announce Wednesday whether it plans to extend the current Level 3 COVID-19 alert beyond June 28 when it expires, after it reported under 100 new cases for the second consecutive day on Tuesday, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).

The CECC on Tuesday reported 79 new cases of COVID-19, all but one of which were domestically transmitted, as well as six deaths, raising talk of whether current restrictions could be fully or partially lifted.

At a press briefing, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said the CECC has been holding discussions with public health experts and local government leaders regarding the alert, which was issued nationwide on May 19 and has since been extended twice.

The consensus is that ""there should continue to be a consistent policy nationwide,"" Chen said, adding that a formal announcement on the subject will be made on Wednesday.

After averaging over 400 daily infections from mid-May through early June, daily case numbers dropped into the 200s from June 7 to 12, then into the 100s from June 13-20, and were in the double digits on both Monday and Tuesday.

The CECC has expressed caution about lifting the restrictions, however, given that only 6.76 percent of Taiwan's population had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine shot as of Tuesday morning.


The 78 domestic cases on Tuesday included 43 in New Taipei and 25 in Taipei, which continue to be the ""high-risk"" zones of the current outbreak, while infections in other areas have become more ""sporadic,"" Chen said.

Outside of those two cities, Nantou reported three new cases, while Keelung confirmed two, and Miaoli, Changhua, Taoyuan, Taichung and Hsinchu County each reported one.

Of the 10 cases outside of New Taipei and Taipei, only two had unknown sources of infection, the CECC said.

The one imported case was that of a Taiwanese man in his 50s, who tested positive after returning from Indonesia on Sunday, the CECC said.


Meanwhile, the six deaths reported Tuesday were three men and three women, in their 50s to their 80s, who passed away between June 17 and June 21.
The new cases brought the total in the country to 14,157, of which over 12,700 are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 cases in a single day.
To date, 575 people in Taiwan have died from COVID-19, including 563 since May 15.

A Level 3 alert is the second-highest in Taiwan's four-tier COVID-19 alert scale. Under the alert, schools have been closed and many companies have shifted to remote work or staggered working schedules.

People are also required to wear masks at all times when they leave their homes, and are banned from having indoor gatherings larger than four people and outdoor gatherings larger than nine people.

Two common colds (not covid, not RSV, just plain jane rhinovirus) three weeks apart have necessitated ambulances, oxygen, bipap masks, and this last time there was concern he'd need a breathing tube. He needed to be sedated a lot of the time with the mask because he was panicking. This isn't a particularly uncommon condition, he's a little on the young side I think but under the age of 12 there are lots of kids with this.

We're starting him on asthma meds now but they're not always useful for kids his age. Asthma triggers can be a little unpredictable, in his case it's been respiratory viruses - covid falls into that category. The effect may be the same as the rhinoviruses, maybe less, maybe more. I don't know and I don't really want to experiment. I know he can't avoid getting sick, but my point is there's one respiratory virus circulating out there that we could squash if we chose to, and people are choosing not to based on a risk-benefit analysis that only includes themselves. Even if it's not a huge deal for someone personally wouldn't it just be nice to have one less virus floating around making ANYONE sick, even if not you personally? Fortunately my state and county seems to have decided that yes, that is a good idea, so fortunately I don't think at this point there's much chance of him getting it, but that's just the luck of where we are.

Assuming your stat is correct, that 10% of overall hospitalizations still represents a much larger number than would, say, 10% of vaxed admissions because so few vaxed people even get infected to begin with. Put another way, 10% of 1,000 infections is bigger than 10% of 10 vaxed infections.

Most people who hit the hospital after vaccination were infected before the vax or shortly after but before their body could develop immunity (within that 2 week post-vax time period).

The scary thing about having a decent proportion of the people vaccinated, but not *enough* people, is that if vaccinated people become infected and can also transmit the virus, we are selecting for more infectious variants. Errors in reproduction, and recombination, can cause higher or lower virulence (severity of symptoms), higher or lower rate of transmission, including possible accumulation of genetic tools.

During flu season, this is of greater concern, because they can exchange genetic material.

Currently it is *not supported* that Covid 19 can insert itself into human DNA, but genetics isn't as clear cut as one might think. 
Theoretically it is *possible*, based on the mechanisms of genetic replication, for DNA to be synthesized from a segment of viral RNA, and for that DNA to be mistakenly inserted into the human DNA. It is *improbable*, but the more hosts, the more opportunities for the 1/100 million chance event to occur. That doesn't mean that the insertion would necessarily do anything, depending on the size of the segment and where it inserts.
If Covid 19 ever got ahold of the coding for an enzyme to ""intentionally"" insert itself into our genome, or if someone is concurrently infected with a virus that contains that mechanism and recombination were to occur, we would be in huge trouble.

Once you have that belief, then why bother with a vaccine? It's just a hassle. Would you waste a weekend, or take two days off from work, recovering from the vaccine side effects to deal with the common cold?

On top of that, a lot of people, especially with lower levels of education, don't understand the scientific process at all. So all they see is the vaccine was pushed out in record time and get skeptical of it, as they don't understand (or care to understand) how the different testing phases go for FDA approval.

So, to these people, not only is it an unnecessary hassle (side effects) for what is essentially the common cold, it might be dangerous because they rushed it through.  It's not like people are taking every cue from Trump -- people still make their own decisions based on the info they have, and Trump himself being vaccinated is only one piece of information.

To add on to /u/kwo3660, the issue with this is the sample size of the 2 groups. Over 95% of people 65+ in the UK* are fully vaxxed, as well as the vast majority of other immunocompromised/vulnerable populations. So comparing these groups (likely where all the deaths are from) where the vaccinated outnumber the unvaccinated somewhere around 20:1 and still seeing less than half coming from the vaccinated group is very good.

Some back of the napkin math is showing that people are 23x more likely to die without the vaccine than with it, assuming 95% vaccinated in the vulnerable groups and this single cherry picked stat of 45% of England Delta deaths last week were in vaccinated individuals.
