In some cases fragile people are likely to die in a certain year, and if they catch any disease, this is going to be the year of their death.  To clarify:  while Flu and Covid and Colds and Measles and so on can kill, if you eliminated the other diseases, you aren't going to eliminate the exact number who died of those diseases, because a certain ratio will still die but for other reasons (because they are susceptible/fragile.)

With COVID, because we have really good data from many countries on how many people die overall a year, then it becomes easier to see that the event of COVID increased death burden, and far more substantially than those counted as COVID deaths. (In the US , a few weeks ago we passed 1 million excess deaths: i.e. 1 million deaths more than should have happened, since COVID began.) 

Ultimately COVID is the reason they died, even if it's a secondary reason.  Many people are going to have a desire to say that the secondary COVID reason is due to psychological overreaction or unexpected effects.  At a macro scale however, whatever the COVID primary or secondary reasons are, ultimately whatever just happened caused kids under the age of 18 to die in lower than expected numbers and everyone else to die in much higher than expected numbers.

Labor unions by and large are supportive of the mandates, provided that employers obey meet and confer rules. We're going to negotiate over documentation requirements for exemptions (that's the big one), what will happen to unvaccinated employees, how long they're on job protected unpaid leave if they don't comply, when they can terminate, whether or not an exemption denial is grievable, who pays for testing, etc.

It's going to be complicated, and that complication is compounded since my state has its own OSHA, and they have 30 days to release their own standards. They will be functionally the same as the federal standards but I'm sure there will be something in there that's not in the federal version.

I was expecting this, but not for another 3 months. I just spent 3 weeks negotiating a voluntary vaccination incentive with them, and we were a week away from pulling the trigger. I'd have gotten a bunch of extra sick leave for employees, as well as cash payments.

In light of the news this morning, I fully expect them to bail on that. Disappointing, but unavoidable. Can't blame them for that.

You're right, our numbers are a lot more accurate. Especially if you look at places like Africa were basically nothing is being counted. However, unlike many poorer nations we are uniquely capable of doing better with the resources we have at hand. We just didn't because of poor response. 

I won't deny obesity as a serious problem in the United States, it definitely is. I have many friends in medical fields around the world. One of the interesting things we have all noted about the United States is that we don't support preventative care to stop medical problems like eating healthy or life style changes. What more proof do you need then the typical hospital food given out which tends to consist of mostly carbs and processed foods. We tend to hand out pills and do surgeries instead of really focusing on making changes. Many European cardiologists focus much harder on teaching their patients preventative measures before a bad medical problem happens. Here cardiologist spend large amounts of time in surgery for instance instead. The medical system here is not about preventative practices just patches and making money. That's one of the problems allowing obesity to get by. Again, talking to many of my friends from other countries we can all agree that people from the Untied States are very bull headed. We always know what's best. My brother is morbidly obese and knows what he needs to do but refuses and says he'll die some day anyway... 

I think when it comes to obesity we need to have programs that work with people instead of just going to the doctor stepping on a scale and then telling someone they are overweight eat better. A program that worked with these people through their everyday lives would be much more effective. Now I know many would say they just need to eat better and exercise. I would obviously agree as someone who does all that. However, looking at the other side of the leaf what is the difference between a smoker and someone that cannot control their cravings? These problems are controlled by the same regions of the brain. Many people will admit it's hard to stop smoking but not recognize that about eating. There are studies coming out now showing brain structure and genetics play a role in obesity as well. It's not as simple as many of use non-obese people think.

Therefore, looking at what covid showed us about obesity we should implement programs to help people with it step by step and make it widespread. Economically this could save the country a lot of money as there would be far less sick people for sure.

But only 36% of deaths are in this group. 68% of deaths are in the 10% non-vaccinated. Almost 7X overrepresentation. Cambodia is using Chinese SinoVac / Sinopharm.

A couple of things that may distort the numbers compared to a Western perspective.

1. Cambodia is not so geriatric (average age: 24yo) as the West. Perhaps young people have a higher/lower risk of breakthrough infection compared to older people? I don't know.
2. Many older Cambodians are still traumatized from the Communist holocaust from the late 70s. These people may be less likely to see government assistance, and since they're older (and in bad mental health) more vulnerable. So the non-vaccinated may skew towards the more vulnerable, and the effectiveness of the vaccine overstated. I don't know.

Anyway, my take-aways. 1) The 90% effectiveness of the vaccines which I have seen reported seem to be about right. 2) Some people's (who are absolutely in no way at all associated with Westen multinational medical corporations' marketing departments) attempts to try to cast doubt on Chinese &amp; Russian vaccines have been wrong, and extremely irresponsible, if not downright evil.",,,,1636088171,{},hjdovoc,False,t3_qmeyn0,False,True,t3_qmeyn0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qmeyn0/daily_discussion_thread_november_04_2021/hjdovoc/,1636331184.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What you are referring to above is the amount of liquid in a dose.

Moderna original doses are 100 micrograms of mRNA in a .5 ml suspension that includes other ingredients like stabilizers, etc. The booster dose for moderna is .25 ml instead of .5, which cuts the active ingredient mRNA down to 50 micrograms.

Pfizer’s original dose was 30 micrograms of mRNA, given in an injection of .3 ml total, including the mRNA and all other ingredients, and the booster dose is the exact same.",,,,1636125557,{},hjfargg,False,t3_qn36d6,False,False,t1_hjf8eix,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qn36d6/study_shows_dramatic_decline_in_effectiveness_of/hjfargg/,1636362179.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;WASHINGTON — The federal government has canceled its contract with a troubled Covid-19 vaccine manufacturer that ruined millions of doses and had to halt production for months after regulators raised serious quality concerns.

&gt;The decision marks a stark reversal of fortune for the politically connected contractor, Maryland-based Emergent BioSolutions, and an abandonment by the government of a deal that was supposed to be a centerpiece of Operation Warp Speed.

&gt;Early in the pandemic, the government decided to bank on the company to be the sole domestic manufacturer of the Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines. But this March, testing found that a batch of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine had been contaminated, and Emergent agreed to pause manufacturing after an inspection uncovered a host of problems at its facility in Baltimore’s Bayview area.

&gt;The termination of the contract, disclosed on Thursday by Emergent executives during a call with investors, was the result of negotiations that began after the government earlier this year stopped making payments under the deal, which was awarded in May 2020 and was worth more than $600 million. Emergent will now forgo roughly $180 million of that amount, according to company disclosures.

(This is a very abbreviated version of what goes into a clinical trial. Anyone with sufficient background should be able to add 'actually they do ....' and they'd be right. I'm only giving a very broad overview)

The data scientist sees only the results. They are involved in developing the study, to make sure the data collected will be usable, but from there on, they're in the dark about the data until they get a final report. 

The data isn't (or shouldn't be) entered into Excel. It's entered into a database created for this study. Usually the person entering the data isn't involved in collecting the data. This is done to ensure there's no bias when entering it. The person entering the data should also be blinded so they don't know what treatment the patient was getting (again, so there's no bias in reporting).

So. What SHOULD happen is:
Person 1 - performs study. 
Person 2 - documents what happens into source material (report forms, clinical notes,  etc(
Person 3 - takes notes and puts it into specific database
Person 4 - gets results from database 

What likely happened was person 1, 2 and 3 could have all been the same person, possibly with an agenda. By the time it got to person 4, they trusted the system and just looked at the data. 

(That's not to say there aren't many other points to catch this. The 'end data' should include the numerator anyway.

Shaming tends to push people away and further into bad problems. Negative feedback does motivate some, like myself, but I've found for most it's much less effective.

For some that cannot escape obesity due to health factors that prevent them from extensive movement, shaming them is not helpful.

1. If you were stuck working in a high risk enviornment, you dealt with increased stress, increased risk, either got sick yourself or saw people you know get sick, had increasingly agitated customers/patients/clients, and may or may not have gotten some extra financial support for it. However, it's just as likely your financial situation got much worse and you lost benefits. Your emotional health took a major toll.
2. If you were a student, your life changed substantially. Social interaction changed heavily, your work life (if you had one) became far more chaotic, or you were entirely locked out of all your old cliques/social activities. Sports, events, meetups, gatherings, classes, extraciricular activities all were majorly disrupted for at least 6 months, if not a full 18 months in most cases. This is not good for one's mental health no matter how you slice it, even if you are the introverted type.
3. If you are the reckless type, people around you became increasingly stressed and agitated by the culture wars over these issues. People you were close to may have died, and you yourself or your family may have experienced serious setbacks from COVID. Sure, you might bear a big chunk of responsibility in that, but it doesn't change the fact that the life of these people would've also become chaotic and filled with disease, death, destruction, disruption, and a constant battle. Not good for mental health either.
4. If you are the cautious introvert who locked down, you held down for 18 months only to watch as the world has torn itself apart and as we experience some major setbacks. Global movements in response to all this caused a lot of chaos, both in the US and Europe. Social media changed and influenced people you know.

An absolutely horrible time for the mental health of people in this category.  


And that's not even really going into the sheer death and loss of millions of people worldwide, and sickness and suffering of the survivors. All of which directly impacted people in all 4 categories.

I just observed usually. However, since COVID it's too overwhelming obvious politics played way to much into health related problems. It was extremely poorly handled and then brushed off. 

People say one man cannot make a difference, but that one man could lead to many others making poor decisions based on ones lead. 

If the most powerful person in the world says there is a big problem and it needs to be dealt with people will listen. 

A lot of it came down to money and what I would call the ""strong man stance"". 

Patients ending up in ER for COVID cost something between $20,000-75,000 on average. Not to mention the disability needed later on if they don't recover. Plus, long COVID and those in the younger generation that will be lost from the workforce forever. That right there is a huge impact on the economy in the future. However we had a leader that thought all about short term economics to make himself look good but not the long term economics. I think it would take a much stronger leader to setup a country for future success, even if it doesn't make them look amazing in the moment, compared to short term glory. Many loved the short term economics with trump and praised him but they didn't realize how much we will be paying for it in the future. 

The stance put off by Trump, the Brazilian president, and Boris Johnson all were that of it's not a big deal. Yet all these countries fell short of a good outcome. In the animal world the strongest organisms all have genetic weaknesses still. If that weaknesses is exposed no matter how strong the organism the outcome may be grim, but that's why humans have medicine and higher thinking right? We use these to beat our genetic deficiency and survive because we're ""smart"". However, that obviously doesn't work when we don't follow through. I would say the ""strong man stance"" is that of survival of the fittest. Yet, that doesn't work well for humans as a species because we are extremely empathetic. Many realized that when one of their loved ones died. Trump basically pushed the survival of the fittest vibe then as soon as he got sick ran with his tail between his legs to get the best treatment possible which no one else has access to.

[],,burtzev,,,[],,,,text,t2_3yb2p,False,False,,"I would presume it's in the different meanings of the words ""prescribe"" and ""success"". People unfamiliar with what actually happens in medicine and in science in general might be shocked at just how much medical intervention has little to no empirical evidence behind it. The effort to untangle the true from the false has been styled [Evidence Based Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine), and it is a slow, plodding enterprise that doesn't produce all the 'magic' solutions at once. But people really and truly long for magic. 

One of the best laborers in this vineyard is the 'Cochrane Reviews', and [here is what they say about ivermectin and covid](https://www.cochrane.org/CD015017/INFECTN_ivermectin-preventing-and-treating-covid-19). Cochrane has always been a favourite of mine. 

This matter screams out for an illustration so here goes. Suppose you an ER physician anywhere in the world, and you prescribe ivermectin for every person coughing who walks through the door. Further suppose that you want to congradulate yourself on how many lives you have saved. You gather the numbers. In one country you succeed 98.7% of the time, in another 98.4% of the time, and across the world your fellow practitioners report they reach this laudable result 98% of the time.

Looks good doesn't it ? Better than anything else aren't they ? But where to the numbers above come from ? They are from the existing case fatality rates in India (1.3%), the USA (1.6%) and globally (2%) as of today. In other words you have made no difference whatsoever. You could have dispensed sugar, salt or chalk pills and had the same result. Or handed over 3 gallons of Cool-Aid with dosing instructions. The great wisdom of an old saying in medicine usually doesn't fly with patients: ""Don't just do something, stand there"". 

So there's the nub of the matter. People such as those who write for the Cochrane Review make it their business to examine reports critically. So do other publications. Her is Nature Magazine, long the foremost general scientific journal in the world, and [what they say about this subject](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01535-y). I quote from the article:

&gt;The authors of one recently published meta-analysis of ivermectin for COVID-193 have publicly stated that they will now reanalyze and republish their now-retracted meta-analysis and will no longer include either of the two papers just mentioned. As these two papers1,6 were the only studies included in that meta-analysis to demonstrate an independently significant reduction in mortality, the revision will probably show no mortality benefit for ivermectin.

&gt;Several other studies that claim a clinical benefit for ivermectin are similarly fraught, and contain impossible numbers in their results, unexplainable mismatches between trial registry updates and published patient demographics, purported timelines that are not consistent with the veracity of the data collection, and substantial methodological weaknesses. We expect further studies supporting ivermectin to be withdrawn over the coming months.",,,,1636085026,{},hjdjqzi,True,t3_qmxpuz,False,True,t1_hjd1lvh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qmxpuz/ivermectincovid19_study_retracted_authors_blame/hjdjqzi/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,a04824b28872a02c287258482b79f76c614a89c5,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1636085042.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

\&gt;Data from Belgium's Sciensano health institute showed 6,728 daily new cases on average in the last 14 days, up 36% from the previous week. An average of 164 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to hospitals daily in the last seven days, a 31% increase, and 343 coronavirus patients were in intensive care.  
  
\&gt;Belgium went into its second coronavirus lockdown in October 2020, a few days after recording similar hospitalisation numbers.  
  
\&gt;On Monday, the U.S. Centres for Disease Control (CDC) added Belgium to its highest risk level, discouraging international travel there for those not fully vaccinated.  
  
\&gt;""Because of the current situation in Belgium, even fully vaccinated travellers may be at risk for getting and spreading COVID-19 variants,"" it said.  
  
\&gt;Other European Union countries on the U.S. maximum COVID-19 risk level include Austria, Croatia, Greece and the Baltic countries.  
  
\&gt;""I thought that with the vaccinations everything would be solved, but it persists,"" said a Brussels supplier Erik Verpuylt. ""We will have to slowly accept the coronavirus as a kind of bad flu.""  
  
\&gt;More than 8.6 million people, or 74% of Belgium's total population, have been fully vaccinated, meaning no new lockdowns are being discussed. But the country has eased face mask requirements in recent months and is now facing a fresh spike in infections as winter nears.  
  
\&gt;""The majority of the people being hospitalised are people who are not vaccinated or (only) partially vaccinated,"" said Inge Neven, crisis manager responsible for COVID-19 response in Brussels.  
  
\&gt;""The people that are in intensive care are almost exclusively people who have not been vaccinated.""    

\&gt;So far in the nearly two years of the pandemic, Belgium has had one of the world's highest per capita mortality rates, mostly due to deaths in care homes in the first wave.

This is what concerns me with all these people acting like the pandemic is over once you're vaccinated. We've reduced the mortality rate by 70%. That's good. But we're also satisfied with an endemic spread. People are suggesting that cases don't matter because if you're vaccinated you won't die.  
So if we continue to spread this disease, even among vaccinated populations, that's still a steady rate of infection getting many thousands of people every day. Are we okay with a mortality rate at approximately 30% of what it originally was? 
  
I mean, if cases were *low* and endemic, sure I guess it's tolerable. But if we're going to see a flat or even slightly positive slope on the daily cases graph.. it's not sustainable.

I finished one of psychologist Danny Kahneman's books not too long ago, and one thing I was struck by is that when people are faced with 2 risks: one that they face by not acting, and one that requires them to act, a shockingly high number will do nothing, even if it's a much worse gamble. It makes people feel like they didn't do it to themselves.

I should add that _I_ think it's objectively provable that the vaccine isn't a real risk, but it's clear some people feel like it is.

&gt;He also found medical records indicating that more than 3,000 of the 25,000 Chinese Labor Corps workers who were transported across Canada en route to Europe starting in 1917 ended up in medical quarantine, many with flu-like symptoms.       
         
&gt;**Origins Debated**     
     
&gt;The Spanish flu reached its height in autumn 1918 but raged until 1920, initially gaining its nickname from wartime censorship rules that allowed for reporting on the disease's ravages in neutral Spain.    
    
&gt;Physicians began debating the origin of the pandemic almost as soon as it appeared, Higgins says, with historians soon joining them.     
    
&gt;France's wartime trenches, ridden with filth, disease, and death, were originally seen as the flu's breeding ground. The flu's tendency to strike young adults was explained as the disease targeting itself to young soldiers in trenches. The theory also purported to explain how the illness spread from Europe to cities such as Boston and Philadelphia by pointing a finger at returning troop ships.    
    
&gt;A decade after the war, Kansas was identified as another possible breeding ground, due to reports of an influenza outbreak there that spread to a nearby Army camp in March 1918, killing 48 doughboys.     
     
&gt;But in his study, Humphries reports that an outbreak of respiratory infections, which at the time were dubbed an endemic ""winter sickness"" by local health officials, were causing dozens of deaths a day in villages along China's Great Wall. The illness spread 300 miles (500 kilometers) in six weeks' time in late 1917.      
      
&gt;At first thought to be pneumonic plague, the disease killed at a far lower rate than is typical for that disease.     
     
&gt;Humphries discovered that a British legation official in China wrote that the disease was actually influenza, in a 1918 report. Humphries made the findings in searches of Canadian and British historical archives that contain the wartime records of the Chinese Labor Corps and the British legation in Beijing.     
      
&gt;**Sealed Railcars**        
    
 &gt;At the time of the outbreak, British and French officials were forming the Chinese Labor Corps, which eventually shipped some 94,000 laborers from northern China to southern England and France during the war.    
    
&gt;”The idea was to free up soldiers to head to the front at a time when they were desperate for manpower,"" Humphries says.     
    
&gt;Shipping the laborers around Africa was too time-consuming and tied up too much shipping, so British officials turned to shipping the laborers to Vancouver on the Canadian West Coast and sending them by train to Halifax on the East Coast, from which they could be sent to Europe.      

&gt;So desperate was the need for labor that on March 2, 1918, a ship loaded with 1,899 Chinese Labor Corps men left the Chinese port of Wehaiwei for Vancouver despite ""plague"" stopping the recruiting for workers there.       
      
&gt;In reaction to anti-Chinese feelings rife in western Canada at the time, the trains that carried the workers from Vancouver were sealed, Humphries says. Special Railway Service Guards watched the laborers, who were kept in camps surrounded by barbed wire. Newspapers were banned from reporting on their movement.      
      
&gt;Roughly 3,000 of the workers ended up in medical quarantine, their illnesses often blamed on their ""lazy"" natures by Canadian doctors, Humphries said: ""They had very stereotypical, racist views of the Chinese.""      
       
&gt;Doctors treated sore throats with castor oil and sent the Chinese back to their camps.       
       
&gt;The Chinese laborers arrived in southern England by January 1918 and were sent to France, where the Chinese Hospital at Noyelles-sur-Mer recorded hundreds of their deaths from respiratory illness.     
     
&gt;Historians have suggested that the Spanish influenza mutated and became most deadly in spring 1918, spreading from Europe to ports as far apart as Boston and Freetown, Sierra Leone.      
     
&gt;By the height of the global pandemic that autumn, however, no more such cases were reported among the Chinese laborers in Europe.     
      
&gt;**Medical Evidence**     
     
&gt;Humphries concedes that a final answer to the mystery of the Spanish flu's origins is still a ways off.      
       
&gt;”What we really need is a sample of the virus preserved in a burial for the medical experts to uncover,"" Humphries says. ""That would have the best chances of settling the debate.""      
      
&gt;For the last decade, experts such as Jeffery Taubenberger, of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have sought burial samples across continents, seeking to find preserved samples of the virus in victims of the outbreak.      
      
&gt;Taubenberger led a team in 2011 that looked at flu virus samples taken from autopsies of 32 victims of the 1918 outbreak.     
     
&gt;The earliest sample found so far was from a U.S. soldier who died on May 11, 1918, at Camp Dodge, Iowa, but the team is looking for earlier cases.     
      
&gt;A broad number of samples from flu victims before and after the pandemic might finally narrow down its origins. Essentially, scientists would need a genetically identified sample of the influenza's H1N1 virus taken from a victim who died before the first widespread outbreak of the pandemic in spring 1918 to point to a time and place as the likely origin point of the pandemic.     
      
&gt;One from China in 1917, for example, would fill the bill.      
       
&gt;”I’m not sure if this question can ever be fully answered,"" Taubenberger cautions, noting that even the origin of a smaller flu pandemic in 2009 still eludes certainty.       
      
&gt;Ultimately, ""these kinds of [historical] analyses cannot definitively reveal the origins and patterns of spread of emerging pathogens, especially at the early stages of the outbreak,"" Taubenberger said, of the new historical report.      
       
&gt;In the end, however, knowing the origin of the disease might provide information that could help stop a future pandemic, making the search worthwhile.      
      
&gt;”I would say that the takeaway message of all of this is to keep your eye on China"" as a source of emerging diseases, Higgins says.

&gt;••1918 Flu Pandemic That Killed 50 Million Originated in China, Historians Say ••     
       
&gt;The global flu outbreak of 1918 killed 50 million people worldwide, ranking as one of the deadliest epidemics in history.
       
&gt;For decades, scientists have debated where in the world the pandemic started, variously pinpointing its origins in France, China, the American Midwest, and beyond. Without a clear location, scientists have lacked a complete picture of the conditions that bred the disease and factors that might lead to similar outbreaks in the future.      
       
&gt;The deadly ""Spanish flu"" claimed more lives than World War I, which ended the same year the pandemic struck. Now, new research is placing the flu's emergence in a forgotten episode of World War I: the shipment of Chinese laborers across Canada in sealed train cars.     
           
&gt;Historian Mark Humphries of Canada's Memorial University of Newfoundland says that newly unearthed records confirm that one of the side stories of the war—the mobilization of 96,000 Chinese laborers to work behind the British and French lines on World War I's Western Front—may have been the source of the pandemic.       
       
&gt;Writing in the January issue of the journal War in History, Humphries acknowledges that his hypothesis awaits confirmation by viral samples from flu victims. Such evidence would tie the disease's origin to one location.    
      
&gt;But some other historians already find his argument convincing.     
      
&gt;”This is about as close to a smoking gun as a historian is going to get,"" says historian James Higgins, who lectures at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and who has researched the 1918 spread of the pandemic in the United States. ""These records answer a lot of questions about the pandemic.""      
      
&gt;**Last of the Great Plagues**      
       
&gt;The 1918 flu pandemic struck in three waves across the globe, starting in the spring of that year, and is tied to a strain of H1N1 influenza ancestral to ones still virulent today.      
       
&gt;The outbreak killed even the young and healthy, turning their strong immune systems against them in a way that's unusual for flu. Adding to the catastrophic loss of lives during World War I, the epidemic may have played a role in ending the war.      
      
&gt;”The 1918 flu was the last of the great plagues that struck humanity, and it followed in the tracks of a global conflict,"" says Humphries.         
       
&gt;Even as the pandemic's origins have remained a mystery, the Chinese laborers have previously been suggested as a source of the disease.    
     
&gt;Historian Christopher Langford has shown that China suffered a lower mortality rate from the Spanish flu than other nations did, suggesting some immunity was at large in the population because of earlier exposure to the virus.     
     
&gt;In the new report, Humphries finds archival evidence that a respiratory illness that struck northern China in November 1917 was identified a year later by Chinese health officials as identical to the Spanish flu.",,,,1636078239,{},hjd6acw,False,t3_qm1emq,False,True,t1_hjcciea,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qm1emq/according_to_the_economist_estimates_the_number/hjd6acw/,1636320336.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It doesn't inhibit regular cell function, just viruses.

Think of DNA like a zipper. Make one of the teeth change in size and shape, and that zipper isn't going to zip.

A virus isn't technically alive. It's a single stranded (usually) RNA molecule that's going to hijack the cell's machinery to zip up it's RNA code and force the cell to start making new viruses.

So these nucleoside inhibitor drugs throw a whole bunch of misshapen 'zipper teeth' in the soup of the cell, but only the virus enzymes get tricked into using the bad 'teeth.'

It doesn't affect DNA replication or transcription. Our enzymes are really good at using the right 'teeth.' In fact, this is only the second one we've found that tricks COVID virus enzymes, and the first one that does it well (remdesivir is okay. Better than nothing)

&gt;”If you have been waiting for an elective procedure for the last 18 months and are finally scheduled – you’re vaccinated, you don’t have Covid – your procedure might still get canceled if a hospital is totally full,” said Dr Anuj Mehta, a pulmonologist with Denver Health who serves on the governor’s expert emergency epidemic response committee. “While this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated at this point – and the surges in the hospital are entirely being driven by unvaccinated folks – it is having a massive bleed-over effect on to the entire population.”

&gt;There are about 1,300 patients hospitalized with Covid-19 in Colorado, according to the New York Times data; that’s the highest number since December 2020, when more than 1,900 patients were hospitalized.

&gt;That number has increased by 15% over the last two weeks, the third largest increase in the country, and at a time when the national picture for the US is of a Delta variant surge that is firmly on the way down.

&gt;…

The trend in Colorado can be attributed in part to the almost 40% of the state population that has not been vaccinated and people again gathering indoors without masks. It also shows that, despite the national downward trends of infections, regional spikes can still happen that can cause havoc in state healthcare systems.

&gt;”We clearly have events taking place in Colorado, as elsewhere, that are spreading infection,” said Dr Jon Samet, an epidemiologist who directs Covid-19 modeling for the state. “I know everyone would like for it to be 2019 all over again, but that’s not the case.”

&gt;The state had also not had surges on the scale of other states, said Dr Michelle Barron, senior medical director of infection prevention and control for UCHealth.

&gt;Other states “had flames from the get-go, whereas we have been smoldering along this whole time, and we are finally hitting that peak of saturation and seeing flames finally,” said Barron.

&gt;Thirty per cent of Colorado hospitals are anticipating a shortage in the number of intensive care unit beds and 37% are anticipating staffing shortages within the next week, according to data from the Colorado department of public health and environment.

Close to half the population has been infected.  Assuming that previous infection is uncorrelated with vax status, that means half of unvaccinated people have been previously infected.

That gives unvaccinated people some immunity, for some amount of time.    (This is *not* a controversial point and it is also *not* a good reason for someone who was previously infected to remain unvaccinated).

**If you don't correct for this, the vaccine efficacy will appear to go down as more people are infected, since the efficacy is calculated by comparing infections in vaccinated people to those in unvaccinated people.**

In fact, in the limit that everyone has been vaccinated or infected, if a previous infection provided the same amount of immunity as vaccination (it probably provides less), the vaccine efficacy will appear to be *zero*.

This is almost inconceivable, from what we know:

* Only 100 entries in the study
* but in fact 11 of those entries were cut and pasted ""repeatedly""
* and none of the researchers involved caught it?

100 entries isn't a huge amount of data.  ""Repeated"" cut and paste of _11_ entries means some large portion of the data is literal duplicates of others.

Almost any sort of these records, for example, would show this off.

As I wrote elsewhere, in any sort of data analysis, a small amount of duplicate data is a constant issue, and even a pretty new analyst knows to cast their eye over the data for just this purpose.

Even places with very high overall uptake are experiencing surges among the unvaccinated that threaten to overwhelm the healthcare system.  I'm not even talking about high-risk breakthrough cases, this is only about the unvaccinated.  I'm not even going to talk about PASC among breakthrough cases and why it warrants NPI management.  **This is still a matter of acute healthcare capacity.**

My Canadian province has nearly 90% overall uptake, but that still leaves ~175k unvaccinated adults (and roughly the same number of under-12's), all of whom are sitting ducks waiting for COVID roulette to give them the empty chamber or the bullet.  They're also largely concentrated in one region where they mingle and interact, which is only going to further accelerate transmission.

No, we can't just scale up, not without breaking the laws of physics.  It takes *months* to properly train up ICU specialists, never mind finding them in the first place.  We can't borrow staff from or send patients to other provinces because they're in the same dumpster fire.  We're already down a couple hundred staff in the system who refuse to be vaccinated or regularly tested, about three-quarters of whom are in the region that's getting hit the hardest due to low regional vaccine uptake.  The surgical backlog is nearly equal to 10% of the population.  Influenza is making a comeback after a year of quiet.  Rural ER's are closing up or severely limiting hours.  The healthcare system is hanging on by a thread.

Mandatory vaccination is the way to go. There's legal precedent (for example, we had that for small pox up until 1983), it's clearly called for and doesn't raise questions about fairness and what not, to the contrary, it's the only way to end this needlessly prolonged debate, which is a boon in itself. As for the pandemic, though, it's obviously still about biding our time. Vaccines, at least for these type of viral infections, can't be the solution. All they can do is give us the time to develop better medications that actually cure. Doesn't mean they aren't entirely justified and called for, but expectations management obviously is important.

All citizens that are of eligible age to take the fully federally approved vaccines choose 1 of 3 options:

Option 1: Eligible people that have chosen to be vaccinated:COVID / COVID related medical coverage either continues with their existing insurer OR is provided by the federal government.Mask wearing is optional; no universal mask mandate.Immune from any legal action related to breakthrough cases / spreading

Option 2: Eligible people that have chosen NOT to be vaccinated:Insurers are no longer bound to provide COVID / COVID related medical coverage for them. Incurred costs related to COVID infection treatment are NOT covered. Mask wearing is optional; no universal mask mandate.  If federal COVID precaution recommendations are not followed and people are proven / linked unvaccinated COVID spreaders they can be held legally responsible for costs / losses via litigation if people get COVID from them (For instance, dated social media posts / pictures can be used as evidence)

Option 3: Eligible people that have chosen NOT to be vaccinated but want the same benefits as option 1:Mask wearing requirement outside of home.  Weekly COVID testing requirement at their cost billed through medical insurer or in person (if no insurance).  Anybody in option 3 found or proven to not be complying with the requirements of option 3 automatically default to option 2 retroactively

This act is in effect in individual states until COVID cases drop below a predetermined number.  If we reach that point this act is suspended until numbers go above that predetermined number.  Some sort of medical ID will be required for each person to show chosen option status.

If we assume that, at the delta peak, there were 500,000 infections/day nationally (which is a relatively high estimate), that means 1 in 600 people were infected daily and roughly 1 in 50 people were infected over a 4 month period.

&gt; In our study, the rate of myocarditis in the general unvaccinated population was 1 per 10,857 and can be compared with findings indicating that myocarditis was more common after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after vaccination, as reported previously by Barda et al.

https://www.aappublications.org/news/2021/08/30/covid-vaccine-acip-pfizer-boosters-myocarditis-083021
&gt; In a discussion weighing the risks and benefits, the CDC estimated that among males ages 16-17 years, every million doses of Comirnaty over the span of a year would prevent 1,540 COVID-19-related hospitalizations, while there may be 73 cases of myocarditis. In males ages 18-24 years, these figures would be 3,150 and 39, respectively.

The takeaway is that myocarditis from covid infection is 11 in 100.000, from vaccination is 1-3 in 100.000, therefore a vaccination makes a lot more sense.

It is also, when it comes to the coronavirus, perhaps the most tightly regulated place on earth.

&gt;In the past year, it has been locked down four times, with one shutdown lasting 26 days. Homes in an entire district have been evacuated indefinitely to create a “buffer zone” against cases from elsewhere. Schools have been closed for months, except for a few grades — but only if those students and their teachers do not leave campus.

&gt;Many residents, including 59-year-old Liu Bin, have gone months without income, in a city that relies heavily upon tourism and trade with neighboring Myanmar. Mr. Liu, who ran a customs brokerage before cross-border movement essentially stopped, estimated he had lost more than $150,000. He is tested on a near-daily basis. He borrows cigarette money from his son-in-law.

Few things here. 

Last Friday a CDC update removed about 500k first shots as a data correction. So this update is from Friday numbers but last weeks are Thursday. This is becuase for the whole week the daily avg was messed up from that data correction. 

CDC does not break out 5+ yet but I decided to do this update with 5+ since I am thinking there might be some in the total number.

I might not 100% sure on the total population of 5+ but I heard it was 28m more kids, so I just added 28m to my old 12+ total.

Nice boost on 18+ - guessing with some of these mandates hitting people are getting their shots.


I might move to a few updates a week if we are seeing good numbers of kids getting shots.",,,,1636147394,{},hjgw0ki,False,t3_qn5er2,False,False,t3_qn5er2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qn5er2/daily_discussion_thread_november_05_2021/hjgw0ki/,1636393941.0,19,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,
