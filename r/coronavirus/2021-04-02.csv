Not american so maybe missing some nuance but this sounds a bit weird. Isn't BIPOC just a code word for anyone except white?  I don't understand why a Racial Justice Alliance operates this clinic. What has this got to do with Racial Justice? 

 I get the principle, less people of color were vaccinated and they want to get them vaccinated for that reason but were they ever expressly prohibited based on the fact they were BIPOC? 

If they weren't then coming up with a solution to vaccinate only BIPOC and prohibit anyone white doesn't at face value really seem to be an appropriately ethical strategy (is it even legal to discriminate based on race for life saving treatment?)

Right, but you aren't a scientist. And the scientific conclusion by scientists is that you should take it. If your conclusion is different, you are deciding you think you're smarter, which does in fact make you an anti-vaxxer. 

&gt;I read articles about the vaccine on the manufacturers and government website and they all say the same thing that they do not know of any long term side effects but the latter is worse. 

Yes because it's science, they won't publish long term effect until there are long term effects to publish. It's been basically a year since trials, nothing to report so far. And again the FDA Approval process is **rigorous** and they test for all possible effects, and it passed. There is no significant chance whatsoever of any long term effects. You are completely 100% worse saying that ""the latter is worse."" 

&gt;They also say on the vaccine websites that they are not approved by the FDA they were passed through because of medical emergency. 

False. They are approved by the FDA.

I hadn't seen the newest numbers, but, 70% is an improvement. 

Natural infection, without vaccination, is about 60% protective agains the S.African variant, based on research. 

&gt;In contrast, after 9 months, convalescent sera had a mean sixfold reduction in neutralizing titers, and 40% of the samples lacked any activity against B.1.351.

source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01318-5

So, if 40% of the us was infected with the original strain, then 40% of those people are at risk. 

Interestingly, 1 dose of Moderna or Pfizer elicits a strong enough response to stop any of them, and is expected to often be strong enough to stop SARS-COV-1. So natural infection floowed by vaccination, leads to essentially 100% immunity. [mRNA vaccination boosys cross-variant...,Stamatos et. al., Science]

If, 42% of the population is infected, and 0.7×0.75=52.5% is vaccinated, and
Vac+Infected= 100% protected
Infected = 60% protected
Vaccine = 81.3% protected, (2/3@90% for moderna and Pfizer + 1/3 @ 64% JnJ (S.Af. effectiveness))

Then the number of people immune is 58.8%, which is good enough to stop an R0 of ~2.43. So in short. this isn't good enough to stop the variants; there will be a persistant infection rate, i.e. we wont be at herd immunity. maybe not thousands a day in every state, but some, nonetheless.",,,1617424487,{},gt7s92d,False,t3_miysvc,False,True,t1_gt7lrk2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/miysvc/100_million_americans_have_received_at_least_1/gt7s92d/,1617424498,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You have to compare it with the risk of catching covid and dying from it. Let’s take this for example with simplified numbers:

Let’s say you have 20 deadly blood cloth cases in 1 million young women. That is 1 in 50,000. Everyone will get a vaccine so with a population of 10 million you get 200 dead.

Now covid. Maybe 1 of 1000 young woman die if infected and roughly 1 in 100 do got infected so far. This means 1 in 100,000 die. With a population of 10 million young have 100 dead from the virus.

So by using the vaccine we increase the death rate of young women even if it means we stop the virus and safe many others that have a higher risk of dying from covid .

The good thing is: we can just give that specific age group a different vaccine and use the AZ for people that aren’t at risk with barely any downsides. Everyone gets a vaccine, covid stops, old people are saved and no one had to be sacrificed

Edit: note that this scenario assumes we get covid under control. If we don’t and every young women will get covid in her lifetime then getting the AZ vaccine will actually decrease the risk of dying!

But the coronavirus we human beings are dealing with right now does not do that! 
I repeat: there is no evidence showing that anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination exacerbates, prolongs or helps to spread the decease. In fact, it’s safe to say that the opposite is true! Vaccines produce competent neutralizing antibodies, and the only minor issue is these antibodies are IgG ones which are abundant in blood, not so much on mucous membranes, hence they don’t prevent contraction as an ideal vaccine would. 

But you don’t need 100% neutralizing immunity in order to stop the spread! 30% neutralization means 30% of vaccinated people won’t be infected at all, but that does not mean that remaining 70% are just as dangerous as unvaccinated people. You are not accounting for reduced viral load and reduced time period when the infected person is contagious after proper vaccination. You are not accounting for reduced decease duration and reduced volume of affected tissues which have to stay high to provide the virus the best mutation playground. You also don’t account for all other measures taken. These 30% are 30 over placebo. And nothing tells that it should work substantially different in carnivores.

But you know what’s the style of SARS-CoV-2? Recombinations. Weird animal-to-animal transmissions we don’t know about enough yet. A lot of mutations in people with prolonged COVID, which might be the case in animals too.  

So if we want to prevent SARS-CoV-2 from picking up animal coronaviruses’ traits, we will probably have to vaccinate our pets at some point, provided humans don’t miss their shots too. That will prevent the virus from entrenching in pet animal populations. If 30% of cats will never have a chance to contract the human coronavirus, that would be splendid. And the remaining 70% are pretty much guaranteed they won’t not become silent carriers, that’s awesome too. That means that the odds of SARS-CoV-2 hooking up with FCoV and screwing up the humanity will be very low, and that’s a good thing.",,,1617442238,{},gt8b734,False,t3_mh3fe1,False,True,t1_gt88zs8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mh3fe1/russia_registers_worlds_first_covid19_vaccine_for/gt8b734/,1617442248,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

No, people don't want to be that conservative when it comes to living their lives normally again.  And we've had studies since early February that shows a significant reduction in viral load in those vaccinated starting 12 days after the first dose.

There's only about 260-270 million people OVER the age of 16 to begin with.

Other wealthy countries (e.g. Switzerland, Canada) seem to have other obstacles such as depending on other countries to produce their vaccines and issues ramping up local distribution caused by local political inefficiencies.

Even though the US had the benefits of its large production capacities and export ban (which generally prevented approved vaccines from being exported to other countries), it has done nearly everything related to vaccinations remarkably well, all things considered.",,,1617402798,{},gt6s2a6,False,t3_mikbdd,False,True,t1_gt6nojg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mikbdd/dr_anthony_fauci_does_not_expect_a_4th/gt6s2a6/,1617402809,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That was a rough five-year patch and I eventually went to a therapist as I had a lot of other work-life problems and anyway, one of the things I got my work to agree upon was a maximum of 15 trips a year and a goal to keep it to just once a month, with more notice on trips too (because before I literally kept a suitcase packed in my trunk as they'd sometimes decide I needed to be somewhere the next day and I'd just go straight to the airport). It's been ten years and they've kept that promise every year -- with the past year being no trips because, well, pandemic.

My ideal travel schedule would probably be half a dozen trips a year. But the 15 trip annually limit (and it's usually been more like 10 to 12) works too.

and

&gt;have not seen anything stating this. Do you have a link to an actual study I can read through? The stuff I have read has mostly been articles and the general gist is that this would be much worse than 1918 flu given the complete lack of care available.

When the statistics are REALLY considered. They dont match up with what the journalists are telling you. 99.99% of people dont bother to look at the statistics critically and compare them to previous events of similar nature. It's the main reason history repeats itself in the worst of ways. I know I'm just a random redditor to you and you're probably thinking ""why would I believe you over journalists and doctors and politicians?""

But understand that in this crazy world we live in, a common person could have more common sense and intelligence than those with trumped up degrees, connections, and clout. Infact, that's often how it is isnt it? You and me have more in common with random people in the UAE or France or Japan or Zimbabwe for christ sakes than we do with our own representatives.

I'm not denying this virus exists. I'm not even making conspiracy theories. I'm simply using statistics to show you that doctors, politicians and the media have all stoked peoples WORST FEARS. And used that to scare people into complying.

Why did they do that? They didn't mean to. It's not some grand conspiracy. It's just fear... That's the catalyst of all this. Fear. The most powerful weapon to control the masses.

They're scared of the virus cause their health advisors showed them the same RIDICULOUSLY OVER THE TOP PROJECTIONS that were released to the public of what this virus could look like if we dont lockdown and curfew.

I'm in Canada, our top health advisor claimed Canada would face 20,000 cases a day in march if we dont hard lockdown... We refused to hard lockdown and guess what happened? Nothing. Cases rose but not even CLOSE to 20,000 a day.

So you see what I mean here? It's not a conspiracy. It's not some grand plan for a great reset or communist take over. 

This is all just one big over reaction.

&gt;Yes, but I don't think you quite appreciate the insane number that would be

Perhaps you could argue that the spread is higher but the harms are less due to more people at high risk of death being vaccinated. Sure, thats true. But I really don't know what message you are intending to send, so I can't meaningfully respond.

Adverse reaction center Lareb has received five reports of extensive thrombosis with a low platelet count after vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine. It occurred 7 to 10 days after vaccination. The cases involved women between the ages of 25 and 65.  
Roughly 400,000 people were vaccinated with AstraZeneca during the period when the symptoms occurred.  
Reports of thrombosis and lowered platelets to Lareb  
Three patients had extensive pulmonary embolisms. One died and one also had a cerebral hemorrhage. Another patient had extensive thrombosis of the abdominal veins. One patient developed a thrombosis of the arteries in the legs.  
Lareb previously reported on three reports involving a combination of thrombosis with a reduced platelet count. At that time it was insufficiently clear whether this was the same picture as had been seen in other countries. Two reports have now been added and more information is available about the earlier reports. There is also more clarity on the nature of the reports from other countries.  
The picture resembles heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). In HIT, the immune system is activated so strongly that the body makes antibodies against its own platelets.  
In two of the five Dutch reports, however, no antibodies were found that fit the HIT-like picture. In three reports this is not yet clear.  
The reports in comparison with reports in Europe  
The reports appear to be similar to other reports in Europe. As in other countries, they involve a combination of extensive forms of thrombosis combined with a sharp drop in the platelet count. Also, the symptoms occurred 7-10 days after vaccination in women younger than 60-65 years.

I would say literally ignoring ONE source instead of Science. 

It is documented that vaccinated people can still carry and transmit the virus. 

In Israel, they had 4th lockdown with half their population vaccinated. 

In Spain, there has been a COVID outbreak in an elderly residence, were they ALL were vaccinated (except one nurse, who brougth it back). None of the elders had any complications, but still they had an outbreak in a CONFINED, BUBBLED and VACCINATED entourage. 

I really do not understand this CDC post. 

Vaccinated people can carry the virus. 

The virus do not move itself. It is the people who move it from place to place.

The peak ending Dec 12 was 89.2 per 100k hospitalized 65+, now it's at 30.2 for March 27 or 33% of the peak and rising from a low of 10.9. Hopefully vaccines keep that down, but it's not rosy. 


What's really bad is the 50-64 group is at 22.9 vs a 32.8 peak or at 70% of the December peak. This suggests that vaccines are helping curb the older hospitalization which is great but the really striking thing is the December peak was driven off of about 7k new cases per day while the March 27 sample is just 3.5k or half the positives. So if the relationship with case counts for these age groups continue based on this week's case count of 5.8k, the 50-64 group will be up to 39, a new high, and 65+ at 50. The 18-49 group is up to 6.6 from a peak of 7.5 and could be at 11 this week, also a new high. 


In other words, due to the new variants and people's changing behavior, some age groups may already be in the worst period in Michigan. 


In absolute hospital load, the 65+ group is roughly 17% of pop, 50-64 roughly 20, and 18-49 38%. That makes the December weighted average 32.4. If the trend continues, we'll be at 27.3 this week.

I don't think vaccine passports are going to be adopted by many businesses where I live in the US. The ones that do I will not patronize. I will patronize the ones that don't. In other parts of the country its going to be far more prevalent.

I just disagree vehemently with the entire concept of a more than likely cloud based, digital, vaccine passport that is suppose to keep my private information secure. It's the registry aspect. As was noted when we were advised about not posting unedited CDC vaccination cards on the internet, they contain information that can be used to access other parts of our medical records and in turn also other private information that can be used for identity theft.

Now of course the obvious retort is that that information about me is already probably available which is true. But I'm not going to volunteer it. 

If they wanted to give me a laminated card that says I'm vaccinated that I can present to prove it that would be fine I guess. Hell, I'd wear a scarlet letter V if that's all it took.

The J&amp;J vaccine manufacturing mixup that you heard about [isn't a problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/mhhf8x/johnson_johnson_statement_on_us_covid19_vaccine/) There are no tainted or flawed doses from J&amp;J being distributed, all our doses of J&amp;J came from a different manufacturer in the Netherlands and are both safe and effective.

It's too soon to say ""lifelong"" but [that is a possibility.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4nkco/the_immune_system_mounts_a_lasting_defense_after/) Also, it looks like those who have recovered *may* only need [one dose of an mRNA vaccine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/labst4/robust_spike_antibody_responses_and_increased/). There are some people (~7%) who don't develop lasting immunity from infections, but it's not clear to me now whether vaccines would develop lasting immunity for these people. 

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l9nfu8/stable_neutralizing_antibody_levels_six_months/) probably a lot,[ lot longer,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/)  probably many years.

Vaccine induced immunity is [comparable to](https://www.verywellhealth.com/antibodies-from-vaccines-and-from-natural-infection-5092564), or [better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l5whhu/increased_resistance_of_sarscov2_variants_b1351/), or a [LOT better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m8m23c/neutralizing_antibodies_against_sarscov2_variants/), immunity from a previous infection.

[Seriously,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4pnde/mrna1273_vaccine_induces_neutralizing_antibodies/) it's [very probably](https://reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l6vs1t/in_vitro_studies_demonstrate_pfizer_and/), like, [not going to be a problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l0yqe6/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gjwov3s?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) Yes, even against ones [we've not yet encountered](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mhg9lf/your_immune_system_evolves_to_fight_coronavirus/).

Just because Moderna has one ready and is testing it, doesn't mean that we will definitely need boosters.

[This was encouraging,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmp5doo/) regarding the efficacy of vaccines against variants.

Pfizer [seems fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lf7uph/neutralization_of_viruses_with_european_south/) against the troubling variants, at least in the lab. At the very least, the mRNA vaccines [*still* work](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfp89k/neutralization_of_sarscov2_spike_6970_deletion/) on the three most worrying variants.

Variants [are not currently evading vaccines](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mg0l7a/study_shows_no_vaccineresistant_strain_exists_in/), and seem unlikely to do so.

Still worried about variants? Check [this out!](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/27/vaccination-against-the-new-variants-real-world-data)

Most variants aren't great at being viruses; [that mink variant](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/19/danish-covid-mink-variant-very-likely-extinct-but-controversial-cull-continues) may have already gone extinct. 

Antibodies from recovered people who then got an mRNA vaccine [work on variants *and* OG SARS?!](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfiypu/antibodies_elicited_by_sarscov2_infection_and/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) This should really put the variant fear behind us.

**Vaccines Seem to Reduce Spread**

Vaccination and previous infection[ reduce viral load, which reduces spread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s).

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) article does a good job of explaining the likelihood of vaccines *at least* reducing spread.  [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lf744r/daily_discussion_thread_february_08_2021/gml0gyi/) may help too. Data from [Scotland looks great](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m3tx1n/covid19_vaccine_linked_to_a_reduction_in/). 

[""Moderna vaccine blocks &gt;90% (87-93%) of infections &amp; 91% (89-94%) of transmission.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmqfk4q/)

Milder cases, especially asymptomatic cases [are worse at spreading](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kcy2e0/weekly_question_thread_week_of_december_14/gg8tp7n/).  

Looks like the amount of virus in people who've gotten one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and then infected is [greatly reduced compared to those not vaccinated](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfiqma/decreased_sarscov2_viral_load_following/).  This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a great reduction in ability to spread the virus. [Maybe even with just one dose!](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242) You should [get both doses though.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m2mtnv/immune_response_to_sarscov2_variants_of_concern/)

Reinfections are rare, some studies show [less than 1 in 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kyj0bx/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/) (maybe in the 1 in 10,000 range, you'll have to read the study, it's awesome).

The thing is, what you are trying to do with an mRNA vaccine is to make cells produce large amounts of proteins that you want your immune system to zoom in on. If you make loads of viral spikes, any real COVID that shows up later will get fried almost instantly, as the immune system sees those spikes, and nukes it.

If you try to do the same thing for cancer cells, that is a lot harder, as you need to find a feature on the surface of the malignant cells which you are *extremely* sure is unique to those pathological cell lines. Reason being that if you make the immune system zap everything with that particular protein on its surface, you are pretty screwed if that protein also appears on some rare healthy cells that you had not thought of when making the vaccine. So that e.g. your tumour cells end up getting nuked - but some nerve sheathing in your brain stem as well, because these rare cells have the same feature that you were targeting. This is of course just a made up example, to give you the idea - and this problem is absolutely not an issue with a viral spike, of course, as that stuff simply does not occur anywhere in the body.

To add insult to injury, our bodies are already really, really good at killing cancer cells. So that if a malignancy manages to hide from the immune system, and goes out of control, it will already have evolved to be as immunologically inconspicuous as possible. 

What mRNA vaccines do offer (and there is hope in that) is a way to fry those malignant cells if you do manage to spot a targetable marker the body's immune system missed. That will be a huge help, in those cases where a feature like that can be found. But please don't expect mRNA vaccines to be a miracle cure just yet.

The news item says:

&gt; Fra 1. februar til 23. marts har 117.670 borgere inden for 48 timer fået både en lyntest og den mere præcise PCR-test.

&gt; 4069 var positive ifølge PCR-testen. Men lyntesten fangede kun 2159 af dem, skriver Politiken. 1910 personer med coronavirus i kroppen fik således tilsendt et negativt testsvar. Det svarer til 47 procent falsk negative.

Which translates to:

&gt; Between the 1st of February and the 23rd of March, 117,670 citizens have taken both a rapid test and the more precise PCR test within a 48 hours of each other.
&gt;
&gt; According to the PCR test, 4069 were positive. But the rapid test only caught 2159 of them, writes Politiken. 1910 people with coronavirus in their bodies thus were given a negative test result. This corresponds to 47 percent false negative.

Even with a correct translation, the article clearly doesn't know how to calculate the false negative rate.

If 4069 were positive, then 113,601 were negative (according to the PCR test). Likewise, with the rapid test, if 2159 tested positive, then 115,511 must have tested negative.

According to the numbers given, 4069 - 2159 = 1910 tested falsely negative from the rapid test.

Assuming that all positive cases in the rapid test tested positive in the PCR test, and all negative cases in the PCR test tested negative in the rapid test (which is an assumption - I don't know what the actual numbers are), that'd make for 1910 out of 115511 negatives being incorrect, or a 1.65% chance that a negative is a false negative.",,,1617454628,{},gt8ox1g,False,t3_mj7rct,False,True,t3_mj7rct,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mj7rct/47_percent_of_positive_rapid_tests_in_denmark_is/gt8ox1g/,1617454638,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

But they have also observed a broader return to pre-pandemic life seen in a relaxing of mask wearing, social distancing and other strategies meant to slow the spread of the virus — many weeks before a substantial portion of the population is vaccinated."" 

""On Thursday, Michigan officials announced that they had identified their first case of the P.1 variant""

Clearly B117 is playing a role, but the rise in Michigan cases cannot be solely contributed to it. 

I cannot find any definitive research demonstrating P1 is more deadly amongst younger people.

I for one highly encourage people to be vaccinated as soon as they can and wear masks until the summer at the very least, preferably longer.

However, most people don't realize the global context which sort of does make this hoarding of vaccines a problematic approach. The issue is that the EU is producing a lot of vaccinations yet is lagging behind massively on actually being able to roll them out for personal use. They are facing a difficult decision because if this continues, they may be forced to take control over their production. However, if they do, they will be screwing over other countries including the UK and they will slow down global production.

The vaccines produced in the EU often partially use resources from other countries like the UK. So if they stop exporting, the UK will probably respond with boycotting the production. So everyone loses in that scenario. Hence why European politicians are angry at the US but more so at the UK government. The EU is allowing the current status quo to continue to ensure maximum production of vaccines but they are indirectly being punished by other regions who put their utmost priority on what is being called ""vaccine nationalism"" . 

So the EU is in a really bad spot. They could heavily prioritize their own citizens like the UK and US have done, but they would be screwing over everyone else in the process while probably not gaining all too much from it due to the reduced import of resources. They tried to impose stricter regulations, but the WHO called this out. Which is kind of weird considering the EU is literally bleeding resources right now.

“Back to normal” can mean a lot of things. For example some people will be doing things like wearing masks when sick in the future. Other places like airports might still scare people for a while since other countries might not have a good handle on Covid and airports are probably the first place to encounter folks from other countries. 

I’ll define “back to normal” as most places in the US you are not required to wear a mask and social distance. 

I think this will happen when cases go low and we are confident they won’t start going back up. 

How low does it need to go. CA has 2 (or 4 if you have tons of testing) new cases per 100k pop for yellow tier. I could imagine 0.5-1 new cases per 100k pop. They will announce their green tier soon and since they have been the most strict state with restrictions I imagine other states will be same or les restricted.

The second part is how to be confident the cases won’t return like they did around thanksgiving. This is where the vaccine comes in. 

Now for vaccine rollout I have been projecting best and worst case scenario with current numbers (158M doses, 3M avg daily doses) and linear growth of vaccine distribution (+.2 more vaccine each week). That puts us at 70% of adult population fully vaccinated before May 31st.

For how long does vaccine effect cases I have been watch Israel. Their numbers stated to plummet about 1 week after 50% population got their fist dose. It has taken them about a month of dropping to get low numbers. 

So that puts us around end of June. But faster vaccine rollout or more people choosing to get the vaccine could make it happen sooner. Also having higher or lower stating case number can make the plummet take longer or slower so it would be good if people wore masks and social distanced until numbers start dropping again. 

Obviously if there is a variant that isn’t protected by the virus that messes everything up but that is supposed to be unlikely. 

Given all that I am booking a vacation to see family in July and a vacation with friends in August. I’m planning to wear masks in airports/planes and tourist places and if I’m sick but not otherwise.

Strain implies a biological difference, which is unknown for most lineages and therefore frowned upon even for lineages that are definitely their own strain, like B.1.1.7 (UK).

The dominant lineage varies across the US.  The original highly contagious strain, B.1. (Wuhan), encompasses many mutations that each create their own lineage but are all suspected to basically be the same - often called wild type, though Classic Strain is a good term too.  This includes the D614G mutation that was first noticed last spring, and has not been proven to actually do anything.

B.1.427/B.1.429 (Los Angeles) lineage is suspected (unproven) to be slightly more contagious, and was highly prevalent during the large Los Angeles wave.  It has since spread across a good bit of the US, but hasn't become dominant anywhere.

New York City now has its own strain, B.1.526, which has high prevalence there and is provably different from the original.  It has not spread much elsewhere though.

In most of the rest of the country it's a mix between ""wild type"" and B.1.1.7.  B.1.1.7 is believed to be 50% more contagious, meaning it will outgrow Classic Strain by 50% per 5 days.

The other strains that are substantially worrisome are P.1. (Manaus), that is currently spreading across South America, P.2. (Rio) that is doing the same thing at a slower rate, and B.1.351 (South Africa), that completely took over in South Africa and seems to have the most immune escape, but has never gotten a foothold anywhere else.  These have all been detected in the US, but appear to be out-competed by B.1.1.7 even though this contradicts how quickly they took over in the locations they were first identified.

There's also a completely different naming system, in which B.1.1.7 can just be called V1, B.1.351 V2, and P.1 V3.  These are all provably different strains, and are the most worrisome we have.  Any time someone says ""variants are a problem"" they mean these three strains, but V1 is the only one that has measurable prevalence in the US.",,,1617484269,{},gta84c0,False,t3_mjauad,False,True,t1_gta0xle,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mjauad/covid_strain_from_uk_now_top_variant_across_much/gta84c0/,1617484281,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

We could easily vaccinate 6 times as many people in one month.

There are many benefits to stockpiling vaccines and not give them out until around mid 2021:

* No problem with diminishing immunity from prior infections and early vaccine recipients

* Less time spent between the rollout and reaching herd immunity means less time for the virus to mutate under selective pressure into vaccine-resistant variants.

* No false sense of security leading to premature cancelling of safety measures

Four Nationals players have tested positive for the coronavirus this week, and six others — five players and a staff member — are in mandatory quarantine because they were deemed to be close contacts of infected individuals.

&gt;The Nationals’ season was supposed to begin at 7:09 p.m. Thursday at Nationals Park. Uncertainty with their latest test results led to a postponement, which then led MLB to keep the club’s operations on hold. Now the Nationals are waiting for Thursday’s test results, which could come Friday night. If there are no new cases — aside from the “likely” positive the Nationals announced Thursday — they will inch closer to containing the spread. But if there are more positive tests, their immediate future gets even more complicated.

&gt;MLB has not announced when three games will be made up. The Mets now will start their season at the Philadelphia Phillies on Monday. The Nationals are scheduled to face the Atlanta Braves in Washington that afternoon, but the status of that series is uncertain. Test results and any necessary contact tracing will determine when the Nationals can begin their season.

If you feel that the restrictions &amp; precedent that requiring medical information to do basic things like attend a baseball game are worth saving, say, 100 lives (number will drop with a heavily vaccinated adult population anyways), I get it.

The interview is in German and much more detailed than the text below the video.

I hope, i get the major points right:

* Covid-19 is much more dangerous and he recommends to get AZ shots, if you have the chance (there are 40 cases of thrombosis in 1.4 million vaccinated people in Germany compared to 45 active Covid-19 in his hospital in Greifswald alone)
* in his eyes the connection between AZ shots and the cases of thrombosis is proven
* his team and many more professionals all over Germany &amp; Europe are currently looking for the cause
* they don't know the cause and he compares it to searching a needle in a haystack
* there are many speculations what's causing the problem: maybe the vector of the vaccine itself, maybe the patients have special genetic traits or they had taken other medicines
* at the moment nobody knows what the cause is, thus there are no tests to have before vaccination
* two things he rules out as causes, because they are too common and would've resulted in many more cases of thrombosis
   * birth control pills
   * Faktor V Leiden mutations
* they have developed two tests to check, if antibodies are currently causing the blood clots in patients, unfortunately they only work once the problems started
* if vaccinated patients show symptoms for thrombosis, they should get treatment immediately and do the tests after",,,1617404317,{},gt6utmc,False,t3_mim81s,False,True,t1_gt5zcfx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mim81s/netherlands_halts_use_of_astrazeneca_vaccine_for/gt6utmc/,1617404328,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This is relevant to a point, but we've been vaccinating people in Group 6 since the middle of February, a group that includes people at risk in the age group 16-65, but also includes unpaid carers, of which there are an estimated [13.6 million in the UK, with 35% of them being between the ages of 18-44](https://www.carersuk.org/images/CarersWeek2020/CW_2020_Research_Report_WEB.pdf), a further 43% of unpaid carers are between ages 45-64. Combine that with key workers who received AZ prior to this group, and I would argue that the UK now has more younger people vaccinated with AZ that just about any other nation. I just wanted to bring this to people's attention for additional context, it is something that can be underestimated about the UK's rollout.

You're right in saying part of the of the answer lies with rollouts differing in terms of strategy around age, but as we start to get the data coming in now, are we seeing the same relative volume of fatalities that other countries have? It could be that we are, and whether through data lag or otherwise, we should expect even more fatalities as the number of AZ vaccinations in the UK for younger people continue. Alternatively, we might not, and then the question returns why countries like Norway and Germany have been disproportionately affected by this, despite fewer vaccinations.

While current vaccines do not guarantee neutralization since they are not tailored towards mucosal immunity boost, they still are very efficient at humoral and cellular immunization. As the result, they ​noticeably increase viral load threshold for COVID contraction in the vaccinated people due to cellular immunity response and some IgG antibodies being present anyway. They also dramatically reduce time frame and viral load generated in a previously vaccinated infected person because the immunity kicks in much faster and prevents the virus from proliferating in large volumes of tissue and spreading across the body. It's pretty damn close to neutralization.

I have no reason to believe that this should be any different in carnivores. And before you bring ADE and neutralizing antibodies in here, no, that's not an issue with current vaccines. In fact, vaccines prevent that situation because they produce a lot of competent neutralizing antibodies and the memory about them. You see, if a person contracts the virus, there are always some incompetent antibodies being produced. S-protein isn't the only one, and antibodies against other proteins might turn out being non-neutralizing. If the person is lucky, there should be enough competent antibodies to combat the virus and that does not matter too much, but if not, you are asking for a severe case or long COVID. If the person is extremely unlucky and contracts COVID again or stays ill for too long, these incompetent antibodies may cause ADE and substantially aggravate the problem. BUT if the person is already vaccinated, there are enough neutralizing antibodies which are proven to work, so the situation stays under control. 

In other words, [steps to reduce the risks of ADE from immunotherapies include the induction or delivery of high doses of potent neutralizing antibodies, rather than lower concentrations of non-neutralizing antibodies that would be more likely to cause ADE.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-00789-5) And again, I have no reason to believe that shouldn't work in carnivores.

What can be an issue is COVID in domestic animals. The more cells and organisms are infected with the virus, the faster it can mutate. It's already known to change hosts, so we are already playing with fire. And since people (myself included) love to pet their carnivores, a virus strain capable of spreading between carnivores and people alike will be a disaster. And if the virus will even attempt to recombinate with highly lethal viruses such as FIPV... Well, you definitely don't want that. By vaccinating our pets we are mitigating these risks. It simply won't have a chance to mutate like that.",,,1617409210,{},gt73ift,False,t3_mh3fe1,False,True,t1_gt2nok1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mh3fe1/russia_registers_worlds_first_covid19_vaccine_for/gt73ift/,1617409221,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

No need to constantly clean the apartment. For me it was a low maintenance life, but I had previously worked ridiculous hours with frequent (every 9-12 month) relocations, so to me it was an improvement.

I have not seen anything stating this. Do you have a link to an actual study I can read through? The stuff I have read has mostly been articles and the general gist is that this would be much worse than 1918 flu given the complete lack of care available. The fact that covid variants have evolved to 1) be able to re-infect people that have already had it and 2) be more contagious, deadly, and capable of targeting young demographics (instead of more contagious and less deadly as with most diseases) really just reinforces that point. 

&gt; Better standards of hygiene having an effect? Yes but to what degree it would have effected is essentially a guess. So cant use that. Better nutrition? Yes but again you're firing blind here.

You can run comparisons on historical disease transmission and adjust for what we see today. It's not perfect by any means, and yes it would essentially be an educated guess, but it's a bit silly to leave out things from discussions that we know would absolutely be confounding factors simply because there isn't a way to perfectly measure or gauge it.

Oh, yes, individual people have been shaming others. But if it's just one person, an anti-masker can write them off as ""uptight"" and keep going with their lethally wrong behavior.

That's why I added ""as a society"" and ""reliably"". We needed to be consistent about this from the beginning.

Anti-masking would have mostly faded away, and a lot of people would not have died.

Of course, and typically that is how you would expect it to be rolled out based on how each vaccine is stored. This is purely anecdotal but since the start of last month everyone that I personally know has been receiving the AZ vaccine at sites such as dedicated vaccination centers and halls as well as pharmacies and local GPs. I wish I had more credible information to hand than my own personal experience but it certainly would suggest we have a sizable portion of the younger population with at least one dose of AZ.

At the very least, it means that we probably have a greater volume of data to come in the next few weeks. Fingers crossed it's encouraging (less fatal) data, and as you say, we see further co-operation by countries to effectively address health concerns in balance with rollout.

The spanish flu killed 50 million people when the earths population was around 1.8 billion.

COVID 19 has killed 2,850,000, our population is 7.8 billion...

For COVID to be as bad the spanish flu was with todays population it would have to have killed hundreds of times the spanish flu death count.

Another month of wearing masks and avoiding gatherings could save a lot of lives. Or a few. Who knows. What we do know is being cautious a little longer until more are fully vaccinated can't hurt.

&gt;When the statistics are REALLY considered...  
&gt;99.99% of people dont bother to look at the statistics critically and compare them to previous events of similar nature...    
&gt;I'm simply using statistics to show you...  

You haven't shown me any statistics. You have literally done nothing but ""subtly"" hint that you have more intelligence and sense than most doctors and researchers. You're a walking example of Dunning-Kreuger; too caught up in the idea of your own intelligence to even realize how far out of your depth you are. 

Again I'll ask, do you have any actual sources to back up your statements? 

&gt;What's the total amount of people in critical condition from COVID?

I'm not aware if any place has stats combined and totaled properly from different countries since reporting methods and data vary heavily. I'm sure it exists but I have no idea how much it would cost to access it or where to get it from since most sites are just listing reported cases and deaths. I know for US data states are responsible for reporting that stuff, so you'd need to aggregate all the historical data for 2020 to get a clear picture. There's an incomplete total found:  
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

The issue with this view again however is that you're missing the fact that early oxygen often prevents a lot of people from even reaching critical care part of things. Covid absolutely crushed hospitals that were inside large outbreaks as well, and that was with a ton of patients basically being given oxygen and sent home. 

All of that to say that even if you take the case \# and multiply it by 5, we'd still barely be over 33% population infected, and covid would likely not slow down or stop until well over 50%. 

One last thing as well. It's highly likely the current covid numbers are severely underrepoted based on excess deaths for many of the hardest hit areas. Much of the data your asking for won't really be available for a few more years while researchers actually compile and dig into all the data when Covid is finally over.",,,1617426142,{},gt7ufm3,False,t3_miucvq,False,True,t1_gt7rbbf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/miucvq/realworld_data_shows_vaccines_kicking/gt7ufm3/,1617426152,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

So there is still a chance that if you are infected you can pass the virus on as you fight it off.

First, to clear two misconceptions out of the way. ""Vaccine passport"" is a catchy nickname the press coined. It doesn't resemble a passport in any way, which is merely an ID saying who you are. In post soviet countries, Id documents are still called passports, even. 

Second, there are extremely few countries we need proof of vaccination to travel. All of them are african sub saharan states with a precarious level of state enforcement and very little healthcare infrastructure available. Almost all international travel happens without them.

The main point is we are not ""getting vaccinated anyway"". We have no idea of when vaccines will be truly accessible to everybody, there are only ""goals"" written in the sand by politicians trying to save face which are constantly moved backwards. There are very few countries in the world, such as Russia and Serbia, where vaccine supply outstrip the demand, and this is effectively punishing people for their age, or whatever other factor that makes them not be a priority group. Not to mention poor countries which won't be able to fulfill vaccine goals for years. Will we simply lock them out until them?

It is not just an annoyance. Think of how common immigration, international students, etc is nowadays. This might separate families for years to come. 

Second, there is a fact someone else already raised: in case this madness is indeed enforced over even small aspects of life, which is unprecedent, this would mean a severe burden over businesses and employees which would bear the responsibilities of a police force. Imagine you, in your shit low paid McDonalds job, forgetting to check the vaccine passport app and serving a costumer anyway, meaning a huge fine to your employee, you losing your job and even potentially getting a criminal record? Absurd, isn't it? It is how the plans for a vaccine passport in Denmark are going at the moment.

Third, it is completely pointless. It will consume a lot of time, effort, money in a moment where public authorities were strained, for a measure that would make sense epidemologically for literally moments. Look at what vaccination, far from complete, has done already in the UK, US and Israel.

The UK had no native vaccine production before covid. In part because of Brexit leading to fears the EU could withhold vaccines, and in part just the obvious danger of relying on purchasing vaccines produced in other countries who might suddenly decide they want to keep those vaccines for themselves (Australia could tell you about that), the UK government paid for factories to be set up in the UK so they would have their own domestic production, *as well* as purchasing vaccines produced by private companies in other countries such as the EU. Many countries (again, notably Australia), now doubtless wish they had done the same thing too.

Paying to set up those factories in the UK was not cheap, and they were given to AstraZeneca to produce the vaccines the UK paid for, since they were in partnership with the UK government. 

The vaccines that have been produced in the EU but being exported were not paid for by the EU. The factories they were produced in were not paid for by the EU. They are from existing factories owned by the European arms of Pfizer and other manufacturers. They are fulfilling orders from other countries under normal free market conditions.

Had there been vaccine manufacturing in the UK prior to covid, those would be exporting vaccines from the UK now. For example, had Pfizer had a UK factory prior to covid, not paid for by the UK government, they would be free to export to whichever country purchased vaccines from them.

Instead of paying to set up domestic production in Europe for the domestic market, the EU just went shopping for vaccines from the free market. So they join the queue along with every other country for vaccines produced in these factories that happen to be located in the EU. It was the EU's choice to do it that way, and the EU chose wrong. Crying that *they're* exporting vaccines when other countries aren't is ridiculous. 

The US did a little dirty by effectively imposing a ban on vaccine exports, but they did this early on and made it clear to everyone, which is why Australia and the like didn't order vaccines from the USA. Had the EU done the same, countries like Australia would have sought their own domestic production instead of buying from EU manufacturing, and the UK would have cut its contracts to buy vaccines produced in Europe and doubled its domestic production instead.

The EU's crocodile tears are getting really tedious. The vaccines manufactured in Europe being exported aren't the EU's to withhold, they were bought and paid for by other countries. The vaccines produced in the UK and US were bought and paid for by the US and UK governments, whether by paying for the entire production line (UK) or by advanced notice to other countries not to bother (US).",,,1617473987,{},gt9o1ht,False,t3_miysvc,False,True,t1_gt8twjl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/miysvc/100_million_americans_have_received_at_least_1/gt9o1ht/,1617473998,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This country is going freaking berzerk in 45 days!

Also note that children are at much lower risk of infection - half that of adults. That's like being vaccinated right there.

Given our friend wizmax soon, we plan for 155M having had a shot by end of the month. That means at least 80% effective by mid may for all those, avg effectiveness even higher. 1/3 of the remaining adults have already been infected, so 33M. And then of the 85M children you've got all of them with 50% protection and 10M of them with even more since they've been infected.

Add that up-
-155M with 80%
-33M with 60% (conservatively for the previously infected)
-85M with 50%
-that's 273M (or over 80% of Americans) with +50% protection by may 14
-total protection percent for population would be 55% (70% here is best guess for herd immunity to be in full effect) 
-by then the shots will be slowing down but I'd expect that total protection percent to increase 1% every 3 days, so full herd effect by July 4th if we do it right. But we'll before that we will have major reduction - my guess is by mid may

That can be prohibitive for some businesses. Just look at the chaos that wearing a mask has created, adding enforcement on top can be an issue.

From my perspective UK, vaccine passports have been mentioned in able to go to the pub. Pubs don’t have people on the door, so they’re going to need to hire security just to open, and deal with potential issues. The bar staff they have, are normally under 25, so its extremely unlikely they will be vaccinated but will have to ensure customers are, leading to tensions. A lot of the customer base will be in the non-vaccinated group, so the finances of opening do not add up. A lot have said it’s not financially viable to open until everyone can come in.
I’m sure there are crossovers with US businesses.


Its generally down to fairness, everything open to everyone at the same time, especially as if half the population can go out and have fun.

The drop in antibody effectiveness in both cases is pretty dramatic, but the good news is that it would appear that even the reduced efficacy is strong enough to prevent most symptomatic infections. 

Clearly, there isn't a 1:1 relationship between antibody effectiveness and the number of symptomatic infections (which is to be expected). It is likely that there is a relatively narrow band of antibody effectiveness that separates ""mostly immune"" from ""mostly vulnerable"".

It is already established that the way coronaviruses replicate allows for the emergence of ""hybrids"", and hybrid strains of COVID19 have already been detected. A California/South Africa hybrid has the very significant potential to be much better at evading an immune response than either parent strain. However, it wouldn't have any major advantage over the South Africa strain since pre-existing immunity is still somewhat rare.

As more people get vaccinated or recover from being sick, that situation changes. The more immunity exists in the population, the more of an advantage that hybrid has.

**Additional Thoughts/Cool Stuff**

Even the shittiest masks do seem to work, [but why?](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/md436k/another_explanation_for_why_cloth_masks_reduce/)

Testing and the Positivity Rate: It's been said a lot in other subs that the positivity rate should go up over time as more people are vaccinated and don't require testing. Last year, it was *the* metric to watch, but it will likely wane quickly in importance as overall testing drops.  Don't necessarily worry about sudden high positivity rates, as mass testing will likely drop off pretty quickly, particularly as testing sites are converted to vaccination sites. 

We may want to use our newly found testing and sequencing capacity to test and sequence a higher proportion of flu samples.  This might give us a head start on which flu genetics are circulating, and help eliminate a flu or two.  We're in the single digits of flu cases most places, which is awesome!

**Which vaccine should I get?**

When someone asks me what my favorite beer is, the answer is always the same.

It's the one in front of me.

So get the first vaccine you can, the differences are pretty minor.


[**Conclusions**](https://gfycat.com/cleantalkativedassie)

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms.  This currently seems to also be true with post vaccination infection with any of the known variants. We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well. 

In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections and symptoms in those who do get infected. Therefore, vaccines should reduce spread.

Regarding side effects of the vaccine:

Nobody is saying there aren't side effects. There are clearly side effects. I'm not even saying there aren't side effects from the vaccine that could last for years. The effects of an infection may not show up for a while, [and we know they can last a long time](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m4jhpf/rapid_implementation_of_a_cohort_for_the_study_of/), most notably a loss of sense of smell.

I'm saying that we'd find out about all the side effects within a few months. There won't be side effects that suddenly show up six months after vaccination that haven't already shown up in some people.

If you have an example of a side effect from any vaccine where side effects not seen within the first four months were suddenly found over four months post-vaccination, I'd change the wording in my post.

I'll tell you though, I've still not gotten an example of a vaccine side effect that didn't show up in at least some people until way after the vaccine was administered.

I get plenty of ""look, this vaccine used decades ago in some tiny country rarely causes this one long-term side effect, so you're wrong"", which doesn't address the point I'm making.",,,1617463363,{},gt93j87,False,t3_mj3e9x,False,True,t3_mj3e9x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mj3e9x/daily_discussion_thread_april_03_2021/gt93j87/,1617463374,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I was so torn about whether to go for the vaccine or not, I shouldn't have even been offered it yet but somehow received my letter so initially thought it was a great thing that I'd be vaccinated early. I have pretty bad anxiety sometimes so I didn't know whether I was being rational in not wanting to go or not. Everyone I knew told me I was being silly, so I went. And the night after having it, I read the news that more countries had pulled the vaccine for younger people. I honestly felt like crying. 

What bothers me most about all this, is that the British gov and British media (on all sides of political spectrum) keep pushing the narrative that it's totally fine. That 'you are far more likely to die from the covid than the vaccine', but for young women (or whichever group is vulnerable to developing these clots), that simply isn't true. The risk of dangerous effects from the vaccine could be a lot higher for a really specific group, so this whole utilitarian message is unnerving. I feel like the message is just one of 'serve your country, others could die'. I know I'm being dramatic but that's just how it feels. 

I just feel the media coverage in the UK is still not giving a true account of what's happening. Every single article says the same thing about the benefits outweighting the risks. When I got vaccinated I asked if many hadn't turned up and they said they'd had about 20% of people not turning up. So the gov and media actually does need to have an honest discussion about it.

I got my first Moderna dose around noon EST on Thursday, and I felt totally fine for the rest of Thursday and Friday. When I went to bed Friday night/Saturday morning around 1 am, I noticed I had pretty uncomfortable bloating but wasn't able to pass gas to get rid of it. It kept me awake for the next 4.5 hours, until about 5:30 am when I got a sudden urge to use the toilet. After some pretty hefty diarrhea (completely liquid), I started to vomit pretty hard. Felt a little better afterward, but then had to go diarrhea two more times in the two hours that followed and just finished vomiting for the second time. Stomach hurts still, and I have some minor chills.

From what I've read, this isn't a common side effect of the vaccine, but I *think* it can happen in rare circumstances. My brother (whom I got the vaccine with on Thursday and drove home from college with on Friday) said he felt the urge to poop and vomit on Thursday night.

meanwhile there were neighboring states that did even less than that where people were travelling freely to and back from. they could have chosen to restrict movement between states on the basis of a health emergency, but restricting freedom of movement (something that's a constitutional right) is a pretty big deal that would have caused for people who work in a neighboring state and would have required extensive security checkpoints (something that would be expensive and unpopular) to enforce.

since they didn't restrict movement, it just took one person coming from a neighboring state with less restrictions to cause an outbreak. fundamentally states could not deal get the same benefits from restrictive policies as an equivalently sized country. this leads to a kind of race to the bottom because can you really justify putting these restrictive and disruptive policies in place in your state if it's going to have a limited impact? but in practice that just means the least restrictive states get to dictate policy to some extent.",,,1617465163,{},gt96xn4,False,t3_mimikg,False,True,t1_gt92dgr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mimikg/vaccinated_americans_are_free_to_travel_but/gt96xn4/,1617465174,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The restrictions were initially in place to slow down everyone getting infected, but as time went on that transformed into trying to prevent anyone from getting infected while they wait for immunization by vaccine. We're at that point, but not everyone can or has been vaccinated.

It is mathematically inevitable that the states that prevented consistently large numbers of infections over the past year would get a massive boost as things open up towards the end. Why wouldn't they? The uninfected are defenseless without immune system familiarity, whether that's from the virus or the vaccine.

The question is basically a three part issue now:

* If opening things up towards the end leads to an inevitable case increase, was the vaccination effort quick and comprehensive enough to prevent heavy restriction states from having similar death numbers from light restriction states?

* Assuming there is a statistically noticeable difference in deaths between heavy restriction states and light restriction states once this is all over, was that difference large enough to justify the difference in the first place?

* What restrictions were the most helpful in forging that difference in deaths, and should there be consequences for the restrictions that turned out to be unhelpful or with costs that outweigh the benefits in the minds of most people?

**None** of these are going to get answered by the end of the year. We're probably going to be debating the second question especially for the rest of our lives. This is also just a bit of a tangent, but I speculate the two biggest factors whose importance we're going to learn as time goes on are obesity and Vitamin D. Japan is my biggest example of this, they have a negligible obese population and very fish heavy diets. They did not have restrictions comparable to the United States or the European Union, and they didn't suffer from the pandemic nearly as much as them. I think it's going to be a cultural shake up to learn that the worst year of our lives was very largely caused by extremely unhealthy lifestyle choices, and that's going to be a major, major wedge in the discussion of what the restrictions contributed on a logistical and ethical scale.",,,1617469879,{},gt9fxi4,False,t3_mjbym0,False,True,t1_gt9csuy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mjbym0/variants_could_largely_be_reason_for_massive/gt9fxi4/,1617469892,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

However, there is a problem with medical journalism and related epistimology where some claim that RCTs are the only kind of valid ""evidence"".  

However most studies and trials covering every permutation of variables will not be available on time, or may never be done.  Gold standard RCTs are great ""ground truths"" but we need a working model to fill in the gaps between them.  So what this means is that we have to rely on is our understanding of how vaccines work to fill in the knowledge gaps.  This impacts treatment decisions, but also public policy decisions.  Decisions we make today on vaccine capacity, targets, and strategy will affect what we have this fall and beyond.  We need to plan for what is probable, not only what is proven.

We do have substantial experience in animal models and other analytical models of human immunity that guide our process of vaccine development and inform us what the ""null"" hypothesis should be.  

The vaccines mostly work by presenting the immune system with irritating antigens, and mostly the COVID vaccines have antigens that mimic the spike protein on SARS2 that allows it to enter the h-ACE2 rich cells in your respiratory epithelium.   Mostly, additional vaccine doses will create a stronger immune response.   We can actually measure the # of antibody units per mL after dosing animals and we almost always see them go up with cross dosing regardless of the type of vaccine or antigen source.  There are a couple caveats to this, for example: Vector vaccines may have issues with the 2nd dose; This is because you immune system can generate immunity to the vector itself, rather than the ""payload"" of antigens.  But as far as we know, barring very rare allergies, the mRNA vaccines have no such limitation - they basically turn cells into pure irritating antigen factories.  saRNA tech is a recursive MRNA coding technology that makes cells turn into MRNA vaccine factories and thus sub uL doses are possible.  We already have a bunch of real world human data of the 0, 1, 2 mRNA vaccine doses after ""natural"" infection, and we see that the antibodies continue to climb (although the increase from 1 to 2 shots after natural infection isn't super big).  

Most of the vaccines, except for AZ have a similar ""payload"".  The AZ vaccine is missing one part that the others have, which may explain why it seems to have very poor efficacy against the south african strain with the EEK mutation.  In lieu of real-world data, we can also take the blood from vaccinated people and see how well it binds to the proteins of the SARS varrants &amp; strains.  We see that Moderna, Pfizer, and Novavax generally produce a much stronger response than the J&amp;J and AZ vaccine in these lab tests.

So I think it is almost certain that mRNA vaccines can be used as a universal booster shot.  And we can quickly tweak the antigen payload to match the EEK mutation as well.",,,1617469790,{},gt9frae,False,t3_mj93i4,False,True,t1_gt97kqa,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mj93i4/moderna_vs_pfizer_vaccine_why_you_shouldnt_decide/gt9frae/,1617469802,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

As far as I know the single biggest thing about mRNA vaccines is that they're a platform rather than a single vaccine.  In theory it is much easier to build a vaccine for something using it as the majority of the work is already done, you need to synthesise the RNA which codes for an identifiable feature of what you're vaccinating against which is relatively much easier than designing a traditional vaccine.

In terms of therapies it could be useful as it's a stable system which uses the body's own cells to synthesise things with various known factors of how much of a substance will be produced from a given dose and how quickly mRNA decays then you could have a high degree of control of how much of a substance is delivered over time.  An obvious candidate for this would be various hormone therapies that are used currently but there are other possibilities as well.  

A few days ago there was a story about a hormone that when inactivated in mice caused missing teeth to start to regrow.  If it pans out that something like that would work in humans then an mRNA vector could cause the body to manufacture the suppressing protein and would be an ideal way to do that.

The other avenue of therapies is the prospect of highly customised medicines.  RNA synthesis is relatively easy so a customised dose for a specific person for a specific function could be possible as the technology matures.  With that case it could become possible to take a biopsy from a cancerous growth and work out protein or set of proteins which would attach to just those cancerous cells and flag them to the immune system.",,,1617471718,{},gt9jhtw,False,t3_mj7a3d,False,True,t1_gt97hch,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mj7a3d/biontech_ramps_up_vaccine_production_in_marburg/gt9jhtw/,1617471731,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It also may be regional. Here in NY, all my Republican friends plan on taking it, even some of the more conspiratorially minded.

[As of March 15th](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20210315.476220/full/) Israel vaccinated half of its population with two shots, and 60% with a single dose.

That includes certain groups within Israel not abiding by public health precautions (no large gatherings, masks, social distancing etc) as well as vaccine hesitancy. There's other factors at play such as weather being more mild in Israel over the winter but that will apply less so as the US is heading into the warmer months.

[This site](https://covidvax.live/location/isr) shows live data estimates for vaccination efforts globally and corrects based on official reported numbers once daily.

There's a few things to remember going into this:

1. [First doses can be highly effective](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210114-covid-19-how-effective-is-a-single-vaccine-dose) in protecting someone.
2. [Real world evidence](https://www.wsj.com/articles/single-shot-of-astra-zeneca-pfizer-vaccines-cut-hospitalizations-u-k-says-11614619961) of the former point has been shown in the UK.
3. [It can take a few weeks for a dose to work](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/how-they-work.html).

TL;DR: Look at the chart on the second link I posted and set it to cases ""Doses vs Cases"". You can see about two to three weeks before March 15th when they hit the 50% fully inoculated number and those people were still on their first dose, cases began to decline significantly. That decline is likely due to those people getting their first shot administered.

Hope that helps!",,,1617400353,{},gt6niv0,False,t3_mippnp,False,True,t1_gt6eb8i,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mippnp/briefus_cdc_says_delivered_2047_million_doses_of/gt6niv0/,1617400446,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

No simple answers, but the European Commission failed to buy the protective gear and ventilators needed for countries in Europe in time and they failed to buy vaccine in time too.  

They spent large amounts of time giving Pfizer/biontech a hard time about liability but pretty much allowing Astrazeneca to be exempt 

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-astrazeneca-results-vaccine-liability-idUSKCN24V2EN](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-astrazeneca-results-vaccine-liability-idUSKCN24V2EN)

&amp;#x200B;

Then there were disagreements about buying the mRNA vaccines that have become pretty much the cornerstone of the world

*Germany, however, wanted to throw more money at the problem. Specifically, it wanted to bet even bigger on its homegrown mRNA vaccines — especially given that BioNTech was well into Phase 3 trials. In mid-September, Berlin announced it was giving €375 million to BioNTech and €252 million to CureVac.*

*Other capitals were quick to push back. Why invest in expensive, unproven technologies that need to be transported at super low temperatures? Some countries, most notably Bulgaria, thought the portfolio was too broad. Poland spoke out against having mRNA vaccines represent half the stock.*

In the end, the EU pretty much put all of its bets on AstraZeneca , even though they had extended the contracts to massive amounts of the Pfizer/Biontech (pretty much because Germany had threatened to leave the whole deal).  They had not prepared to transport the vaccine and countries like Bulgaria didn't even buy any of it (which they later were gifted by Germany, and others after they fucked up). 

*The Hague had bet* [*so strongly*](https://www.politico.eu/article/netherlands-coronavirus-vaccination-slow-start-mark-rutte-hugo-de-jonge/) *on the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab being the first to be approved that it hadn’t finished preparing to transport mRNA vaccines, which need to be kept at temperatures far below freezing. Cash-strapped Sofia eschewed big orders of mRNA vaccines; it made a*[ *show of distributing*](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-bulgaria-moderna/facing-criticism-over-slow-rollout-bulgaria-starts-moderna-vaccinations-idUSKBN29J14Y) *a few thousand Moderna shots on January 14 amid criticism.* 

Anyway long story short, the EU screwed the whole deal up and it was signed very late, and many orders were in made much earlier and so the EU is at the back of the line.  The EU doesn't have the power like the US does to stop vaccine from leaving its shores as much, so the urgency that was really needed by the EU was totally lacking.

You have literally done nothing but ""subtly"" hint that you have more intelligence and sense than most doctors and researchers. You're a walking example of Dunning-Kreuger; too caught up in the idea of your own intelligence to even realize how far out of your depth you are.

&gt;Again I'll ask, do you have any actual sources to back up your statements?

You calling me stupid? That would be a great example of a lack of self awareness if you did. You have repeatedly asked for something I've already given you. A freaquent tactic used by redditors. The stats and comparisons with other viruses speak for themselves and while I can only use data that is PRESENT. I believe it is enough to prove the point that curfews and lockdowns were not necessary. Masks? Fine, vaccines? Fine, social distancing? Fine. Lockdowns and curfews? That should be last resort. Not the first thing you jump to. Medical projections were skewed to show infections that never happend in my country. States in the U.S. with mask mandates having more infections than states without mask mandates. Doctors that have spoken out against the lockdowns and curfews. The infection and deaths not falling in line with the absolute panic the media has been pushing. Too many inconsistencies for me to put absolute faith in the mainstreams discussion of COVID. So I have to look outwards instead.

&gt;I'm not aware if any place has stats combined and totaled properly from different countries since reporting methods and data vary heavily. I'm sure it exists but I have no idea how much it would cost to access it or where to get it from since most sites are just listing reported cases and deaths. I know for US data states are responsible for reporting that stuff, so you'd need to aggregate all the historical data for 2020 to get a clear picture. There's an incomplete total found:

Damn. Well someone should eventually release that info. Seems useful to know. I know worldometer it's my primary source for the really basic COVID stuff.

&gt;One last thing as well. It's highly likely the current covid numbers are severely underrepoted based on excess deaths for many of the hardest hit areas. Much of the data your asking for won't really be available for a few more years while researchers actually compile and dig into all the data when Covid is finally over.

Yes I have considered this possibility. Ultimately all I can do is operate with the data I have available to me. And the data I use can be found through worldometer and googling past viruses. My entire argument relies on taking the infection and death rates of previous pandemics and comparing them to Covid. The TRUELY undebatable data will come years from now. This isn't it.

Yes several factors remain unaddressed as you pointed out. Some of the factors actually help my point against lockdowns and curfews. I just dont think that certain nuances really change the equation all that much. Like yes 1918 health standards, terrible. Which obviously lead to more infections. Nutrition was weaker. Medical advances a joke. These are all things that could contribute to why the spanish flu was as awful as it was. But it also explains why COVID is not as bad as the media says it is. These are great things that I would prefer we relied on instead of, you know, destroying other peoples lively hoods with lockdowns and curfews that lead to lay offs? And it's always the little guys getting screwed man I'm sick of it!!! I'm sick of the higher wage people being unaffected by this kind of stuff.

[],,IronEngineer,,,[],,,,text,t2_4b7xe,False,False,[],"My current boss has taken an interesting approach.  The lead engineer is an older guy and my work environment has had a hard time with older staff not adjusting well to wfh.  It hasn't been a problem for me on the projects that I've run.  So I just started a new project under this guy and he does not like zoom meetings or managing from remote.  He feels unable to control the design.  So freaking behind on his timeline he requests help and they put me, a senior engineer, and a junior engineer under him to help him.  This was 2 months ago.  

It started with him giving me a short rundown and a few tasks to do.  I started with looking things over at his request and finding problems and potential solutions.  Offer to implement said solutions.  Denied as he doesn't want me designing anything.  He wants me only documenting and creating drawings.  Without looking over my shoulder he doesn't trust what I do or that I'll do it right.  Ok, whatever.  I create drawings and schedule a meeting to review them with him before sending to vendors.  He refuses the meeting.  Call him.  Get him on call for maybe 10 minutes where he mostly gotta on about how stressed and overworked he is.  He refuses to give me or the new guy any actual significant work to lighten his load. I find out this guy is having weekly meetings with the other engineering leads to guide decisions and not allowing any of his underlings to attend, or even telling us what was discussed.  As he doesn't have the time to disseminate information.  I am now out of work and asking for additional tasking, which he doesn't feel comfortable giving out, and refuses to respond to contact attempts.  I haven't heard a peep from my lead in... It'll be a month next week.  

So I'm sitting in his payroll wondering what to do next with my apparent time off and wondering at what point I consider calling his boss.  Reluctant to do that for office politics but this is absurd.  Did I mention that I've had to become the de facto checker of the new guys work because the lead apparently hasn't been doing it.  I noticed there were blatant problems in his work (typical new guy stuff) and the lead was just rubber stamping it all through, as again he didn't have the time to review anything.  

Damnit I've been a lead for 3 years now and have never seen anything like this.  Incredibly stressful.  

First boss from this division was another older guy lead engineer.  I haven't worked with him in a long time but he retired a couple months back.  Found out he was requiring his whole team to be in the office every day in violation of california law and company directive because he hated wfh.  I asked him at his retirement party how he got away with that (I was shocked) and he told me that he'd been with the company for 30 years.  What were the going to do, fire him?  They didn't have the guts. (His actual words.). He was right.  These older guys are fixtures and even when they are terrible at their jobs or refuse to advance to new technologies, they are untouchable.  Very frustrating and feeds into the office politics mentioned earlier.",,,1617478662,{},gt9xi8n,False,t3_mj89m1,False,True,t1_gt9addq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mj89m1/more_extroverted_people_suffered_mood_declines/gt9xi8n/,1617478674,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

With MRNA vaccines, if they can find a common feature on my cold and flu vaccines, they can code the MRNA to protect against that feature that will prevent multiple flu and cold vaccines.

This is why the COVID vaccine is so effective. There's a spike protein the COVID virus uses to attach itself to cells that simply doesn't change that much between mutations.

It is also one with a very simple answer.

Due to the lack of trial data on efficacy for 65+, a number of countries decided to restrict AZ to under 65s. Which was reasonable.
Other countries, including the UK, decided to take a (small) gamble, and give it to any age group (note that this was also the position of the EMA). Which was _also_ reasonable, if for no other reason than the logistics of Pfizer vs AZ favored giving Pfizer in hospital settings.

The consequence is that while the UK administered a lot of AZ, most of it was to elderlies. Essential workers, such as medical staff, would have primarily got Pfizer. In those countries that restricted AZ to younger people, the opposite happened, AZ was given _only_ to essential workers, all the way down the age group.

The traditional benchmarks of infections in the trials were reached at a quick speed as a consequence of being run in the midst of a raging pandemic not because anyone decided to speed them up. Furthermore some of the benchmarks were even added because the spread of Covid was so rampant they met them earlier than they expected.

HOWEVER, the P1 variant contains multiple potentially-immune-evading mutations, is as contagious as they come, and seems to have the highest propensity to re-infect individuals (implying that it also has the highest probability to evade vaccines). And we have virtually NO data on vaccine efficacy. All the trials were done before it emerged, and there's no real-world data as Brazil hasn't vaccinated enough people yet to provide anything meaningful.

Going out in a mask really helps the social anxiety. 

I'm deep in the convention scene for my work, and not having to go to any of those crowded, smelly places all pandemic was amazing. All of the conventions moved online, so I was able to just sell my stuff on there instead. 

I got a bunch of stuff done around the house and saved a ton of money not having to go out with friends to various expensive things. 

When the super strict lockdowns were going on and traffic was nonexistent, I used it as an excuse to go on a week long camp around the state thing, staying on BLM land in the middle of nowhere since the interstates had almost no traffic. Avoiding people like a literal plague was going on. It was wonderful. 

There were no door to door sales people. 

No awkward family gatherings during the holiday (which was a godsend since half my family is republic and half democrat so they would have been a bloodbath this year if the last few years have been any indication). 

All of my friends were still connected online. Tabletop gaming went to tabletop simulator. Everyone was home to play mmorpgs and stuff all day. We had a blast.

The virus isn't going to stop spreading.  We are unfortunately stuck with another seasonal endemic virus we're going to have to continually fight through vaccination.

The goal for a long time was to keep too many people from getting sick and being hospitalized such that systems get overloaded and have to perform triage resulting in the death of people that could have otherwise been saved.  Now we're at a point where just about anyone in the most at risk age groups that are willing to be vaccinated have been vaccinated.

Despite the new order, the state is still encouraging people to voluntarily wear masks in any setting where they are interacting with people outside of their own household.

“I look forward to the day when immunity reaches a level that we no longer have to wear masks,” Polis said in a written statement on Friday. “Right now across our state, 1 in 207 people are currently contagious with COVID-19, and only an estimated 27% of Coloradans are already immune through either vaccination or prior infection. In the meantime, we must continue practicing vigilance by wearing masks, especially if you aren’t yet fully vaccinated, practicing social distancing when in public and in the company of people with unknown vaccine status. This modified mask order is a step towards the light at the end of the tunnel.”

Just wait a little longer till you get the vaccine or herd immunity is low enough that it isn't required, which I'm sure will be within the year for the states.

Working from home really suited me, and I was one of the lucky ones who actually enjoyed the extra family time. 

Now that I’m back working in the office, only home about ten hours a day on work days, I’ve found myself way more stressed, constantly tired, and the closeness that had developed in our family has slipped away a little since we are all gone our own ways during the day, and the nights are so rushed we don’t have time to have those deeper conversations we did when we had nowhere to go.

I can appreciate that some have been separated for over a year now because of this, but again I don't see this lasting very long, if it is implemented at all.

While I myself am not opposed to the passport system, I do not see them even being implemented because of the constraints you brought up. But if they do come to pass, I still don't think it's as ""freedom restricting"" as people are claiming, as it is allowing freedoms that haven't been available for a year now for some, again acting as a stop gap while vaccinations pan out.

Gotta count on that, thanks haha.

&gt;I would agree that there’s enough ambiguity that you might be right but there’s also surveys showing that roughly half of republicans currently don’t plan on taking the vaccine (compared to 11% of democrats and 30% of independents). Also, you would expect that rural areas would stock less vaccine to serve a smaller population.

True. However, as I'll explain to you later, this is also influenced by non-political factors. I.e., more correlation not equaling causation. Just because people who say they are Republican are more likely not to take the vaccine arent necessarily not going to take it BECAUSE they are republican. It's more likely to me that they're not doing so BECAUSE they're rural. Keep reading.

&gt;It also may be regional.

That's my point.

&gt;Here in NY, all my Republican friends plan on taking it, even some of the more conspiratorially minded.

Exactly my point. It's not red vs. blue, it's urban vs. rural. 

&gt;Just a theory, but I think knowing someone who died of this plays a role in motivating people to get vaccinated.

I know I would be far more motivated to do something to not only protect myself from the disease I know could kill someone I know, but also to stop its spread to anyone else.

But the biggest thing too is that rural areas have had far fewer cases than urban areas (cities are disease factories), and having people more spread out means that they're less likely to get the disease already, much less after the vaccine. Hence, fewer rural people likely will get vaccinated.

It's not red vs blue, its urban vs. rural. That's the real divide in America.

A few professionals (mostly in the school and university field- which are more or less open and considered to be a critical point for spreading the virus- with the exception of Tuscany that gave it also to lawyers and judges) were given permission to get the AstraZeneca vaccine, which at the time could be subministered only to people younger than 55.  

&amp;#x200B;

At that time AstraZeneca was not to be used to directly save lives, it was the vaccine to contain the spread on the general population. They hence decided to give the possibility of vaccinating ALSO to some essential professionals with a queue system.

&amp;#x200B;

I got the vaccine myself (I'm under 30, in the teaching sector) for this reason. I think it was in February.

&amp;#x200B;

Later on, they opened up the AstraZeneca for up to 65 y/os (maybe now is higher after the latest EMA statement, not sure), but I would not say that the vaccination campaign prioritized professionals over elderly people, as the vaccine can't (or couldn't) be given to old citizens according to the health regulatory bodies. Tuscany still made a strange decision to let lawyers in despite the national directives, but who am I to judge.

&amp;#x200B;

We could argue that AstraZeneca should be given also to elderly citizens, but it's something we can't really discuss on Reddit, as if Germany caps it at 60 y/o and a few other countries banned it altogether there must be some health concerns.

&amp;#x200B;

I still think that priority should have been given also to grocery store workers (and similar jobs), with some age-related cap. I'm glad to have received the vaccine but, honestly, I would have preferred to give it sooner to my parents (who got it at 60+ just a couple of weeks ago) or to some older essential workers.

The paper never actually showed that antibodies from people who were exposed to Sars-CoV-2 were cross-reactive with human proteins and if there was cross-reactivity we'd have seen autoimmune disorders emerge from people who were infected. I'm amazed something so shallow got past peer-review.

Ultimately, the vaccines have been tested in tens of thousands of people in clinical trials and no autoimmunity has been reported. The concern posited in that article hasn't been realized. After all, it's been a year since that paper was published and the FDA panel of top virologists, vaccinologists, and immunologists who evaluated the data from the trials were not concerned.

Besides, check the author, he had to create his own non-profit to spread anti-vax propaganda\*.

But you have to consider that the EU will increase production capacity over 4 times this quarter, compared to previous quarter. Deliveries to the EU will go from 100 million in Q1 to 420 million in Q2. Now also include a lot of doses get exported from the EU as well. Using the last export to own use ratio, that would be around 88 million doses for Q1 exported and around 368 million doses in Q2, assuming the ratios stays the same. That means around 790 million doses will be produced in the EU in total in Q2 and that means around 980 million doses will be produced in the EU in the first 6 months of the year. 

For Q3 the production is even set to increase with another 70% compared to Q2. This might mean 1.34 billion doses will be produced in the EU in the third quarter alone. Or 2.32 billion doses in total in the first 9 months of this year. The eventual goal is to produce 3 billion doses in the EU in 2021 (which seems reasonable, because it looks like deliveries will reduce in Q4 again, to around 1 billion doses produced).

These are not very accurate numbers whatsoever, as they are based on current export to own use ratios and the deliveries for Q3 are still quite unsure, but they show the kind of number the EU is set to produce the coming months.

But even if the numbers are off, for better or worse, there surely is a very exciting time ahead.",,,1617477754,{},gt9vn48,False,t3_mj7a3d,False,True,t1_gt8rj4d,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mj7a3d/biontech_ramps_up_vaccine_production_in_marburg/gt9vn48/,1617477765,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Let’s just say 1 of 3 things will happen 

1- you never get Covid 

2- you get the vaccine and your body produces the signature spike protein and chops it up and then recognizes it when it’s confronted with Covid and doesn’t let it replicate 

3- You get a natural infection and Covid and your body produces spike protein attached to actively replicating Covid that does whatever it does

I can’t really put my thumb on the proposed long term effects people are worried about from the vaccines.  Like what pathology, what mechanism, what category?

I will say that wild type Covid is way more of a mystery than an mRNA vaccine.   The multi system inflammatory phase of an acute infection is very weird even in young people and does stuff that we find very atypical. The lingering fatigue we find in some patients is strange and the sometimes persistent loss of or change in taste and/or smell is really crazy.  

Post 1918 pandemic there was 2 decades of a Parallel pandemic of a mysterious condition Encephalitis Lethargia that had an unknown cause and was hard to pinpoint it even spreading but it was everywhere.  Most had mild cases but it turned some people into catatonic zombies who would eventually be collected into nursinghome-like wards that they grew up in and lived in until the 60s I believe.  The movie Awakenings was about how this one doctor was able to wake them up for a few months with a new drug.  Encephalitis lethargia is a medical mystery and for years there has been speculation as to whether it was a syndrome linked to a world where a huge % of people had gotten and recovered from the Spanish flu.   It’s conjecture and they did some work studying an handful of archived brain tissue samples of Encephalitislethargia patients and were unable to find RNA from the flu.   But it still persists as a potent hypothesis as to its origins. 

My only point being that virtually everyone who is worried about long term effects from vaccines dismisses the possible longterm impacts of incubating some random bat virus that has managed to make its way into the lives of roughly 20% of all humans in a little over a year.   

Covid is an odd bug.

The EU negotiated an at that time ""good"" deal for vaccinations but are now bleeding vaccinations due to corporations going where the market tells them to go, despite it not being entirely up to code. There's also an issue where some corporations producing in the EU are in fact majorly UK/US owned and funded, so they are producing them for these markets and often with resources from the US and UK mixed in between it all. It's a bit complex and both sides have got a leg to stand on.

The EU is now thinking about taking measures to keep more resources within its borders rather then letting them bleed to other regions, which is similar to what the UK and US are doing. It's not uncommon practice during times of crisis to prohibit the export of regionally produced resources, but that usually only goes for a crisis that isn't a global. When your neighboring country isn't lacking food but you are, it makes sense to prohibit the export of foodstuffs. It's a bit different when everyone is suffering the same shortage of goods which are produced through a conjoint global effort. 

So this is bound to further sour the UK and EU relations as the UK claims to not be hoarding vaccinations whereas the EU are collectively saying that they do. So from a EU perspective, it's a very selfish approach when the research towards the vaccinations was a global effort, even though it's fair to say that the UK was a major contributor. Meanwhile, people in the UK are just happy to be taken care off. 

So while international relations between Europe and its traditional allies is going to be hitting an absolute low, the UK politicians will nationally most likely heavily benefit from this approach.
