She works with a therapist to hopefully one day be able to overcome this fear and get the vaccines she needs to stay healthy. Because of her fears she is a very adamant about wearing masks, wearing gloves, bleaching everything, using disinfectant and social distancing. She does this not only for her health but for the people around her.

I know a lady who is so very scared of needles so she can't get the vaccine. Actually she gets no shots whatsoever! She is fastidious about masks, wearing gloves, washing her hands, touching her face, disinfectant use social distancing and she only comes out into public a couple of times a month. She works from home and keeps up with people very well. She says she does this not only for herself but for other's good health!

I know a couple of people who have doctor diagnosed allergies and they have been advised to not take the vaccine. As with the other two people I know they both are very cautious about being out and about around people. They take all precautions and are very careful about wearing masks, disinfectant use and social distancing. One guy is frustrated by what all is going on with the covid-19 vaccine, social distancing, businesses being impacted by all of the regulations and just ""want it over with!""

So not everyone who can't or won't get the vaccine is reckless in their behaviors. Yup, there are people who won't get the vaccine, for whatever reasons, and just go about their lives as if they are impervious to the virus! Obviously we are seeing the results of their behaviors. But just because people are not getting the vaccine do you see people being so reckless! Life is not perfect but we can sure try the best we can. 

So let's just keep putting the message out there: get your vaccine, wear your face mask, wash your hands, don't touch your face and social distance! And get out and vote!

The [CDC data countrywide](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#covidnet-hospitalizations-vaccination) shows a somehow lower hospitalization rate for vaccinated people currently, so this may vary based on your locality.

Learning to live with covid is fine. I can get my boosters every 6 months (or maybe we'll make it 4 months if that ends up more effective).

&amp;#x200B;

I haven’t been outside of Japan throughout this pandemic, so my observations are limited, however, it’s interesting to notice the differences in attitudes towards this pandemic between Japan and most western countries.  It seems to go a little like this:  
  
(West) / (Japan)  
  
This whole thing is China’s fault.  /  Wherever this came from, this is dangerous.  The world outside of Japan is dangerous.  
  
(At beginning)  Psh.  A mask won’t do anything.  You think a little paper mask is going to protect you from a deadly virus?  /  We don’t know how bad this is, but the least we can do is cover our mouths and noses.  
  
(The government early on) This is getting out of hand.  We better shut everything down.  Sorry, everyone.  Sorry, economy.  /  How can we deal with this in the most unobtrusive way?  Let’s put out some recommendations and send everyone a mask.  
  
(Some people)  I’m not going to wear a mask.  It’s my right not to.  I will fight for this right.  I don’t care if the hospitals are overflowing.  /  It’s pretty easy to wear a mask, it doesn’t hurt me, and it could save others.  
  
(Most people)  I’ll just do as the government tells us.  It seems fair enough.  /  Politicians aren’t the best people out there.  Let’s just use our common sense.  
  
(At beginning)  Dr. Dingleberry from the USA says we shouldn’t wear masks, and that sounds about right to me.  /  Didn’t we learn in elementary school that viruses spread through bodily fluids?  
  
I’m clean enough.  Everything’s good.  /  (綺麗 (kirei) is a Japanese word that both means beauty and cleanliness.  In other words, beauty is inseparable from cleanliness.)  
  
Alright.  I’m vaxxed.  Time to take off the mask and get on with it.  /  The pandemic is still on, so why would I take off my mask, even if I’m vaxxed?  I’ve been wearing a mask in public for a  year and a half.  It’s really not a difficult thing to do.  Of course I can take it off now and then, like when I’m eating, as long as I am smart about it.  Just keep a steady, balanced standpoint.  
  
(Government)  Don’t let the people move around.  Keep them in little bubbles.  /  Let’s just make some more suggestions about not getting together in big groups.  By the way, people aren’t traveling much in Japan.  Let’s make some domestic travel incentives so the economy doesn’t tank.

Let's say hypothetically that out of 100 people, only 5 people are vaccinated.  If 20 people are hospitalized, the odds of that 5 being included in that list *regardless of vaccination* are low.  It's just probabilities that if you had to pick 20 numbers out of 100 you're not likely to get many of that sample of 5 included.

Now flip this around -- let's say that 95 out of 100 people are vaccinated and 20 are hospitalized.  It will be literally flip things around and show that more vaccinated people would be hospitalized entirely because of the math.

Note that in both of these scenarios, I've completely ignored the actual odds that come into play with vaccine efficacy.  In the real world, the vaccines are effective enough to help a tremendous number of people not get sick and not go to the hospital.  We can't compare delta to the original COVID-19 because we know that delta sends more people to the hospital.  Instead we kind of have to rely on scientific models to imagine what the hospitalization rate would be if it were alpha instead of delta.

Also, there will still be a relatively small number of breakthrough cases that require hospitalization especially with people who have other health issues.  I have a friend with cancer and he's undergoing chemotherapy and it sounds like his doctor is going to want to have him get frequent COVID boosters because his immune system is being suppressed by the chemo.

This doesnt mean the vaccine doesnt work though. In UK more people are vaccinated than not, so its only logical given the high overall infection rate and no countermeasures that also many vaccinated get infected. But this is somewhat a selection bias, because one doesnt automatically compare this to a society without the vaccine, many more would get infected, get symptomatic and die. Not only does the vaccine protect from severe illness and death but also from infection, viral load and reduces and shortens transmission from breakthrough cases. There is also waning of protection, a new variant and reduced effectiveness in high risk patients. Overall studies show that vaccines still prevent many infections.

German health authority RKI says:

&gt; How can you explain that the higher the vaccination rate, there are more and more vaccination breakthroughs?

&gt; It is to be expected that more and more vaccination breakthroughs will occur as the vaccination rate increases. As the vaccination rate rises, proportionally more and more people are expected to be vaccinated. The relationship between vaccination breakthroughs and the vaccination rate is shown graphically in the diagram below. This is not an indication that the vaccines are not effective, but can be explained by the following:

&gt; (1) The effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccinations is very good, but not 100%.

&gt; This means that although the vaccines are very effective, they cannot prevent all infections in people who have been vaccinated. However, they ensure that infections are much less common (see FAQ Can people who are fully vaccinated continue to transmit the virus?) And that serious COVID-19 disease courses become very rare in those who have been vaccinated.

&gt; (2) If the vaccination rate rises, then the probability also rises that the vaccinated part of the population will also include infected.

&gt; This means: if the proportion of vaccinated people in the population increases, then the probability also increases that among all people who become infected or fall ill, vaccinated people may be affected. Put simply: if all people in a population are vaccinated (vaccination rate 100%), the percentage of breakthroughs in vaccination among those infected is 100% (if a vaccine is not 100% effective).

&gt; (3) The number of breakthroughs also depends on the number of active cases. The more active cases there are, the higher the likelihood of being infected as a vaccinated person.

&gt; This means: if there is little or no circulation of the pathogen in the population, the likelihood of infection decreases, and with it the number of vaccination breakthroughs. Put simply: if the pathogen does not circulate at all, there are no vaccination breakthroughs. https://www.rki.de/SharedDocs/FAQ/COVID-Impfen/FAQ_Liste_Wirksamkeit.html",,,,1634912678,{},hhmgks2,False,t3_qdbbe0,False,False,t1_hhm7ve7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qdbbe0/daily_discussion_thread_october_22_2021/hhmgks2/,1635056397.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is frustrating in the extreme. I'm a ""Boomer"", by one year. I know the value of societal consciousness. I know that we live in a relative societal desert - unless we grew up in an enclave of immigrants who chose to hold true to their values. 

My family came to America from Ireland on one side, and Germany and Austria on the other. Both families dropped their cultural identities and became ""Americans"", grasping at American holidays like Thanksgiving and the 4th of July. 

America is *good, strong, resilient* was their motto. It was only that because of safeguards to workers like unions, pensions, and company paid healthcare. Since 1980 all of these protections have been eroded. One has to save for one's self, using IRAs or the like to hold one's own money. There's very little job security. Rents are skyrocketing due to lack of laws preventing raises on the poor and working classes - something that was implemented in NYC - rent control. 

So here we are: a new generation with no cultural identity, stripped of protections built before the boom, being thrust into a pandemic with no knowledge of how to cope. This group is panicking like the villagers in a vampire novel. They are running around at night bearing torches and pitchforks, accusing their neighbors and scholars of witchcraft.

That's great, but I'm not sure why you sound so angry that other states that aren't in as good of a situation haven't been able to do that yet.

I don’t care what other states do. Why would you insinuate that about me? Just because we don’t have a mask mandate doesn’t mean we have been allowed to socially move on. Outdoor events are still cancelled in the name of Covid. Businesses are still cheapening out and hiding behind Covid as their reasons (the other day I cited an example that theaters here don’t allow free popcorn refills anymore “in the name of Covid” yet it’s perfectly okay to be maskless in the theater. No, they’re just trying to save money). Hygiene theater, not genuine Covid counter measures, are still taken hold. My University’s library will have workers barge into a privately booked study room, *get up close to the student* to tell them to wear mask even if they were alone. I don’t want society to devolve into hygiene theater after Covid like we did with security theater after 9/11.

&gt; though I would defer to your medical professionals to see whether or not THEY think the system is overburdened

Our governors’ health advisors says our state is fine without restrictions and that individuals are okay to make their own decisions as long as they are vaccinated. So what do you want?

For some reason you kept posting irresponsible states that are doing bad as a counter notion that I as a vaccinated individual in a vaccinated state should restrict myself.

An  immunologic  test  for  SARS-CoV-2  seroconversion (ELISA and/or SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin assay) based on SARS-CoV-2 N protein, will be performed to identify cases of asymptomatic infection. This assay will be performed on samples obtained at Day 1 (pre-vaccination), Day 71, 6 months, and 1 year after vaccination.

More from [The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/article/S1473-3099\(20\)30773-8/fulltext), which is where a lot of this study data is analyzed:

&gt; Although some countries might deploy COVID-19 vaccines on the strength of safety and immunogenicity data alone, the goal of vaccine development is to gain direct evidence of vaccine efficacy in protecting humans against SARS-CoV-2 **infection** and COVID-19 so that manufacture of efficacious vaccines can be selectively upscaled. A candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 might act against infection, disease, or transmission, and a vaccine capable of reducing any of these elements could contribute to disease control. 

When these vaccines were brought to market, it was believed at the time they were effective against not just disease, but infection. Now they're still pretty effective against disease, but they're not that effective against infection.

While it's great that vaccinated people seldom get severe disease, since they are [still getting infected fairly regularly](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/10/pfizer-covid-vaccine-90-effective-vs-hospitalization-study-finds) (contrary to what we hoped), immunizing people will not necessarily lead to herd immunity. That's an important thing to understand. It's not good, but it's not the worst case scenario either.

Here is the tweet, where the guy notes on the report in red that there were 45 deaths of vaccinated people, but for some reason writes 45% in the tweet:

I have found no real sources for my claim; it's absed on my memory of last year's events. The point is that the timeline looked like this: Up until the 3rd ir 4th week of March 2020, officials claimed that Covid was not a prevalent problem in Russia. Then they changed tack and started halfhearted lockdowns. Until about June/July (Euro games) when they let everyone into the stadiums and pretended there was no problem with Covid, for propagandistic purposes (to be fair, the British government did the same). The claim was, that Corona in Russia was ""in retreat"".

And as some of the articles below point out, Putin has always shied away from telling people the truth, instead leaving it to the lower ranks to announce unpopular measures. That weakens any response right from the start.

Replication errors cause mutations.   The mutations that are more infectious or can replicate faster will spread faster and out compete existing variants.  

There is no evolutionary pressure driving the mutations.

[],,PeonSanders,,,[],,,,text,t2_53uhs,False,False,,"I believe that risk aversion and mask wearing in those areas, especially for kids, are why the case loads aren't as high as they are in the UK, combined with the fact that whole segments of the population weren't vaccinated at all. You don't need to evaluate the case load at the beginning of delta, you can compare where it was at after the UK's initial spike, to what the UKs case load is now, and the difference in vaccination between that point, and where even New England is at now, is not that significant in terms of spread.

There are significant policy differences though.  A huge number of kids are testing positive and driving cases, and this population is entirely unmasked in the UK. They aren't in New England, there are plenty of mask mandates. If people wholly abandon that mitigation, as they have done in the UK, the case load will worsen, even in areas of higher vaccination, in the winter.

I'm well aware of the vaccination rates in both places. I live in Rhode Island, and I'm currently in the UK. I'm not ""super cautious"" as that fact alone demonstrates, as I came here to see my parents after 2 years, with my 3 month old and 4 year old. 

The reason that Delta was worse in the UK vs here initially was dumb luck and timing. There's a chance that these areas currently also have slightly higher natural immunity as well, and that the AZ vaccine is less effective.

But, from what I've seen, the most stark difference is behavioral. In one place 1% of people are wearing masks. In the other, a many times more are, including by mandate. So, socially it isn't it, thankfully. I imagine that will change further with pediatric vaccinations. 

Your idea that the Delta wave is over because you believe it will follow a pattern similar to previous waves rather ignores the UK NOW. You need not think about what the differences were when restrictions were lifted, or when Delta began. 

You believe that Delta has had a months long plateau in the UK rising to a second peak, but it won't in the Northeast, because vaccination rates are a couple percentage points higher there?

As for this Irish case, more info would be required to find out why their case numbers are so high. When were the majority of people vaccinated? What are the demographics? Is it a town that could facilitate a lot of transmission in under 18’s?

&gt;TO THE EDITOR:

&gt;Ivermectin is approved by the Food and Drug Administration as an oral treatment for intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis and as a topical treatment for pediculosis and rosacea. It is also used as a treatment for parasites in pets and livestock. Ivermectin may decrease severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication in vitro,[1,2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2114907?query=TOC&amp;cid=NEJM%20eToc,%20October%2021,%202021%20DM395995_#) but randomized, controlled trials have shown no clinical benefit in the prevention or treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).[3](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2114907?query=TOC&amp;cid=NEJM%20eToc,%20October%2021,%202021%20DM395995_#) Veterinary use of ivermectin has increased, and the number of prescriptions for use by humans in the United States is 24 times as high as the number before the pandemic. Moreover, the number of such prescriptions in August 2021 was 4 times as high as the number in July 2021.[3,4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2114907?query=TOC&amp;cid=NEJM%20eToc,%20October%2021,%202021%20DM395995_#)

&gt;The Oregon Poison Center is a telephone consultative center staffed by specialty-trained nurses, pharmacists, and physicians who provide treatment advice for the public and comprehensive treatment consultation for health care workers caring for patients in Oregon, Alaska, and Guam. The center has recently received an increasing number of calls regarding ivermectin exposure related to Covid-19. The rate of calls regarding ivermectin had been 0.25 calls per month in 2020 and had increased to 0.86 calls per month from January through July 2021; in August 2021, the center received 21 calls. Monthly total call volumes for all poison exposures were stable throughout 2020 and 2021.

&gt;Of the 21 persons who called in August, 11 were men, and most were older than 60 years of age (median age, 64; range, 20 to 81). Approximately half (11 persons) were reported to have used ivermectin to prevent Covid-19, and the remaining persons had been using the drug to treat Covid-19 symptoms. Three persons had received prescriptions from physicians or veterinarians, and 17 had purchased veterinary formulations; the source of ivermectin for the remaining person was not confirmed. Symptoms had developed in most persons within 2 hours after a large, single, first-time dose. In 6 persons, symptoms had developed gradually after several days to weeks of repeated doses taken every other day or twice weekly. One person had also been taking vitamin D to treat or prevent Covid-19. Reported doses ingested by the persons who had been using veterinary products ranged from 6.8 mg to 125 mg of 1.87% paste and 20 to 50 mg of the 1% solution. The dose of the human-use tablets was 21 mg per dose twice weekly for prevention.

&gt;Six of the 21 persons were hospitalized for toxic effects from ivermectin use; all 6 reported preventive use, including the 3 who had obtained the drug by prescription. Four received care in an intensive care unit, and none died. Symptoms were gastrointestinal distress in 4 persons, confusion in 3, ataxia and weakness in 2, hypotension in 2, and seizures in 1. Of the persons who were not admitted to a hospital, most had gastrointestinal distress, dizziness, confusion, vision symptoms, or rash.

&gt;These cases illustrate the potential toxic effects of ivermectin, including severe episodes of confusion, ataxia, seizures, and hypotension, and the increasing frequency of inappropriate use. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of ivermectin to treat or prevent Covid-19,[3](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2114907?query=TOC&amp;cid=NEJM%20eToc,%20October%2021,%202021%20DM395995_#) and improper use, as well as the possible occurrence of medication interactions,[5](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2114907?query=TOC&amp;cid=NEJM%20eToc,%20October%2021,%202021%20DM395995_#) may result in serious side effects requiring hospitalization.

Vaccines reduce risk by ~20-100x. Risk is directly proportional to case rate. If the case rate is 20-100x higher that cancels out the benefit from vaccination.

Basically, it boils down to the dark side of the right to free speech.

You have to remember that the 1st amendment to the US Constitution is essentially our version of a sacred cow, and that almost nothing can be done to limit it, in large part because of how it's written.

As much as I would love to see laws prohibiting and punishing hate speech and speech that hurts others, I doubt that it will ever happen except in only the most extreme possible cases.

NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The Pfizer (PFE.N)/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine showed 90.7% efficacy against the coronavirus in a clinical trial of children 5 to 11 years old, the U.S. drugmaker said on Friday.  
  
Sixteen children in the trial who had received a placebo got COVID-19, compared with 3 who were vaccinated, Pfizer said in briefing documents submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  
  
Because more than twice as many children in the 2,268-participant trial were given the vaccine than placebo, that equates to better than 90% efficacy.  
  
Pfizer's clinical trial in those 5 to 11 years old was not primarily designed to measure efficacy against the virus. Instead, it compared the amount of neutralizing antibodies induced by the vaccine in the children to the response of older recipients in their adult trial.  
  
Based on those results, Pfizer and BioNTech said last month that their COVID-19 vaccine induced a robust immune response in the children.",,,,1634907010,{},hhm3plu,True,t3_qdg7sh,False,False,t3_qdg7sh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qdg7sh/pfizerbiontech_covid19_vaccine_shows_907_efficacy/hhm3plu/,1635049855.0,58,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,WackyBeachJustice,,,[],,,,text,t2_rhdlxun,False,True,,"Just my 2 cents, a complete layman, with a degree in something completely unrelated to subject at hand.  It has become clear to me, as it has to Israel, that the only real way out **presently** is to continue maintaining really high levels of antibodies.  That's it, as we stand here today, that's the only way out.  The WHO (and their minions) are dead wrong for denying boosting at all cost in the name of equity.  Scarcity is not the limiting factor now, and withholding of boosters will not in any way meaningfully change the supply around the developing world.  It has been discussed, beaten to death, by many many people in the know.  So at this point, the call for equity at all cost is merely one of ""If they can't have it, you can't have it, period"".  IMHO these people have blood on their hands.

It's also extremely disingenuous to force feed us that VE against hospitalization/death is the only thing that matters.  We're not stupid.  We understand that 90% VE against severe outcomes when we have sky high cases still produces a lot of bad outcomes.  Still produces spread, etc.  It's hypocritical to ask us to implement NPIs such as masking to control spread, while simultaneously telling us that VE against infection is irrelevant.

As I'm looking at the [Israeli Dashboard](https://datadashboard.health.gov.il/COVID-19/general) this morning.  Their positivity rate is down to 1.19%, which skyrocketed to something like 6-7% just a few months ago, on an already fairly highly vaccinated population, with a very obviously waning immunity.

My comments are primarily directed at the people in these threads chomping at the bit for their booster when they likely don’t meet the criteria. 

My point is; we aren’t going to boost our way out of the pandemic, not with these sets of vaccines that wane in protection against infection (not severe disease) within a few months. 

This doesn’t mean the vaccines are bad, it’s just coming down to reality, for myself included, that they aren’t the miracle cure we thought. Furthermore, compared to other vaccines they do have a higher rate of complications and therefore regular boosters carry a risk. 

We need to focus on getting the first series to the rest of the world and every who hasn’t had it yet, then the vulnerable with boosters, then maybe a booster for general public at some point. This is what the FDA has essentially authorized and said in panels, I’m just pointing out the unsaid parts.

Will vaccinated people get it? Sure.  But spread in a fully vaccinated population is very different than a mixed vaccination population (mathematically, cut out any single exponential multiplier and you get a very different result; cut out multiple and you get a very very different result).

Other than restrictions, the next best thing that can be done to limit spread is getting as many people as vaccinated as possible.

I know there is a sentiment that because vaccines are very effective at preventing death, its the unvaccinated people that are driving the deaths. While this is true in places like the US which have a fair number of unvaccinated elderly, it's not as true in the UK.

More than 1,100 people are hospitalized in Colorado with confirmed cases of COVID-19, the highest number since last December. What is different this time, though, is the state has largely reopened, meaning hospitals are also filling up with victims of car accidents and other day-to-day events.  
During normal times, the state’s intensive care units would operate at about 68% full, said Scott Bookman, the state health department’s COVID-19 incident commander. Now, though, Colorado’s hospital ICUs are operating at around 90% of capacity, running the risk that they could be overwhelmed if the surge of coronavirus cases continues.

The rising levels of concern in Colorado stand in contrast to what is happening in the nation at large. Across the United States, coronavirus cases and hospitalizations are falling.  
During the previous several months, while the virus’ delta variant tore through health care systems around the country, Colorado had managed to have some of the lowest hospitalization and case rates in the country. Now, Colorado has the 10th-highest infection rate and 20th-highest hospitalization rate among all states, according to The New York Times’ case tracker.  
Since the beginning of October, about 20 people a day in Colorado have died with COVID-19. As recently as this summer, that number was around four or five people a day.

It's a quadratic fit to cumulative confirmed cases on 15 consecutive days. It's a decent fit, but it's not exact.

If they lied ""for the greater good"" about mask efficacy at the start of the pandemic, then one could be justified in asking whether they're lying ""for the greater good"" about vaccine efficacy now. Another example: the CDC isn't strongly recommending widespread use of N95 even KN95 or FFP2 masks, just because they're afraid people might interpret that as a departure from their original stance that cloth masks are good enough.

When any public agency starts issuing guidelines not based on scientific judgment but based on considerations (political or otherwise) targeted to elicit a certain outcome among the public, that's when they lose long-term credibility, certainly in my mind. The CDC's job is to communicate to people, in a manner as easy to understand as possible, the best available scientific information at any moment. What political leaders or ordinary citizens do with that information should be none of the CDC's business. They should have stated the full truth right from the beginning: ""based on prior experience with similar diseases, we believe masks, ideally N95, might help in controlling spread; but we will update this communique with more information as it becomes available.""

If hospitals aren't overwhelmed, there's relatively few treatment delays.

There are also costs to *not* returning to life as normal. Having a beer at a bar actually is part of normalcy, and normalcy is part of everyone's mental health (bars are open almost everywhere anyway). 15% of businesses that temporarily closed during COVID are now gone forever, affecting with the livelihoods of their owners and staff, including their health insurance and ability to find care. A couple of my friends are in the field of psychology and this year has been *brutal* for them; most are turning away patients because they're already over-extended.

Normalcy is pretty important for the mental, economic, and social wellbeing of people. And at this point, severe COVID among the vaccinated is statistically pretty anomalous. The affects of mitigation are becoming more problematic. The UK, Spain, and most Nordic countries have returned to normalcy and dropped mask mandates, dropped social distancing, and are braving the waters of uncertainty with vaccines to protect them.

&gt; “It means instead of the virus being able to hop from person to person to person to person, spreading and spreading, sickening some of them but not all of them, and the ones it does't sicken don't know they have it and they give it to more people,” Maddow explained, “Potentially mutating and becoming more virulent and drug resistant along the way, now we know that the vaccines work well enough that the virus stops with every vaccinated person.”

&gt; When Walensky said vaccinated people “don’t carry the virus,” she was likely referring, somewhat loosely, to this low incidence of asymptomatic infections.

[They're both important](https://www.thelancet.com/article/S1473-3099(20)30773-8/fulltext): *A candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 might act against infection, disease, or transmission, and a vaccine capable of reducing any of these elements could contribute to disease control.*

&gt; Just think about it logically. If a covid positive patient sneezes next to you and the droplets enter your nose, the virus will enter your system. Due to vax even if the viral load is low, you might be diagnosed positive even if you’re asymptomatic. This bunch of asymptomatic ppl technically are a part of the 95% number as they don’t have any symptoms. No vax in the world stops virus from entering the system (physically impossible), but it stops/ limits it from replicating through a proper immune response.

I'm not arguing with you, we agree.

I'm suggesting that it seems likely that based on the available data, the *higher viral loads* in the Delta variant are causing the vaccines to be less effective at *preventing transmission*, even if they are still effective at preventing disease.

That's an important distinction to understand.

You should still get vaccinated, because preventing disease is great, but we should prepare for the possibility that vaccinated populations won't necessarily have herd immunity to transmission.",,,,1634924045,{},hhn8m0e,False,t3_qd1rej,False,True,t1_hhn2z0b,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qd1rej/irish_city_with_997_per_cent_vaccinated_over_18/hhn8m0e/,1635070569.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;There are 10 people with Covid-19 in University Hospital Waterford, according to the latest HSE update - one of those is being treated in ICU.

&gt;It's a jump up from 7 on the previous 24 hours.

&gt;It's the highest number of cases on site there since March 31st.

&gt;Meanwhile, the latest CSO statistics indicate that one person has died in Waterford due to the virus in the week ending October 1st.

&gt;The total number of deaths from the virus in the county since the pandemic began is 110

Population: 53,504 

Being vaccinated doesn't mean you DON'T GET a virus, it means your body knows how to KICK IT'S BUTT.

Don't confuse the two things

[],,Coviddiscussion,,,[],,,,text,t2_6fbp97lr,False,False,,"This article is pro-vax but it aproaches vaccination from a realistic perspective. It prepares for the next step and tries to explain how this next step is possible.

The vaccine (and this will come as a shock for many people) is not meant to prevent all infections,that merely is a positive side effect for the first few months. It would be nice if the vaccine was able to prevent all infections forever but that simply is not the case and this article explains why that doesnt neccesarily have to be a problem.

The idea is,and some countries have already adopted this idea by beeing slow with boosters,to get everyone vaccinated once. This first vaccination reduces infections but the most important thing is that it trains the immune system to handle future infections better.

After overcoming the inevitable first infection with help of the training it got from the vaccine the immune system will keep learning and (hopefully) eventually be able to deal with all future infections without the need for booster shots.

Booster shots are meant to prevent any infection but that seems to be an unrealistic aproach in the long run. You would have to vaccinate the whole population every 6 months and this is not how the immune system works in general (though it does for some situations). The immune system doesnt prevent infections,it deals with infections once they are there. And that is what the vaccins are meant for,to give the immune system a headstart in dealing with the first infection.

I have noticed people have unrealistic expectations from the vaccins and also that people dont fully see what the endgame is for this pandemic. 6 months boosters to keep titters high are not the endgame,and probably also not desireable from a medical point of vieuw (the human body slowly breaks down titters for a reason,as this article also briefly mentions).

Maybe if all this was explained better to the general public it could help convince more people to become vaccinated. The vaccine is not meant to stop all infections,its merely meant to give your immune system a headstart for the inevitable first infection.

If this aproach is works in reality is yet to be seen,it could be that it is not after which something else will have to be tried.

&gt;the most esteemed, intelligent individuals in the world are now looked at like they’re idiots

You say ""now"" but we've been cultivating anti-intellectualism for decades.

TV shows like [Happy Days](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0070992) painted the book-smart character as a ""nerd"" or ""square"" or ""bookworm"", and rarely in a positive light. They also had a ""cool"" character who was ""street-smart"" and sometimes resorts to brute force to solve problems.

Even with a show or movie where the ""nerdy"" character is the *main* character, you typically get at least one scene where they are bullied, and their attacker is usually depicted as handsome, strong, and successful -- in a school, the bully is usually the football star; outside of that, they might be an astronaut or high ranking military figure.

In Billy Joel's song [*It's Still Rock and Roll To Me*](https://youtu.be/5eAQa4MOGkE) you get lyrics like this:

&gt; Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?

You haven't had Covid-19 yet. That's great. I assume you're doing a rapid test. False negatives happen often enough. Keep that in mind. 

Unvaccinated people are dying every day. Maybe you'll get it and survive. Maybe you'll get it and survive yet have weeks, months, or years of problems thanks to long covid. Maybe you'll get it and die. Maybe you'll *never* get it. This is true for every vaccinated and unvaccinated person alike.

However, being unvaccinated means you are *more susceptible* to getting Covid. That means you are more likely to die or get seriously I'll, *but it also means* you are more likely to spread it to others, unvaccinated and vaccinated alike, but more so to the unvaccinated. Maybe those it spread to have young children or immunocompromised family or friends that they have now exposed to the virus. Or maybe the person is immunocompromised themselves. Do you want to risk killing someone in your life because you won't get vaccinated? It could be a co-worker. A co-worker's spouse or child. Your mail delivery person. Someone in a store in your town. 

The virus is also just having a good time out there largely thanks to the unvaccinated, mutating every so often as it spreads and makes copies of itself. We don't know where these mutations will lead: maybe to something worse than delta variant, or maybe something not that bad at all. 

tl;dr 1) Because of the circumstances of being unvaccinated, you have more chance to spread it those in your life.  2) Teenage Mutant Ninja Covid. 

If you legitimately can't get the vaccine for some reason, that's fine. 

If you are skipping it because you're scared, think it's a conspiracy, or a hundred other dumb as shit reasons, then you're part the problem.

A bit flip is so rare it shouldn’t really be considered here. A random bit flip due to cosmic radiation isn’t what causes “computer issues” like this.

Their software should have prevented this, and at least popped up a dialog box saying “are you sure you want to get fired?”.

Please double check my first comment.

The first and second doses of the Moderna vaccine are the same.

The 3rd shot of the Moderna vaccine (which everyone is referring to as a booster shot) is different from the first and second.

The only difference is the dosage.

The 1st and 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine use the exact same dosage.

The 3rd one (the booster) uses half the dosage of the 1st and 2nd.

That's the only difference.

However, please speak with the pharmacist and clarify whether that is okay for your mom.

Which would result in reduced spread in both the control and experimental groups of the adults.

Here's some made up numbers to help this make sense to you.

All 4 groups are 15k.

Infections among each group:

Control Kids: 200

Control Adults: 100

Experimental Kids: 20

Experimental Adults: 5

So, kids are yuckier than adults which is why they spread it more in the control group, but you can see that there isn't that same 2x gap in the experimental group because the efficacy is higher in adults than kids.

[],,LukeLC,,,[],,,,text,t2_jgopy,False,False,[],"This question kind of gave me pause. You know what, I'm actually not sure. But I feel like I should find some that can communicate what I've learned the hard way. My own parents weren't the best example, but I was lucky enough to find other examples out there who helped me see what a real parent should be like (even if they weren't trying to teach me).

The simplest way I can put it is, with every decision you make as a parent, you should be asking yourself: what's going to help make my kid the best version of themselves that they can be? (Note: *not* ""the best version of *myself* that they can be."")

It might sound shallow, but I promise it's not. Sometimes it means teaching (which is a three step process: ""I do, we do, you do"") and sometimes it means letting go so they develop their own independence. Building practical competence, social integrity, critical thinking, and emotional maturity is incredibly nuanced. No parent is going to be perfect at it, but at least communicating those values will give kids a fighting chance.

Fauci has arguably been a net negative during the COVID era because of his role eroding public trust by spreading misinformation about crucial pandemic topics \[1\]:

  
The early **dismissal of masks**. The story is complicated, but it is clearly not simply a matter of evolving science. As Slate's writers put it in ""The Noble Lies of COVID-19"":

&gt;One thing is beyond a doubt, however: One of those two statements \[on masks\] did not accurately reflect the evidence as Fauci saw it. Such high-profile mixed messages in a short time frame, without substantive new data to justify the change, generated confusion and a backlash from politicians, other experts, and the general public.

His knowingly false (by his own words!) **estimates of the herd immunity threshold**. Some part of these revisions were related to new data, but [as Donald McNeil wrote in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/health/herd-immunity-covid-coronavirus.html), Fauci had been deliberately withholding his real analysis:

&gt;Dr. Fauci acknowledged that he had slowly but deliberately been moving the goal posts. He is doing so, he said, partly based on new science, and partly on his gut feeling that the country is finally ready to hear what he really thinks.

Other times, he just admits to being concerned with the consequences of communicating the truth, rather than disseminating knowledge. For example, in early 2021, [he said of switching to a ""first shots first"" strategy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/03/01/fauci-defends-two-shot-strategy/):

&gt;We’re telling people \[two shots\] is what you should do … and then we say, ‘Oops, we changed our mind’?” Fauci said. “I think that would be a messaging challenge, to say the least.”

I mean ... he's right, but if you're paying attention and reading that in March 2021, it's becoming increasingly harder to take anything he says at face value anymore.

TL;DR: Hero scientist undermines Americans' trust in experts during COVID.

I travel a lot for business anyway and I own property in Florida, so when the restrictions returned in August, I started staying here. I plan to stay here until the crazy is done in California. Unfortunately, I have to return periodically and I dread it. Many of my friends did the same thing, most of them sooner than I did. I kind of went with it for the first 15 months, but once we had a majority of the community vaccinated, the restrictions were unnecessary (in my opinion). 

The school issue is a big one and one we will be dealing with for a very long time. It was unnecessary to shut them down for 18 months. Other communities reopened long before California and did so with few issues. I am also opposed to mask in schools. I believe it is developmentally harmful to children. They are largely unaffected by covid and their parents are likely vaccinated. They should not be wearing masks. 

You mention impoverished communities. Imagine being a minimum or near minimum wage worker through this. Many lost their jobs.

It is not easy to talk about the cost benefit analysis of restrictions. This is why we have professionals that are supposed to do it for us. Unfortunately, the ones in California failed. I disagree with most policies and politics in Florida, but I can see the public health response produced a much better result than California. It was far more balanced and resulted in a community that will rebound more quickly and with less assistance. Yes, it resulted in more deaths, but not dramatically so. In fact, until vaccinations became available, the per capita death rate was not much worse than California. Unfortunately, once vaccines became available the politics of Florida slowed vaccination. 

At this point, if someone gets covid and dies from it, it is likely because they are unvaccinated. This is a choice they made.

COVID protection seems to be a combination of...

1. Robust antibody response. (Which clearly wanes with time and is most effective short term)
2. Rapidly responding strong immune systems that are trained to recognize it (T/B-Cells)
3. First or second option responding faster than whatever the most dominant variant is (Delta in this case, with a much higher viral load).

Thus, the data points to the idea that younger and healthier populations with any of the 3 vaccines can overcome most current variants and protect breakthroughs most successfully when 1 and 2 are in effect, but likely still keep the virus at bay even when they have 2 only. Breakthroughs still seem very rare among this crowd, even when 1 wanes. The elderly or immunocompromised don't have 1 and are not able have 2 produce the effects of 3 in time to stop the faster replicating and more virulent Delta variant, hence breakthroughs.

Personally, I'm young and don't mind boosters (I'm scheduled for one today, at least in theory), but I don't think it's still fully clear how much risk there is in transmission between a younger vs older population yet. Evidence points to those with weaker immune systems now being the most vulnerable to breakthroughs and worse outcomes.

You haven't had Covid-19 yet. That's great. I assume you're doing a rapid test. False negatives happen often enough. Keep that in mind. 

Unvaccinated people are dying every day. Maybe you'll get it and survive. Maybe you'll get it and survive yet have weeks, months, or years of problems thanks to long covid. Maybe you'll get it and die. Maybe you'll *never* get it. This is true for every vaccinated and unvaccinated person alike.

However, being unvaccinated means you are *more susceptible* to getting Covid. That means you are more likely to die or get seriously I'll, *but it also means* you are more likely to spread it to others, unvaccinated and vaccinated alike, but more so to the unvaccinated. Maybe those it spread to have young children or immunocompromised family or friends that they have now exposed to the virus. Or maybe the person is immunocompromised themselves. Do you want to risk killing someone in your life because you won't get vaccinated? It could be a co-worker. A co-worker's spouse or child. Your mail delivery person. Someone in a store in your town. 

The virus is also just having a good time out there largely thanks to the unvaccinated, mutating every so often as it spreads and makes copies of itself. We don't know where these mutations will lead: maybe to something worse than delta variant, or maybe something not that bad at all. 

tl;dr 1) Because of the circumstances of being unvaccinated, you have more chance to spread it those in your life.  2) Teenage Mutant Ninja Covid.
