I’m a senior in high school right now, I’m doing a hybrid model but our school got COVID so we’re all at home for a while. Before, we would do in class learning (mostly watch class videos on your chromebook and ask the teacher questions if you want) and asynchronous at home. That part all sucked. 

The teachers couldn’t give active instruction because they have to manage at home kids and do grades while we’re in class, so we gained little from actually being there, except the few teachers who decided eff it, they’ll actively teach in the class. The good side was getting work done was easier when you’re at school, and you get to interact with your peers

At home, we would complete assignments in google classroom and watch more class videos, not interacting with anybody and often turning things in late because of lack of structure. We did get a lot more sleep though

Now that we’re at home only, we’re doing zooms all day 4 days a week. No meaningful contact with peers (you can’t hold a conversation with your friend during zooms). The zooms being synchronous helped me greatly. I really suffer when I don’t get the chance to interact with my teachers and ask them questions, and now I have the structure that I am able to get my work done on time. In addition to this, school starts later so I get better sleep

I always argued for the hybrid learning model, because I need to interact with my teachers and friends, but with the way that my school has been handling it, school from home has been better for me academically, though social interactions still suffer.

I am of the opinion that things will be more or less normal by then anyway. Where I live, things are pretty damn near close to normal right now unfortunately. I don’t see our state keeping what few restrictions we have in place after the vulnerable have access to a vaccine. 

What we are going to do is, if there is a vulnerable guest who has not been vaccinated, that guest can’t come. There are only about 10 vulnerable guests though out of 60 and they are all pretty reasonable so I suspect they will be fine.

At that point, my thought is that everyone can make the call for themselves. Vast majority of guests are under 35 and healthy.

The members of the board were crying because their vote was pretty split to either go completely remote, or allow students to pick which one they wanted.  

A week before that meeting the whole band had to quarantine, because someone tested positive during their band camp week.  They ended up allowing students to pick whether they would want to go in school or remote learn.  It seems like every week a certain section of each school has to send kids home to quarantine because someone tested positive.  Oh, and cases in our county have grown by the thousands following the return to school. 

I completely understand the issues placed on families with a single parent that is working, and can’t support having a young child on remote learning home alone all day. What baffles me is after going to remote learning back in February of this year, the district had no exact plan in place until the last minute.

If people could just take this seriously we would be done by now, or at least in a much better state.  Like just wear a mask and stop going out for pointless stuff.

[],,jdorje,,,[],,,,text,t2_ii7rl,False,False,[],"This article, and no doubt many other opinion pieces, seem to be saying that ending the mink industry was unnecessary.  This is false, for two reasons.

This specific mutation spread easily in minks, but we do not know if it spread well in humans (most likely it did not).  But this strain would constantly spread in mink farms and jump to humans, and it would eventually mutate into something that was contagious in humans. Once it infects a human that is already infected by another strain at the same time, it can exchange genetic material and end up with any combination of mutations from either strain.  Based on the number of people who they estimate caught the new strain and the percentage of Denmark currently infected, it is most likely this hasn't happened yet.  But it absolutely would if a reservoir for the strain remained in mink farms with hundreds of thousands of animals in close proximity.

Second, coronavirus in mink farms is constantly jumping back and forth between humans and mink, and it has a huge population of mink in which to constantly spread.

Unfortunately it's not that simple. School is very important, but data from around the world is showing that schools are one of the primary sources of outbreaks, second only to LTCs in most cases. In theory, we should be closing or locking down drivers of outbreaks. But the reaction if schools were shut down and restaurants, gyms, hair salons, etc. (all with significantly lower instances of being the sources of infections - we're talking 3% vs 50% in some places) were allowed to be open is exactly what you said. Covid infections acquired in schools trickle into the general population. In this case, should schools be kept open at all costs? There's no straight answer.

My old school has done 100% hybrid - i.e. all remote students are in the same 'class' as the few in-person students, they just get a live feed of the class instead of being sat in the room.

However, the small number of outbreaks reported among teaching or associated staff to date suggests that spread of COVID-19 within educational settings may be limited.

&gt;As children generally have milder illness and fewer symptoms, cases may sometimes go unnoticed. Importantly, early data from studies suggest that infection rates among teenagers may be higher than in younger children.

&gt;Considering that many countries are starting to slowly lift restrictions on activities, the longer-term effects of keeping schools open on community transmission are yet to be evaluated. Some modelling studies suggest that school re-opening might have a small effect on wider transmission in the community, but this is not well understood. Further studies are underway on the role of children in transmission in and outside of educational settings. WHO is collaborating with scientists around the world to develop protocols that countries can use to study COVID-19 transmission in educational institutions.

[],,littlesauceplease,,,[],,,,text,t2_2x3zrfnv,False,False,[],"A couple reasons why that won’t happen. First and most importantly, vaccines tend to be more dangerous / less effective for these populations. These are the people who rely on everyone else to get the vaccine in order to be protected. It’s easier to sequester these uniquely high-risk people than it is for most other groups and chances are the first round of vaccines won’t be effective enough to really minimize the risk to these compromised people. Second, these folks tend to already avoid risky infection situations and are therefore less like to be spreaders of disease relative to young, healthy people who tend to congregate more frequently and in larger groups. Our rather limited human trials for Covid vaccines have all been based on responses from healthy people, that’s the group we will understand best in relation to any vaccine candidate. It makes more sense to target relatively healthy people in the hopes that we will be able to reduce transmission which will ultimately reduce mortality. Third, it’s important to remember that death is not the only substantial negative outcome and certainly not the worst. The pain, suffering, and economic loss from someone with long-term major health complications are greater than those caused by a (relatively) quick death. Most lung transplant patients don’t live longer than an additional 5 years but they are counted as “recovered” Covid patients.  They still require expensive care before ultimately dying within a few years. 

There’s still a lot we don’t understand about this virus, usually there’s 5-10 years of initial academic research before a vaccine is attempted, we completely skipped that phase of development due to the urgency this virus has created. For that reason and for all the reasons I mentioned above, we’ll likely see a prioritization of people who are most likely to experience repeated exposure to the virus rather than people with health risks. So naturally, health care workers are first in line. Next will come healthy adults who are willing to get vaccinated (and that will be the *true* phase III trial). At that point we’ll hope the child vaccine data is mature enough to begin vaccinating kids. We only need to reach ~55-60% population immunity (according to the traditional formula based on average R0) to get the benefits of herd immunity, at which point outbreaks will become easier to identify and isolate and we’ll see some return of normalcy for everyone.",,,1604689000,{},gbdhcdq,False,t3_jpafsw,False,False,t1_gbddnkf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jpafsw/first_covid19_vaccine_doses_to_go_to_health/gbdhcdq/,1604694264,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Hancock is calling the mandate a “home-by-10” order. It’s aimed at restricting nighttime gatherings at bars, clubs and restaurants, as well as private gatherings.

Denverites covered by the order must stay in their homes until 5 a.m. each day. It is in [effect until Nov. 28](https://twitter.com/MayorHancock/status/1324783794822340608), though it is temporarily suspended on Thanksgiving. There are exemptions for critical businesses, employees returning home from work, first responders and people who may be traveling. 

“We’re on a very dangerous path,” Hancock said at a news conference on Friday. “… There’s another stay-at-home order in our future unless we act with urgency.” 

Hancock and his public health team have been sounding the alarm for weeks about rising coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in Denver. 

Denver, Colorado’s capital and economic hub, is following in the footsteps of Pueblo, [which enacted a similar curfew](https://www.koaa.com/news/covering-colorado/pueblo-mayor-announces-2-week-curfew) last week in order to slow the spread of coronavirus in southern Colorado. State health officials have said that a curfew could be a way for counties to avoid a full-blown lockdown like what was enacted in the spring.

Bob McDonald, who leads the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment, warned that Denver’s hospital capacity could be overwhelmed by the end of December if the current trends continue. 

“We can get this under control,” he said, “but we all have to contribute.”

Asked what proof he has that the new curfew in Denver will work, McDonald said no restrictions implemented to slow the virus’ spread are a sure thing.

“If there was an easy way to get this done, it would have already been done across the country,” he said. “There are no guarantees with any of this.”

The new restrictions in Denver come after Gov. Jared Polis and along with Colorado’s top epidemiologist on Thursday warned coronavirus is circulating in the state at its highest rate since the pandemic began.

Polis urged Coloradans not to spend time with people outside of their own households for the next several weeks. He said that if the trend doesn’t abate, Colorado could become the next New York City.

Also if you knew exactly on what criteria these patients are counted as Sars-Cov-2 positive you would start questioning ""the system"". Let me explain. 

Let's look at this for example: in the country where I practice in, patients died in nursing homes. Many did. Some of these patients have been under my care from day 0 of my career. I have followed them and see them going from living independently at home to being hospitalized at the hospital were I practiced to being transferred to the adjacent nursing home. Their health degraded to the point of not being able to live independently at home for all of them. All of them chronically ill and many being terminal (kidney, heart failure, cancer, etc.). Quite a lot of them became so moribund that they would have died with a very high likelihood in 2020 anyway. In many nursing homes 50% of the patients die within 12 months of admittance. Completely independent of covid. All right that's already some pretty solid context to show how fragile these people are. 
   
Then covid hit and exploded in many nursing homes. The fact is, that under our legislature (and I know from many collegues that it's the same in other countries) , if 2 patients in a care institution are infected with Sars-Cov-2 , all other residents are considered positive. Independently of whether a PCR was carried out or even if there are any symptoms . From my 6 patients who died of Covid-19 only 50% had typical signs of Covid-19, none were tested and the other 50% died from other illnesses and were counted in the statistics anyway due to administrative shortcuts. None of these 3 patients presented with any Covid-19 symptoms. These cause of death were: heart-failure and twice cancer. 

Everyone needs to know that a significant proportion of nursing home patients counted as Covid fatalities didn't die from Covid-19. 

This is addition to all the deprogrammed/cancelled non-covid care is a massive scandal creating way more harm to our societies in term health, life expectancy and quality of life for people who could have easily been treated that it overshadows the 7% of people who died of Covid and for whom no other comorbidity was found. 

Finally, let me attract anyone's attention to the fact that 7% chance of less than the 1% (overestimate of the IFR) of people who died is 0,07% and this is the actual number people are freaking out about in this thread.

If you are interested in knowing, I think middle and high schoolers are capable of doing online learning in most circumstances. I also believe we should aim for fourth graders and younger to have in-school learning to the safest extent possible, whether that means four or one days a week in class for some amount of time.

I am inclined to agree with the sentiments of this article. It should be our goal to get elementary aged students, who are likely not the ones fueling this pandemic, back into classrooms in a strict and regulated manner. 

Students sleeping in is not a counterpoint to my stating “research shows there is long-term damage to missing school” because schools starting later does not equate to missing school.

The other Nordic newspapers currently writes a new article about every new person who dies and where and when they died. This is so different from what Sweden is doing

One slight correction is that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 in humans is not a human-only virus. It doesn't have to mutate at all to infect cats and dogs and minks and other animals. The version that infects humans infects lots of other animals just fine. 

It may well be that a mutation also spread to humans from Dutch mink farms as well, but perhaps the mutation wasn't significant enough to notice or cause concern (just as there are natural mutations that occur in human populations without the mutations being significant enough to make a discernable impact on the virus' behaviour).",,,1604701205,{},gbe6s81,False,t3_jpe0k3,False,True,t1_gbe4gw9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jpe0k3/denmark_has_found_214_people_infected_with/gbe6s81/,1604708661,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

2. And? That means nothing other than 12 people have been detected as having gotten this strain from minks. That also doesnt mean only 12 people have gotten this strain.

3. What they're actually saying is they don't know how it will impact vaccine effectiveness since they don't know how widespread this is and havent been able to test the vaccine against this particular strain. The main problem is that the change in this strain is related to the way the current crop of vaccines are targeting the virus. If the target changes, the vaccines potentially become less effective.

The lockdown or the circuit breaker as what the government calls it, was a soft reset to reduce the number of cases and buy more time for mitigation strategies, it was never an strong intent for the lockdown to eliminate the virus completely due to the nature of the virus.

We failed to contain it properly because at the start we use an honour system for residents and visitors who came from infected countries for them to quarantine themselves. We didn't implement testing/quarantine orders against people from Europe in time when Europe look like a new COVID 19 hotspot. We failed to protect the migrant workers who lived in tight quarters. We didn't encourage mask wearing in the beginning.

But one part I do agree with you is it possible,  for you to continue to have a ""normal"" at least minimal disrupted economic life while at same time control this virus. But it requires both the public and government to be proactive and trusting of each other, which is a fine balance.

Better everyone ""losing"" a couple of years in life than thousands of unnecessary deaths.

&gt; missed vaccine programs \[...\] screenings for cancer and similar 

Which I don't see why should be tied to in-person schooling.

&gt; Lost school years lead to lower life expectancy 

Contracting covid too, much lower life expectancy.

&gt;  lower expected lifetime wage 

Not really in this case since everyone is kind of in the same situation (and those who aren't already had an advantage in wage terms).

&gt; higher crime rates 

Which are mostly tied to wages and the US already has high crime rates related to income inequality, a couple of years of lockdown won't cause an unexpected crime wage, at least not much more than the income inequality problem (that exists completely apart from the lockdown).

&gt; less healthy population 

Yeah, you know what's less healthy? Contracting covid.

&gt; We’ve also got to consider that many dying of covid are at the end of their life, whereas kids are only in the beginning 

Stop fucking repeating the lie ""kids don't die of covid so kids should be going to school"". First, kids do die of covid, so even if they are fewer, there will be unnecessary child deaths.

It's hard to overstate just how out of control the spread in Lombardy was by early March. I don't think they would have ever been able to bring cases down with a milder lockdown.

Italy blamed bad luck at the beginning as it was the very first Western country to get hit. I don't think they ever blamed bad luck for getting deeper into the mess (and if they did, they were wrong).

Don't get me wrong, I am NOT claiming Italy only had bad luck - far from it. I'm *very deeply* critical of Italy's whole management of this. But it did implement some of the measures that this sub publicizes as both necessary and sufficient to contain the spread, and it wasn't enough.

Generally speaking, luck is one of the factors. Both Australia and NZ were lucky AND smart enough to make use of that luck. Others, such as the US, were lucky - good geographic position, ready-to-be-applied pandemic plan, huge tech capabilities, timing advantage compared to Europe - BUT completely threw that luck in the garbage.",,,1604687784,{},gbderfk,False,t3_joumqy,False,True,t1_gbd0720,/r/Coronavirus/comments/joumqy/covid19_italy_sees_over_450_deaths_in_1st_since/gbderfk/,1604692729,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1604688699.0,,

True, they probably didn't find every single case, but DK is already testing at one of the world's highest rates and among the positives they're also sequencing at one of the world's highest rates. So, while it is likely that some cases were missed, it is unlikely that it was many or that this is widespread in the country or region.

Indeed, they're not even sure this variant still is around because none have been found in the thousands of samples from Oct. or Nov. that have been sequenced ([Danish article](https://www.berlingske.dk/danmark/minkmutation-der-har-foert-til-masseaflivninger-og-stor-nedlukning-er-med)). They just upped testing again and all cases will be sequenced; if it is still around it'll be discovered.

Anyway, they're just being extra cautious and not taking chances. I much prefer that approach over taking chances. That's also why they're closing down the entire mink industry; if allowed to continue they fear that a future mutation could be more problematic. I also hope other countries with significant mink industry take notice; only a few countries appear to sequence at the rate of DK and one might fear that mutations could go unnoticed in mink farms elsewhere.",,,1604695176,{},gbdu7me,False,t3_jp7mq1,False,True,t1_gbdqtrv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jp7mq1/denmark_ssi_human_mistake_resulted_in_cluster5/gbdu7me/,1604701734,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1604697013.0,,

Data for different countries during the same time period is not the same, therefore climate zones and hemispheres do not cancel each other.

Instead of trying to be condescending, put some effort into understanding the issue. Take a country such as Brazil for example. The covid dynamics there followed seasonal flu for the southern hemisphere to the t. The opposite is true for countries in the northern hemisphere. The virus spreads faster in autumn and winter, and slows down in the summer. Human activity barely registers (except by skewing case numbers by vast shifts in the amount of testing), judging from very similar results from countries with very different approaches.

Schools have been open in Sweden for 11 weeks. There was no surge in cases, as this model predicts, after four weeks (in fact cases went down). There was none after eight weeks. The increase started 10 weeks later, because, pay attention now, because autumn came along. The model in this rag of a paper would not take seasonality into account, but would associate the increase with schools, despite the grossly distorted time window.

## Abstract

Zoonotic introduction of novel coronaviruses may encounter preexisting immunity in humans. Using diverse assays for antibodies recognizing SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we detect preexisting humoral immunity. SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S)-reactive antibodies were detectable by a flow cytometry-based method in SARS-CoV-2-uninfected individuals and were particularly prevalent in children and adolescents. They were predominantly of the IgG class and targeted the S2 subunit. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced higher titers of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgG antibodies, targeting both the S1 and S2 subunits, and concomitant IgM and IgA antibodies, lasting throughout the observation period. Notably, SARS-CoV-2-uninfected donor sera exhibited specific neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotypes. Distinguishing preexisting and de novo immunity will be critical for our understanding of susceptibility to and the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",,,1604696678,{},gbdxg8n,True,t3_jpdf77,False,True,t3_jpdf77,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jpdf77/preexisting_and_de_novo_humoral_immunity_to/gbdxg8n/,1604703533,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

**Tegnell aimed for herd immunity - but said something else**

&amp;#x200B;

**Tegnell denied that the strategy was herd immunity.** But the exchange of emails from March shows something completely different, and now he has to explain himself.

&amp;#x200B;

The Swedish strategy does not differ much from other countries. We have heard this several times in recent months, from both ministers and our state epidemiologist.

That we deviate from neighboring countries so markedly - both in terms of the number of deaths and the extent of restrictions - has been downplayed, explained by the quality of care for the elderly. This is despite the fact that experts in neighboring countries have pointed out that there are other factors that make the countries different, more specifically how much spread is allowed in society.

When the United Kingdom for a short period chose to aim for gaining herd immunity through more widespread proliferation, state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell spoke with interest about the decision. But outwardly, he has consistently denied that this is what Sweden has been doing. At most, it should be considered a side effect.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that it's not true. In an excerpt from **Johan Anderberg's forthcoming book ""The Flock"",** he tells how the conversations at the beginning of the pandemic sounded (SvD 5/11). How several experts early on explained to Tegnell in what way he underestimated what was about to happen - and dismissed it.

&amp;#x200B;

And how it sounded when Peet Tüll, who used to have the state epidemiologist's duties as head of the National Board of Health and Welfare, exchanged emails with Tegnell about what Sweden should do.

&amp;#x200B;

Tüll explains in mid-March that he sees three possible options for fighting the virus: shut down society for a total of a month, track down as many infected people as possible to quarantine them, or allow ""infection to spread, slowly or rapidly, to achieve a hypothetical 'herd immunity' ”. Tüll advocates the second variant. Investing in herd immunity would be headless and resigned, he explains. It would lead to thousands of deaths.

**Tegnell replies: ""Well, we have walked through this and after all landed in 3.""**

&amp;#x200B;

**The state epidemiologist and his authority thus chose early on to invest in a herd immunity strategy.** At the same time, he persistently explained that this was not the case.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not how an authority can treat citizens.

""It's not about sacrificing a lot of people to gain immunity. **This model was the only one that was passable "", says Tegnell** when he gets to comment on the information in SvD.

And no, of course the Public Health Agency has not acted to destroy people. Of course, the ambition has been to protect the population. But to do so by not being honest - to judge that this is not something that citizens can bear to hear - is actually unacceptable.

&amp;#x200B;

When so much is at stake, crucial information cannot be withheld because it risks being criticized. In particular, not by an authority that has done a great job in that it - unlike decision-makers in other countries - trusts that people can make their own wise decisions if they only get the right information.

&amp;#x200B;

**That this model was the only one that is passable is of course not true either, more or less all other countries chose other paths.**

Now the question also arises: Has the government understood this? Has PM Stefan Löfven understood the truthfulness of Tegnell's reassuring words that herd immunity was not on the agenda at all?

The government has actively chosen to stand back in corona management, declaring that the experts are responsible for the decisions. But if such a model is to work, it presupposes that the country's management actually understands what decisions are being made.

2. I never said we knew what animal it came from. 

My comment was made tongue in cheek, if you couldn't tell. 

My quibble is with the title of the article. In the early phases of the pandemic, numerous articles and medical professionals, including the surgeon general, made dismissive claims about covid. The major talking point was, "" if you're worried about the coronavirus, get a flu shot because thousands die from that each year."" From there, the seeds of doubt were planted in many Americans, who often made frequent comparisons to the flu, dismissing covid and thwarting our early response. With the events unfolding in Denmark, public health experts and the media have a responsibility to convey accurate messaging in a manner that won't disseminate general confusion. By simply stating, ""what's happening in Denmark is an evolving and dynamic situation that is being closely monitored,"" is more accurate. Such messaging will provide greater reassurance to the public. It's much better than stating, ""fears are overblown.""  


&gt; Being vaguely afraid of endless bad possibilities helps no one

My post is in no way suggesting that we should fear endless possibilities. My criticism is how the message is being conveyed by making comparisons to messaging from January. Again, this was done tongue in cheek. 

&gt;What are you monitoring? What are you preparing for? That isn't included already in daily life during COVID.

I'm monitoring the unfolding of events, and in no way am I suggesting it will become worse. By knowing what is happening in the world, I can communicate such messaging to my students (history professor of epidemics) and those around me. I've been doing the same since January, and what some experts don't seem to fully grasp is how much the average person does not seem to understand the pandemic. I don't blame the average Joe, honestly, because the messaging has been a cacophony since the beginning. 

Again, I'll reiterate my point: stating ""fear is overblown"" or ""this is pandemic 2.0"" will create enormous confusion in the general public. One simply has to state, ""this is a dynamic and evolving situation that is being monitored. Here is what we know.""",,,1604703071,{},gbeaf0k,False,t3_jpac2e,False,True,t1_gbe1fvx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jpac2e/spread_of_mutated_coronavirus_in_danish_mink_hits/gbeaf0k/,1604710584,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I know a lot of people have decided that they're doomed to get it but its simply not true if we take steps to avoid such situations. The issue we face if this continues spreading out of control is more rapid mutations.

I'm really happy to hear some ideas about how to do that. As you said it is probably pretty expensive and we need large amounts of staff, which each state is going to have to organize on their own. They are also going to run into lawsuits from the companies that own the facilities because ya know, investors and their profits. I think the correct thing to do would be for the federal government to allocate some amount of resources and strongly recommend these practices, but there's so much variation in facilities and laws, and there are so many facilities that the state, or even the county is really going to have to be responsible for implementation and oversight. Investors in private SNFs will only go kicking and screaming. They are the ones that want us to just open everything up, even if they lose residents or get sued. The whole facility is broken up into parts to protect them from lawsuits.

Once this idea has been proven to work in some areas, then maybe we can talk about  doing it on a larger scale.

Breaking down your experience though, it looks like you are mostly ok with asynchronous instruction for the actual learning content, and value the synchronous portion for things like group discussion, peer interaction, etc. That is EXACTLY what you should be doing in a flipped-classroom model. The instruction part is all done via pre-recorded content and interactive lessons (so that you can go at your own pace, on your own time, etc). You then create synchronous opportunities to have office-hours with your teacher, do small-group discussions with peers, engage in non-curriculum instruction (i.e. play ""Among Us"" together), etc.

I have NO idea what school districts were thinking. There is an entire industry that has all of this mapped out, and how/when to use synchronous vs. asynchronous, and most schools just completely ignored this. Some of it was for political reasons, some of it was to appease parents who have no idea what they're doing, and some of it was ignorance. We could have used May through August to set up a LOT of this stuff, and instead we squandered the opportunity by focusing on trying to send people into the classroom during the worst pandemic in 100 years.

He was, scholars believe, in the midst of an astonishingly potent creative period, one that produced some of the most extraordinary tragedies ever written — “King Lear” and “Macbeth” among them.

&gt;It was a remarkable achievement, one that got me thinking about our current moment and the possibility that during this pandemic, society’s artful dreamers might find their own inspiration and make similarly groundbreaking creations. “The great work begins,” playwright Tony Kushner wrote as the final words of “Angels in America,” his sprawling dramatic diptych of another terrible modern epidemic.

&gt;In perilous, isolating times, we hunger with a special zeal for great work by artists who can capture the experience for us. The novel coronavirus that has infected nearly 50 million people worldwide and killed 1.2 million — including more than 233,000 in the United States — has also created a vacuum in live entertainment of all kinds. That includes the performing arts, whose theaters and studios have been forced to shutter for months as organizations also furlough or dismiss scores of the 5.1 million arts workers in this country.

&gt;All at once, the curtains closed on hundreds of plays, ballets, concerts, musicals — as well as the in-person classes in drama, music and dance that feed the future of these forms. Though some arts lovers have followed their favorite companies to the Web, where videos of old productions and super-skeletal versions of new projects are being tried out, one can’t avoid a certain hollow feeling — a cultural deprivation unprecedented in our lifetimes. Pause for just a moment from reflecting on the terrible losses inflicted on so many families by the coronavirus, and imagine another type of devastation: a life’s dream of seeing your new play onstage, or appearing in a recital marking the launch of your career, washed away in a tidal wave of worry about contagion in public places.",,,1604691700,{},gbdmzlp,True,t3_jpbu48,False,True,t3_jpbu48,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jpbu48/perspective_shakespeare_wrote_king_lear_during_a/gbdmzlp/,1604697574,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

1. Trump has already totally poisoned this whole situation.  This just IS politicized now.  I'm not sure it's even possible to put that genie back in the bottle, but if it is, it would take a very long time and a lot of work.

2. Biden isn't going to try any kind of iron-fisted policy on this.  Any guidance he attempts to implement is going to require buy-in from the people, and it is distinctly possible that conservatives will be even more resistant to it once they are all buttmad about the election result.  

3. I would wager that things actually won't be getting any worse by the time January 20 rolls around.  I don't think our healthcare system can sustain through anywhere even close to another 2.5 months of this level of increase.  I believe that overwhelmed, collapsing hospitals will once again force our hand with regard to local restrictions and shutdowns across the country, long before Jan 20.  This will work, just like it has every other time it's been done, and metrics will have probably already been improving for some amount of time by the time Biden takes office.  

4. The vaccine will essentially be imminent by that time.  If/when we bring this winter surge under control within the next few months, it should be at least a few months after that before another ""wave"" might start to kick off.

The retired guy giving three options, 15:th of March, of which probably only one was viable. Lockdown in any meaningful sense probably not feasible. Tracing capacity was already exhausted if I remember correctly, was that not why they changed strategy 13:th of March?
The third option is everything else which some of you guys take to mean something sinister, something that I find hard to accept.
We will see what the book says!

(reusing my comment from this morning) I looked through the fhm press archive for the period to get a frame of reference. 

5th Feb. Travelers from Wuhan with symptoms to isolate
13th feb. One detected case. No spread
25:th Feb. High risk of cases. Low risk of spread in society. 
26:th Feb. One more case
27:th Feb. 5 new cases.
2:nd March . 14 total cases. Medium risk of spread.
3rd March. Travelers from northern Italy to be tested if symptomatic
9th: Same for Tyrol and Innsbruck
10:th March signs of spread in society. People with symptoms to avoid socializing. 
11:th March. WHO declares pandemic. 
13:e mars. New phase. Aka ""the herd""?

Nope. Pretty much just the governor saying ""North Dakota Smart"" and patting himself on the back while giving money to oil executives with the other hand.

There's a mask mandate in Fargo, but when the city announced it they said in the same breath they wouldn't be enforcing it. I don't know about mask mandates in other cities. There's a ""risk level"" map of all the counties, and when a county is at high risk they're supposed to reduce all gatherings, restaurants and bars to 25% capacity or 50 people, whichever is less. But once again there's no way to enforce that. I'm told bars were shoulder to shoulder on Halloween.

Talking to coworkers and family, the general consensus is ""we're all going to get it so suck it up and live your life."" And I'm made to feel like an asshole for saying I do care about it and want to wear my mask. Mask use is rare. Proper mask use is even rarer, even in places that claim to require them like my workplace. People think the only reason cases are up is because there's more testing. I still hear people saying daily that the flu kills more people each year... I've never known anyone to die from the flu but four North Dakotans that were family members of my friends have died of Covid.

Hospitals are full, I think they're opening up our stadiums to hold sick people? But who knows where they're going to find doctors willing to work there. I've heard word of mouth that doctors are being taken from their primary duties (obgyn, cardiology, etc.) and moved to work the covid wards. Paperwork and safety measures are being reduced in hospitals to reduce the workload so they can treat more patients.

Yes, it would likely have mutated and it did: the NL both was the first to confirm mutations in their mink farms and the first to confirm the virus going from mink to human (instead of only human to mink), but based on available evidence it didn't spread much. Mutations in this virus happen all the time, also unrelated to mink farms, but most don't change anything important and are not a cause of concern. However, because mink appear particularly susceptible to this virus, the farms typically have thousands of mink living close together, and the ""species jump"" by virus is a known way of introducing potentially problematic mutations, it needs to be closely watched. Among the 214 confirmed mink-related cases in DK, 12 are the potentially problematic ""cluster 5"". A mink related mutation in NL had changes to the spike protein that were similar to ""cluster 5"" in DK, but only partially. It was one of the reasons for NL speeding up the closure of their mink industry, which is smaller than the one in DK. More farms = more risks of mutation.

However, the extent of mutations in other countries with mink farms is less clear. DK has one of the world's highest test rates and of the positive cases one of the world's highest sequencing rates (which will be further increased, so all cases will now be sequenced).
