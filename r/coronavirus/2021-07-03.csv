&gt;By NANCY WEST, InDepthNH.org

&gt;CONCORD – There have been 385 people who contracted COVID-19 and seven who have died after being fully vaccinated in New Hampshire between Feb. 1 and July 1, according to Health and Human Services Spokesman Laura Montenegro.

&gt;“While the vaccines are very safe and effective, breakthrough cases are to be expected, as no vaccine is 100% effective at preventing illness,” Montenegro said in an email.

&gt;There have been a total of 33,882 cases of COVID-19 since Feb. 1 and 243 total deaths related to COVID-19 during that timeframe, she said.

&gt;New Hampshire is ranked seventh in the country for the percentage of the population that has been fully vaccinated at 56 percent by Becker’s Hospital Review. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s latest data said 55 percent of the state’s population has been fully vaccinated.

&gt;The state Department of Health and Human Services dashboard also said as of July 1, 55 percent of the population has been fully vaccinated.

&gt;All other New England states and Maryland had higher percentages of their populations fully vaccinated. Vermont ranked highest in the country with 66 percent of its population fully vaccinated.

&gt;Because the data on breakthrough infections is minimal, the state would not provide town-level data to protect the privacy of the individuals, Montenegro said.

&gt;“Vaccine breakthrough infections have occurred in people of all ages 12 and up, across all parts of the state, and in vaccine recipients of all types of vaccines (e.g. Pfizer, Moderna, and J&amp;J),” Montenegro said.

&gt;Montenegro also said a hospitalizations comparison is not possible as the state stopped daily contact with every case during the fall surge.

&gt;“Since then, we’ve known if someone was hospitalized at the time the case was reported to us, but we aren’t able to determine if they required hospitalization after the initial case investigation was completed. As a result, DHHS is not able to provide the number of non-vaccinated individuals requiring hospitalizations. However, hospitals report all breakthrough hospitalizations and to date, there have been 20 hospitalizations involving fully vaccinated individuals,” she said.

&gt;The timeframe for breakthrough cases – meaning individuals who got COVID after being fully vaccinated – would approximately be the beginning of February, which is when the first residents were fully vaccinated, she said.

&gt;“Our online dashboard provides the most up-to-date data on those who have had at least 1 dose and those fully vaccinated,” she said.

&gt;As of Friday, 99,555 people have contracted COVID-19 in New Hampshire since the start of the pandemic last year and about 1 percent or 1,372 people have died. There are currently 181 positive cases.",,,1625354965,{},h3yxfas,False,t3_ocx9g7,False,False,t1_h3yviae,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ocx9g7/385_fully_vaccinated_people_contracted_covid19_7/h3yxfas/,1625589348,7,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I have discussed [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oawth0/tomlinson_let_the_unvaccinated_pay_the/h3ls8vb?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) numerous times in other replies. The chances of being allergic to the COVID-19 vaccine is so small, it does not need to be treated a common occurrence. 

&gt;or if they have one of the few conditions that make vaccination risky

Do you mind specifying exactly what those conditions are?

&gt;In my hypothetical prison

I personally don't think it is productive to entertain hypothetical scenarios.

&gt;they do not get to ignore very basic medical care from vaccines to stiches to antibiotics and basically self-harm. Just like they don't get to assault others while in prison.

I would argue that the comparison of choosing to get a vaccine and assaulting others in prison (and even self-harm) is a false equivalency (ignoring the differences in orders of magnitude between the things being equated).

&gt;Especially when that basic medical care is a vaccine which protects not only that person but every inmate and guard/staff/visitor on the premises.

The vaccine decreases the risk of hospitalization and the amount of viral load *only* for the individual who is vaccinated, not for the individual who is unvaccinated ([Source](https://news.yahoo.com/covid-19-vaccines-reduce-viral-131454438.html)). In terms of transmission, there is not sufficient evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines decrease transmission, even so, only those who are vaccinated are protected. 

Overall, I think the idea of forcing vaccinations on prisoners goes against precedent (as this is not a requirement now) and goes against bodily autonomy. If you want to think you know better than them about their own health, and fantasize about being, ""in change of their bodies while they are caged,"" you are free to think that.",,,1625370214,{},h3zlufe,False,t3_obr0m5,False,True,t1_h3ssgsp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/obr0m5/ohio_judge_admits_hes_mandating_covid19/h3zlufe/,1625603531,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There may be some regional exceptions but most vaccination centers had either already finished their waiting lists (including people without any prioritization) or were within days of finishing them so you got an mRNA appointment within days (though often Moderna and not Germans' first choice BioNTech).

I think this sort of word choice is bad.

If a variant comes along that evades the vaccines--and it is absolutely an ""if"" not a when, so I am glad that you only said ""might""--it isn't going to send us back to square one.

We now have well-established mRNA vaccine technology, and Pfizer believes it could design, test, get approved, and produce these in under 100 days.  Countries now have the infrastructure to distribute vaccines rapidly, as well.

Additionally, we would probably have some warning, as--looking at the way the variants have gone so far--it takes a couple months for a variant to take over anyways and it seems most likely that each new variant would chip away at the efficacy of the vaccines, not drop it to zero.

As you describe, we don't know the exact number, we don't know how these (let's say) 15% are split between vaccinated / non-vaccinated: could be 50:50, could by 20:80. So we'd have to add anywhere from 0-15% to the number.

I have discussed in my previous [reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oddz2z/the_unvaccinated_are_at_risk_as_evolution/h42c9ci?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) the risk to children is so low, it is virtually inconsequential (this is a good thing). Yes, every death is too many, but they are by far the safest demographic in terms of hospitalizations and deaths.

&gt;Some can't get it due to medical conditions

According to the CDC, ""COVID-19 vaccines are recommended for and can be administered to most people with underlying medical conditions"" ([Source](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underlying-conditions.html)). If you wouldn't mind specifying exactly what medical conditions you are referring to, that would be very beneficial to the discussion.

Again, I have already discussed in another previous [reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oawth0/tomlinson_let_the_unvaccinated_pay_the/h3ls8vb?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) that the chances of being allergic to the COVID-19 vaccine (or any other vaccine for that matter) is at most 0.0006%. To put that in perspective, you have a slightly higher chance of being struck by lightning this year.

I feed my kids organic. Kiddo is too young for a bicycle. 

Vacation isn’t an issue for us personally, my folks have 25 wooded mountainside acres to camp on, and in-laws have a lake house. But… we can do those things without spending more than a tank of gasoline beyond what we otherwise would spend. 

See, a car accident or what have you, could happen, but statistically won’t happen. Putting 30 kids in a poorly ventilated room, where statistically one kid will have it, is literally asking for trouble. The never did full, in weekly testing on school age kids because society *needed* the parents at work to keep the country functioning, for warehouse workers to pick and pack, for doctors and nurses to show up at the hospitals. 

As someone who’s 25-30 lbs heavier than I’d like to be, and who got the virus in April of 2020 and actually faced the debilitating brain fog/breathing issues, I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. I mentally took stock of my life, and found myself good, but shy of great. I was prepared to die, and I faced that crucible as a man should.

But I have compassion for others beyond myself. Feel free to view me as overprotective, I’ll certainly take that as my worst quality. 

I view all those who won’t get vaccinated as selfish/uncaring at best, and a direct danger the the people that I love more than myself, at worst.

This is not true. The CDC has recommended individuals with weakened immune systems may get vaccinated and that the data on the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines for immunocompromised people is not yet available ([Source](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underlying-conditions.html)).

However, there is a great study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) that I have already discussed in a previous [reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oawth0/tomlinson_let_the_unvaccinated_pay_the/h3ln8dc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) which shows the COVID vaccine does provide at least some protection (47% after second dose) to individuals who had just received an organ transplant (i.e. immunocompromised/immunosuppressant).

&gt;children under 12

First, The hospitalization rate for adolescents aged 12-17 stands at a cumulative rate of 0.058%, which peaked at 0.002% as of January 2021, and is currently down at 0.0002% as of June 26, 2021 ([CDC Source](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19_3.html)).

In this [study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7023e1.htm?s_cid=mm7023e1_w), also published by the CDC, found no associated deaths among adolescents aged 12-17 between January 2020-March 2021.

These numbers are extremely low already even without the COVID-19 vaccine, which Moderna has found to be 100% effective among children aged 12-17 ([Source](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-teencove-study-its-covid-19-vaccine)).

In regards to children aged younger than 12, the risk of hospitalization and death is even lower.

The hospitalization rate for children aged 0-4 stands at a cumulative of 0.06%, which peaked at 0.002% in December 2020, and is currently down at 0.0002% as of June 26, 2021 ([CDC Source](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19_3.html)).

The hospitalization rate for children aged 5-11 stands at a cumulative of 0.02%, which peaked at 0.0008% in January 2021, and is currently down at 0.0003% as of June 26, 2021 ([CDC Source](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19_3.html)).

Taking the averages, the hospitalization rate for children aged 0-11 stands at a cumulative of 0.04%, which peaked at 0.0014% in December 2020/January 2021, and is currently down at 0.00025% as of June 26, 2021.

The death rate for children aged 0-4 stands at a cumulative of 0.00034%, with the death rate of children aged 5-14 stands at a cumulative of 0.00016%. Combining the averages, the death rate for children aged 0-14 stands at a cumulative of 0.00025% ([Source](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00066-3/fulltext)).

Again, these numbers are extraordinarily low. Of course, one death is too many, but to present this as a life or death thing among children I think irrational at best, and fearmongering at worst. 

To summarize, immunocompromised persons may get the COVID-19 vaccine according to the CDC with no clear data that the COVID-19 vaccines are or are not safe for immunocompromised persons (except for the study I provided which shows that it provides some protection). And children aged 0-14 are the safest demographic involving hospitalizations and deaths. So safe, in fact, the chances are all less than 0.1% in both hospitalizations and deaths, with some figures even less than 0.001%.",,,1625433875,{},h42c9ci,False,t3_oddz2z,False,False,t1_h40zm8a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oddz2z/the_unvaccinated_are_at_risk_as_evolution/h42c9ci/,1625655477,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I dont agree with him, and the rest of our family has had it done already. He’s not ugly about it, doesnt criticize us or say why we shouldn’t or even why he wont. He and his brother are just very cautious people in a weird way. I’m probably going to tell him we cant visit for awhile with the Delta variant going around, unfortunately. I’m too spooked for good reason. He wont get angry or take it personally. When I bring up the shot or where he can get it for free, he says thanks and leaves it at that. 

He’s somewhat Rastafarian, I guess? He’s vegetarian and a very healthy, active man in his 50s, hes very into micro-nutrients and just knowing all the benefits of various vegetables and supplements. Not a replacement for the shot in anyway, but thats just to give an idea of how he is. Unfortunately, my family left Jamaica under bad circumstances so hes very distrustful of the government in general, especially as it pertains to medicine trials and black people (see Tuskegee experiments)—i think he worries black ppl were underrepresented in the trials, the same way women were :/ 

He’s a very kind man. Before Covid, he was the only person who took care of this old woman he’d be helping out for years. Her kids wouldnt take her to appointments, and they put her in a horrible home and never checked on her. He visited her regularly and said it smelled like urine and was so depressing. Her kids also threw out her nice things to the curb and he took them and passed them along to me and other family because he felt sad to see her things trashed. When she died, he was with her, literally in her bed while she rested next to him and he gave her ice chips. It tore him up. She loved him so much she gave him her minivan when she went to the home. 

I only share this about him because he’s actually a very kind and thoughtful person. I dont agree with him on this issue about vaccines, but he was never a Covid-denier who didnt take it seriously or downplayed it.

Assuming literally everyone in that age range caught covid, then that is a 1 in 17,650 death rate. If half the people in that age range have caught covid, then it is a 1 in 8,825 chance. 

This study is saying the chance of having a blood clot in under 50s is 1 in 50,000. And then about 20% of them will be fatal, so the death rate would be 1 in 250,000. (I think...)

If we know the vaccine makes it less likely you'll get the virus, yes we know vaccinated people allow fewer opportunities for the virus to mutate. The virus doesnt multiply very much if you don't get infected. 

&gt;How is it that we are finding clusters of infection in vaccinated people?

Because the vaccine isn't 100% effective. Those clusters however are dwarfed by the amount of unvaccinated infected individuals however. 



&gt;We don't really know how much less likely vaccinated people are to be creating mutation opportunites

We absolutely know. A virus multiplies when it takes hold in your body. If its less likely to take hold because of a vaccine, its less likely to multiply and therefore less likely to mutate. Its not impossible, but less likely. Could the virus mutate in a vaccinated individual? Yes. But the odds of that happening before it mutates in an unvaccinated individual are negligible. 

&gt;But clearly, if a dozen vaccinated Yankees team members can spread it to each other, the infectivity rate is not dramatically lower than for unvaccinated people. 

Compared to the thousands it ripped through yesterday and today, yes its drastically lower. Are you genuinely suggesting your 12 yankees hold a fuckin candle to the hundreds of thousands that were being infected daily before the vaccines came about? Or the thousands that still are where the vaccine hasn't fully rolled out yet? 

&gt;Where is the proof for that? Vaccinated people can get infected and spread it around. 

You want proof vaccinated people are less likely to get covid and spread it? Are you an anti vaxxer? Thats the only thing I can think of for such a nonsense question. Yes vaccinated people can still spread it, but if you read slower you'll notice I said **less likely**. Nothing is guaranteed, its all odds, and odds are a vaccinated person will not get covid and allow it to mutate when compared to an unvaccinated person. That's how vaccines work. So you're now asking for proof vaccines work. 

&gt;If my arguments are unconvincing to you, I would just ask that you show me the study that shows that vaccinated people are x% less likely to be ""mutation factories"". 

Vaccinated people are less likely to get the virus. The virus can't mutate outside a host, so if you don't get it, it can't mutate in you. If you're less likely to get the virus, you're less likely to have it mutate inside you. So again, are you asking for a study that vaccines work? A study that vaccines make you less likely to get the virus? Because if that's the case im really starting to doubt your opening line because you wouldn't seem to understand much. 

&gt;What I was arguing against was the fear-mongering against unvaccinated people and the unsupported implications of the article.

Every single mutant variant of covid has come from an unvaccinated person thus far. It's far from unsupported. We also haven't had any new variants emerge from places where vaccines have heavily rolled out. All the variants we're dealing with mutated before vaccines were rolled out (meaning they can't possibly have come from a vaccinated person) or came from a place that didn't have vaccinations as early as other places (the delta variant from India). 

It is entirely possible that a variant emerge from a vaccinated person, however the odds are slim. Every variant we're dealing with so far came from unvaccinated individuals. Any variants to emerge in the future will also likely come from unvaccinated individuals. It could come from a vaccinated person, but if I was a gambling man, I know where I'd put my money.",,,1625353079,{},h3yu8fs,False,t3_ocwhp4,False,False,t1_h3ys6ja,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ocwhp4/unvaccinated_people_are_variant_factories/h3yu8fs/,1625587443,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The people in the experiment were going psychotic thinking about food, the hunger drive is that strong.  But past a certain point they were not loosing more weight despite their dietary calorie consumption being adjusted downward to force weight loss.

The fact is that the more weight you loose the harder it gets to maintain that and loose more.

Here on Reddit and around the world we saw video of huge pool parties people are outside no masks, there was tons of community spread happening at the time, a lot of those people from those same gatherings ended up getting covid and some of them have even died.  Are you forgetting about the ante lockdown protesters, they were protesting outside about all the restrictions and lockdowns, and we all laughed on here how after a few weeks a lot of them came infected with covid-19 as well. Couple things to note as when the black lives matter protests were occurring, many large urban cities were seeing their infection rates on the decline due to the lockdown measures which were technically still in effect. Add to that many people during these protests were wearing masks, some still got sick due to the nature of their masks and I'm sure viral load/density problems. I know several people who went to the protests, and a few weeks later had covid-19.

Your body doesn't necessarily need to store all extra calories, and it doesn't necessarily need to burn fat for all calorie deficits. It's how any animal body with a healthy metabolism maintains weight over time even without cognitively counting calories. If your body makes you more hungry while this is going on, you might well end up gaining back everything you lost and possibly more. Check out what happened to a lot of the people on The Biggest Loser for an example of this.

But aside from that, people don't like being told something so simplistic because it's so unhelpful. (Wanna be rich? Spend less than you earn. Money in, money out. Why aren't you rich yet?) It's the biological equivalent of telling people to bootstrap it. There's no actionable information there and it leaves out most people's actual experiences with this issue.

On top of that the coronavirus is slow to mutate on the genomic level as it has a proof-reading gene which prevent major changes to its genetic code, this is in contrasts to the flu which mutates rapidly.

Can you source this? I find it hard to believe that there are clusters of double-vaxxed people at airports. I would love to know more.

&gt; And why is it that leading countries who are almost entirely double vax'd are getting new waves of infections?

That's actually to be expected. First, many of those illnesses continues to be amongst non-vaccinated populations. But even if half of all new infections are amongst vaccinated people that is also to be expected. 

Think of it this way: A double dose of Pfizer basically reduces your risk of infection by about 20 times. That's still not zero. Your chance of a serious outcome doubles roughly every seven years (I have heard 6-8 years). So one way to think about it is that the mRNA vaccines roughly reduce your age by 30 years. That is, I as a 55 year old, who has been doubly vaccinated have roughly the same risk of serious outcome if I get infected as a 25 year old. Not great, but a lot better than my risk before. But definitely not zero either.

I read there was a study some time ago showing that the risk of getting infected by measles was greater for a vaccinated person amongst a population of non-vaccinated people, than a non-vaccinated person amongst a population of vaccinated people.

The people who eat the ""right"" foods and still can't stop the inexorable march of weight gain? That's how most weight gain happens. It's not all at once. It's gradual over a lifetime. If the image in your head is from a TLC show, get rid of it. That's just not most people. 

So I didn't get into the systemic issues with this before, but here are a few:

Do you honestly think that healthcare access and cost have no effect on this? That mental health parity wouldn't impact it? What if, instead of being left to figure out which diet book or guru is gonna work this time, you could see a professional nutritionist once a week for little or no out of pocket cost? A personal trainer? These are luxuries for the wealthy today. They shouldn't be. People talk about ""educating"" people about food, but imo every effort has been a fucking disaster ruined by corporate input. (Let's be real, if we all actually ate healthy, we'd fall into a recession, lol.) But why spend so much on coming up with My Plate when we could just go to actual experts? Fund educating real experts.

Easy access to fresh food is linked to income and geography. But you know that, right? We all know that. But we ignore it.

Time. How much free time does a minimum wage worker have? How much time does it take that person to go to a grocery store that sells fresh produce? Do they have a car? How much time does it take to cook dried beans? (Answer: about 2 hours after soaking.) How long does it take to go through the drive thru or just take something home from the restaurant they work at? As a culture we outsourced things from the home that we never should have outsourced. Its baked in now. In any given household, all able-bodied adults are needed to work, so time to cook is greatly reduced.

We allow food companies to market however they see fit. They intentionally use buzzwords and confusing health statements (no added sugar, gluten free), to trick you into thinking you're buying something healthy. The whole idea of ""good"" vs ""bad"" foods is problematic on its own since it can lead to disordered eating.

As a culture we approach weight in a ham fisted, blunt way: lose it, you lazy asshole! Fat people with eating disorders are dismissed while thinner people are encouraged to get help. Yes, there are fat bulemics. There are fat anorexics. But they are often simply encouraged in their eating disorder. The belief that fat people are lazy and stupid stops them from getting help because even the fucking providers so often hold these opinions.

If it were simple or easy, it wouldn't be a problem. Putting it solely on the individual perpetuates the problem.

Well obviously, but the point, as described, is that variants which transmit better and keep their hosts on their feet will have a clear evolutionary advantage.

The vaccine doesn’t just “hopefully” prevent you from hospitalization - it drastically reduces your odds of a symptomatic infection, and nearly eliminates the risk of severe illness and death. It effectively keeps everyone that gets the vaccine from getting it or speeding it, especially if they tend to hang out with other vaccinated people.

Sure, some vaccinated individuals will have breakthrough cases, but except for a few cases of elderly individuals with non-functioning immune systems, it won’t be a problem. This isn’t any different from how we treat other diseases.

They take the evidence of that story, their own experience with drugs that seemed way over priced, and then make these assumptions. They don’t reason out any of it. They may not realize that pharma companies are kinda screwed by their limited patent rights.

Before clinical trials or any other development.

First, in the USA, most people work at will, so employers can require vaccinations. Some employers are and some are trying to bride their employees to get vaccinated. Other employers, like the My Pillow guy, do not believe in the virus and vaccines and are unlikely to do so.

Your suggestion about landlords and banks are a non-starter. Housing and banking are necessary components of a working society. Vaccinated family members are not going to let non-vaccinated members live on the streets unless it is a very dysfunctional family. Also gathering all the unvaccinated together in one place will only make it easier for variants to spread and mutate. And that’s without mentioning the ethical problems with your solution.

Also something you did not mention, all these people avoiding it from ignorance and misinformation did not come up with the same misinformation on their own. They are victims of listening to the wrong people. Prior to the internet, Information could be controlled and verified before publishing. Even then there where sensationalism in the news. Now the anybody with a smartphone and an app can post “information”, bad actors can influence large groups of people. Since we all have a confirmation bias, getting people to change once they formed an opinion is difficult. An example of this are the Trump followers. Initially Trump said the virus was a hoax and wasn’t dangerous and downplayed the vaccines (while at the same time taking credit for them). As a result his followers adopted these views. Now over a year later than when he first announced the virus as a hoax, he himself and his family has gotten vaccinated. Did this convince his followers to get vaccinated? No it has not. Now I would think that a person’s actions “speak louder than words” but apparently not in this case. Despite Trump himself being vaccinated, his followers continue to remain unvaccinated as a whole.

The coronavirus figures have soared  since mid-June against a background of reluctance among many to get vaccinated and suspicion of home-grown shots.  
Russia on Sunday announced 25,142 new infections, the highest figure since January 2 when Russia was emerging from a second wave of the pandemic.  
This week Russia reported record numbers of coronavirus deaths for five days in a row, registering 697 Covid-19 fatalities on Saturday.  
On Sunday, the official tally showed 663 people dying of Covid-19 over the past 24 hours.  
Some experts say that Russia vastly under-reports coronavirus fatalities, counting only cases when the virus was found to be the primary cause of death after autopsy.  
Moscow, the biggest virus hotspot nationwide, recorded 7,624 new cases and 111 deaths.  
The government has ruled out a nationwide lockdown but this week President Vladimir Putin once again urged Russians to get vaccinated and ""listen to experts"" rather than rumours.

Here is an excerpt:

&gt; The researchers tracked each subject's weight as a function of time elapsed since the beginning of the starvation period. For each subject, the weight versus time plot was expected—as well as enforced—to form a particular curve, the prediction weight-loss curve, whose characteristics were decided before the commencement of the experiment. The postulated curves turned out to be **quite predictive** for most subjects. If a subject did veer off his curve in any given week, his caloric intake for the next week would be adjusted, by varying the amount of bread and potatoes, to bring him back to the curve; however, the required **adjustments were usually minor**.",,,1625377175,{},h3zvf6g,False,t3_ocwr9b,False,True,t1_h3ytjrp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ocwr9b/covid_plummets_as_leading_cause_of_death_in_the_us/h3zvf6g/,1625608941,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It's also false to assume that covid-19 did not increase case rates during blm protests, it did but due to all the different factors going on during the protests, people wearing masks, transmission rates were already on the decline due to lockdown measures, these played a huge role in allowing the protests to not significantly impact case load and transmission, because community spread had already been somewhat contained at that point especially within urban metropolitan areas. But the case load did increase, just not in a significant way and that is due to many different factors. 

So to recap sunlight doesn't kill the virus, find me an article that says sunlight kills the virus, because it slows its mobility, wind does not affect covid-19, we're not talking about something that is large enough to be affected by wind; you have to take physics into account and covid-19 is that the microscopic level, the gravitational pull that a microscopic organism is affected by is much smaller than a larger object of denser magnitude, ie covid would have only been dispersed a few microns if that. 

I see that you keep sidestepping the issue of the memorial day parties, which significantly contributed to covid-19 and its spread, how about you find articles that disprove that partying and gathering on memorial Day caused no impact to covid-19 cases.

My 52-year-old Army-fit uncle was diagnosed with Covid two weeks ago, and it's a miracle he's still alive. He was not vaccinated. They fretted about potential side effects, too.

Even though he passed an Angry physical two months ago, Covid ravaged him. They were giving him Last Rites Tuesday night before he stabilized enough to be flown in the middle of the night to a hospital with a heart and lung bypass machine. Apparently there are only 11 hospitals in the country offering this treatment, and we are exceptionally lucky that his base was a 30-munute flight from one of them and that one of the three ECMO beds was available. He nearly died of oxygen starvation before they could get him on it.

He will be lucky to survive and luckier still if he's not seriously impacted. The machine he's on is a level of care UP from full ventilator support. The only way to keep his blood oxygen high enough is to use a full artificial circulation system designed for people undergoing heart bypass surgery. The awful risk at the moment has to do with blood thickness and pressure.

In addition to drowning the lungs, Covid makes the blood coagulate irregularly, so he's been on blood thinners, but the blood thinners are causing internal bleeding that make it hard for the ECMO machine to work. The ECMO completely bypasses the heart and lungs to directly oxygenate and circulate the blood — he has tubes running out of his neck and chest to move blood through his system—but it only works if there is enough vascular pressure. The bleeding makes that hard. It's like leaky hydraulics. If there's not enough pressure, the machine can't work. They had to give him 6 units of plasma last night. They've taken him off blood thinners to try to reduce the bleeding, but that increases the risk of blood clots. If clots block blood flow, it's game over. So it is very touch and go. The good news is that since the latest surge began, they haven't lost any of the 14 Covid patients on this treatment, which is amazing, because the balancing act is extreme.

Nobody knows how much Covid may have scarred his heart or lungs or how well they will be able to take over once they start weaning him off the machine. The moments of low oxygen can have major impacts on kidney function, and nobody knows how much they will recover.",,,1625375340,{},h3zt2tl,False,t3_ocghej,False,True,t1_h3v624w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ocghej/hospital_in_hardhit_springfield_missouri_turns/h3zt2tl/,1625607637,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Of the new cases, 37 were domestic transmissions, two were imported and there were also two deaths from the disease, the CECC said.

Speaking at the daily CECC press briefing, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said that overall case numbers continue to trend downwards.

The cluster infections at three Taipei markets are also under control, Chen said, adding that testing of market personnel, contacts of confirmed patients, and residents in the neighborhood have returned fewer positive results than expected.

This indicates that the cluster has been contained to a certain degree, Chen said, though thorough contact-tracing and more tests are still required.

To date, the three wholesale markets in Taipei have reported more than 200 cases. This includes 110 at Huannan Market, 96 at the First Fruit &amp; Vegetable Wholesale Market and 23 at the Second Fruit &amp; Vegetable Wholesale Market, Chen said.

More than 11,000 COVID-19 tests have been administered at the markets over the past three days, according to Chen.


Of the 37 domestic cases Sunday, Taipei reported 18, followed by New Taipei with 11.

Taoyuan and Changhua County each recorded three cases, while two were reported in Yilan County.

Three of the cases have no apparent link to previously confirmed COVID-19 patients, 16 have a known source of infection, and 18 are under investigation, according to the CECC.

Meanwhile, the two imported cases involved two Taiwanese nationals who recently returned from Cambodia and Indonesia.

The two deaths reported Sunday were a woman in her 70s and a man in his 80s, who passed away on July 2 and June 17, respectively, the CECC said.


To date, Taiwan has confirmed a total of 15,030 COVID-19 cases, over 13,600 of which are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 cases in a single day since the beginning of the pandemic.
The number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths in the country has risen to 688, with all except 12 recorded since May 15, CECC data shows.

at this point in the the vaccine can mean two things. Freedom to live without worrying about a pretty nasty virus, and the freedom to do shit without pulling teeth to get it done. And to that, the anti-vaxxers are shooting themselves in BOTH feet. 

If there is anything Americans are very good at doing, its putting up barriers to access something for the sake of protecting american soil, and suing the crap out of each other.

Biggest example i can think off is air flight. To americans, the pandemic could effectively be over for them because they have the absolute biggest and most effective weapon, a top tier vaccine and plenty of it. But to the rest of the world, namely India, the pandemic is only getting worse, so in a sense, it ain't over. So in order for an american to fly to any part of the world, and come back HOME, a screening to protect america from spreading any covid from the other parts of the world will definetly be done. And if you have the vaccine, the amount of teeth you gotta pull to prove you are safe to enter american soil is probably cut by 90%. 

Why? Liability. If an airport is responsible for letting an outbreak into america unchecked, its grounds for claims for losses. We all know that this pandemic has hit EVERYTHING hard, and things at the very least move SLOWER. Which means less productivity, which means less profit, which means its a loss.  

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing i can think of, which may or may not happen, is the loss of a job opportunity. Imagine a recent grad from 2021, and he went to a prestigious school and worked his ass off in getting good grades and sincerely knowing his studies inside and out, and wants to change the world and has a ton of ambition. He's also 23-24 years old so he's even more hungry for life. He gets an interview with Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Boeing, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Blackstone, Delta, even a position in the White House, or whatever may apply to his industry. BUT..................he's a staunch anti-vaxxer. When office work becomes the norm again, i would NOT be surprised if offices start doing some kind of check for vaccination for the sake of keeping the company from being liable for a covid related loss. Because of that, when the company finds out his vaccination = ""not gonna get it"" (because its fucking nov 2021 and if you ain't gonna get the vaccine in America by that point, you probably ain't getting it ever), they go ""sorry sir, your resume is fantastic and you qualify for everything we've ever looked for, but you're just not a fit for our office, good luck"".

The UK is [vaccinating more rapidly](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2021-06-01..latest&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=Vaccine+doses&amp;Interval=7-day+rolling+average&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=USA~GBR~DEU~NLD~BEL~European+Union), has higher vaccination rates amongst vulnerable, has [more people fully vaccinated](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2021-06-01..latest&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=People+fully+vaccinated&amp;Interval=7-day+rolling+average&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=USA~GBR~DEU~NLD~BEL~European+Union) and [more people at least partially vaccinated](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2021-06-01..latest&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=People+vaccinated&amp;Interval=7-day+rolling+average&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=USA~GBR~DEU~NLD~BEL~European+Union) than the US.

Because of this and the longer pause between doses [more people are still partially vaccinated](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2021-06-01..latest&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=People+vaccinated+%28by+dose%29&amp;Interval=7-day+rolling+average&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=USA~GBR~DEU~NLD~BEL~European+Union) at a given moment and thus a higher % of deaths were vaccinated than the US.

But it is important to zoom out with these statistics. This means the UK has significantly [less deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2021-06-01..latest&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=Confirmed+deaths&amp;Interval=7-day+rolling+average&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=USA~GBR~DEU~NLD~BEL~European+Union), [hospital](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2021-06-01..latest&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=Hospital+admissions&amp;Interval=7-day+rolling+average&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=USA~GBR~DEU~NLD~BEL~European+Union)/ICU admissions and [hospital](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2021-06-01..latest&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=Hospital+patients&amp;Interval=7-day+rolling+average&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=USA~GBR~DEU~NLD~BEL~European+Union)/[ICU](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2021-06-01..latest&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=ICU+patients&amp;Interval=7-day+rolling+average&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=USA~GBR~DEU~NLD~BEL~European+Union) occupancy than the US.

And of course you'd have to add that the UK records deaths by reporting [all deaths within a 28 of days since a positive corona test](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths). This means they report more deaths less accurately (meaning they are counting deaths of people that have not died due to corona) but closer to ""reality"" (difference between counted deaths and excess mortality/death certificates is smaller). 

Now, the reason [the UK is fairing so badly in terms of cases](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2021-06-01..latest&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=Confirmed+cases&amp;Interval=7-day+rolling+average&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=USA~GBR~DEU~NLD~BEL~European+Union), is because it was [hit by the delta wave earlier](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2021-04-05..2021-06-14&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=Delta+variant+%28share%29&amp;Interval=7-day+rolling+average&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=USA~GBR~DEU~NLD~BEL~European+Union). The UK is just what the EU and US will look like the coming weeks to months. Another reason is that almost no young people were fully vaccinated in an environment with almost no restrictions with an extremely contagious variant. It is always the young people that are the first group to start a wave and the most infected group, but luckily they are by far the least vulnerable group (the ones vulnerable in all age group were already vaccinated). This will probably also means that a delta wave in the US will happen later and will probably be lower in terms of infections than in the UK. But the level of deaths and people in hospital/ICU will be many many times higher relative to the UK.",,,1625429518,{},h423oab,False,t3_odlvz6,False,True,t1_h4159hq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/odlvz6/fauci_99_of_us_virus_deaths_are_unvaccinated/h423oab/,1625650995,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

So my original comment means that, in regards to herd immunity, the state percent doesn't mean that much (since there is so much variation throughout each state). As a measure of how many individuals are protected, the state percent is obviously a good measure.*

**RE: Herd Immunity**  
The 70% threshold is used because this is the number we typically hear reported for herd immunity. In a city, we would aim to get 70% vaccinated. Once we reach this threshold, in theory, it is much more difficult for the virus to spread to the other 30% who are unvaccinated.

California is [reporting vaccine data](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-progress-dashboard-data-by-zip-code) per zip code area ([interactive map here](https://dig.abclocal.go.com/kabc/ca-vaccine-tracker/CA_vax_zip_map.html)). Looking at zip codes where data are not redacted (94% of zip codes), 67.1% of individuals statewide have received at least one dose of the vaccine (very close to the 70% threshold). If administered evenly among the state, this would mean the remaining 32.9% of unvaccinated individuals have a moderate amount of protection due to herd immunity.

We can break this down by zip code and see if this is actually the case. Out of the remaining 32.9% of unvaccinated individuals, only 38.9% live in a zip code which has reached the 70% threshold. This leaves 6.7 million unvaccinated individuals in zip codes where herd immunity has not been reached; 1.5 million of whom live in zip codes where only 50% of individuals have received at least one dose of the vaccine.

Looking at unvaccinated individuals in zip codes where less than 70% of individuals have at least one dose of the vaccine, 20.1% of California's population is still at risk of getting covid.

*So my original thinking here with my first comment is states are reporting they have reached 70% (what we typically think of as herd immunity), which would mean the state population is relatively safe; even though a large majority of the unvaccinated population is still at risk due to spatial variation in vaccine rates.*",,,1625432620,{},h429syn,False,t3_odjozk,False,True,t1_h40t1mk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/odjozk/20_states_reach_70_covid19_vaccination_goal/h429syn/,1625654196,2,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Covid is never going away, but it's going to get weaker over time regardless of whether the unvaccinated get vaccinated or not. The strains that are most successful at spreading will be the ones with weaker symptoms (more severe symptoms = infected is less mobile/active = less spread).

If a major deadly strain pops up, the unvaccinated population will become self-selecting over time and thin out, reducing their ability to spread that strain.

Vaccine resistant viruses are not vaccine immune, we are not going to see a covid strain that completely bypasses current vaccines - vaccinated people are always going to have less serious cases when infected because your body at least has a gameplan for fighting the infection off.

The likelihood of a strain that is largely fatal to the vaccinated is absurdly low.

**Study Title:** Perceived changes in cognitive performance of patients with active Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or recovered from COVID-19

**Study Description:** Many patients after COVID-19 infection have complained of cognitive impairment, including memory loss, confusion, difficulty focusing, dizziness, and grasping for everyday words. This problem may be also called “Brain Fog”. We want to systematically explore this problem in this research project. The results of this research will help us understand changes in cognitive performance including memory, attention, language, and executive function after COVID-19 infection. We will also explore some related factors including sleep quality, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and quality of life. These research results can support efforts to design interventions to improve cognitive performance after COVID-19 infection. 
We will use an online survey to collect data. It will take about 20-30 minutes to complete this survey.
**Participants must be:**

• over 18 years old 

• under active COVID-19 infection, recovered from COVID-19, or never been diagnosed with COVID-19

• do not have Alzheimer’s disease, other types of dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness over 30 minutes, diagnosed major depression, bipolar disorder, substance abuse, or schizophrenia

As an expert on transatlantic relations, I watched closely as President Biden took his first official trip overseas, to Europe — a visit packed with summits and photo-ops under the sunrays of a beautiful spring. Mending relations with Europe after four years of tensions, Biden gave life to his slogan that “America is back,” engaging allies on a long list of exciting new initiatives.
Yet, to my great disappointment, and that of many other Europeans living in the United States, one much-anticipated announcement never came: the lifting of the transatlantic “travel ban.” We were hopeful because, by and large, Europe has reopened to Americans. European Union member states — whose vaccination rates are in many places just a few weeks behind those of the United States — have agreed to lift the ban on nonessential travel from America (although individual members are free to impose their own restrictions).
Despite high hopes to the contrary, however, America has failed to reciprocate. The United States remains almost entirely sealed off to Europeans, a result of travel restrictions enacted by presidential proclamation in March 2020. (President Donald Trump briefly lifted them as he was leaving office, but Biden reinstated them immediately.) They stipulate that anyone who has been physically present in Britain, Ireland or 26 other European countries in the past 14 days is forbidden entry to the United States. It means that thousands of families, like mine, remain separated by the Atlantic Ocean, living in the same state of uncertainty as at the beginning of the pandemic crisis.

There are exceptions to the ban. U.S. citizens, green-card holders, their spouses and children, as well as diplomats, are allowed entry to the United States. Other people — including students, journalists and certain travelers working in areas involving “critical infrastructure” or “significant economic activity” — may qualify for a “National Interest Exception” to the travel ban. Their applications will be considered by American consular offices abroad.
However, this list of exceptions leaves out millions of ordinary travelers, as well as hundreds of thousands of European expatriates who, like me, happen to live temporarily in America. We are nonimmigrant visa holders. We live across the country in D.C., California, Michigan and Georgia. We are researchers, NASA engineers, project managers and elementary school teachers. We are employees, small-business owners and start-up chief executives. We have children in school, we pay rent and we pay taxes. However, we have not been able to visit our home countries in Europe since the onset of the pandemic. Although we are allowed to fly home, we have no guarantee that we will be able to return.

I was last in France in March 2020 to promote my latest book. I hurried back to my children in D.C., worried that imminent travel restrictions would keep us separated. Before leaving France, I kissed my dad goodbye as he lay on a hospital bed after a heart attack, anxious about the care he would get just as the pandemic was starting. (He has since recovered.) I rushed back to my career and home in America, never imagining that 15 months later, I would still be stuck here, subject to a travel ban.

Early in the pandemic, a travel ban was a prudent move — and the case for a ban remained strong for some time. But we are not, in June 2021, in a situation resembling that of a few months ago. Just as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has revised its guidelines for masking, so the U.S. government should reconsider the safety of letting at least some Europeans enter the country.
Over this long, unsettling period, my children have turned 10 years old and 6 years old — and my parents in France missed their birthdays. A new baby niece was born in Belgium, and I have yet to hold her. My grandpa turned 94, and I have not visited him in his new retirement home. But of course, I am one of the lucky ones. I can only imagine the tragedy of losing a loved one without being able to attend their funeral, the pain of suffering mental or physical ailments without any support network (I’ve been healthy), or the anguish of being long separated from a child or a partner (my French husband is stuck here with me).
Yes, I can fly home. The problem, for nonimmigrant visa holders, is that the route back to America — where for many of us our jobs, our houses and our children’s schools are — is fraught with complications. Those still in possession of a valid visa can try to take what’s become known as the “long route” back to America, which involves making a pit stop for more than 14 days in a third country such as Turkey, North Macedonia, Colombia or Mexico before returning to the United States. Such detours are costly and can be unsafe. Coronavirus rates are higher in Turkey than in either France or the United States, for example.

For those in need of a new visa, and I am among them, there are additional complications. Going back to Europe means being stranded there until one obtains a visa appointment. Yet wait times for nonimmigrant visa appointments at U.S. consulates in European capitals have reached unbelievable lengths: 349 days in Paris, for example. Other cities, including Rome and Berlin, are offering appointments only for “emergency” situations. This is partly because consular officers have been busy processing National Interest Exception requests.
Given such delays, European nonimmigrant visa holders are told not to leave the United States “unless they understand that they may not be able to reenter the United States for some time.” The backlogs have effectively created a permanent no-visa policy, a radical interpretation of immigration law for which the State Department is being sued.
As my own nonimmigrant visa is set to expire soon, I am faced with a dilemma. We could stay in the United States until the time comes for the visa appointment I was given for renewal — in April 2022. But faced with the prospect of 10 more months of separation, we’ve decided to fly to France to finally reunite with our family, then quarantine for 15 days in a third country outside Europe (as yet undetermined) before rushing back to Washington before the visa expires. I will then apply for an expedited process, hoping that a visa appointment would suddenly open, freeing me and my family from uncertainty. In short, this is a mess.

Although the Biden administration has expressed some empathy for Europeans who want to come to the United States, it has yet to meaningfully address the situation. So far, the only response from the White House has been the creation of “expert working groups,” a measure unlikely to produce results in the short-term.

With an eye on coronavirus variants, the Biden administration may decide to hold off on a full reopening to Europe for a few more weeks, or months. But this blanket travel ban on nonimmigrant visa holders is cruel and has outlived its purpose. Allowing us to travel would not significantly raise the public health risk in the United States. Sixteen months into the crisis, being unable to go back home has become unbearable to me and to many other Europeans. Travel is not just about tourism. It’s about human lives, which for now, are stuck in unremitting bureaucratic purgatory.",,,1625420940,{},h41mitu,True,t3_odnhky,False,False,t3_odnhky,/r/Coronavirus/comments/odnhky/the_ban_on_travel_from_europe_once_made_sense_now/h41mitu/,1625642422,27,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

I said two simple things. When you're out in public, its only reasonable to still wear a mask. When you're in a group of vaccinated friends and/or family, it is reasonable to enjoy yourself like before.

If there's a mask mandate, you should wear a mask, and can be fined for not doing so. If there's a no large gatherings mandate, you shouldn't be having parties, and can be fined for doing so. So it very much is not your discretion. Additionally, regardless of mandates, we can still talk about what is more reasonable to do whether the state tells you to or not.

The average number of new daily COVID infections in Israel has also risen by more than 50 percent since last week ■ Fourteen of the 35 cases defined as serious have received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine

The number of serious coronavirus cases in Israel has risen by almost 50 percent since last week, Health Ministry data released on Sunday showed, as the delta variant continues to spread across the country.

According to the Health Ministry, 326 new COVID cases were diagnosed on Friday and 185 on Saturday, with the number of serious cases currently standing at 35 – 11 more than the number reported last Sunday. Within this group, 17 are in critical condition and 16 are on ventilators.

Fourteen of the 35 cases defined as serious have received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine.

COVID-19 cases in Israel to triple in 10 days, health officials predict
Israel breaks 100,000 mark for vaccinating ages 12-16 against COVID
Israel establishing a new COVID testing compound at Ben-Gurion Airport
The Health Ministry added that the running average of daily new infections rose to 262 from 142 last week. Israel currently has 2,455 active cases. So far, 6,429 people have died from the virus. 

Due to the uptick in coronavirus cases, the number of communities in Israel with a moderate infection rate has spiked from nine to 21 over the weekend. These include several areas in Tel Aviv and Netanya that had been classified as low-risk until Friday.

Last week, the ministry said that the country will soon face 600 new coronavirus cases a day, and that this figure is expected to rise to 1000 in 10 days as the delta variant continues to spread across the country. According to the Health Ministry, Israel is also expected to carry out 100,000 COVID tests per day by July 11.

Israel surpassed 100,000 coronavirus inoculations of 12-16 year olds, the Health Ministry said on Saturday. The ministry, as well as Israeli health maintenance organizations, expressed satisfaction at the rate of vaccination in recent days. There was, however, mention of a large gap between the ultra-Orthodox and Arab populations and the rest of the public.

On Friday, Israel stepped up its bid to halt a major vector of coronavirus transmission by beginning to set up a new testing compound at Ben-Gurion International Airport, which will accommodate up to 2,500 tests an hour.

The initiative by the Defense and Transportation Ministries is expected to be up and running early next week, after Prime Minister Naftali Bennett identified the international gateway as ""a huge national vulnerability.""",,,1625411459,{},h4135lg,True,t3_odmc9e,False,False,t3_odmc9e,/r/Coronavirus/comments/odmc9e/covid_in_israel_serious_cases_surge_as_delta/h4135lg/,1625632580,20,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I'm sure not all of them are vaccinated, but at this point I'm not going to stay inside and take all the extra precautions that unvaccinated people should be taking, *when all of them are out living life as normal anyway*.

If they chose not to get the vaccine and they end up with Covid that is on them; I'm done trying to do everything I can to protect the unvaccinated people, when they don't give a shit anyway.  Maybe it's just the area I'm in too I guess, basically there was a two week period where I saw mask use go from like 80% to like 10%.  If no one else is wearing a mask in a store, what is the point of me wearing one when I'm vaccinated anyway?

The comment above you says the life we knew in 2019 is gone, but in my experience life has been back to normal around here since April or May of this year.  Like I said before, no one even talks about Covid anymore around here, and people sure as hell aren't taking any precautions.  But we also have not seen a rise in cases either so I guess we'll see what happens with the delta variant in a couple months.  Although even if it started killing people at twice the rate of normal Covid I don't think anyone would follow any precautions again around here.

If you're in the US where so many people don't give AF and happily spread it, it's probably a good idea to get it.  Especially with the seemingly endless variants popping up all the time.

I was the same as you.  Uneasy about the vaccine, but I make data driven decisions so it became a no-brainer (got Johnson one).  It's far more relaxing to be out and about and enjoying nightlife again knowing the vaccine will at least 100% protect against dying from covid or being hospitalized from it.

Comes down to fact there is tons of data that covid is very dangerous to your health with long-term health complications.  Then considering there is also tons of data that the vaccines are largely safe and do NOT cause long-term health complications.  Serious reaction is probably about as likely as taking an aspirin.

Don't let anyone convince you that a vaccine is more dangerous to your health than covid itself.  Even if that story does change, it's most logical to act on today's data.

Literally the day before my coworker got her vaccine, I was going into the details about the various studies that has been released about what makes the Delta variant so strong and how it's still stronger than the vaccine. She asked me if even vaccinated people are still catching the delta version of covid and spreading it, what's the point? And all I could say was at least it stops you from dying. Oh by the way. It's in the US now and is about to become the most popular version of covid."" She never told us she would and I didn't ask her to do get vaccinated, but I ended by saying ""this is why [other Indian friend] won't stop harassing you to do it.""",,,1625422413,{},h41pimy,False,t3_odlvz6,False,False,t3_odlvz6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/odlvz6/fauci_99_of_us_virus_deaths_are_unvaccinated/h41pimy/,1625643906,20,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

“It matters. Unvaccinated folks being a solid % of the population mean I can’t bring my kids anywhere. If you don’t care that my kids can’t be in public, that’s fine, I get that. Im not asking for sympathy.

It’s important to “you” anyway because it means families like mine won’t be vacationing, shopping, or going out to eat.

That’s less support of local businesses, less tips for waiters, less dollars spent and taxed because of my kids aren’t going, my whole family stays home.

128m plus households total in the US, 24% of those are households with children. That’s 31m households with kids under eighteen. So say half of families think the vaccine makes you safer (52% Americans have at least the first dose). That’s 15.5m households that in favor, 15.5m against. Ballpark.

Say out of the 15.5m households that think the vaccine is a positive thing, let’s say one out of ten families think that the unvaccinated population (48% of Americans) pose a threat to their children.

That translates to over one and a half million households that won’t be participating in activities outside their homes. Or 1.2% of the total number of households in the US that won’t be out and spending like they did pre-covid.

I’ve been rounding down with numbers, but say my assumptions are far, far off. Say I’m off by as much as half.

That’s still .6% of families, which is huge and hard fought for in terms of spending power.

I'm not sure you've understood what evolutionary pressure is.  The fact that the Delta variant has been able to completely dominate the infection rate in countries like the UK, India and Russia at the expense of the original virus and all other variants is a demonstration of evolutionary pressure pushing the virus to evolve to be more transmissible.  Ultimately Covid will end up as a more transmissible and less virulent version of what we know.

From the article on which you're commenting:

&gt;In Britain those infected with the Alpha variant saw a higher level of severe disease than those infected with the original version, but no corresponding increase in deaths... The picture emerging from a British symptom-tracking app called Zoe suggests that Delta is presenting with symptoms closer to those for the common cold than those seen with other variants. They rarely have shortness of breath, the hallmark symptom of covid-19 with the variants that dominated the first year of the pandemic.

There are a few reasons that vaccinated people are *generally* even safer, but the biggest one is that most vaccinated people live in areas with high vaccination rates, which means herd immunity.  For example: my county, Santa Clara, CA, has an overall vaccination rate of 73% and a current case rate of around 1 per 100k per day.  Gentry County, MO has a 33% vaccination rate and a case rate of around 37 per 100k per day.

Exactly why it has become so much more widespread than SARS-CoV-1 which was more lethal yet killed less. QED.

&gt; It doesn't matter if it becomes more lethal, because those that are on a ventilator, in an ICU unit or quarantined in a COVID ward aren't the ones perpetuating the pandemic.

People don't stop being infectious when they get to hospital though - they're just not in a position to spread disease.  The point is that taking people off their feet and putting them in hospital stops the disease being transmitted.  You're making the same point I am.  Transmission is greatest in the symptomatic period as it's the coughs and sneezes which spread the infection more than anything.

Or here is a comment that was posted somewhere on reddit and it resonated with me so I sent it to someone on Facebook. This was on a post about WHO recommending vaxxed to still wear masks. 


&gt;I’m not sure how to feel. I wore my mask all year and did everything I was asked to do. Now that I’m fully vaxxed and the cdc said go ahead and remove the mask if you are fully vaxxed. I went ahead and did that. If they say the delta variant poses a new threat and the mask is advised again I’d probably put it back on. But if the main reason they’re saying it is because the delta variant poses a more serious risk to people who have not been vaccinated but it is not a threat to vaccinated people. That is a tougher pill to swallow. I’m tired of having to model my entire existence over trying to protect morons who won’t do it for themselves and wouldn’t do it when they were asked to protect lthers. I know some people can’t get vaccinated yet so I will probably go ahead and don the mask until kids and so on have the opportunity if that’s what the cdc recommends. But I don’t know, I’m kind of sick of having to protect the anti vaxxers from themselves",,,1625426591,{},h41xxk9,False,t3_odlvz6,False,True,t1_h41tb7k,/r/Coronavirus/comments/odlvz6/fauci_99_of_us_virus_deaths_are_unvaccinated/h41xxk9/,1625648071,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

wearing a mask will likely help other people if you get infected, and will reduce the viral load if you get infected from somebody else.
