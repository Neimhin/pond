&gt;If our observations of mask-associated ocular dryness and irritation prove to be consistent in all mask wearers, patients and providers need to be aware of these potential ramifications. Lubricant eye drops and eye protection, such as goggles, should be used in conjunction with masks. Additional care should be taken by individuals using masks for extended periods and by patients with prior history of dry eye disease, recent ophthalmic surgery, or other surface inflammatory diseases, such as Sjogren syndrome.

&gt;Masks with a pliable nose-wire should be used, with attention toward fitting the shape of the wire to prevent air being directed toward the eyes. Masks can also be taped at the top to impede upward airflow, but care should be taken to ensure that lower lid excursion is not inhibited. Patients experiencing dry eye symptoms from extended mask wear should take breaks every few hours to remove the mask, allow the eyes to recover, and reapply lubricant eye drops. Emollient eye drops may be the most effective in preventing symptoms by preserving tear film. Blinking exercises may also be beneficial.

I will also mention that this is not a study but an article that might prove to be fodder for a hypothesis and future research.
I will read the studies it is based on to see what they say.
It is definitely still in favor of masks with mitigations for eye dryness and other problems that might result from wearing masks",,,,1627084249,{},h6b5oal,False,t3_oq9tfy,False,True,t1_h6axdjn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oq9tfy/st_louis_city_county_to_reinstate_mask_mandate/h6b5oal/,1627245280,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

Both mRNA vaccines made use of a “lock“ on the protein spike they produce. The spike changes form when it fuses with a cell. Since the goal was to train the body to make antibodies that neutralize the virus before it can fuse to a cell, they made a modification to stop that change from happening.

https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-08/uota-lds080520.php

My theory is that while it resulted in a weaker antibody response, by allowing the spikes to fuse to cells, the oxford vaccine gives the body more opportunities to learn how to kill infected cells, hence the better T cell response. Maybe a future vaccine could include both versions of the spike to cover all bases.

During a news briefing, Dr. Lisa Piercey, the Commissioner for the Tennessee Department of Health, discussed the “breakthrough” cases and revealed 195 of those fully vaccinated residents who tested positive for the virus had been hospitalized.

Knox County Advisory Board of Health to meet as COVID-19 cases rise across Tennessee	
She added 27 of the patients had died.



The Tennessee Department of Health‘s website shows 2,642,285 people in the state are fully vaccinated.

Dr. Piercey said 25% of the “breakthrough” cases are asymptomatic with 50% in people 60 and older.

The state of Tennessee has experienced a more than 200% increase in overall COVID-19 cases since July 1, averaging more than 700 new cases per day over the last week, according to the health commissioner.

	
Dr. Piercey added the state, at one point recently, had less than 200 virus patients hospitalized, but the number is now well over 500.

“We haven’t seen an uptick yet in deaths. Unfortunately, that will probably come in the next few weeks,” she said. “It takes a few weeks after somebody gets sick and then in the hospital, if they are going to pass away, that would come a few weeks later.”

	
The Delta variant of the virus is the predominant variant in Tennessee, making up a majority of the state’s infections, according to Dr. Piercey.

“It is here in Tennessee and it is widespread,” she explained.

The state’s health commissioner added that almost all of the hospitalizations and deaths among Tennesseans are still among the unvaccinated.

Dr. Piercey said 97% of all hospitalizations and more than 98% of deaths are residents who have not received the vaccine.

Arriving at this result requires assuming random mixing of the entire population, that is that you are equally likely to contact any member of the population, random vaccination, and that vaccination and natural immunity prevent infection and reinfection 100% of the time. If you assume vaccination prevents infection only E% of the time then herd immunity = (1-1/R0)/E. (Note this E does not represent vaccine effectiveness but represents the chance that a vaccinated individuals will not get infected. Vaccine effectiveness represents a proportionate reduction in disease as compared to an unvaccinated population.)

It seems that nailing down the R0 value is tricky. From what I'm aware of it's value will depend on population dynamics (rural areas will have a smaller R0 than urban areas).

Objective  
With a vaccine effectiveness of 95% for preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 (BNT162b2) was the first vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to be approved. However, immunosuppressive therapy was an exclusion criterion in the phase 3 trial that led to approval. Thus, extrapolation of the trial results to patients with rheumatic diseases treated with immunosuppressive drugs warrants caution.  
  
Methods  
Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; n = 61) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA; n = 73) were included from the COPANARD (Corona Pandemic Autoimmune Rheumatic Disease) cohort, followed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients received the BNT162b2 vaccine between December 2020 and April 2021. All patients had total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 measured before vaccination and 1 week after the second vaccination (VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products).  
  
Results  
Of 134 patients (median age, 70 years), 77% were able to mount a detectable serological response to the vaccine. Among patients treated with rituximab, only 24% had detectable anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in their serum after vaccination. The time since the last rituximab treatment did not seem to influence the vaccine response. No significant difference was observed between patients with RA or SLE when adjusting for treatment, and no correlation between antibody levels and age was detected (r = −0.12; P = 0.18).

It breaks down as 2.2% for over-50s and 0.035% for under-50s.  But even those under-50s are probably mostly in their 40s or maybe 30s at that time.

There's a new one [yesterday](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1005517/Technical_Briefing_19.pdf).   The table on page 18 is the relevant one.

220/2873 = 0.77% CFR in vaccinated over-50s

4/15346 = 0.02% CFR in vaccinated under-50s

""Vaccinated"" means by day of second dose (rather than a week or two after that second dose which would be better), but it's also by day of sample collection.

The only surprising thing to me is that the over-50 CFR has dropped, but perhaps that could be explained by the second dose taking weeks to have a full effect.  I do think they're making a mistake by counting by day of second dose.

Fully vaccinated under-50s still have about a 3% chance of a hospital visit after testing positive.  Of course, we know that vaccines help at this stage too and that these hospital visits are likely to be short.",,,,1627154094,{},h6e8p69,False,t3_oqkz41,False,True,t1_h6e5v5o,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oqkz41/daily_discussion_thread_july_24_2021/h6e8p69/,1627303228,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

On page 16 you can see 118 deaths out of 10.8k people who have gotten their second dose.  They break it down further as a 2/5600 = 0.04% CFR for those under 50 and a 116/5234 = 2.2% CFR for those over 50.  Strangely the UK only counts deaths if they occur within 28 days of a test; based on US state data I've seen that may exclude about half of deaths from being counted (when healthcare availability is high).

That's about 3 weeks out of date and they release a new (ultra-long) briefing each week.  As they vaccinate younger people you would not expect the over-50 numbers to change much, but the total CFR among the unvaccinated should continue to drop as overall CFR probably starts rising again.

All that may sound vaguely worrisome, but remember that the mRNA vaccines reduce chance of Delta infection by a factor of nearly 10.  They reduce severity if infection happens by another much-harder-to-measure factor, but it's probably a smaller one.

Define “old normal”. If you mean, “Will everyone currently forced to work from home eventually go back to working in offices?” We already know the answer to that is no, some companies have figured out they’re actually better off with a WFH or hybrid schedule.

If you mean, “Will we ever get to a point where we don’t have to social distance?” Of course we will, some places already have. But we may still have to put NPIs like distancing and masks back in place from time to time. We can’t predict the future with enough certainty to say it’ll never be necessary again.

[],,usmilitarythrowaway1,,,[],,,,text,t2_a97spydw,False,False,[],"The US government is buying an additional 200m doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, expanding its total order to 500m, as officials prepare for the next phase of vaccinations, including children under 12 and potential booster shots.

Doses of the messenger RNA shots — to be delivered between October and April next year — will either be the current formulation or one that has been adapted to coronavirus variants. The companies are testing whether a shot tailored to the Delta variant is more effective in studies set to begin next month.

A Biden administration official familiar with the contract said the government was exercising an option to buy the 200m doses “to prepare for future vaccination needs, including vaccines for children under 12 and possible booster shots if studies show they are necessary”.

“Importantly, as part of the agreement, Pfizer will provide the US with 65m paediatric doses should Pfizer’s vaccine be approved for kids under 12, including doses available immediately upon authorisation,” the Biden administration official told the Financial Times. 

Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s chief executive, said on Friday that the additional purchase would enable “broad access” to vaccines in the US.

“As a long-term partner to the US government in the fight against this pandemic, we are proud of the impact of vaccination efforts across the country. Vaccines have been and will remain critical to protecting lives against this devastating disease,” he said.

Pfizer has assessed that people who have already received the full two-jab regimen will probably need a third shot, even though US public health officials have been reluctant to commit to a booster programme.

The UK is preparing for a booster programme for the most vulnerable, while its scientists examine emerging evidence. The EU has also made a big bet on continuing to use the Pfizer vaccine, with an order of up to 1.8bn to be delivered by 2023.

The companies are planning to apply for US emergency use authorisation for their shot to be used as a third dose. Analysts predict a booster shot market could be worth tens of billions of dollars.

About 60 per cent of US adults are fully vaccinated, and while shots are widely available, officials have struggled to overcome high levels of vaccine hesitancy.

Covid-19 cases in the US had been in sharp decline since the country began a mass vaccination campaign in the spring. However, infections have begun to rise again in recent week, especially among the unvaccinated, as the contagious Delta variant sweeps across the country.

“I think they’re having a very hard time modelling this and they don’t know where we are in this wave of infection,” Scott Gottlieb, former head of the Food and Drug Administration, told CNBC.

“I think we’re vastly under-measuring how much infection is already under way in the US, and where we are in this epidemic wave. I think we’re probably further into it than we’re measuring right now.”

Gottlieb noted the CDC estimates of how many new Delta-related cases were diagnosed in the US varied widely, suggesting the agency is struggling to get a firm view on how broad the new outbreak is and how protected fully-vaccinated Americans are.

“I think we’re also having a hard time measuring what the components of immunity are and the durability of immunity,” he added.

Separately, the US government has already ordered 500m Pfizer doses at non-profit prices to provide to the developing world in 2022 and 2023, via the World Health Organization’s Covax initiative.",,,,1627092219,{},h6bkjwv,True,t3_oqgpwq,False,False,t3_oqgpwq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oqgpwq/us_buys_200m_pfizer_jabs_for_children_and/h6bkjwv/,1627253594,48,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I read that article you posted - here are some interesting points taken from it:

&gt;If our observations of mask-associated ocular dryness and irritation prove to be consistent in all mask wearers, patients and providers need to be aware of these potential ramifications. Lubricant eye drops and eye protection, such as goggles, should be used in conjunction with masks. Additional care should be taken by individuals using masks for extended periods and by patients with prior history of dry eye disease, recent ophthalmic surgery, or other surface inflammatory diseases, such as Sjogren syndrome.

&gt;Masks with a pliable nose-wire should be used, with attention toward fitting the shape of the wire to prevent air being directed toward the eyes. Masks can also be taped at the top to impede upward airflow, but care should be taken to ensure that lower lid excursion is not inhibited. Patients experiencing dry eye symptoms from extended mask wear should take breaks every few hours to remove the mask, allow the eyes to recover, and reapply lubricant eye drops. Emollient eye drops may be the most effective in preventing symptoms by preserving tear film. Blinking exercises may also be beneficial.

I will also mention that this is not a study but an article that might prove to be fodder for a hypothesis and future research.
I will read the studies it is based on to see what they say.
It is definitely still in favor of masks with mitigations for eye dryness and other problems that might result from wearing masks",,,,1627084237,{},h6b5nja,False,t3_oq9tfy,False,True,t1_h6ay5fw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oq9tfy/st_louis_city_county_to_reinstate_mask_mandate/h6b5nja/,1627245268,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It's actually not mutating that much. It may be mutationally constrained, I have links if you'd like.

&gt; It will infect the vaxxed population; and then mutate into a deadlier strain due to how many people will be infected but asymptomatic. 

No.

No.

Right, that's my point. Why would anyone recommend the mask policy to be changed when the ability of the virus to mutate in the vaccinated population is still there? 

Being real - wearing a mask is such a non-issue and I feel like all these leaders and rushing ahead to keep optimism high when vaccination rates have been falling. 

I still wear mine despite being vaccinated. However 1/100 people I see IRL are wearing one. Considering the vaccination rates. This feels extremely premature.

Nope, just wanting to highlight how during a pandemic the usual approach of considering rights violations by governments in a vacuum does not hold up so well. People see all the hardship caused by lockdowns and get tunnel vision and blame the government for causing harm. It becomes much harder to see the alternative situation and all the harm that would be caused if the government did not act.

Both outcomes were determined 14 days after the first dose and 14 days after the second dose. 

However, at the time the preprint was published there was not enough data yet (not enough people got infected) to determine the efficacy for two doses of Moderna, so I will summarize the efficacy values for one dose of Moderna.

14 days after the first dose of Moderna the efficacy for protection against symptomatic disease was 83% for the alpha variant, 77% for the beta variant and 72% for the delta variant. The efficacy for protection against hospitalization or death 14 days after the first dose of Moderna was determined to be 79% for the alpha variant, 89% for beta variant and 96% for delta variant. It is safe to say that these values will improve after the second dose.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a crucial role in host defense against infection and tissue injuries and is a bioindicator of multiple distinct types of cytokine storms. In this review, we present the current understanding of the diverse roles of IL-6, its receptors, and its signaling during acute severe systemic inflammation. IL-6 directly affects vascular endothelial cells, which produce several types of cytokines and chemokines and activate the coagulation cascade. Endothelial cell dysregulation, characterized by abnormal coagulation and vascular leakage, is a common complication in cytokine storms. Emerging evidence indicates that a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab, can effectively block IL-6 signaling and has beneficial effects in rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile systemic idiopathic arthritis, and Castleman’s disease. Recent work has also demonstrated the beneficial effect of tocilizumab in chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy-induced cytokine storms as well as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Therefore, there is a priority to develop treatments that reduce the severity of COVID-19 in patients who require hospital admission. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine. In 2011, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), tocilizumab, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, giant cell arteritis, and Castleman’s disease. In 2017, tocilizumab was approved to treat chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy-induced cytokine release syndrome (CRS). In 2021, the results of the REMAP-CAP clinical trial (NCT02735707) and the COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) clinical trial (NCT04381936) supported FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for tocilizumab to treat hospitalized patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies are currently in clinical development or undergoing clinical trials to treat COVID-19. Further clinical trials will provide safety and efficacy data on targeting IL-6 and IL-6R and provide rationales for more personalized combination treatments to control the systemic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized patients with moderate and severe COVID-19.

[],,HW90,,,[],,,,text,t2_58rca,False,False,[],"The UK is currently protected by the vaccines before antibodies have waned to a significant extent, that's my point, that's why it's seeing relatively low R numbers. The UK conducted its second doses relatively late as a result of the longer spacing, which will also cause antibodies to wane more slowly, so it will take much longer until we start seeing this in the UK. It is also still protected by further natural immunity alongside non-pharmaceutical interventions which prevent R from reaching its full potential, particularly as the effect of the July 19th reopening won't be shown yet.

Hence the UK is still in the position to have R in the 1.2-1.4 range despite being fully open because the vaccines are still preventing infection and bumping up the proportion of cases who are asymptomatic and so transmit to fewer people. That could change in a few months to a year however if we start seeing the same trend in vaccine efficacy against infection as Israel. In that situation R number would increase substantially because they're going from 60-70% infections prevented (and roughly the equivalent decrease in R number) to 16% if I remember correctly, and that will continue to go down. Based on Delta being around [5-8 without restrictions](https://states.aarp.org/west-virginia/the-delta-variant-is-40-more-infectious-than-the-original-covid-19-strain) if vaccines bring it down to 1.5 then we would expect it to go up to 4-5 once antibodies wane, excluding the impact of natural infection in the meantime.

I work in Manhattan and I can feel the hooks coming through the screen where the implication is I should work until midnight from my home (with two kids) or come into the city and get to leave at a 'reasonable time like 7pm' and fight to commute home for two hours when I live only 18 miles away.

Apple has already backed off their insane return to the office mandate, as have some of the big banks. If there's one thing that could cause further spread unnecessarily and especially for those with kids having to return to school soon, it's to realize that in most cases, going into an office everyday after being herded onto mass transit for hours is totally unnecessary.

If you want to, that's one thing and if you're vaccinated and don't have kids under 12, I get it and fully support it. But there are millions of us in another boat who felt that this rush to return to normalcy might have been too fast. That it felt like a brewing war against work-from-home for no discernible logical reason (or even financial, it saves money!) other than the egos of the people at the top and the desire to keep people from pursuing side hustles or realizing they hate what they're doing, how meaningless it is, and deciding to pursue something else or downsize their lives to... ya know, live more life.

But yeah, I think much of what we were seeing from politicians has to do with 'getting the economy' back. And I get that, people suffer one way or another. However, as usual, the most pressing parts and the way it was handled seem designed to benefit those who need it the least here in the good 'ole United States of America. Most of the aspects deemed most urgent have to do with those aspects that provided the fewest issues and had the biggest benefit in terms of curbing spread, i.e. - working from home.

A debate can be had about many things, whether or not remote learning is worth the reward versus children's stunted learning being a big one... but going into the office for 'face time', water cooler chat, and all the other frivolous b.s. that many couldn't stand to begin with? No... there's no debate to be had there. It's the easiest 'win' against the spread of all illnesses, not just COVID.

Not everyone needs an education, especially a college degree, which is something employers need to wake up to and stop expecting prospective employees to put themselves into lifelong debt just so they can check an imaginary box in employers' minds for jobs that will never be worth the expense of school loans. 

However, if you hate the conditions of low-skill work, there are jobs that pay well and require much less time/money in training compared to getting a college degree. The trades desperately need people and they pay really well. And jobs like truck driving. My friend's son just did a short certification in truck driving and is 23 and saving to buy a condo. He's making good money right out of a three-month course. He likes driving and traveling. The job is a good fit for him.

There's no reason that woman, the typical CNAs, can't drive trucks or become electricians if they want to make good money. And those jobs aren't requiring or pressuring employees to get vaccinated, for the most part. 

My point is, if you hate your job AND are putting other people's lives at risk, it's time to rethink your choices. I agree that these jobs are not worth personal sacrifice, although I would argue that getting the vaccine is a not a sacrifice for most people. And I think that if people quit these jobs until employers wake up and pay higher wages and good benefits, then they will get them. 

Until then, you can't ethically argue that killing vulnerable people in nursing homes because you don't like your employers' conditions is morally acceptable.

(First shot) 💉💪🩹,dark,text,t2_a0itw6r0,False,False,[],"&gt; A DUP MLA, and former health minister said he is not willing to take any of the current Covid-19 vaccinations licensed for use in Northern Ireland, because of “ethical concerns”.

&gt; He said he was concerned over how the vaccine had been developed and tested claiming historically vaccines had used “stem cells and tissues from aborted babies”. 

&gt; While cells derived from elective abortions have been used since the 1960s to manufacture vaccines, no fetal cell lines or human tissue were used to manufacture any of the available Covid-19 vaccines in the UK.

&gt; Instead, the vaccines use mRNA technology which is synthetically produced.

&gt; Virologists have stressed the vaccines contain only synthetic material and no human cells are used in their development. The Department of Health has also said the vaccines contain no human element.

&gt; South Down MLA Jim Wells (64) said his “very strong pro-life"" views was the reason for his decision. 

&gt; He called for the Department of Health to roll out the German-made CureVac vaccine, which he would prefer, stressing he was not “anti-vaccine”.

&gt; He said he did not wish to dictate what anyone else should do.

&gt; Mr Wells said his concern was the historic development of vaccines: “Which are still being tested in the same way. I want nothing to do with that industry.”

&gt; When asked why he was assured the CureVac vaccine was not developed and tested using procedures he deemed ethically concerning he responded: “It isn't.

&gt; When asked if he had been in contact with the Health Minister or the manufacturers to confirm the methods used for CureVac, Mr Wells responded he had not.

&gt;  “But I am clear, there is plenty of material out there that it is not and all the people lobbying me, that’s what they want.”

&gt; In February, Mr Wells wrote to the Health Minister Robin Swann asking when the CureVac vaccine would be introduced in Northern Ireland. The MLA says he never received a response and was planning to “chase this up”.

&gt; In February, the UK agreed a 50 million-dose order for a Covid-19 vaccine with German biotech company CureVac. However, the vaccine has not yet been approved for use by the MHRA body which regulates vaccines.

&gt; “What I have asked the minister is when CureVac is going to be made available to those who have an ethical problem with what is available at the moment,” said Jim Wells.

&gt; “This vaccine has been available for many months but not been made available to people in Northern Ireland.

&gt; “It is not an anti-vaccine issue it is an ethical issue. I have had a large number of Christians who have said to me: ‘Look we are not opposed to vaccines and are not into these conspiracy theory issues and have nothing against vaccination, we just would prefer to have an ethical vaccine option’.

&gt; “The simple solution to this is to enable everyone in Northern Ireland to have a vaccine and to make the vaccines which are ethically sound.

&gt; “I’m not on the anti-vaccine bandwagon and I don’t want to do anything to deter people who have a different moral perspective on this.

&gt; “I’m just saying to our government, get your act together and make this available to people like myself, I’d even pay for it, to enable those of us who have a moral problem to be vaccinated.”

&gt; In a response to the Belfast Telegraph, the Department of Health did not make a direct comment on Mr Wells’ remarks or the status of the CureVac vaccine. 

&gt; Instead, the Department linked to the official government information for the three vaccines available here, showing no human tissue listed in the ingredients.

&gt; In December, responding to DUP councillor John Carson who said he would not take a vaccine, Health Minister Robin Swann said people objecting to Covid-19 vaccination on anti-abortion grounds should think again.

&gt; ""It is disappointing that people calling themselves pro-life would be objecting to vaccination programme that will save many lives,” said Robin Swann.

&gt; ""It is the case that the development and testing of some vaccines can include the use of human cell lines grown in labs, having been replicated from fetal cells obtained in previous decades following abortions.

&gt; ""If people want to object on those grounds and leave themselves unprotected from Covid-19 that is their choice.”",,,,1627131696,{},h6d0nwp,True,t3_oqpgfh,False,False,t3_oqpgfh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oqpgfh/northern_ireland_former_dup_health_minister_jim/h6d0nwp/,1627280892,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Wearing one is not the end of the world by any means. I was fine wearing one for over a year because until I had the shot and the CDC said it was fine for me to let it go, I wanted to protect others and do what I could to stimulate the economy safely. I don’t mind wearing one personally in situations like at the doctor and other places that have asked me to.

It’s about what going back to it represents. There is supposed to be a way for this to end. If mask mandates come back, that signals that those who cared about getting the vaccine doing it is not enough and that life will not go back to the way it was. I’m of course sick of POS anti-vaxxers but it was clear from the beginning that they wouldn’t take it. Unfortunately, it seems “just a mask” has now become a way to push off that there now is no end. We need an actual target to get these things off, such as being approved for the under 12s and giving them the 6-8 weeks to get the shots.

Yes I was a bit dramatic last night now that I’ve slept it off but seeing this was not the best way to end a tough week after my mechanic basically broke my car and the loneliness of being in a new place with no friends hit me and I’ve been pretty down this week. I’m sorry if you think I don’t have empathy but when the only point of me wearing one anymore since I now have the shot is preventing me from getting a mild breakthrough infection at worst, it’s frustrating when people use the “selfish, idiot” and other names they used for anti-vaxxers and pre-vaccine anti-maskers.

What are you talking about?

It is about halfway there, which would be about 0.05 SD, lining up with the 0.04 SD in the text.

Please read my comment. The quoted section relates to those with mild disease, without respiratory symptoms, or with respiratory symptoms but no mention of breathing difficulty. Of course the effect sizes increase as the severity increases, this is evident in Figure 2 and the mentioned numbers which is where I got my numbers to begin with. But my comment **very specifically** mentioned mild cases with no medical care:

&gt; The effect size they found for someone who was ill but without respiratory problems was 0.04 SD, and ill with respiratory symptoms but without needing medical assistance was 0.07 SD

&gt;The region of Samara — a relatively well-off area where the Volga River bends past oil fields and car factories as it nears Kazakhstan — had **10,596 excess deaths**, a jump of 25 percent over the 2019 mortality rate. **Yet the region reported only 606 official coronavirus deaths last year**.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**“The published numbers are trustworthy,”** said Armen Benyan, Samara’s health minister. “And they are what they are.”

One year ago: [Six Months Into the Coronavirus Outbreak, Russia’s Statistics Still Provide More Questions Than Answers Analysis of excess fatalities show regions may be underreporting deaths from Covid-19.](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/08/11/six-months-into-the-coronavirus-outbreak-russias-statistics-still-provide-more-questions-than-answers-a71069)  


&gt;(Tatarstan) Deaths in June came in 800 above the average level — the highest single toll in any month, not just any June, since a spate of devastating wildfires killed tens of thousands across the country in 2010.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Political analysts and statisticians told The Moscow Times underreporting of the pandemic on a regional level is a given considering the political architecture binding Moscow and the regions.   
“By default, regions do not report honestly to the federal center,” said Petrov.  
“Neither a governor nor the president are eager to get bad news, and so their subordinates try not to come to their bosses with bad news.” That’s partly because the Kremlin judges Russia’s regional governors — a large number of which are parachuted-in from outside the region — on their bureaucratic performance, he added.  
“The system doesn’t require them to be the best, it requires them to not be very different from the others, to be very fast in reacting to each and every order coming from the center, and to be seen to avoid public scandals.”  
Coming to Moscow to ask for help in a time of crisis is “considered a vulnerability and weakness,” said political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya. In the context of the coronavirus, the Kremlin demands governors perform a tricky balancing act — keeping cases low, hospitals within capacity, social unrest down and economic fallout minimal, she added.

(Article also got good explanation on the problem with reporting death late, months after death, as Rosstat does.)  


Problems with Rosstat itself and how ""trustworthy"" Rosstat is: [https://meduza.io/feature/2021/07/08/dannye-rosstata-stali-neudobnymi-dlya-kremlya-i-pravitelstva-tam-reshili-sdelat-tak-chtoby-ih-nikto-ne-zamechal](https://meduza.io/feature/2021/07/08/dannye-rosstata-stali-neudobnymi-dlya-kremlya-i-pravitelstva-tam-reshili-sdelat-tak-chtoby-ih-nikto-ne-zamechal)

Do you see how you’ve unsuccessfully tried to move the goalposts? First, it was “we don’t know the long term side effects. Then it was “the vaccines are causing issues that are lasting well past 4 weeks” — a supposedly factual statement with no citation whatsoever which contradicts your original statement about not knowing about long-term side effects. 

Next, you said that mRNA vaccines have never been used on humans and I proved you wrong there as well. Then, when I asked you to explain precisely how something would cause long-term effects when it’s no longer in your body, specifying that I am educated in the hard sciences, suddenly you’re no longer an expert and can’t tell me how these magical effects would happen even though you made the initial claim to that effect.

Then it was a blanket statement of “the vaccines are having long-term effects past 4 weeks” without any citation whatsoever even though you previously stated that we “don’t know” if there are long-term effects. 

Subsequently, it became “prove that my statement is wrong”, which is not how arguments work. You don’t prove a negative; the original claimant provides legitimate evidence for the claim. You have once again failed to do so.

Isn’t is amazing how I was able to predict you’d try to claim VAERS is legitimate when it is all self-reported? Now how do you suppose I knew that was coming if not for the fact that all of you antivaxx morons follow the same pathetic playbook?

Are you finished yet? Do I need to keep doing this?

That belief has no basis in science or history, and with novel diseases that have not been around for very long we have always (or almost always?) seen the opposite.  1918 influenza is the classic example, where the ""first wave"" was not especially contagious or deadly, but the ""second wave"" was many, many times deadlier as well as being more contagious.  Simply put, a novel disease isn't adapted to humans, and the easiest way to adapt is to reproduce faster within the human body - which will generally make the disease more deadly and more contagious.

The only research we have on Delta variant is from Canada, where they found it to be 1.5-3.3x deadlier than the classic strain.

Of course, vaccines are very effective, and extremely so against death, so during a period of ongoing vaccination you would definitely expect to see overall mortality plummet.

The social and political landscape has also changed dramatically since those books were first published. Some of the moral high ground the ""good guys"" stood on has since eroded - specifically the holier than thou mentality on illegal drugs. Also, there are some elements that are at worst innocuous products of their time, but which would be considered unrelatable or ""pRoBlEmAtIc"" by some folks now.

Honestly this sounds like a huge win for the vaccines. 

Looking at the UK they are up to something near 50k cases a day  in the seven day average with just over 4k in the hospital, a few hundred in ICU and less than 100 deaths per seven day average.

The last time the uk was at that number of new daily infections they had 23k people in the hospital and a couple thousand in ICU roughly 600 people a day were dying.

There is nothing to lose by keeping our masks on and everything to gain. For all of you advocating that this is some sort of infringement on your rights, a massive inconvenience or that 'no i wont do it blah blah', no one cares &amp; gtfo.

While I have enjoyed a few weeks of taking it off at the grocer here and there, it literally does not bother me nor most anyone even a little bit that masks are being recommended.

I am very proud of how we have implemented a science and data driven approach to COVID, and our County is rated one of the highest not just for vaccine uptake, but also for mask adherence and intelligent phased base policy.   


At the time of our Phase 2/3/4 decision making, the vaccine was only available for 16+, thus the reference point. The reason why, especially living here, we do not cite ""total"" % is because symptomatic and asymptomatic spread from 12 and under, to and from, is so negligible that we've integrated that observation into our public health policy county and state wide.  


Like, it's a great 'gotcha' and kudos for attention to detail on your resume my dude/gal, but it lacks incredible amounts of context. As the eligibility expands and new evidence is observed, tested and verified, what we reference for meeting targets and communicating how vaccinated we are as a community will change. That is the nature of the beast. One day, when the vaccine is fully authorized for people of all ages, a total vaccination % for all people &amp; all population will be a meaningful measurement.

##Cases
- 73,166 new resident cases weekly's report - Total Resident Cases: 2,479,975. **A change of +27,717 over last week's (45,449).** 
- 11.30% of people in Florida had tested positive with COVID before (residents case numbers only).

##Testing
- 15.1% (+3.6% than last week's 11.5%) new cases positivity rate.

##Death
- 282 resident death- 38,670 Total Resident Deaths. 

###Averaging the case and death numbers into 7 days
- **73,166/7= 10,452.29 new cases per day in the last 7 days**
- **282/7=40.29 new death per day in the last 7 days**

##Vaccinated
- **177,420 New People Vaccinated (Actual First Doses)- 11,469,755 Total People Vaccinated (Actual Total First Doses Altogether)** 
- **134,389 Vaccinated Series Complete (J&amp;J 1 dose+Second Dose Vaccines)- 9,914,406 Total Series Complete (J&amp;J 1 dose+Second Dose Vaccines)**

##Percentage for Population That Are Vaccinated 
**(18+ population is removed since Total People Vaccinated counts 12+ now and age groups go from 12-14, 15-24 so it's hard to exclude under 18 from the adult population)**
- Total Population: 21,944,577
- Everyone who's Vaccinated in the Entire State Population (includes partially and fully vaccinated): 11,469,755/21,944,577=52.27% **(+0.81%)**

A small group of public health officials who were saying that the virus spread through aerosols in the air, like cigarette smoke, were hounded and marginalized. After about fifteen months of this, the aerosol theory finally came to dominate and the droplet theory is largely discredited.  This was an important change because the mitigation strategies are quite different in the two cases.

The same thing is happening now, I think, as we come up against the limitations of vaccines.  While they certainly seem to help, they aren't turning out to be the magic bullet that was initially assumed, and I think it's taking a while for people to catch up with this. Certainly the US seems to be roaring into a 5th wave of infections, for a combination of reasons (lower than hoped vaccination rates, much more virulent variants of the virus, abandonment of social distancing and other mitigation measures, and so on).

Florida recorded more coronavirus cases this week than California, Texas, New York and Illinois combined, a Palm Beach Post analysis of state and federal data shows. 

The state logged 73,199 more infections in this week's state Department of Health report. That’s the biggest one-week surge since Jan. 27.

California, Texas, New York and Illinois altogether logged 73,116 new infections in the seven days leading up to Thursday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.

The state took hours longer than usual on Friday to publish its weekly update to inform the public about pandemic statistics. And the late report contained an error in its death tally.

California, Texas, New York and Illinois and Pennsylvania together logged 362 more COVID-19 fatalities in the same period, lower than Florida’s 387, the CDC’s website said.
But Florida’s Friday report states it logged only 78 more deaths this week. Yet the difference between the state report’s total statewide death toll of 38,670 and the 38,388 reported the week prior is 282.

Representatives for Florida’s Health Department and Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office did not return answers on Friday to emails and calls seeking explanation for the delay in reporting and the discrepancy in new fatalities.
Testing statistics reported by the state further show the deadly respiratory illness is out of control. Fifteen percent of COVID-19 tests came back positive, a level not seen since last summer, when Florida temporarily became the epicenter of the pandemic, recording more new infections than anywhere else.

Health experts have recommended sustained positivity levels for two weeks of below 5% before considering the virus contained. Florida has not achieved that since June 25.
Palm Beach County added 3,981 people to its infection count, the highest level since early February. The state stopped reporting counties’ death tolls June 4. Meanwhile, 12.5% of new tests countywide came back positive.
As the resurgent disease ravages the state, driven by the highly contagious Delta mutation, the pace of vaccinations is slowly picking up.

The state added 177,420 people to its inoculation count this week, its Friday report shows, and Palm Beach County added 10,602. Those numbers are higher than the first week of this month, when the number of new vaccinations reached a near seven-month low.

Just 60% of eligible Florida residents — ages 12 and older — have received at least one shot, state health officials reported. That’s lower than other big states such as California and Pennsylvania (75% each), New York (72%) and Illinois (72%).

And with 9,914,406 Florida residents fully vaccinated, or 46%, the state’s overall immunization rate remains lower than the nationwide average of 49% reported by the CDC.

In Palm Beach County, 831,451 people 12 and older have received at least one shot.

I like how you are trying to paint us as the unreasonable ones here while failing to understand the very basics of a pandemic.

Yeah, cases are increasing and contact tracing is at its limit.

&gt; It’s less than 200 cases, of a virus that for most people is either asymptomatic or a bad cold. 

We are not complete morons over here. No, we are not worried specifically about the individual health effects of 200 COVID cases. We are worried about 200 COVID cases leading to tens of thousands of cases in a mostly unvaccinated population, and the resulting effects of THAT.

&gt;This zero covid approach is completely unsustainable

So is rampant spread in an unvaccinated population. A look at any country in the past year should clearly demonstrate that doing so would mean overrun hospitals and tens of thousand dead.

The goal of Covid lockdowns in the US were: (1) prevent hospital overload by flattening the curve, (2) protect the vulnerable members of society (the 70+ &amp; immunocompromised).  Both are incredibly legitimate goals we needed to accomplish that were worth the economic destruction and mental health crisis caused by lockdown. 

But we've accomplished those goals now in the US.  Hospitalizations are incredibly low and their is a vaccine that all but people under 12 and people with incredibly rare medical conditions can get for free today if they choose to.  The only states who need lockdowns are the ones with low vaccination rates and we know they aren't going to do them.  

So all in asking of you pro Summer 2021 lockdown crowd is that to think of the economic and mental damage it did to this country and ask yourself if the goal of (1) protecting unvaccinated people who are willing to risk the virus, (2) preventing cases that rarely result in hospitalization and death, like breakthrough cases and u-12 cases.  Imo, those aren't goals worth shutting down society for.  People who are worried about it should continue to isolate and do pickup groceries.

In many parts of the country doctors have said hospitals have been overflowing for almost a month, placing huge strain on medical workers already battered by a year and a half of the pandemic.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Since the start of July, Russia's official coronavirus statistics have shown over 700 people dying most days, on many days breaking previous daily records from the winter.  
That may be a significant undercount, many experts said. Throughout the pandemic Russia's official COVID-19 statistics have been criticized for drastically underplaying its real virus numbers.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;..  
  
&gt;  
&gt;\[We\] ""are in the heart of a storm, which no one even tried to prevent,"" Alexander Dragan, a data analyst who has tracked Russia's pandemic statistics, wrote in a Medium post this month.  
The wave of infections and deaths has hit as Russia had erected few defences to stem it. By June, authorities had lifted most of the limited restrictions that had been in place and spoke of an end to the pandemic in sight. Restaurants, bars and shops were working as usual, most workers had returned to offices, people were packing out events.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The result has been the virus -- accelerated by the delta variant -- has burned through Russia almost unrestricted.  
The wave flooded hospitals in many regions from the start of June. In cities across Russia, local authorities warned they had run out of beds and were forced to open emergency reserve hospitals.  
In St. Petersburg, medics told ABC News hospitals were packed with COVID patients since mid-June. Dmitry, a doctor at a hospital in the city said its 450 beds had been filled for the last month and that patients had to be kept in corridors, although the situation had improved in the last week.  
The numbers were putting a huge strain on medical workers, he said, saying one medic was often having to look after 30 patients.  
""It's really a lot,"" he said, also requesting anonymity because he was not permitted to comment publicly.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Alexey Raksha, a demographer who formerly worked at Russia's state statistics agency Rostat, told ABC News he estimated Russia might see between 70,000-90,000 deaths for July alone.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Dmitry, the doctor in St. Petersburg said he did not have much hope a new wave would be avoided, even as the current wave eased.  
""I think it's a sort of calm before the storm,"" he told ABC News.  
He said both authorities and citizens needed to accept more restrictions to do so, alongside vaccination.  
""In my view it's better to cancel concerts for half a year than over the course of two years bury a large number of people,"" he said.

Background: There is growing concern about possible cognitive consequences of COVID-19, with reports of ‘Long COVID’ symptoms persisting into the chronic phase and case studies revealing neurological problems in severely affected patients. However, there is little information regarding the nature and broader preva- lence of cognitive problems post-infection or across the full spread of disease severity.


Methods: We sought to confirm whether there was an association between cross-sectional cognitive perfor- mance data from 81,337 participants who between January and December 2020 undertook a clinically vali- dated web-optimized assessment as part of the Great British Intelligence Test, and questionnaire items capturing self-report of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 infection and respiratory symptoms.


Findings: People who had recovered from COVID-19, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhib- ited significant cognitive deficits versus controls when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group, pre-existing medical disorders, tiredness, depression and anxiety. The deficits were of substantial effect size for people who had been hospitalised (N = 192), but also for non-hospitalised cases who had biological confirmation of COVID-19 infection (N = 326). Analysing markers of premorbid intelli- gence did not support these differences being present prior to infection. Finer grained analysis of perfor- mance across sub-tests supported the hypothesis that COVID-19 has a multi-domain impact on human cognition.


Interpretation: Interpretation. These results accord with reports of ‘Long Covid’ cognitive symptoms that per- sist into the early-chronic phase. They should act as a clarion call for further research with longitudinal and neuroimaging cohorts to plot recovery trajectories and identify the biological basis of cognitive deficits in SARS-COV-2 survivors.",,,,1627155305,{},h6eb2x2,False,t3_oqwl5n,False,True,t3_oqwl5n,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oqwl5n/cognitive_deficits_in_people_who_have_recovered/h6eb2x2/,1627304475,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I could imagine your immune system becoming weak over time without getting ""practice"" against smaller colds. Then when you inevitably do get sick, you get *really* sick. I remember early on in the pandemic some doctors thought exposure to common cold coronaviruses might provide some protection against COVID-19. Not sure if that's still current consensus, but my thoughts were more general than this specific example.

Or I could imagine never getting a cold might increasing your odds of developing an autoimmune disease, since your immune system would have nothing else to attack.

Obligatory IANAD, covid isn't a cold, masking is and has been important during the pandemic, etc. I'm just not sure the best course of action post-pandemic.

I've heard scientists propose the idea that super sterile environments have led to an increase of kid's with severe allergies. And you have obvious historical examples such as 90% of Native Americans dying of smallpox due to having 0 immunity.

&gt; WASHINGTON – The White House on Friday refused to release the number of breakthrough COVID-19 cases among vaccinated staff after one aide tested positive for the virus earlier this week.

&gt; Press secretary Jen Psaki suggested the public did not need that information, even as the U.S. vaccination effort is flagging and COVID cases are surging due to the more contagious delta variant.

&gt; When pressed by a reporter again, Psaki asked: “Why do you need to have that information?”

Why would anyone need to know a basic fact that helps them make decisions, you're right Jen, our bad. 

Boosters being bought, not called boosters. Masks coming back while national figures keep pretending that they aren't for one more 'good' news cycle. Other countries openly talking about the need for third shots and policy shifts while our White House is pretending everything is the same situation as even two weeks ago.

One reason to study Ivermectin is that it is well known to be safe and is already in worldwide production and distribution. It's also in the public domain, so it will be cheap and accessible around the world.

What's needed is more thorough studies, which is hopefully what's happening here.

Government rules like: Masks on airplanes, masks in government facilities.

Jobs like settling up community vaccination centers and public health clinics, transporting and administering vaccines in rural and underserved communities, and the thousands of back office support jobs that go along with that. 

There’s even already a whole agency that already inspects and verifies personal identity information at designated checkpoints all over the country which sounds like just the right agency to do routine and random vaccine passport inspections. I kept hearing over and over how great those folks are the last few years.

 With that said, i don't believe i have covid, but since i haven't been tested, I'm kind in a crossroad, should i go to my appointment tomorrow and get vaccinated (it would be a private clinic no risk to contact other people)? or should i get tested and wait until the i get another appointment (which could take a long time)? 

my question is because of the possible greater side effects i could get if i indeed have covid. Or maybe my friend just had bad luck and there is no really greater side effect if you get vaccinated while having covid?

The Ministry of Health also came up with an idea to vaccinate in shopping centers and pharmacies, even the first such points were launched. On the occasion of shopping, you could come for a vaccine. In this matter, it quickly turned out that we were losing to our own bureaucracy. When the first patients were scheduled for vaccinations, it turned out that the size of pharmacies did not allow for vaccination - it was stipulated in other regulations, about which the employees of the National Health Fund informed by phone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Patients had to be recalled, explaining by phone to everyone what the problem was - because pharmacists did not have access to the general database. In the pharmacy in Łysem, even the idea itself is skeptical. Substantive information about vaccinations, their effectiveness and side effects can be obtained here for a long time, but people do not want to listen. - We managed to persuade only a few people to vaccinate - says the pharmacist. - The rest are stubborn. Besides, few people ask about these vaccinations. Extensive Effects In Łysem, people feel sorry for the local entrepreneurs who failed to cope with covid.

Like the owner of a pizzeria or gym that has recently been decommissioned. Now the premises are empty and waiting to be rented. In Podhale, the government is blamed for everything; he broke the winter holidays on one date, ordered it to close, did not allow anyone to earn, and therefore people barely survived. Unvaccinated tourists are not afraid to come. A true highlander the devil, including covid, will not take. They do not think about whether tourists will be afraid to come to a potential risk area; It does not happen that the cepras sitting at the table in the guesthouse deal with the problem of vaccines during the rest. 

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, the autumn wave is a certainty. In prospect we have a more contagious variant of the virus - delta. So the next restrictions are also a foregone conclusion, the only question is what. In Great Britain, Spain, Portugal or other places where Poles will go on vacation or from which they will return to Poland, the number of infections has been increasing for some time. In Great Britain, about 20 new infections a day have become over four hundred - almost 100 percent. new cases is the delta variant. In the countries of southern Europe it is not much better. 

&amp;#x200B;

The vaccinated disease the delta slightly, often asymptomatically, but can spread it further. If the number of people willing to vaccinate remained at the level from the beginning of July, 2 million people could be vaccinated by the end of the summer holidays. We would only have half of the population vaccinated with at least one dose. This is still over ten million too little to count on herd immunity, and thus protection of those who cannot be vaccinated. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, young children. Compulsion The government is also considering compulsory vaccination, at least for some groups. Mirosław Wróblewski, legal advisor from the Office of the Human Rights Defender, argues that at least legally such compulsion can be introduced under the law. For now, there are two scenarios being considered - compulsory vaccinations for seniors, which, however, raises many objections, and accelerating the vaccination of school children. Before the lessons begin for good, the youngest ones would be vaccinated. Last fall, the school was the seedbed of the pandemic. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And the virus was still gentle with the children at the time. We already know that it will be difficult to introduce compulsory vaccinations. If you look at the vaccination map, you can see that PiS will have a big problem. The regions with the smallest percentage of the split cover the largest electoral influence of this party. The question is, if the need arises, will the government risk introducing lockdowns in non-vaccinated areas, where the number of cases will be record-breaking? Or - in order not to annoy the supporters - will it decide to shut down the entire country? After all, the authorities have been winking at anti-vaccines for a long time - the president said during the election campaign that he had not vaccinated against the flu ""because he did not"".

&amp;#x200B;

In Łysem, he convinced the fate of the kids to get vaccinated by the cleaning lady in the community center, apart from two deaths in the family. - In a pandemic, they had the worst. Locked in homes, in front of computers. How much depression, suicide will there be? - he says. - That is why everyone should get vaccinated for these children so that they do not stay at home for the next year. 

&amp;#x200B;

For now, no one in Łysem wants to listen to her. For example, the library is just fed up with this whole pandemic. ""Take off your mask, because you can't hear you at all,"" teaches one of the librarians, clearly annoyed by this viral ostentation. When asked if she was vaccinated, she replies: - And whether I get vaccinated is my private matter. - And I do not vaccinate - says her friend immediately. - But why? She looks immensely surprised by the question before shrugging her shoulders. ""I don't know."" that the next year they would not stay at home.

It is what it is in Podkarpacie, among others, because the vaccination was started late. Nobody wanted to take the vaccines, but there was also a shortage of people willing to give them. In some distant and badly connected municipalities, such as Wielkie Oczy or Lisie Jamy, detour points had to be set up to reach people with vaccinations. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

They only started in mid-May; today one fifth of all mobile points vaccinate in Podkarpacie. And on the way, there was also a ""vaccine scandal""; Just before the election of the city's president, more vaccines arrived in Rzeszów in the Podkarpacie region than it should have been, but it was quickly caught and plans to chase the peloton started to fall apart again. It's bad on the eastern wall. In the Ostrołęka poviat, to the north-east of this city, lies the Łyse commune, with a record low number of vaccinated persons. It has over 8.4 thousand. inhabitants who mostly live off agriculture and small services. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You can see that the central village has benefited from EU funding: a modernly finished school building, a fresh-smelling Municipal Cultural Center, a library next to it, a tidy parking lot, roads as flat as a table, wide sidewalks, life is based on traditional values. The inhabitants of the region appreciate the local identity - there are Kurpie restaurants and shops here, and the Kurpie language inscriptions can be seen on the welcoming streets near the commune borders. There are Easter palms famous in Poland. PiS votes - in the last elections the ruling party got almost 70 percent. votes, but not the government, but the Church. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And he keeps his distance from vaccines. - Last Sunday we said that there is a possibility of vaccinations - says the young curate, distracted from his duties, and adds: - But we can't tell people anything. The announcement in the church that ""it is possible"" is an initiative of the commune, not the parish priest. - We are also planning to organize festivals in the villages, during which we will promote vaccinations. But what else can we do? - says the mayor who vaccinated himself. - Maybe that is why people do not vaccinate themselves, because there were few cases in our country and the inhabitants do not feel threatened? Young people in Łysem are particularly resistant to vaccines. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Two elderly women met in front of the grocery store agree: those those who do not vaccinate should not be allowed to enter church, but it does not work for their grandchildren. - Why don't the younger ones want to get vaccinated? They do not want to risk - explains a young employee of a store in Łysy, who did not vaccinate herself. According to her, they are afraid of side effects; not those visible today, but in 10-15 years. When and if they get vaccinated at all? - Only if there is a top-down order - says the saleswoman. She herself made the decision to do so, because she has an old grandfather behind the wall, but it hasn't happened so far. The cleaning lady in the community center is vaccinated. - My father-in-law and my father died of it - he says But even she could not make up her mind for a long time. - It's like this: you have already collected yourself, and here someone says that it is not known what is in these vaccines, whether they are effective, and you think right away. Now children will be vaccinated, and you can hear that many parents will not agree to it, because they say that vaccines are infertile - he says. Management center The government had high hopes for the vaccine lottery. It started in July. You just need to be fully vaccinated and call the helpline to participate. Up to four chances of winning for everyone - immediately, that is on the day of reporting, the second - in a given week. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 Once a month - a hundred thousand or a car, in the final game - a car or a million. After the vaccine lottery was announced, the statistics were raised to 40,000. willing, and if it was a very good day - 60 thousand, but then the numbers started to drop again. The lottery revealed what a mess we have in our papers. It turned out, for example, that those vaccinated in Radom, at least some cannot take part in the lottery. There they were vaccinated, among other things, at a quick drive-thru point in the cemetery parking lot. When in May the administration of Johnson's single-dose vaccines was suspended (it was speculated that there were not enough of them for the enrolled, because the government vaccinated thousands of Poles with them in the weekend vaccination campaign last weekend), people from all over Poland came to Radom because they still had them there. The Territorial Defense Forces, those formed by Antoni Macierewicz, were setting up cars in the parking lot, and so, without getting out of the car, leaving theirs in a two-hour queue to one of the four points, they left, being vaccinated.

&amp;#x200B;

But some Radom vaccinees are still listed as waiting for a second dose of the vaccine. From the headquarters and hotline, the lottery office, changes cannot be made - only the vaccination point can make them. But this one is already rolled up. On the occasion of the lottery, the talk of fake vaccines was also louder. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In some places in Poland, if you needed a vaccination certificate, but did not want to ""take the risk"", you could get a fictitious vaccination. With an entry in the file - and the vaccine poured down the sink instead of injected into the arm. Marcin Samsel, a former policeman and crisis management expert, and a popular instagramer at the same time, admits that in order to check if it was not gossip, he invested PLN 150 and discovered that it was possible. The government tried to raise the indicators by announcing two or more competitions: ""Commune for a medal - we get vaccinated"" and ""The most resistant commune"". 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For 48 small municipalities, up to 30,000 inhabitants, he reserved for a million, for the larger, 2 million. The condition for receiving them was to exceed 50 percent. vaccinated. In the second project, ""Gmina na medal"", there are 100 thousand. PLN for the first five hundred municipalities that will achieve a vaccination rate of 67 percent. The government collects the applications for effect, unless five hundred municipalities do not collect, then at the end of December 2021 the payments will cease to apply. An innovative idea, but at the same time revealing the turmoil that the government is subject to; just a few months ago, in ministerial circles, Mateusz Morawiecki and his office staff were advised not to announce the target level of vaccination, not to indicate less vaccinated groups (in order not to provoke contrariness), and not to worry about low rates in public. Now the whole narrative is going the other way. To call to order those who put the health of others at risk.

Australia's lockdowns haven't been lockdowns. They've been very soft, they've been very leniant. New South Wales (Sydney) has been the cause of the current outbreak and their slow and nuanced approach has been the reason that this has spread so quickly. 

All other regions of the country have locked down quickly and hard and they're not seeing the sustained infection rates. This current cluster is a failure of government in not going hard enough, fast enough. No doubt it'll lead to improvements.

I'm not saying don't vaccinate. I am saying **vaccinate and use lockdowns** as the tools to reduce the domestic population of Covid-19 down as much as possible. 

Locking down for 20 years? Heck no. Using short and hard lockdowns, vaccination and monitoring of international situations to achieve a manageable situation? Heck yes. 

[In this article](https://www.statnews.com/2021/05/19/how-the-covid-pandemic-ends-scientists-look-to-the-past-to-see-the-future/) \- The last few paragraphs speak to this:

&gt;Cécile Viboud, an infectious diseases modeler who has extensively studied flu pandemics, also believes the pandemic ends with SARS-2 being endemic. But she’s not sure when.  
  
“I’m trying to be cautious, because I’ve always been an optimist and during Covid-19 I’ve been proven wrong,” said Viboud, who is based at the National Institutes of Health’s Fogarty International Center.  
  
She suggested it’s possible that the four seasonal coronaviruses, the ones that cause colds, were always milder than Covid. Or that SARS-2 will continue hurling variants at us — especially once it comes under pressure to evolve when large swathes of people are vaccinated. “So I think we have to be cautious. We only have like 15 months of data or something, right?”  
  
Mike Ryan, head of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Program, agreed.  
  
“We don’t know where we are, because this is the first pandemic of a SARS coronavirus,” he said. “From my perspective, crystal-balling it … we’re not even close to the end of it.”  
  
Ryan picks up Van Kerkhove’s refrain, arguing countries shouldn’t be waiting for vaccines or for the virus to transition into an endemic mode. They should be using the other tools that have been shown to stop transmission, he said. “I think we can get to very high levels of disease control, so much so that this ceases to be a pandemic in the sense that it ceases to be … causing disease and deaths and filling up our hospitals. So, in that sense it ceases to be a public health crisis.”

FL is starting to cancel all elective surgeries in our area and the hospital systems are going back to full COVID protocols. No visitors, masks required on the premises, temp checks, the works.

Masks will be the new normal if people don't get vaccinated, mutations are coming out of the unvaccinated, FL will not report it but ~98%-99% of deaths were unvaccinated. My area is posting stories and interviews about a single case of a person getting deathly ill with COVID even though she got the Johnson and Johnson vax, she is recovering well, that is what they are focusing on.

I would start with an honest conversation about it.

There's likely a perception thing going on.

Almost everyone at some point in their life thinks they're invulnerable to *something.*

Some people can see from where they are in the world that it isn't true and some never figure it out until it's too late.

There is a very strong possibility that covid-19 may never fully go away. 

Pandemics don't last days or weeks, they last years or decades.

Huge portions of the world have almost no vaccines, so covid-19 is going to be bouncing around the planet for a very long time to come.

There will likely be seasonable outbreaks for many years to come.

The saying ""what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger"" doesn't apply to something like covid-19.

It is an infection that can destroy parts of your body including your lungs and your brain.

It's not something that people should be messing around with.

The people who turned vaccines into a political issue for the purpose of convincing people not to get vaccinated are evil and should be punished severely.

The PM told a government meeting Friday that Vietnam ""cannot keep relying on foreign sources of Covid-19 vaccines forever.""  
  
In the coming time, related units have to ""give special priority to the fastest and earliest domestic production of vaccines.""  
  
However, he noted the process must ensure the safety of people's health and lives and follow scientific, practical and legal principles and regulations.  
  
The Ministries of Health and Justice are assigned to ""urgently complete necessary contents and procedures to submit to the legislative National Assembly for consideration and settlement of legal issues raised in domestic vaccine production.""  
  
Relevant units have to provide maximum support to manufacturers in assessing the immunogenicity of vaccines. ""This task could not be entirely left to manufacturers,"" said Chinh.  
  
The Ministry of Finance has to regulate specific and clear regulations and conditions for private companies to receive funding support for studying, testing and producing made-in-Vietnam vaccines, he said.  
  
A special working group of the Health Ministry must coordinate with experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) in evaluating clinical trials and developing vaccines. ""Give special priority to this step,"" he urged.  
  
Government leaders also suggested agencies ""create favorable conditions and provide maximum support"" for technology transfer in vaccine production.  
  
Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam noted with technology transfer, it is necessary to guarantee raw production materials.  
  
The quality and effectiveness of domestic Covid-19 vaccines must be objectively and transparently evaluated by professional agencies and councils ""to have a scientific basis to decide whether to grant a permit for emergency use,"" Dam said.  
  
For its vaccine strategy, Vietnam has boosted imports and vaccine diplomacy to gain access to as many foreign vaccine sources in the fastest way possible, promoting research and technology transfers, as well as domestic production, the leaders said.  
  
The nation currently has two homegrown vaccines near completion: Nanocovax by Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology JSC, of which the third and final phase of human trials is expected to finish in August, and Covivac by the Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals (IVAC), expected to enter the second phase of human trials within this month.  
  
Vietnam has obtained nearly 8.6 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines via global vaccine access mechanism Covax and support from other governments.

The PM said the first priority of HCM City and southern provinces should be to focus on COVID-19 prevention and control, and maintain and restore production under safe conditions. Enterprises should carry out production and provide meals and lodging for their workers on-site.  
  
The PM has instructed ministries and local authorities to ensure that assistance centres and hotlines are set up to help local residents and enterprises facing difficulties.  
  
He pointed out that social distancing in several places was still not being carried out strictly. Mass gatherings were still occurring, and non-essential services were being provided. Sites taking test samples have not kept safe distances between people, and community-based teams for COVID-19 prevention and control have not been set up in many places.  
  
Enforcing Directive No.16  
  
Like HCM City, Bình Dương Province is strengthening the Government’s Directive No.16 to fight the growing threat of COVID-19. The province has set up an inspection team to supervise implementation of regulations.  
  
“We have to carry out more serious preventive measures to rapidly bring life back to normal. The province needs the whole system and each resident to join in the fight,” Nguyễn Văn Lợi, secretary of the Provincial Party, said.      
  
If relevant agencies find people driving or going out on the streets without necessary reasons, they will be fined. At checkpoints, people should keep a safe distance, and in residential areas, households should not have close contact with others.  
  
Local COVID-19 prevention and control teams should be more active, and task forces and hotlines for residents must be set up quickly, Lợi said.  
  
He ordered local authorities to disburse allowances quickly to workers who have lost jobs due to the COVID-19 outbreak.  
  
Other southern provinces such as Hậu Giang have also tightened preventive measures.  
  
Đồng Văn Thanh, chairman of Hậu Giang People’s Committee, said that a new cluster had appeared in Phụng Hiệp District’s Thạnh Hòa Commune.  
  
Thanh has told relevant agencies and local authorities to prepare facilities and human resources for a scenario of 10,000-12,000 people who might need isolation at quarantine facilities in the province.      
  
In Long An Province, secretary of the Provincial Party, Nguyễn Văn Được, said the province would try to protect areas with no COVID-19 patients and strictly control areas with COVID-19 patients in districts Cần Giuộc, Bến Lức, Đức Hòa and Cần Đước and Tân An City.  
  
Local authorities must deploy COVID-19 prevention and control teams and strictly control people and vehicles travelling through border areas.  
  
Được told relevant agencies to work with local authorities to control residential areas that have people returning from HCM City and areas with a large number of workers.  
  
The chairman of the province's People’s Committee, Nguyễn Văn Út, told local authorities to focus on giving tests to discover COVID-19 cases in the province. He said violators of regulations of social distancing and preventive measures would be fined.  
  
Facilities and human resources should be prepared to quarantine people returning from HCM City, he said.   
  
The province has added 2,406 beds to treat COVID-19 patients. More field hospitals should be built to increase the total number of beds to 6,000, he said.  
  
The province has added three hospitals to meet standards in SARS-CoV2 testing with the real-time PCR technique, taking the total to six hospitals.  
  
In Cần Thơ, two more field hospitals in Cờ Đỏ District will be set up to meet the increasing number of COVID-19 patients. They will admit mildly and moderately ill patients. The city currently has four field hospitals with a total of 450 beds.

""But kids don't-"" bla bla bla yeah yeah, but virtually all of the adults in a given room today are vaccinated against measles because they couldn't go to school without it, right? 

So I guess we have to play the long game and wait for herd immunity in the next generation. So...a couple decades to see the payoff? *Which is super dumb,* but we seem to be having a shit time convincing adults to get vaccinated.

""But religious exemptions-"" School districts can (and do) decline to accept religious exemptions, either as policy or during emergencies/epidemics. When I was growing up, there was an outbreak of measles in my district. Families of unvaccinated kids were sent a letter stating that although the district of course respected their religious beliefs, etc, they would have to either keep their unvaccinated children home until the crisis had passed, or get them vaccinated. It was *amazing* how many parents with ""strongly held religious beliefs"" suddenly changed their tune and got the kids vaccinated ASAP. 

By and large, parents can't afford to pay for private school and *really* don't want to (or can't) home school them. Even if they don't give a shit about their kids' education, they still need to be able to send their kids somewhere during the day so they can go to work. 

I know the vaccine isn't approved for the very littles, but it will be eventually. 

And yes, it's absurd and pessimistic to say that we're going to have to wait decades for herd immunity, but really, who could have anticipated politicizing *a virus* and the ultimate fallout?",,,,1627141435,{},h6diqow,False,t3_oqncqd,False,False,t1_h6d4nyc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oqncqd/mask_mandates_are_back_on_the_table_as_covid19/h6diqow/,1627289849,426,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,2,[],,

The municipal Department of Health has categorized Covid patients into five groups: those being asymptomatic and having no underlying diseases, those with mild symptoms, those with moderate and severe symptoms, those with underlying medical conditions or suffering comorbidities prior to Covid-19, and critically ill patients.  
  
In case the number of infections crosses 80,000, the city would turn existing infrastructure into specialized facilities for receiving and treating Covid-19 patients based on these five groups.  
  
Quarantine facilities in all 21 districts and Thu Duc City would receive 40,000 of the first group, who are asymptomatic and have no underlying diseases, but have been found infected with the virus through rapid testing.  
  
The city would arrange at least one doctor and two nurses to care for every 50-100 patients in this group.  
  
For those with mild symptoms, the city would prepare 21,600 beds at field hospitals. For every 25 patients there would be one doctor and two nurses.  
  
There will be 8,000 beds to treat patients with moderate and severe symptoms and having underlying medical conditions. For every 20 patients, there will be one doctor and two nurses.  
  
Patients with underlying medical conditions or suffering comorbidities prior to infection would have access to 6,400 beds. One doctor and two nurses would be responsible for every 10 patients.  
  
Covid-19 resuscitation hospitals with around 4,000 beds would be responsible for treating critically ill patients. One doctor and two nurses would take care of every five people.  
  
To offset the number of treatment beds in this scenario, many private hospitals could be mobilized including Hoan My Saigon General, Trieu An, City International, and Nam Sai Gon International, along with other facilities like Van Hanh, Hoan My Thu Duc and Xuyen A, with a total of over 9,600 beds.  
  
Public hospitals like Dermatology, Post and Telecoms, Transportation, Orthopedics and Rehabilitation and some other district hospitals would be completely repurposed into facilities for Covid-19 treatment with more than 4,100 beds.  
  
The common difficulty among all hospitals is their lack of doctors specializing in emergency and resuscitation to treat the group of critically ill patients, which are at a high death risk. Ho Chi Minh City is increasing human resources from provinces and cities mobilized by the Ministry of Health and promoting short-term thematic training on resuscitation for critically severe patients.  
  
According to the HCMC Center for Disease Control, as of Saturday morning, city hospitals are treating 37,407 patients. Among these, 619 in critically ill condition are on ventilation while 12 are reliant on the life support machine called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).  
  
So far, the city has reported 55,870 infections and 496 deaths.

The measures to stamp out worsening outbreaks of COVID-19 will be in place for 15 days and follow the Prime Minister's Directive 16. At present, 19 southern localities including HCM City are implementing social distancing measures under Directive 16.  
  
Under the new measures, all public transport services including buses, taxis, contract vehicles and coaches are banned, excluding those in service of pandemic prevention and control and transporting workers and experts.  
  
Motorbikes are also suspended from transporting passengers.  
  
People in the city are asked to stay at home and only go outside in necessary cases like business trips, working at essential businesses (State agencies, factories, essential shops and service providers), buy food and medicines, or emergencies such as medical issues, fires or natural disasters.  
  
Masks are mandatory in public. People must maintain a distance of two metres in public, and must not congregate in groups larger than two outside of hospital, workplaces, or schools.  
  
People are required to submit health declaration forms via website www.tokhaiyte.vn or Ncovi and Bluezone apps. Those who have symptoms such as fever, coughing or difficulty breathing must contact local medical establishments for further instructions.  
  
Non-essential services and businesses must close.  
  
The businesses and services that are still allowed to operate include factories, production facilities, transport projects, construction sites, essential businesses or suppliers (food, medicines, utility, gas and oil, etc.), educational institutions, banks and treasuries along with bank-related and business support activities (such as notaries and attorney offices, registration offices, etc.), securities, post offices, import and export activities, medical examination and treatment, and funeral services.  
  
Delivery services such as Grab will continue to operate as normal but will not be allowed to transport passengers.  
  
People are asked to hold off from organising weddings, while funeral services must not have more than 20 attendants and will face monitoring by the local health authorities.  
  
All unnecessary meetings are banned.  
  
Production businesses, service establishments, and industrial zones must strictly observe COVID-19 prevention and control measures.  
  
For the agencies and offices of Hà Nội and the central Government based in Hà Nội, companies, enterprises and corporations (including foreign-invested companies) must develop arrangements to ensure their staff work online and only go to the offices in case of necessity.  
  
Malls, supermarkets, traditional markets and wholesale markets in the city are to ensure adequate supply of daily necessities for the local population, arrange stalls and reception procedures (from parking to entry) to reduce the number of customers in the same place at the same time, minimise close contacts and encourage online shopping and delivery.  
  
The municipal authorities requested the State agencies and businesses to work out plans that can ensure smooth, undisrupted transportation of goods and production materials.  
  
Industrial parks or production plants with workers residing in Hà Nội or going to Hà Nội from other provinces and cities must register with local authorities (details on the number of workers and experts, their places of residence or accommodation, vehicles transporting them, etc.) and perform regular COVID-19 screening as per health authorities’ guidelines.  
  
The dispatch said in response to the complex development of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hà Nội and other localities and Hà Nội has kept recording new community transmission cases without clear sources of infection, thus posing huge risks of community transmission without strict prevention and control measures, the municipal authorities issued the new measures to ensure health and safety for people.

The court found that Texas does not recognize a wrongful termination claim predicated on a violation of public policy and, even “if it did, [the hospital’s] injection requirement is consistent with public policy,” citing a 1905 U.S. Supreme Court decision that ruled that compulsory vaccination was not a violation of due process. The court further explained that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s recently updated guidance provides persuasive advice that employers may require employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19, subject to reasonable accommodation requirements.

&gt;In addition, the court rejected the plaintiffs’ federal claim that the vaccine mandate violated federal law because it is not fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration, explaining that the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act does not confer a private right to sue an employer. It also dismissed plaintiffs’ argument that the vaccine mandate violated federal law that protects the rights of human subjects. In doing so, the court explained that the plaintiffs misrepresented the facts because the employees are not participants in a human trial, but are merely subject to a vaccine requirement. The judge further explained that the lawsuit’s reliance on the Nuremberg Code was misplaced because the Code does not apply to private employers, writing that it was “reprehensible” for the plaintiffs to equate a COVID-19 vaccine requirement to medical experimentation in Nazi concentration camps.

&gt;Finally, the court explained that the vaccine mandate is part of the bargain of at-will employment and does not constitute coercion, since the hospital is simply “trying to do their business of saving lives without giving [employees] the COVID-19 virus. It is a choice made to keep staff, patients and their families safer.” Employees “can freely choose to accept or refuse a COVID-19 vaccine; however, if [they] refuse, [they] will simply need to work somewhere else…Every employment includes limits on the worker’s behavior in exchange for his remuneration. This is all part of the bargain.”

It was rejected at every level by this federal judge in a conservative state. At will employment being the final stamp.

The concepts of droplets will probably change drastically after everything gets settled.

But as it relates to the science, we've known for decades that flu preferentially infects the lungs over nasal passages. When we purposely infect humans in ""human challenge"" studies we do it via nasal passages because it [produces less flu like symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/479857/) and is deemed safer. Additionally, when we did test aerosols, it required [less infective dose to cause an infection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3372341/) when compared to intranasal inoculation.

Recently the [largest human challenge influenza study](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008704) that has been conducted resulted in just one case of transmission when researchers accidentally did the experiment in a well ventilated building (40 infected people forced to interact with 75 ""recipients"" for 4 days). If flu was spread by droplets or by surface transmission then we should have seen more infections.

Going more broadly, some respiratory viruses are so innocuous outside the lungs, you can just feed **live unattenuated** viruses to people as a vaccine (see [adenovirus vaccine](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/124/2/155/829468)).

Animal models have also shown [eye exposure to influenza](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002569) to be more mild and also produces more mild symptoms. Lots more animals models show [surface transmission just really don't happen](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4180291/) as much as we think. We even see with COVID that when we feed virus to animals orally [they only induce an asymptomatic infections](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32984855/).

&gt; Senate Bill 658, which Stitt signed into law in May, prohibits public school districts from implementing mask requirements unless, at minimum, a governor-declared state of emergency is in effect in their area.  

&gt; The American Academy of Pediatrics released guidance this week that schools require universal masking for all children 2 and older.

&gt; ""AAP recommends universal masking because a significant portion of the student population is not yet eligible for vaccines, and masking is proven to reduce transmission of the virus and to protect those who are not vaccinated,"" the pediatricians' group said. ""Many schools will not have a system to monitor vaccine status of students, teachers and staff, and some communities overall have low vaccination uptake where the virus may be circulating more prominently.""

&gt; The Oklahoma chapter of the AAP said they agreed with the guidance.

&gt; Public Radio Tulsa asked Stitt at a Tulsa press conference Friday if he was bothered by Oklahoma's ranking among the bottom ten states nationally for percent of the population fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

What they meant was that the testing swabs were made in rural communities, mostly by women in their own homes and not in sanitized GMP-certified factories like would happen in the US or Europe. I know organized home industries exist in many developing countries to help poor rural women earn money without having to leave their homes. For example, in India many women make pappadams in their homes for eventual sale in urban areas at restaurants, that sort of thing, through a rural collective or some other similar organization. 

Mucor is commonly found on cow dung, and the theory this person had was that the homemade unsealed swabs were being contaminated by mold in these rural homes. India has a high prevalence of diabetes and the poster thought that they might have caught it when they were tested with nasal swabs that were contaminated with mucor at the point of production in rural communities.

Poles do not want to vaccinate. Why? Because summer, because they are afraid, because there is less virus, and because you can.  
The health minister made an important statement on Twitter. For the first time in months, new cases of covid have appeared in Poland. What will happen next, noted Adam Niedzielski, depends on the pace of vaccination. But Poles do not want to vaccinate.  


  
The National Immunization Program started at high C. From publicly accusing ""celebrities who extorted safety out of line"" and from complaining about the ineptitude of European Union officials who were unable to deliver enough vaccinations.  


  
The initial, strict division into groups: first medical personnel, then seniors, etc., began to blur with time. The vaccination door was opened wider and wider to finally let go of everything - let whoever wants to sting. But soon there was a shortage of volunteers. Today, whoever wanted it, is already vaccinated. And since not so many wanted again, we ended up with 40 percent. fully vaccinated. In the PiS club itself, there is no consent as to the vaccination or rigors to which unvaccinated citizens may be subjected. 

&amp;#x200B;

Seven parliamentarians from PiS established a team for sanitaryism. According to its members, the safety of the public does not explain restrictions and limitations for those who do not want to vaccinate. MP Siarkowska explains on Twitter that ""sanitaryism is the subordination of social, political, economic and religious life, and even a private fight against the epidemic ”. And with this approach, her team is to fight, to ensure that pandemic restrictions do not violate civil liberties. This attitude radiates downward. “Many of my neighbors are quite serious about their preference to get covid rather than get vaccinated with suspect vaccines. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Because they already know something about covid, one or the other acquaintance fell ill and survived. And vaccines? They inject something into a person, but you can never be sure who is behind it and what's in it, says Polityka the owner of the Tatra guesthouse. In his commune, the vaccination rate barely exceeds 10%. Stocks Arguments against vaccination are more. It's vacation, the virus has died down. Besides, it keeps mutating - it will be difficult to keep up with new variants of the vaccine. Some people felt sick after the first dose, so they didn't go for the second. For others, your intuition tells you that covida has passed, so there's no need to sting. The more so that without documents certifying vaccination, it is possible to live: galleries, cinemas, swimming pools are open. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Some people do not want vaccines because they were ""created on biological material collected from aborted fetuses"" (as Bishop Józef Wróbel, chairman of the Team of Experts of the Polish Episcopal Conference for Bioethics, said, exposing himself to criticism from virologists). It is not surprising that the vaccine stocks have already reached 5 million frozen doses (so as not to be wasted, the government has just announced that it will sell them further to the East, to Georgia and Ukraine, but also to Vietnam and Australia). The herd immunity, which we need as a society, is not growing, to safely pass through the next wave of the virus, announced for the fall, in a much more dangerous delta mutation. The Chief Sanitary Inspectorate announces that perhaps in the autumn the unvaccinated will be subjected to additional rigors - as in France. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There, by order of the president, the National Assembly decided to adopt a law prohibiting people who have not been vaccinated since July 21 from participating in events of more than 50 people, and from August 1 - from using public transport, driving their own car beyond their place of residence, entering bars or restaurants. Medics - If they are not fully vaccinated, they will not be able to come to work or be paid. The French decision is controversial - is it ethical to force specific groups to vaccinate? On the other hand, the strategy works - millions of people have become interested in terms, and nearly a million made an appointment at an express pace for vaccination. 

&amp;#x200B;

How are the rigors to look like in Poland? Still unknown. There is talk of a ban on entering shopping centers and cinemas, visiting medical facilities or using trains and planes. Nevertheless, still only half of Poles declare that they want to be vaccinated (most of this group has already had two doses). In this respect, we are at the tail end of Europe. At the beginning, when seniors were vaccinating, we were still close to the European average. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sixty-year-olds are still the best vaccinated group in Poland. But in the statistics on the vaccination of eighty-year-olds, we are lagging behind - only slightly more than a half of vaccinated are (in Spain - 100%, in Great Britain - 99%, in other EU countries usually around 90%). And the younger the Poles, the worse these statistics are. Among twenty-something-year-olds, about one in ten has been vaccinated. Even in April, when the gates were opened for the 40-year-olds, it was not bad. Even over 400,000 people signed up for vaccinations every day. people. But at the end of June, there were no 40-year-olds, only 10-15 thousand were enrolled. people a day. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

According to official, perhaps not entirely precise statistics, we have a little over 15 million vaccinated. It should be at least twice as much. South and East Much about the vaccine problem is what the vaccination map looks like. And it looks like a sickle. The non-grafted poviats stretch from the north-east, through the eastern wall, across Podkarpacie and the mountain part of Małopolska. There are places where only every tenth resident volunteers for vaccination. The case of Lipnica Wielka in Podhale was circulated in the media; 6 thousand Inhabitants of the commune with over 600 vaccinated persons turned out so dramatically that journalists went there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Admittedly, the mayor straightened that it was only a ""system defect"", because many people from Lipnica go to work abroad and get vaccinated there. He stated that according to his estimates, every third Lipnica inhabitant is vaccinated, but journalists who went to the place to talk and ask, found mainly people who believed more in the power higher than in the vaccines. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The communes of Podhale occupy the last six places in the statistics, and politics is not without significance. What matters here is who's own and who's not. Residents skeptical about vaccines obtain information about them from websites and fan pages run, for example, by Sebastian Pitoń, an architect from Kościelisko - and the leader of the Góralskie Veto movement founded in response to the economic lockdown.

The reason why they can't give you, individually, an ""odds"" is there are too many random variables.

maybe the flood of anti-mask anti-vax misinformation is so great they have no choice but to run things this way, id believe that. youd think reddit would offer them some support given all the tools and manpower at their disposal. im sure we all remember a certain problematic the\_&lt;/cough&gt; sub that had an entire army of reddit admins dedicated to patroling it day and night and it wasnt even half as popular as this one, so clearly they have the means.

Before the change here's how preexisting conditions worked. Say you got a new job. You go to the doctor with your new insurance. They find you have cancer. The insurance company denies the claim and says prove you **didn't** have cancer the last 12 months before we'll pay this claim. (since they were not your insurer the last 12 months, they want someone else to pay for it).

How do you prove you **didn't have cancer?** Or that you weren't pregnant? Even in cases when it was trivial to prove, most people never did so because of the amount of paperwork. It was a really handy way for insurers to deny routine claims
