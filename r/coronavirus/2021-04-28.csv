Yes I do. But a share of that little was direly needed 2 months ago. You're right that shipping AZ back and fourth made little sense eventually so just deduct and send over the difference of whatever side owned more. In this specific case it had made sense because Halix wasn't ready yet afaik (they're approved by EMA for quite a while and are producing, but have still not started shipping). So it had been like sharing British made doses until Halix can repay the favour so to say.

As others here already mused, this lawsuit now may not be about political point scoring and rather to get a verdict that proves AZ fails the EU, which would be used in a broader lawsuit to come - over compensation or forcing AZ to terminate the contract (which would free up the IP apparently).

And given the current stand of the British vaccine rollout, forcing AZ to export some UK doses doesn't feel that unfair to me, as long as second doses aren't affected. And even if we take every British person yet to get an AZ jab into account upfront, there'll be leftovers from the UK's 100m order. So maybe a court order could be used to make AZ supply the EU with that instead of the UK giving it away as it sees fit. In any case I couldn't blame the UK for suing back over contract breaches - that's AZ's problem and not entirely undeserved when you sign two contradicting contracts.",,,1619663227,{},gw91eoy,False,t3_n0i3vc,False,True,t1_gw8el7s,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n0i3vc/eu_demands_immediate_access_to_ukmade_vaccines_in/gw91eoy/,1619687512,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

General observation means they just took the number of infections divided by the number of vaccinated people in the study. That's a statement about the way in which the study was conducted. Also, the numbers do not include the chance that an unvaccinated person would be infected, which would not be 100%. Without that, you can't actually compare the efficacy. If only 1-in-1000 non-vaccinated participants got infected then the vaccinated people are only about 1/15th as lonely to catch it. Context on the numbers is important.

&gt;If in reality vaccinated people are getting covid at a similar rate people are getting struck by lightning then I wouldn't say that is ""a lot of potential""

Again though, that's not what we're actually looking at. We're looking at how likely they are to catch it compares to the inactivated population, which is not captured in the number you gave.

&gt; Sensitivity is the proportion of patients with disease who have a positive test, or the true positive rate. Specificity is the proportion of patients without disease who have a negative test, or true negative rate. These terms describe the operating characteristics of a test and can be used to gauge the credibility of a test result.

&gt; A single negative test result may not be informative if the pre-test probability is high

&gt; While positive tests for covid-19 are clinically useful, negative tests need to be interpreted with caution, taking into account the pre-test probability of disease. This has important implications for clinicians interpreting tests and policymakers designing diagnostic algorithms for covid-19.

Translation ([deepl.com](https://deepl.com)):

The Mainz-based vaccine manufacturer Biontech expects to be able to vaccinate the first schoolchildren in the twelve to 15 age group in just a few weeks. In Europe, the company is close to submitting the study data for conditional approval, Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin told Der Spiegel. Next Wednesday, he said, an application for approval for children aged twelve and older should be submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The first vaccinations could then be available from the beginning of June.

The Biontech boss also has hope for a vaccine for younger children in the near future. ""In July, the first results could be available for five- to twelve-year-olds, and in September for younger children; the evaluation will take about four to six weeks."" If all goes well, the company could then submit regulatory applications. ""We believe things can move quickly now."" So far, the Biontech vaccine has been approved in Europe only for adolescents and adults 16 and older.

In children aged 12 and older, the Biontech vaccine was 100 percent effective and well tolerated, according to initial study data. This indicates ""that children are particularly well protected by vaccination,"" he told Der Spiegel. In the clinical trial of efficacy in younger children, vaccination is given by descending age if the children tolerate the vaccine well. In the meantime, the researchers are at the youngest age group with children from six months, he said.

Childhood and adult vaccinations differ in the amount of vaccine given, according to the report. Younger ones would get a lower dosage, and very young children might need only one-tenth of the active ingredient.

Simply being in the same home as others with COVID, then dying, does not mean her death is a result of COVID.

Fun fact: many people (mostly the elderly and obese) upon hearing a loved one has died of COVID, have had heart attacks and strokes upon receiving the news.

Does that mean those people died of COVID? NO.

People die when hearing bad news. Bad news, like the death of a close loved one, can cause blood pressure to increase suddenly. If you have atherosclerosis or narrowing of the veins, this can cause a heart attack and you die, quickly and suddenly. When an elderly man dies of a heart attack upon hearing his wife has succumbed to COVID.... does that mean he died of COVID? No, it does not.

It's a better idea to wait for the results of an autopsy before concluding this is a COVID death. Why should we wait for an autopsy? ""*Her sister had COVID! She probably died of COVID!* is what you're basically saying. And until a medical professional provides an answer, all you have left is this alarmist article.

 ***AUTOPSIES ARE PERFORMED FOR THE LIVING PEOPLE LEFT BEHIND.*** Will an autopsy make an ounce of difference to Sarah, who is now dead? Absolutely not. If it is found that Sarah died of something else, like an environmental pathogen, an undiagnosed congenital heart condition, epilepsy, or some other cause... Sarah's family, ESPECIALLY her younger sister, will want and NEED to know exactly why she died.

Especially with people who die suddenly, like young mothers with children and young people with living siblings, if an autopsy finds that Sarah didn't die of COVID, she died of something else, for example a congenital heart defect... the surviving family will now know to go to a doctor and be screened for the same defect to prevent another premature death in that family. 

Classic example: The families of basketball and volleyball players who are unusually tall experience a relatively high number of sudden deaths, and autopsies regularly reveal to their surviving family undiagnosed illnesses such as Marfan's syndrome (a side effect is being really tall with long limbs and very weak hearts) and other forms of hereditary heart diseases that disproportionately affect tall people.",,,1619686619,{},gw9xzon,False,t3_n0wwig,False,True,t1_gw9t341,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n0wwig/grief_and_shock_southern_alberta_teen_dies/gw9xzon/,1619705240,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

But I think even more importantly than that, is the fact that the comparison to ""last spring"" actually makes the opposite argument in the first place.  We had a SHIT ton of coronavirus at this time last year - the official case count obviously does not do it justice.  On this day 1 year ago, over TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED people died of coronavirus.  We had definitely begun to slope downward, but it was still a total disaster because we'd just peaked a couple weeks prior.  The current situation is nothing like that.  We peaked months ago, and spread was totally under control (generally speaking) throughout the entire period of time where we were surging last year.  AND this is with easing restrictions all across the country (and little/no restrictions in some places).  AND last year, that clusterfuck was mostly still confined to the northeast because the virus was still in the seeding phase in the rest of the country.  

So like... with EXTREMELY lighter restrictions, as well as deeply rooted spread already in place across the entire country, we've had a mere fraction of the coronavirus that we had last year in like one fourth of the country all throughout March and April.

That's mostly false. Root canals are covered 30 to 50% of the cost by health insurances, fillings, periodic clean and check ups are fully covered. 

Glasses are covered if you go past the point of it being a nuisance, e.g. at least 50% of visual impairment if I remember correctly - for lesser sight losses any Fielmann will have you covered for a relatively cheap sum.

Birth control specifically are not covered, although a wide range of women healthcare necessities is.

&gt;Personally I spent less money on healthcare in the US because the German health insurance really only kicks in if you’re dying. 

Yeah that's a vast exaggeration. I get checkups with specialists relatively regularly + I am on regular prescriptions for non life threatening issues and I never paid a sum high enough to be noticeable, usually single digit.

&gt;In the US my insurance actually paid for the small stuff that I needed where as in Germany they’re just like “Root canal? Best I can do is dentures.”

Again, that's false. [Here](https://www.newmouth.com/blog/root-canal-without-insurance/) you can see that insurances actually make quite a dent in the final cost. That's only considering the public basic insurance, paying for additional care is possible and translates in a better cost all around.

&gt;A lot of insurances choose to cover the flu shot for everyone but not all of them do, so a lot of people think that they’ll have to pay out of pocket even though they might not have to. Combined with the fact that it ends up being a 2+ hour ordeal at a doctors office most people just don’t bother.

A vast majority of insurance companies do cover the cost, and coverage for risk groups is mandatory. The insurance companies cited [here](https://www.rtl.de/cms/wer-zahlt-die-grippeimpfung-diese-krankenkassen-uebernehmen-die-kosten-4624122.html) cover the flu shot even for non-risk groups, some (other) insurance companies offer a vaccination yearly budget in which you fit the flu shot as well.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Health Ministry has identified 41 new cases of the Indian coronavirus variant in Israel, including four in people who have been vaccinated against COVID-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;Israel's genomic sequencing system found that 24 of those infected with the variant, which experts say may be more contagious than other variants, had returned recently from abroad. The other 17 contracted it via community transmission, including five schoolchildren. The Health Ministry and the IDF Home Front Command are carrying out widespread testing at the schools where the children are enrolled.    
&gt;  
&gt;Twenty-one of the people who tested positive for the variant are foreign nationals. Last week, Israel banned entry to tourists from India over concerns about the variant's spread and the severe increase in cases there. As part of the new restrictions, only 300 Indian caregivers and students will be allowed to enter the country per month. They will be required to quarantine at coronavirus hotels designated for those coming from India, unless they have either recovered from or were vaccinated against COVID-19 in Israel.  
&gt;  
&gt;A Health Ministry statement said that new restrictions which would forbid Israelis from traveling to countries with high infection rates (save for exceptional cases) are awaiting approval from the relevant ministries before it can be sent to government approval. Israelis returning from these countries would also need to quarantine, even if they have been vaccinated against or recovered from COVID-19. Foreign nationals from these countries would also not be allowed to enter Israel, and those who have received permission to do so would have to quarantine at designated hotels, as is the case with arrivals from India.     
&gt;  
&gt;Last month some 1,000 people entered Israel from India, and only about a quarter of them were vaccinated. Among those who entered, 63 tested positive for the virus, but not all of them had necessarily been infected by the Indian variant.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Indian variant is of concern to experts because it consist of two mutations of its protein, which could make it more resistant to the coronavirus vaccine. Last month, the Indian Health Ministry reported on a strain of the virus that includes two genetic changes and constitutes a kind of “union” of two variants previously known as E484Q and L452R.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, because samples collected from throughout India have shown that the most dominant variant in the country is the British variant, the prevailing view is that the new strain of the virus is not behind the latest outbreak in India, which is rapidly spreading across the country.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Israeli Health Ministry also identified eight new cases of the South African variant, seven of the New York variant, two of the California variant, one of the St. Petersburg variant and one case of an additional British variant.    
&gt;  
&gt;Although most of the coronavirus restrictions in Israel have been rolled back in recent weeks due to the drop in infections, entrance to the country is still being controlled. Israelis who enter without a vaccination certificate must quarantine at home, while those who recovered or were vaccinated in Israel do not have to quarantine, but must receive a negative result from the rapid coronavirus test now being administered to everyone entering Israel via Ben-Gurion Airport.",,,1619697237,{},gwaawcz,True,t3_n12ngc,False,False,t3_n12ngc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n12ngc/dozens_of_cases_of_indian_covid_strain_found_in/gwaawcz/,1619712945,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Probably don't run with the first thing you read on Google. As others have pointed out, it just isn't true.

&gt;Why not keep drugs at home and not bother other people with it?

Because if you're bothered by other people peacefully enjoying a drink or a smoke in public, it's you who's having the problem, not them, and you should probably mind your own business instead of demanding everyone should bow to your personal preferences or life choices.

It's actually much more expensive to _not_ have them, because they're the most basic necessities of a civilized and prosperous society.

We’ve got this production capacity and it’s not being put to use. If we had started this last year, we could have shipped millions of doses by now. This is supposed to be like a wartime effort, everyone in it together. But that doesn’t seem to be the case.”
“We have the facilities and equipment, bioreactors, we have fill-and-finish capability. Depending on how much help we get with technology transfer, we could be ready in a few months,” explains Biolyse’s head of production Claude Mercure. “I don’t understand pharma’s stance on this. Everyone needs to make money, sure. But this is a very serious situation and there’s no reason to be this harsh,” he added.
Fulton says he has been in touch with other manufacturers who say they also have spare capacity – for instance, fellow Canadians Pnuvax and the Bangladeshi producer Incepta. He hopes to put together a consortium to strengthen their offer to industry.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*The pandemic has given scientists a more prominent voice in society. They need to use it to push for better health through equality.*  
&gt;  
&gt;For more than 150 years, scholarship and research have revealed how poor and marginalized communities are disproportionately affected by disease. People are more likely to become unwell if they earn low wages, have few employment protections, live in unsafe environments, receive poor-quality education, or are discriminated against. Whether Prussia’s typhus epidemic of 1847–48, tuberculosis outbreaks in the United States in the 1930s or chronic diseases today, researchers conclude that people would live longer, healthier lives if a society’s collective wealth could be shared more equally.  
&gt;  
&gt;Scholars in disciplines ranging from economics to epidemiology and sociology have proposed ideas for how to share the world’s wealth. But their advice has mostly been disregarded by politicians. This is in part because the idea that the public and private sectors need to have a greater role in reducing inequality has been at odds with the thrust of global politics for at least four decades.  
&gt;  
&gt;**During the COVID-19 pandemic, the successes that scientists have scored with drugs, vaccines and other interventions have given researchers a voice in decision-making. They need to use that position to advocate policies that would improve social determinants of better health, such as living wages, employment protections and high-quality educational opportunities. In this way, scientists need to ‘get political’.**  
&gt;  
&gt;That will require, among other things, scientists to consider how they can best achieve political impact and policy engagement. But advice is on hand. A [News Feature this week](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00943-x) describes how community organizations in one of the poorest regions of the United States, California’s San Joaquin Valley, tried to curb COVID-19 in communities of colour by tackling some of the disease’s underlying determinants, in part through political engagement.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hundreds of thousands of people in the valley — mainly immigrants — work on farms and in food-processing or meat-packing plants. Compared with California’s more affluent regions, wages in the valley are low and labour protections weak. And neighbourhoods of agricultural workers often have poor-quality schools, insufficient clinics and few markets selling healthy food. Some areas even lack clean, running water. A child born in San Francisco, California, is expected to live for at least ten years longer than children born in many parts of the valley.  
&gt;  
&gt;**State and county public-health officials know this, but are often unable to push local leaders for the necessary policy changes. This is because they are generally hired to carry out the wishes of elected politicians, and their budgets and jurisdictions are therefore determined by those politicians.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**But academic scientists are not tied by these constraints.** During the pandemic, researchers in the San Joaquin Valley have partnered with grass-roots groups to try to address inequities and push agriculture companies to report COVID-19 outbreaks and protect their employees with face masks and physical distancing. They have also distributed free tests, and provided outreach and financial assistance for under-served communities.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Funding gaps*  
&gt;  
&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare society’s inequities more starkly than most people today will have witnessed. In the United States, Black, Hispanic and Latinx people are about three times as likely as white Americans to be hospitalized with COVID-19. In the United Kingdom, Bangladeshi-Britons have [twice the risk of death from COVID-19](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/908434/Disparities_in_the_risk_and_outcomes_of_COVID_August_2020_update.pdf) as white British people. In Singapore, most COVID-19 cases have occurred in migrant workers, including those from Malaysia, Bangladesh and India.  
&gt;  
&gt;And the gap between rich and poor is rising in much of the world. In the United States alone, billionaires have increased their wealth by 44% — to a total of US$4.3 trillion — in the past year, and 1.5 million jobs were created in the top wage bracket. And yet, 7.9 million low-wage workers lost their jobs. The number of families reporting hunger and homelessness climbed in 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the United States and Europe, funders have responded with grants to explore and address health disparities and their social determinants. **Researchers should push themselves to go further than simply collecting data on the social and economic roots of poor health, and perhaps even deeper than devising interventions to address immediate needs, such as programmes to teach communities about nutrition.**  
&gt;  
&gt;*Getting involved*  
&gt;  
&gt;But there are few long-term funding opportunities for such work, or even for researchers whose main objective is evidence-based policy — let alone systemic reform — and that, too, needs to change. **Funders and research leaders must place a higher value on these types of impact in research-evaluation criteria. Then scientists would have a greater incentive to collaborate with economists and political scientists to devise ways to share wealth and turn around rising inequality.** Those who study racism could work with epidemiologists to better understand why economic and political systems have marginalized certain groups of people for decades, and how reparations or other reforms could begin to turn the tide.  
&gt;  
&gt;Researchers can also work with think tanks to write the short, research-informed reports that are required reading for politicians and policymakers, but are not part of conventional journal publishing. And they could co-design their studies with grass-roots groups who advocate for — and work with — communities in need. **Scientists should also consider standing for elected bodies such as local, regional or national legislatures — which often have a dearth of representatives with research expertise.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Scientific discoveries and inventions made during the pandemic have led to progress in diagnostics, therapies and, of course, vaccine production. But the pandemic is far from over, and, combined with economic inequality and climate change, the world is in a precarious era. **Now that the pandemic has elevated scientists’ voice in society, more must learn how best to use that voice to advance the cause of economic, racial and social justice. Without such change, the essential research that is scientists’ main focus will ultimately fall short of achieving its goal of building healthier, more resilient, more equal and more just societies.**",,,1619696781,{},gwaa75d,True,t3_n12dw8,False,False,t3_n12dw8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n12dw8/to_remedy_health_disparities_more_scientists_must/gwaa75d/,1619712518,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It looks like the average fully vaccinated in that period is 26,776,416 (taking data from the table you can download [here](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-trends), expand ""Data Table for Trends in Number of COVID-19 Vaccinations in the US"" under the chart, download table, and averaging the  cumulative fully vaccinated by day).

It's also not fully reliable as someone who was vaccinated on April 20 obviously isn't testing positive and dying and having that death reported all in the same day. If you look at fully vaxxed numbers just up to the end of March (giving a 3 week lead time for COVID--&gt;Death--&gt;Report), the average is 17,652,837.

By Reuters 

Taiwan has bought 150 oxygen concentrators and aims to send them to India this weekend to help it deal with a massive increase in COVID-19 infections, and is also looking at providing further aid, Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said on Thursday.

Countries around the world have been rushing to help India alleviate the crisis. India's death toll from the coronavirus pandemic surged past 200,000 on Wednesday, worsened by shortages of hospital beds and medical oxygen.

Wu told reporters that they had been working on an aid package for India and have already purchased 150 oxygen concentrators which should be able to be sent this weekend.

""We are in the process of buying more oxygen concentrators and buying raw materials from overseas so our companies at home can produce even more,"" he said.

An oxygen concentrator reduces nitrogen from an air supply to produce an oxygen-enriched air supply to a patient.

Taiwan is also looking at providing other aid as requested by India, Wu added.

While India, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Chinese-claimed Taiwan, the two have gotten closer in recent years thanks to their shared antipathy of Beijing.

Taiwan sees India as an important like-minded democracy and friend, and there are close cultural and economic links too.

Last year Taiwan accused China of trying to impose censorship in India after its embassy in New Delhi advised journalists to observe the ""one-China"" principle after newspapers carried advertisements for Taiwan's national day.",,,1619680354,{},gw9r6mv,True,t3_n0ydrp,False,True,t3_n0ydrp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n0ydrp/taiwan_to_send_covid_aid_to_india_this_weekend/gw9r6mv/,1619701283,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Ideally, per CDC guidelines, you should consult with an allergist-immunologist to discuss whether you should get a vaccine. To my knowledge, there’s no evidence of cross reactivity to penicillin.

Or the studies are not that far off and P.1 took off there specifically because it evaded the ""herd immunity"" there. Same thing happening in Delhi now - antibody tests indicated 56% of the population had immunity earlier last year yet they're being absolutely ravaged by B.1.617 right now.

However assuming  countries that have a 14 days quarantine requirement, as far as the US is concerned the average American probably has ran out of PTO with one quarantine requirement (at least returning to the US doesn't involve quarantine) unless they have a secure job that can be done remotely during the quarantine period or professions that have large chunk of time off like teachers/professors or self employed. 
So it potentially even prevents those who wouldn't abuse the system to do it even once.

I am glad that neither the US or France requires quarantine, just testing and has a fully vaccinated person going into my fully vaccinated family, testing is already an additional step I am okay to take despite being highly low risk of contributing to virus spread.

 *-it change your DNA! NOOOOO* 

\- A mRNA vaccine is incapable of changing your DNA. That is impossible for three reasons.

1. DNA in a cell is housed in the nucleus. In order to access the nucleus the vaccine would need to pass though the nuclear membrane. To do that, the vaccine would need a nuclear access signal (which it doesn't have). No signal means that it is biologically impossible for the vaccine to enter your nucleus and interact with your DNA.
2. DNA and RNA are separate languages.  Let's suppose that the vaccine somehow did the biologically impossible and managed to sneak though a nuclear membrane. In that situation the RNA from the vaccine would be incapable of communicating with the DNA of your cell. RNA and DNA are completely different languages. For DNA and RNA to communicate with each other a ""translator"" reverse transcription enzyme would need to be used. The vaccine does not have this enzyme in it and therefore it is impossible for vaccine RNA to communicate with cellular DNA. 
3. RNA cannot integrate with DNA without integrase. If biological impossibility 1 and 2 happened, the vaccine RNA would still be incapable of integrating with your DNA. For this to happen, yet another enzyme would need to be present in the vaccine. Which it is not.

So in short, it is literally impossible for the vaccine to interact with your DNA.

 *-If you get the COVID vaccine, you have to quarantine for 2 weeks because of shedding.* 

A mRNA vaccine does not actually have any COVID virus in it. Therefore it is impossible for you to shed the virus.

 I see this one a lot. The misconception here stems from a misunderstanding of correlation and causation. Have people died who have *taken* the vaccine?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I mean you could literally just Google it or do a tiny bit of your own research.  But ok, I'll do it for you.  
&gt;  
&gt;In an open letter  to the German government and state premiers, five leading members of  the Association for Aerosol Research (GAeF) write that ""The transmission  of SARS-CoV-2 viruses takes place indoors almost without exception.  Transmission outdoors is extremely rare and never leads to cluster  infections as can be observed indoors.""   
&gt;  
&gt;https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-the-risk-of-catching-coronavirus-outdoors/a-56792936  
&gt;  
&gt;Our study does not rule out outdoor transmission of the virus. However, among our 7,324 identified cases in China with sufficient descriptions, only one outdoor outbreak involving two cases occurred in a village in Shangqiu, Henan. A 27-year-old man had a conversation outdoors with an individual who had returned from Wuhan on 25 January and had the onset of symptoms on 1 February.  
&gt;  
&gt;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053058v1.full.pdf  
&gt;  
&gt;The one outdoor outbreak also involved a face to face conversation, meaning closer proximity and more time, both factors that help facilitate the spread of Corona.  
&gt;  
&gt;Evidence continues to suggest that the vast majority oftransmission happens in indoor spaces; recent reviewsconsidering data from several countriesfound very little evidence of outdoor transmission for SARS-CoV-2, influenza or other respiratory viruses \[9, 10\]. The small number of cases where outdoor transmission may have occurred are associated with gatherings that facilitate close interactions, particularly extended duration, or settings where people mixed in indoor venues alongside an outdoor setting. It is therefore important that messaging recognises that close interactions outdoors can still pose a risk.  
&gt;  
&gt;https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/945978/S0921\_Factors\_contributing\_to\_risk\_of\_SARS\_18122020.pdf  
&gt;  
&gt;Of the 20,471 cases in the LSHTM database, only 461 in 11 clusters were associated solely with outdoor environments.  
&gt;  
&gt;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188417v2.full-text  
&gt;  
&gt;It's important to note that each of these studies only looks at Outdoors vs Indoors. In fact, they even go so far as to mention that people WERE NOT socially distancing.  So in non socially distanced outdoors activities these studies are already showing that very few cases were transmitted outdoors (.03% and 2.2%).  Adding in social distancing would reduce those numbers significantly further.",,,1619649090,{},gw8837h,False,t3_n0bpjx,False,True,t1_gw7vn4t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n0bpjx/cdc_updates_maskwearing_guidelines_easyreading/gw8837h/,1619672527,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This article also misunderstands the mRNA vaccines.  As the article says, it would take years to build up an approved facility even for traditional vaccines.  But the idea that it is *easier* to produce the mRNA vaccines is completely wrong.  It might be in the future, but it currently is not.

Note that Lonza, the Swiss biotech company mentioned in the article, is not manufacturing Moderna's vaccine, they are making one key ingredient -- the lipid nanoparticles that surround the mRNA.  And Lonza is hardly just a ""chemicals company,"" it's an extremely sophisticated $50 billion multi-national chemical &amp; biotech company.

This is one of the primary bottlenecks in the process, and is categorically not something that one of tens of thousands of ""chemical"" companies are capable of making.  There are a small handful of companies in the world capable of it, and they are all operating at capacity, which is the primary constraint on Pfizer and Moderna.

The idea that any chemical company can just start producing this is not true.

In any event, there's nothing stopping a country like India from ignoring pharmaceutical patents.  India famously ignores them all the time.

And the US, for all of its flaws, has a huge pool of research talent at its universities, and combined probably has more brain power than all of the pharmaceutical companies. Seems to me, there’s gotta be a way to harness all that talent for good instead of profit and price gouging. After all, Moderna started in a Harvard lab.

What happened? A liberal swipe your girl or something? 😂

But seriously, I'll happily play this game. You're not going to like how it goes, but I'll play. Here we go with reasoning skills...

So, Trump won the 65+ crowd by about 3 points, 51% to 48%. The 65+ age group, per the CDC, is about 82% with at least one vaccine dose. Let's assume that 95% of Biden voters over 65 got at least one dose (per the poll) - that's 45.6% of the over 65 crowd. So, 82 (the percent with one dose) minus 45.6 (Biden voters with one dose) leave us needing another 36.4%, which had to come from Trump voters. So if Trump won 51% of that age group, that means we have a remainder of 14.6%. 

That 14.6 represents 28.6% of Trump voters over 65. As you said, the older folks got vaccinated at a higher rate, so it doesn't seem totally out of the realm of credibility that something like 40% of Republicans overall don't want to get the vaccine. And that's before you get to the really fun part and realize there's an entire category we haven't even touched on yet, which are the people in that poll who identified as ""Independent.""

https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/03/14/political-independents-who-they-are-what-they-think/

Independents actually make up 38% of the electorate (with 31% being registered Dems, and 26% being Repubs). So, of the over 65 crowd, Trump must have captured a good portion of the independent voters to hit the 51% mark. Only 22% of Independents refuse the vaccine, as opposed to 43% of Republicans, per the poll, so if Trump won a sizable number if Independents (and he did) that would move the needle on my above math and get us closer to what the poll indicated, meaning something in the neighborhood of mid-30% of Republicans over 65 didn't get the vaccine.

Additionally, other polls have found similar numbers! Like this one: https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/dashboard/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-dashboard/ (, over 11,000 interviews, 29% Republicans refuse), or this one: http://maristpoll.marist.edu/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-poll-results-the-biden-administration-covid-19/#sthash.cI8mHWqH.dpbs (1.200+ polled, 49% of R men refuse, 34% of R women refuse)

&gt;Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or themselves.[16] They can be related to primarily obsessional obsessive compulsive disorder. These thoughts can include harming a child; jumping from a bridge, mountain, or the top of a tall building; urges to jump in front of a train or automobile; and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile.[4] Rachman's survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including: **causing harm to elderly people**...

Hungary is right now having 27 deaths per million, India has 2.39. 

At the height of their COVID wave UK had 18 deaths per million, US had 10 deaths per million. You must put things in context of all this. Don't merely go by the news.

India is a big place with a huge population. Certain urban areas have  covid clusters but if all of India were similarly infected the scale of crisis would be unbelievable.

This is what a mild crisis in India looks like, because there's hardly any excess capacity built into infrastructure whether at hospitals or mortuaries.

Even on ordinary pre-pandemic days at most good well equipped city hospitals I've had to wait 3-4 hours to get a bed. I've had this experience several times in the past few years to admit friends,  family and myself. Lots of old people in my family who needed hospitalization and ultimately cremation.


Similarly at the crematorium on an ordinary day I've had to wait a few hours and give a bribe to get a slot. There's usually one or two bodies in the queue and often the electric furnace  would break down and they'd send for a mechanic. I must have been present at more than half a dozen funerals in the last few years and there's always a wait time of an hour at least.

[],,jdorje,,,[],,,,text,t2_ii7rl,False,False,[],"When it comes to real world data there are always confounding factors that makes it impossible to get an accurate number.  Trial data is more accurate, but never has enough samples to get a precise number.

For instance in Moderna's trial, there were 9 people hospitalized in the placebo arm and 0 in the vaccine arm (out of ~15000 people in each arm).  This is why they claimed 100% efficacy at preventing hospitalization.  But this is absurdly misleading on such a small sample; the 95% credible interval (*) from this sample would be 55-100%.  Of course, that hasn't stopped everyone from incorrectly repeating the 100% number.

When we have real world data we have a tremendously larger sample size, but then the data isn't controlled so we will inevitably get confounding factors.  With vaccination there are two huge ones: vaccinations are unblinded and self-selecting.  Because they are unblinded, behavior is likely to (and of course should) change after vaccination to (presumably) increase the risk of exposure.  And because they are self-selecting, the vaccinations might be given first to people who are at highest risk of exposure (e.g., healthcare workers or group care residents) or to those who take COVID the most seriously (vaccine early adopters).  Taken together these could make the risk many times different than what the data shows; actual protection could be 99% for instance if those who were vaccinated were simply 6x more likely to be exposed than those who weren't vaccinated.

I keep seeing this claim but see no proof of it or data that indicates that. The rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is much lower than the influenza virus and while spike proteins can mutate so to **reduce** effectiveness of antibody response, antibodies in themselves aren't reflective of a long-term immune response to the virus. For that we have to look to memory B cells which can last a lifetime and T-cells which could potentially last years (People who got SARS in the early 2000s still have T-cells for the virus). And so far the variants don't show any resistance to T-cell response and it doesn't seem like they will.
Also a new study dropped that shows that mRNA vaccines also produce T-cells.

Not that the cnn article in itself is a wrong idea, I just think you shouldn't lie and try to scare people for them to get vaccinated.

*pp are* [*percentage points*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point)*, the arithmetic difference between today's percentage and a prior date.  For example, if a group was 55.0% today and 50.0% before, this is a 5.0 pp difference.*

Notes:

* The raw data can be downloaded exact totals for every age group can be downloaded from the [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) as a CSV.  The CDC indicates the data is by ""Date Administered"", but it actually appears to be by ""Date Reported"".
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC demographic data, so the tables do not match national totals.
* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group. The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, assuming that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17.",,,1619675790,{},gw9lidw,False,t3_n0ttnm,False,False,t3_n0ttnm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n0ttnm/us_administers_2346_million_doses_of_covid19/gw9lidw/,1619698137,15,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Furthermore, there may be certain activities that can be performed after vaccination, such as nursing home visitationpdf iconexternal icon, as long as other prevention measures are maintained [CDC unpublished].

&gt;In summary, prevention measures will continue to be important for all people, regardless of vaccination status, especially during this period of vaccine deployment. However, as vaccination coverage increases, a balanced, stepwise approach to phasing out certain prevention measures in fully vaccinated people, ideally those that are the most disruptive to individuals and society, can be taken.

&gt;How long vaccine protection lasts and how much vaccines protect against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants are still under investigation. Until more is known and vaccination coverage increases, some prevention measures will continue to be necessary in some settings for all people, regardless of vaccination status.

&gt;  
&gt; However, as public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission. We support them as vital to the national public health and to the threatened health specifically of Black people in the United States. We can show that support by facilitating safest protesting practices without detracting from demonstrators' ability to gather and demand change. This should not be confused with a permissive stance on all gatherings, particularly protests against stay-home orders. Those actions not only oppose public health interventions, but are also rooted in white nationalism and run contrary to respect for Black lives. **Protests against systemic racism, which fosters the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on Black communities and also perpetuates police violence, must be supported.**

No new symptomatic cases and 300 asymptomatic cases (detection rate 0.303/10,000, 95% CI 0.270–0.339/10,000) were identified. There were no positive tests amongst 1,174 close contacts of asymptomatic cases. 107 of 34,424 previously recovered COVID-19 patients tested positive again (re-positive rate 0.31%, 95% CI 0.423–0.574%).

In the [January 2018 flu epidemic](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm) excess deaths increased quite quickly: 1795-&gt;3030-&gt;3978-&gt;8391 over a four-week period.  Using a 5-day serial interval that gives an R(t) of about 1.45 for that period.  But before that period it was much lower, and afterwards it was back below 1.  So 1.5 might be a high point, but if it's not sustained through 6 months of ""winter"" then that 40 generations isn't going to get anywhere near a 10-million-fold increase in cases.  If it averages 1.06 then it would take ~7 years instead of 1 year to get ""back to normal"" (but at that point transfer from animal reservoirs would become a substantial accelerator).

R(t) is supposed to be somewhat above 1 in winter and somewhat below 1 in summer for a seasonal endemic disease.

Not really, it's getting worse exactly **because** websites keep clamping down on it. It's pushing people further and further into echo chambers and they never get exposed to anything else. The biggest issue is that social media sites use algorithms to show people things that drive up time spent and clicks, which usually means more extreme/conspiratory content. Then if they do ""ban"" something (which usually isn't an actual content ban) or attempt to deplatform someone they become a martyr and people get even more curious about what they're saying that could be so dangerous, and it drives up views.

There is also the question as to how long the immunity will last. I have heard of reports of those that were infected with the virus itself and were regularly donating plasma no longer having any antibodies present in as little as 3-4 months time meaning they could be possibly reinfected. Now hopefully the vaccine is able to last a long while but chances are that there will already need to be a booster administered at some point in the near future as there is no way in heck there will be enough people vaccinated in time to fully stop the spread. The worry is also vaccine escape. The vaccine is completely dependent on a particular spike protein on the virus itself. There has been the first steps towards changing in such a way that a new strain could develop that our developed immunity against the original covid-19 would not recognize sort of like how there is an annual flu shot because influenza is constantly changing.

Seriously: METHODOLOGY 
The Monmouth University Poll was sponsored and conducted by the Monmouth University Polling
Institute from April 8 to 12, 2021 with a national random sample of 800 adults age 18 and older. This 
includes 278 contacted by a live interviewer on a landline telephone and 522 contacted by a live 
interviewer on a cell phone, in English. Telephone numbers were selected through a mix of random digit 
dialing and list-based sampling. Landline respondents were selected with a modified Troldahl-Carter 
youngest adult household screen. Monmouth is responsible for all aspects of the survey design, data 
weighting and analysis. The full sample is weighted for region, age, education, gender and race based on 
US Census information (ACS 2018 one-year survey). Data collection support provided by Braun 
Research (field), Dynata (RDD sample), and Aristotle (list sample). For results based on this sample, one 
can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling has a maximum margin of plus or 
minus 3.5 percentage points (unadjusted for sample design). Sampling error can be larger for sub-groups 
(see table below). In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and 
practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.

So by the middle of May for the first dose. Then worst case they get Moderna and it's four weeks until their second dose then another two to full immunity. That lands us right at the beginning of July.

Both countries already have infrastructure in place to make some vaccines. If they were granted the ability to create the AZ vaccine, then they could build more factories--not enough, probably, and not quickly, sure, but if we don't amp up production of our vaccine, it will be YEARS before developing nations get it anyway. To say nothing of the fact that many experts predict that COVID-19 will continue circulating and evolving and more vaccines will need to develop to combat it. We will still be making COVID-19 vaccines ten years from that, and Africa and India will tremendously benefit from production information being shared. If they know they'll have access to that information, they know that it's worth investing in the necessary infrastructure. If not...then developing nations will continue to be dependent on wealthy ones for the vaccine.

I'm sorry to rain on your parade, but I'm astonished that you are willing to jump to the defense of a billionaire who has turned a huge profit off the pandemic. Bill Gates has gone against the requests of delegates from South Africa and India and nonprofits.

No. This is a lie. Children have not received the vaccine because it is not yet approved for use in children.

If you refer to the German denial of genocide law (and as far as I know, we are the only ones that have it), this can never extend to the Armenian genocide. The constitutional court made very sure that the denial of the Holocaust is only possible because the German constitution is an anti-thesis to the Nazi regime and can only be understood in connection with a full disclosure of the Nazi crimes. Because of that, the acts of the Nazis are outside of the protection of the constitution.

While this decision is very controversial, it also means that argument can never be repeated for any other historical fact.

It is rather the other way around, that your claim for corruption and missing independence, need proove, because you claim that the system does not work as it is designed to work. It is nearly impossible to prove that a system works as it meant, because you have to show every single case and every single situation, something that is nearly impossible. On the other hand, to prove that it fails, you can produce clear evidence by showing the situations they fail.

And I think we need to get everyone vaccinated, regardless of race, location, etc. From what I understand, that's the aim of all the vaccination programs.

The likely reason that there are campaigns targeting Black communities specifically is that various Black communities have common concerns, and it's efficient to target them as a group with tailored messaging. I'm not running that show, so I'm just guessing.

For what it's worth, there are also concerted efforts to target conservative and religious Americans and encourage vaccinations in those groups. Really, the government campaign to encourage vaccination is targeting every group people can come up with. This article gives a useful, simple overview: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/04/01/ads-campaigns-seek-counter-covid-vaccine-doubts-among-conservatives/4829883001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/04/01/ads-campaigns-seek-counter-covid-vaccine-doubts-among-conservatives/4829883001/). The government has partnered with: NASCAR (huge Black following there, I know), MLB, NFL, WWE, dozens of rural organizations, faith and veterans' groups, etc. etc. Heck, man, there's even [https://www.christiansandthevaccine.com/](https://www.christiansandthevaccine.com/).

Where did you get the idea the government was just targeting Black folks in a few area codes? You should probably stay away from whatever site offered that take up.

But, yeah, if we're just playing a numbers game and only targeting one ethnicity, I'd target white folks since they make up 76% of the population.

One-fifth believed the vaccines provided strong protection after only one dose, and another 36% were unsure.

The one-fifth are right: [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00448-7/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00448-7/fulltext). 89-91% protection after the first dose. The second dose boosts this protection further and (probably) extends its duration.

&gt;Less than a third of vaccinated respondents said they were told that their risk of transmitting the virus to others is unknown, one of the key reasons for continuing to wear masks in many settings.

It isn't unknown, it's a 90+% reduction in transmission: [https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-israel-vaccine-int/israeli-studies-find-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-reduces-transmission-idUSKBN2AJ08J](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-israel-vaccine-int/israeli-studies-find-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-reduces-transmission-idUSKBN2AJ08J)

# Rich Countries Signed Away a Chance to Vaccinate the World

Despite warnings, American and European officials gave up leverage that could have guaranteed access for billions of people. That risks prolonging the pandemic.

 

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/21/world/vaccine-patents-us-eu.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/21/world/vaccine-patents-us-eu.html)

&amp;#x200B;

the coming days, a patent will finally be issued on a five-year-old invention, a feat of molecular engineering that is at the heart of at least five major Covid-19 vaccines. And the United States government will control that patent.

&amp;#x200B;

The new patent presents an opportunity — and some argue the last best chance — to exact leverage over the drug companies producing the vaccines and pressure them to expand access to less affluent countries.

&amp;#x200B;

The question is whether the government will do anything at all.

The rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines, achieved at record speed and financed by massive public funding in the United States, the European Union and Britain, represents a great triumph of the pandemic. Governments partnered with drugmakers, pouring in billions of dollars to procure raw materials, finance clinical trials and retrofit factories. Billions more were committed to buy the finished product.

But this Western success has created stark inequity. Residents of wealthy and middle-income countries have received about 90 percent of the nearly 400 million vaccines delivered so far. Under current projections, many of the rest will have to wait years.

Growing numbers of health officials and advocacy groups worldwide are calling for Western governments to use aggressive powers — most of them rarely or never used before — to force companies to publish vaccine recipes, share their know-how and ramp up manufacturing. Public health advocates have pleaded for help, including asking the Biden administration to use its patent to push for broader vaccine access.

Governments have resisted. By partnering with drug companies, Western leaders bought their way to the front of the line. But they also ignored years of warnings — and explicit calls from the World Health Organization — to include contract language that would have guaranteed doses for poor countries or encouraged companies to share their knowledge and the patents they control.

“It was like a run on toilet paper. Everybody was like, ‘Get out of my way. I’m gonna get that last package of Charmin,’” said Gregg Gonsalves, a Yale epidemiologist. “We just ran for the doses.”

The prospect of billions of people waiting years to be vaccinated poses a health threat to even the richest countries. One example: In Britain, where the vaccine rollout has been strong, health officials are tracking a virus variant that emerged in South Africa, where vaccine coverage is weak. That variant may be able to blunt the effect of vaccines, meaning even vaccinated people might get sick.

Western health officials said they never intended to exclude others. But with their own countries facing massive death tolls, the focus was at home. Patent sharing, they said, simply never came up.

“It was U.S.-centric. It wasn’t anti-global.” said Moncef Slaoui, who was the chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed, a Trump administration program that funded the search for vaccines in the United States. “Everybody was in agreement that vaccine doses, once the U.S. is served, will go elsewhere.”

President Biden and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Union’s executive branch, are reluctant to change course. Mr. Biden has promised to help an Indian company produce about 1 billion doses by the end of 2022 and his administration has donated doses to Mexico and Canada. But he has made it clear that his focus is at home.

“We’re going to start off making sure Americans are taken care of first,” Mr. Biden said recently. “But we’re then going to try and help the rest of the world.”

Pressuring companies to share patents could be seen as undermining innovation, sabotaging drugmakers or picking drawn-out and expensive fights with the very companies digging a way out of the pandemic.

As rich countries fight to keep things as they are, others like South Africa and India have taken the battle to the World Trade Organization, seeking a waiver on patent restrictions for Covid-19 vaccines.

Russia and China, meanwhile, have promised to fill the void as part of their vaccine diplomacy. The Gamaleya Institute in Moscow, for example, has entered into partnerships with producers from Kazakhstan to South Korea, according to data from Airfinity, a science analytics company, and UNICEF. Chinese vaccine makers have reached similar deals in the United Arab Emirates, Brazil and Indonesia.

Addressing patents would not, by itself, solve the vaccine imbalance. Retrofitting or constructing factories would take time. More raw materials would need to be manufactured. Regulators would have to approve new assembly lines.

And as with cooking a complicated dish, giving someone a list of ingredients is no substitute to showing them how to make it.

To address these problems, the World Health Organization created a technology pool last year to encourage companies to share know-how with manufacturers in lower-income nations.

Not a single vaccine company has signed up.

“The problem is that the companies don’t want to do it. And the government is just not very tough with the companies,” said James Love, who leads Knowledge Ecology International, a nonprofit.

Drug company executives told European lawmakers recently that they were licensing their vaccines as quickly as possible, but that finding partners with the right technology was challenging.

“They don’t have the equipment,” Moderna’s chief executive, Stéphane Bancel, said. “There is no capacity.”

But manufacturers from Canada to Bangladesh say they can make vaccines — they just lack patent licensing deals. When the price is right, companies have shared secrets with new manufacturers in just months, ramping up production and retrofitting factories.

It helps when the government sweetens the deal. Earlier this month, Mr. Biden announced that the pharmaceutical giant Merck would help make vaccines for its competitor Johnson &amp; Johnson. The government pressured Johnson &amp; Johnson to accept the help and is using wartime procurement powers to secure supplies for the company. It will also pay to retrofit Merck’s production line, with an eye toward making vaccines available to every adult in the United States by May.

**Despite the hefty government funding, drug companies control nearly all of the intellectual property and stand to make fortunes off the vaccines. A critical exception is the patent expected to be approved soon — a government-led discovery for manipulating a key coronavirus protein.**

**This breakthrough, at the center of the 2020 race for a vaccine, actually came years earlier in a National Institutes of Health lab, where an American scientist named Dr. Barney Graham was in pursuit of a medical moonshot.**

In the United States, case counts and deaths are trending down thanks to our impressive vaccine supply, and because of the tragic reality that millions have already attained some level of immunity from being infected. Over the past year, we’ve also gained tremendous understanding about transmission risks—where they are high and where they are very low. It’s time that our rules reflect that reality, and spell out their reasoning explicitly, so they can inform and empower us as we trudge through the rest of this miserable pandemic.

This paragraph perfectly sums up what has had me internally screaming at my computer and TV ever since the vaccine became available. People in my town (which never had an outdoor mask mandate to begin with) are completely losing their minds over this, thinking that this alone will cause a surge. You are more likely to smell a fart in the wind than catch an infectious viral load of covid outdoors. This whole announcement was so anticlimactic and its delivery has only brought confusion and more fear.

Clearly people have been wearing masks and distancing enough to not only limit the flu but flat out eliminate it. Covid is just that much more infectious, basically the only way to similarly eliminate would be to lock everyone in their homes for month, never to leave for literally anything.

Why not both?

This virus is far more infectious than the flu, but the pandemic has been prolonged by selfish behavior. It wouldn't be an easy fight in the best of times, but if a significant portion of the population is not following the rules they can ruin it for the rest of us. 

&gt;Edit: the other option would be that covid is out competing the flu, another theory I’ve seen. That would be pretty nuts because it basically eliminated the flu.

They're separate viruses. To compete immunity against one would have to provide immunity against the other. The different variants do ""compete"" in that sense - if you catch the UK variant you won't catch the regular one and vice versa. But even then, it's not likely you're getting exposed to both at the same time and the strongest one wins. It's more that one is more contagious than the other, and you can actually track different R0 values of the different variants. Often measures which get R0&lt;1 for the original variant (i.e.: cases decrease over time as every infected person is likely to pass the virus along to less than one other person)  aren't sufficient to get R0&lt;1 for the other variants.

I tested negative for antibodies.

My innate immune system fought it off just fine. And I know plenty of people who’ve had side effects of vaccine that were as bad or worse than my actual illness.
I have an immunopenia and do not make antibodies to certain vaccines like rubella or any of the strains in the pneumonia vaccine.
At first I was like, I have natural immunity, I’m not getting up at 4 am and hitting refresh a jillion times to get a vaccine 2 hours drive from here.
This week, literally today or yesterday? Is the first time I became aware that you can now walk in to some places convenient to me.
I may get it, I may not. I know people who’ve recovered that have had it, and for two no side effects, for one, it seems to have resolved heart palpitations she’s had since her infection, and the third has been sick for a month and unable to return to work.
My guess for myself? Any side effects would be mild. Probably wouldn’t make antibodies anyway. Small risk of major side effects.
I’m still thinking. I do know two people who died from it, literally side effects landed them in bed, then pneumonia and hospitalized then dead. But they were old. There are a few thousand reported deaths. 
I’m still thinking, and I’m not particularly nervous about the virus itself, so that gives me a lot more pause. I assume when it’s offered along with my flu shot, I’ll get it.

Most would assume you are referring to a CFR/IFR with your ""less than 1% chance.""  (Or the equivalent with hospitilization, is that a CHR?)

But you're not referring to a CFR/IFR.

&gt;The table shows the absolute **risk of catching and dying** COVID-19 over a 90-day period based on data from the first peak of the pandemic.

Emphasis mine.  It's the likelihood of both catching it and then also dying from it after you've caught it.

And in case it isn't obvious that this is including in the chance of catching it, this should help make it more clear.

&gt;These absolute risks are changing over time in line with the **COVID-19 infection rate,** the extent of social distancing measures in place, and individual behaviour, and so the values should be interpreted with caution.

covid deaths: Brazil exceeds 400,000 deaths from covid-19

Brazil reached 400.021 deaths due to covid-19Image: VINCENT BOSSON/PHOTOARENA/PHOTOARENA/STADÃO CONTENT

Brazil has now surpassed more than 400,000 covid-19 deaths. The mark was reached 19 days after the country counted 350,000 victims of the pandemic and just over 13 months after the first confirmed death. Since 8 p.m. yesterday, 1,678 more lives have been lost, totaling 400.021 deaths due to the novocoronavirus.

The data are from the consortium of media outlets, of which UOL is a part, and which calculates the number of cases and deaths with the state health departments. Brazil has been with a moving average of deaths above a thousand for 98 days.

According to a survey by Johns Hopkins University, Brazil ranks second in the number of deaths from the disease, behind only the United States, with more than 500,000 deaths. As for the number of cases, the country occupies the third position, behind the United States and India, which faces an accelerated increase in infected people. According to the press consortium, Brazil has 14,541,806 cases.

Until recently Brazil was the epicenter of the pandemic in the world, being responsible for one in four deaths, but the worsening situation in India and a stabilization in the Brazilian states made the center of the pandemic move to the Asian country.

The stabilization of the indexes in Brazil occurred after practically all states reinforced their quarantines to face the collapse in hospitals.

The number of more than 400,000 deaths is recorded at the time when the Senate is starting the work of the Covid CPI, which will evaluate the actions of the federal government in confronting the pandemic, as well as the application of federal resources transferred to states and municipalities to combat the pandemic.

At the same time, the country has only 14.52% of the population vaccinated, with 30.7 million people having received at least one dose of covid-19 immunizers.

Covid-19 deaths in Brazil

The first covid-19 death in Brazil was recorded on March 17 last year. It was 95 days before we reached 50,000 deaths.

The 100,000 mark was hit 49 days later, on August 8, 2020. After another 63 days, we reached 150,000 victims. The 200,000 dead were counted 89 days later, on January 7 of this year. After another 48 days, the country reached 250,000 victims.

The number of 300,000 victims came after 28 days, on March 24. After 17 days, on April 10, Brazil passed 350,000 deaths from covid-19. Now, the country exceeds 400,000 dead after 19 days.

The peak of single-day covid-19 deaths in Brazil is 4,249, recorded on April 8.

I wasn't closely watching the jab, but afterwards I asked him if the stuff made it in my arm or not. We had a serious language barrier, and I couldn't get an answer that made sense to me but he assured me it was fine. There was long line so I left.

&gt; Several viruses, including those that cause dengue and yellow fever, can impair clotting, causing bleeding in the most severe cases. For this reason, these conditions are considered hemorrhagic viral fevers. In a recently published article in the scientific journal Memórias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, a group of ten researchers argues that the new coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2) is the first agent recognized for acting in the opposite direction: increasing the formation of clots (also called thrombi) that can obstruct circulation. Considering the evidence of hypercoagulation in the disease, the authors propose that Covid-19 is the first infection classified as thrombotic viral fever. Currently, the condition is classified as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

3) Lab confirmed influenza is a notifiable disease so by law doctors and labs must report it to a central database.

4) Participants in an online tracking study report flu like symptoms each week.  But their vaccination status is noted.  If both the vaccinated and unvaccinated have an uptick in symptoms there’s some cold type virus going around.  When symptoms increase in just the unvaccinated group, it’s the flu.   This measure is designed to catch the cases that are too mild to prompt a doctor’s visit.

By all measures, flu cases have dropped drastically.   Lab confirmed cases dropped from 5,000-10,000 per month to 50-100 per month.   But so did the online tracking reports of flu-like symptoms.    So it’s not like it was only serious cases that vanished.

I like the chart that gets posted in this thread with it being broken down by age group -- most of the younger groups that are lagging behind because they got a slow start did roughly .5% in the latest update. If even that rate holds (hopefully JnJ coming back will offset some of the recent decline) we'll have another 15% in the next 30 days which would put every age group except 16-17 year olds at basically 50% or higher.

Also, we'll see a big boost once kids are approved (presumably in the near-ish future) that will be a big help for overall herd immunity. And once we come off EUA we'll have the military and more businesses require vaccination which will help, too.

Finally there is the fact that it looks like a big percentage of colleges will be requiring it which will help give a nice boost to those younger age groups that are maybe less interested / fear COVID less.

The goal should always be to get rid of endemic diseases entirely when it is feasible, low-impact, cost effective, and safe to do so. And, with what we know today, COVID definitely appears to be a disease where this is the case. It does not mutate quickly, there are effective vaccines, it has a mutation-resistant attack surface (the spike protein), and animal reservoirs do not appear to be a common source of human transmission (as evidenced by countries that have eliminated COVID the hard way already - e.g. Australia, New Zealand, China).

I don't know where this public health notion of throwing our hands up in the air and saying ""meh, we tried!"" for a disease that has a safe, highly effective (90%+ protection from infection) vaccine.

There is nothing that stops us from eliminating SARS-CoV-2 from being endemic in the United States other than vaccine hesitancy. Elimination does not require restrictions - restrictions will end long, long before the disease is no longer endemic - but elimination does require vaccinations.

This attitude that endemic spread of deadly diseases that can easily be controlled is copacetic ""because hospitals aren't overwhelmed"" is just silly and absurd. Polio never overwhelmed hospitals either, and killed far fewer people than COVID ever did but we invested time and effort to eliminate that disease. Yellow Fever and Malaria used to be endemic in the United States - but we applied focused control and pest elimination efforts to end it in the United States. Measles (much harder to control than COVID), Rubella, and Diphtheria were eradicated domestically as well, although unfortunately measles outbreaks are incurring with increasing frequency due to anti-vaccination communities. 

Cholera and other diarrheal diseases - while perhaps not technically eliminated - have been controlled completely through public sanitation.

**UCI vision researchers work on preemptive vaccine for all coronaviruses**
https://www.ucihealth.org/news/2021/01/uci-team-at-work-on-vaccine-for-all-coronaviruses

&gt;Current vaccines from the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca pharmaceutical companies target one spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 to stop the virus from spreading. But the body’s immune system doesn’t only react to the spike protein. Scientists in BenMohamed’s lab examined more than 20 SARS-CoV-2 proteins and found that the immune systems reacts to each one of them in different ways.

&gt;Using a vaccine approach similar to one used to combat herpes simplex, their pan-coronavirus vaccine focuses on epitopes — parts of viral proteins that evoke immune responses — from SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, four of the most typical viruses that produce the common cold, as well as several animal coronaviruses, including those in bats.

&gt;Because many of the most diabolical viruses in the past few decades have originated in bats and transferred indirectly to humans, BenMohamed is aiming for a vaccine to protect against bat coronaviruses that have yet to spill over to humans.

&gt;Promising early results

“As soon as the Chinese scientists released the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, we jumped on it,” BenMohamed said. “We started identifying the building blocks and did microsurgery on the virus to identify the regions that are being recognized by human T-cells and antibodies.”

&gt;Vaccines work in two ways: first by evoking an immune response by antibodies that neutralize the virus, and second by T-cells that clean infected cells if antibodies haven’t done the job. So far, he said results have been promising, showing that laboratory animals have produced T-cells and antibodies in reaction to the many prototype pan-coronavirus vaccine candidates.

&gt;Scientists in BenMohamed’s lab began their initial work when the SARS-CoV-2 virus' genomic sequence was released in January 2020, starting with seed money from Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, part of UCI Health. The team then won a $100,000 so-called Fast Grant from Emergent Ventures, a program of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia. Their current work is continuing with a $3.7 million NIH grant.

&gt;Clinical trials possible by June

&gt;BenMohamed expects to begin testing the first pan-coronavirus vaccine in early 2021. Phase 1 clinical trials to evaluate dosage and safety in humans could begin in June.

&gt; Governor João Doria announced on Wednesday (28) that the Butantan Institute began producing today the first batch of 18 million doses of Butanvac, the first national vaccine against coronavirus. This will be the first immunizer of its type manufactured entirely in the country, without the need to import the raw material, as occurs today.


&gt; ""In this first stage, Butantan will produce 18 million doses of the vaccine ready for use already in the first fortnight of June, as soon as the approval process of Anvisa is concluded. This production will reach 40 million doses. But the production capacity of Butantan factory is surely for 100 million doses until the end of this year. At the pace that Butantan has been working, if there is speed in the approval of Anvisa, still this year Butantan can produce up to 150 million doses of Butanvac, ""said Doria.

&gt; The first batch of 520 thousand eggs arrived at the Butantan manufacturing complex and was immediately sent to the incubators for transfer and inoculation of the virus. From next week on, after the incubation period in an isolated environment, the stages of allantoic fluid collection, clarification, concentration, purification and inactivation of the virus to obtain the API (Active Pharmaceutical ingredient) are planned.

&gt; The next stages, with a schedule yet to be defined, will be the bottling and the quality inspection process. Another five batches with the same quantity of eggs as the first one should arrive at the Butantan Institute until next week for the raw material production processes, totaling around 6 million doses of API until May 18th.


&gt; The technology to obtain the API from Butanvac, largely dominated by Butantan, is already available at the institute's flu vaccine factory, and uses the cultivation of strains in chicken eggs, which generates inactivated vaccine doses, made with fragments of dead virus.

&gt; Butanvac uses the Newcastle Disease virus genetically modified, developed by American scientists at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in New York (USA). The viral vector contains the Spike protein of coronavirus in an integral form.

&gt; The complementary development of the vaccine will be with Butantan technology, including virus multiplication, cultivation conditions, ingredients, egg adaptation, conservation, purification, virus inactivation, dose escalation and other steps.

&gt; Newcastle Disease is an infection that affects birds and, therefore, the virus develops well in embryonated eggs, allowing production efficiency in a process similar to that used in the Influenza vaccine. The Newcastle disease virus does not cause symptoms in humans, constituting a very safe alternative in production. It is inactivated for the vaccine formulation, facilitating its stability and making the immunizer even safer.

&gt; The initiative of the new immunization is part of an international consortium of which Instituto Butantan is the main producer, responsible for 85% of the total capacity, and is committed to supply this vaccine to Brazil and low and medium income countries.

&gt; **Clinical Tests**

&gt; The Butantan Institute sent last Friday (23) to Anvisa the Butanvac clinical trial protocol. Once authorized by the national regulatory agency, the phase 1 and 2 studies in humans will begin immediately, with 1.8 thousand volunteers. Phase 3, with a larger scale of participants, should include 9 thousand people.

&gt; On March 26, Butantan had already sent to Anvisa the Dossier on Clinical Development of Drugs, containing information about the new vaccine. Since then, technicians from the institute and the regulatory agency have been keeping close contact.

&gt; The studies of Butanvac should be conducted in a very fast process, based on comparative vaccine responses in relation to clinical trials already conducted. That is why Butantan expects to have the authorization for the tests soon.

&gt; The clinical trials of the new vaccine should last about 20 weeks. They will be made with adult volunteers from 18 years old. Both those who have already had the vaccine and those who have had COVID-19 can be included in the tests.

&gt; Pilot production of the vaccine compound has already been completed for application in human volunteers during the trials.

[],,shallah,,,[],,,,text,t2_38lau,False,True,[],"&gt;But the spike is slightly different in each variant. “The current vaccines are based on the genetic code of the original strain found in Wuhan,” Pamela Bjorkman, a bioengineering professor at Caltech, explains. This exact strain is no longer in circulation, so the vaccines are already slightly imperfect fits for the variants many of us may encounter. At this point, the changes to the spike protein are not so dramatic as to render first-generation vaccines ineffective, Bjorkman says, “but that won’t necessarily hold as the virus continues to mutate.”

&gt;The challenge, then, is to create a vaccine that will anticipate such changes—teaching the immune system to recognize and fight off variants that may not even exist yet. One potentially powerful approach would be to target a part of the spike protein that doesn’t evolve as quickly as the others. At the University of Texas at Austin, Jason McLellan’s lab has focused on the stem of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which doesn’t mutate as often as the tip. In theory, a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the stem would induce protection against many or even all the variants at once—as long as they continue to share this similar stem. In practice, though, antibodies against the spike stem may have trouble recognizing and binding to their target if it’s tucked away in the protein structure.

&gt;Bjorkman’s lab has been working on another solution, one that’s guaranteed to generate an immune response: a vaccine that carries several different versions of the part of the spike that binds to human cells. This assortment can be arrayed on tiny synthetic skeletons, constituting “mosaic nanoparticles.” When Bjorkman’s team injected mice with a prototype multi-strain vaccine last year, they found that it produced antibodies against every form of spike protein that was in the mosaic.

&gt;A related approach is to start with mRNA, just as the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do. But instead of including the code for only one strain, you could tie together mRNA that codes for many different spike-protein binding sites—including the common mutations seen in dangerous variants. David Martinez, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and his colleagues recently reported promising mouse experiments (their work is under review) with mRNA from different coronaviruses, welded into a “chimeric spike” mRNA vaccine. When given to mice, the hybrid vaccine effectively generated antibodies against multiple spike proteins, including the one associated with a key variant of concern in the U.S.

&gt;To make a universal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that provides long-term protection, we may need to think beyond the spike, Baozhong Wang, a biologist at Georgia State University, says. “Broad, neutralizing antibodies to conserved areas in spike protein are important, but not the whole” solution, Wang says. T-cell responses in the lungs will be crucial, too, because they catalog memories of past respiratory viral pathogens. These responses are predominantly induced by proteins inside the virus, Wang explains, such as the nucleoproteins and enzymes that help it reproduce, rather than its spike. His approach is to load a nanoparticle with parts of different spike proteins.",,,1619647813,{},gw85dvh,False,t3_n0i0g1,False,True,t3_n0i0g1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n0i0g1/one_vaccine_to_rule_them_all_what_if_a_single/gw85dvh/,1619671156,3,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Compulsory licensing protocol exists within the WTO, it is obviously now the fastest way for any country who wishes (and has the means) to produce any of the vaccines outside of the established supply lines to do this. The argument that IP waiver is needed because it would take too long to use compulsory licensing is now known to be incorrect.  As far as I am aware no country has chosen to do this. 

IMO this inaction supports the position of the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network (DCVMN) and the CEO of SII who have both stated that it isn't IP rights, nor lack of licenced manufacturing is the issue with slower than hoped for roll out of vaccines. Very simply, there is capacity already in place but scale up takes time. To go from zero COVID vaccines to billions isn't simple and doesn't happen over night. Supply chains are complicated and are carefully managed. Too many wannabe producers and you will end up with no one producing as scarce raw materials get spread across more and more manufacturers exacerbating supply issues.

At the end of the day the WTO IP waiver petition has been shown to be built on false pretences. That is incontrovertible.

We’ll hit 50 percent 5/18 at current rate which will probably slow down so my guess is 3-4 weeks to hit 50. Plus keep in mind that while it’s not a perfect distribution it’s probably fairly uniform between vaccinated and unvaccinated. Meaning that only 20 percent of the 50 percent of unvaccinated have had covid or about 10 percent. So we’re looking at 60-65 percent immunity by two weeks into June if I assume you’re estimate of 25-30 cause it takes at least two weeks for immunity to kick in. Which is still pretty great. We’ll probably see very low numbers in most of the country and especially in the high vaccine uptake areas. Might see regional flare ups in the south and Midwest where uptake is low but luckily these regions seem less likely to experience bad outbreaks based on how they fared last year. I think herd immunity will hit late summer (earlier in high vaccine uptake areas) but that doesn’t mean we won’t have a much more normal summer or states won’t open up sooner as we see numbers continue to crater.,,,1619703487,{},gwam7un,False,t3_n0yt3d,False,True,t1_gwaabz6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n0yt3d/daily_discussion_thread_april_29_2021/gwam7un/,1619719697,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I'd love to see the poll you reference. While you look for it to share with the thread, maybe you would like to review some of these:

* [https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/dashboard/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-dashboard/](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/dashboard/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-dashboard/)
   * This poll was conducted across over 11,000 interviews. Funnily enough, it shows that a higher percentage of white folks (15%) than Black folks (10%) saying they'd refuse the vaccine.
   * Given that there are 5.69 times more white folks than Black folks in the country, I think it's a much, much more significant problem that 15% of white folks won't get the vaccine, compared to 10% of Black folks.
      * A similar calculation can be done for Black folks vs. Republicans. Given that about 26% of the country identifies as Republican, versus only 13.4% of the country being Black, even if the percentage vaccine resistance was the same for both groups, it would be twice as bad for the country overall re: Republicans not taking the vaccine compared to Black folks (thinking total numbers).
* [http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NPR\_PBS-NewsHour\_Marist-Poll\_USA-NOS-and-Tables\_202103091124.pdf#page=3](http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_202103091124.pdf#page=3)
   * This poll, like the one before it, shows higher levels of white vaccine resistance than Black (25% of Black folks don't want the vaccine, versus 25% of white folks).
* [https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/03/05/growing-share-of-americans-say-they-plan-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-or-already-have/](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/03/05/growing-share-of-americans-say-they-plan-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-or-already-have/)
   * This one is fun too. Here, you see 61% of Black folks saying they'll get the vaccine, versus 56% of Republicans. White folks are at 69% ""yes"" on the vaccine, and Hispanics are at 70%.
   * Interesting side note: this poll shows that, out of all ethnic groups surveyed, Black folks are the only group to actually have higher vaccine acceptance in March 2021 than in May 2020.

No, but cherry-picked. And if it hasn't been deleted yet, I already said somewhere above German taxes include many benefits and kickbacks you don't get with US taxes. 

&gt;Why would we care about stuff from the past?

You tell me.

&gt;are you serious, somebody smoking and poisoning other people is absolutely innocent? So if somebody gets robbed, shot or whatever on the street it was their fault for going outside in the first place? There's a good reason some countries have perfectly functioning smoking laws, Germany not being one of them. Typical German reaction.

Typical American hysteria and zealotry. Someone would need to smoke several packs a day right into your face for weeks before it has _any_ effect whatsoever on your health, and someone else having a drink somewhere has no effect on you at all. Plus, German smoking laws are functioning perfectly well, meaning: as intended, restricting smoking in public venues that are not designated for a smoking audience. 

&gt;Why would I need to bow to a drug user's preference having a smoke outside?

Because it's perfectly legal and none of your damn business, your personal desire for prohibition nonwithstanding, and no one lights a cigarette next to your hypothetical ""pregnant woman"", ever. 

&gt;This is about Germany. Look at the Netherlands, Switzerland, Australia. Lower taxes (or social contributions), but it works fine.

I never claimed Germany had the best system world-wide, but the elephant in the room is the US has pretty much none of it and doesn't work fine at all, or only for those who can afford to pay the exploitative medical fees. Again, combine low social security with high poverty rates, and you'll inevitably get more crime, violence, suffering, homelessness... and I really think all things considered, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Australia are all way better off on that matter.

That's not true. They're completely different technologies lol. A live vaccine has different risks than an adenovirus vaccine, for example. We are already seeing issues with AZ and J+J that don't seem to be risks of other Covid vaccines out there. 

Look, I got my Pfizer jab and was happy to do so. But for someone who is completely healthy and has no risk factors, the threat of Covid is almost 0. He perceives a new vaccine technology risk without full FDA approval to be a greater risk than a virus with a 99.7% survival rate. It's not illogical to think this way. 

There were papers written before Covid about theoretical risks of mRNA. EVERY vaccine has theoretical risks until it's been tested-long term. It's ludicrous to say otherwise. 

Check out this article in Nature from 2018. Read the Safety section of the Therapeutic considerations part. Theoretical risks, admittedly.

The problem is that doing real world studies is extremely hard because there are so many co-factors that go along with masking and it would be unethical to run a study where you deliberately compare the impact by exposing people to covid wearing a mask and not wearing a mask. 

Because of the difficulty of conducting real world studies about masks, there isn’t much real world evidence of mask effectiveness, so people have relied on modeling, meta-data (like the cdc comparison), and lab studies to measure the effectiveness of masking and mask mandates, which do show that masks (especially n95s and high quality masks) are effective in blocking droplets.

Mackinaw resident Shelly Shore Forrest is hoping to get the word out to others who may be suffering with the strange symptom, which is called parosmia. It can be a distressing surprise.  
  
“I picked up my device and Googled, so I found out pretty quickly that I wasn’t alone and wasn’t crazy,"" said Forrest. “There were all these other people having this experience, but most of us feel like there was no warning, no heads up, like, ‘Hey, this might happen.” Nobody tells us it’s going to turn into this terrible thing.”  
  
While the complete loss of taste and smell definitely presents challenges, parosmia may be even more distressing because the new odors can be so strong they induce nausea, said Forrest. Even cooking smells in the house can cause distress.  
  
“My daughter makes coffee in the morning, and the smell of that lingers in the house, and it’s a horrible smell — it's like living next door to a toxic-waste plant,” she said.  
  
Like many COVID-19 patients, Forrest lost her sense of taste and smell after being diagnosed in December. After recovering from the infection, her sense of smell eventually returned, and everything seemed fine. Then one day she noticed something strange.  
  
""Frequently, when I come home for lunch, I’ll slice up a red bell pepper and I’ll have that with something else,” said Forrest. “That was probably the trigger food that woke me up to what was going on — it tasted burned and moldy.”

INDIANAPOLIS — A blue card sat on the windshield of Josh Woolvin's black Hyundai Tucson on Tuesday, a spot of color in the sunshine at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. It signaled to nurses at this drive-by immunization clinic that Woolvin and his mother, Debbie Shipp, wanted Johnson &amp; Johnson's single-dose coronavirus vaccine, not their other choice, Pfizer-BioNTech's two-shot regimen.

Both selected Johnson &amp; Johnson for its one-and-done convenience, a preference that outweighed their concerns about the extremely rare blood clots that prompted a 10-day pause in use of the vaccine.
“I’d rather deal with the side effects than die” of covid-19, Woolvin said.

There is no government data yet on whether health authorities’ 10-day halt in administration of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine soured people on the product, and the company declined to discuss the matter.

In Germany, constitutional freedoms are two things, the right to act out the freedom without interference of the government, but also the protection against others to enjoy the freedom.

Each and every governmental action has to exist within this fight between the rights of these that should not be interferred by the government, and these that have a right of protection by the government.

In case of speech, the most common protective element is the human dignity, so the right of every person to be treated like a human and to be able to participate as equal in the society. Speech can impact this drastically if the narrative tries to deny certain groups their humanity because of who they are, not what they do. This directly denies the humanity of the group and their right to be part of the society as a whole. The duty of the Government is now to mitigate, to see where the necessity of free speech demands that there shall be no impact on what is said, and where the speech is so directly harming the rights of others, again, mainly the human dignity, that this right of others overrites the freedom of speech.

This constant struggle between freedom and protection is the main core of German constitutional, but also governmental law (basically every governmental action has to do this kind of consideration to be constitutional).",,,1619712975,{},gwb87gy,False,t3_n10dgc,False,True,t1_gwb6ds3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n10dgc/german_intelligence_puts_coronavirus_deniers/gwb87gy/,1619732843,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

(IMHO Canada intelligence works in interesting ways - very very quiet and subtle intelligence. Let the US and allies be in the spotlight. We have very pervasive and quite good intelligence methods for Canada and International and Canadians are passive enough and aligned with the government views enough that it works).  

Here is why.  ALso here is why this topic is so damn fascinating to me. 

I know a guy - a real dweeb of a guy. I haven't actually talked to him for 3+ years but he's a 'friend' on social media because Our sons played on top tier sports teams together a few times over the years.  

He's the dad who wasn't outwardly bad. He was refined enough to be tolerable but when it came time to hang out for a beer after the games at night nobody wanted him around because he's the slimy guy who comes across snobby and you know he's doing everything he can to angle his son into better playing time.  He's helping the coaches he's the team gopher and he's a suckass. 

Yes he's 'normal enough' that people have him as a friend on FB because we're all on the same team.  And since he's gotten himself into the team support staff we all have to tolerate him a bit more than we want to. 

Nobody would ever hang out with him though.  WHo would... shallow selfish guy just angling non stop.  

Owns a business that seems successful. Has money.  Has an 'above middle class' lifestyle and belongs to a private golf club.  And so he's not *dumb* - intelligent enough guy to talk to.  I guess my point is he went from 'normal enough dweeb to batshit deranged mental case in about 5 months.  Descent into madness. 

Last Spring he started posting anti-lockdown stuff.  Not raging lunatic stuff just a 'I'm trying to run a business' type news and videos.   This I can understand (but I'm all for lockdowns at the time and we are in one now that I'm all for but I digress...) since he's a business owner his livelihood is being threatened.   But around October last year his FB feed started going a bit odd.  He was talking a lot about the US election and using a lot of 'we' talk like he was in a group.  Again it wasn't so batshit crazy at the time because the US election news and the who (won't name him) scene in politics was nuts and it's all everyone talked about up here praying he didn't get re-elected. 

Except him - he started into the We need to make sure the world isn't taken over by (them was.... anyone but 'the guy).  

Then after the election the rails fell off.  He starts posting videos and links and 'news' (which are wingnuts pretending to be experts, or experts that are actual wingnuts) about Bill Gates committning Genocide and the vaccine is going to kill billions. 

Wierd shit he's posting like videos of 'journalists' uncovering 'facts' about millions of children are being locked in shipping containers and sent overseas by Hillary Clinton. 

In that time before Jan 6th he was posting several videos per day of how 'we need to take america back' crap (and remember... he's a born and raised Canadian... nothing reall to do with him ).  And one was quite interesting the video was calling for the military to take over. 

Then during all the bullshit ballot recounts and lawsuits he posted how 'we will win these lawsuits'.    Etc etc. We need a new US currency and we need the military to take over to have free elections again. 

Oh ya the earth is flat. 

FUnny thing is of the 500 or so FB friends - nobody actually has intervened or even commented on his wierd shit.  People are basically watching his descent into madness real time on social media and not giving a shit about the guy. He's a dweeb. 

But as I study the situation lately he's starting to likes on his posts by - generally - white guys aged 40-60. And he's turned now to an anti-trudeau theme.  

So I started reporting his stories to FB and his profile - only takes a click and I figured they'd remove them and maybe kick him off.  If his video forwards influence even 1 or 2 of his 500 'friends' that's bad. 

But FB ignores the situation and he's still up there spewing stuff every day. 

So we have a flat earther Q-spewing, (dork) obsessed 'take back the US at all costs including war' antivaxxer, covid denying CANADIAN.  

And frankly the guy's gone fucking nuts. I don't care about the guy at all he is irrelevant to me so I'm not actually going to engage with the guy. I would like to hear the dinner time conversations because his wife seems very intelligent and not likely to follow that path, and there are teenage kids at his house too.

## Abstract

### Background

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recently emerged coronavirus that is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 in humans is characterized by a wide range of symptoms that range from asymptomatic to mild or severe illness including death. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and is transmitted via the oral–nasal route through droplets and aerosols, or through contact with contaminated fomites. House flies are known to transmit bacterial, parasitic and viral diseases to humans and animals as mechanical vectors. Previous studies have shown that house flies can mechanically transmit coronaviruses, such as turkey coronavirus; however, the house fly’s role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission has not yet been explored. The goal of this work was to investigate the potential of house flies to mechanically transmit SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, it was determined whether house flies can acquire SARS-CoV-2, harbor live virus and mechanically transmit the virus to naive substrates and surfaces.

### Methods

Two independent studies were performed to address the study objectives. In the first study, house flies were tested for infectivity after exposure to SARS-CoV-2-spiked medium or milk. In the second study, environmental samples were tested for infectivity after contact with SARS-CoV-2-exposed flies. During both studies, samples were collected at various time points post-exposure and evaluated by SARS-CoV-2-specific RT-qPCR and virus isolation.

### Results

All flies exposed to SARS-CoV-2-spiked media or milk substrates were positive for viral RNA at 4 h and 24 h post-exposure. Infectious virus was isolated only from the flies exposed to virus-spiked milk but not from those exposed to virus-spiked medium. Moreover, viral RNA was detected in environmental samples after contact with SARS-CoV-2 exposed flies, although no infectious virus was recovered from these samples.

### Conclusions

Under laboratory conditions, house flies acquired and harbored infectious SARS-CoV-2 for up to 24 h post-exposure. In addition, house flies were able to mechanically transmit SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA to the surrounding environment up to 24 h post-exposure. Further studies are warranted to determine if house fly transmission occurs naturally and the potential public health implications of such events.",,,1619708567,{},gwaxm8x,True,t3_n16ard,False,False,t3_n16ard,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n16ard/mechanical_transmission_of_sarscov2_by_house/gwaxm8x/,1619726438,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Let’s assume that the entire cast and crew are still available and in the industry, many have left. They will all need to get back to speed with rehearsals for a few weeks. If they do need to restart that process will take longer.  

Every show goes through “previews” which are basically live rehearsals, almost ready for show but still tweaking things. This can take a week..

This is where you can bring in 'insignificance' to some extent, but we use clinical significance and CI, which, in a case where the sample size is inadequate, will be large and whatsmore I think you're using the term 'signifiance' loosely rather than in the usual way in which we use clinical significance (often aiming for p&lt;0.05) (please correct me if you were in fact suggesting that you think this is clinically significant). Also, for some odd reason, you've then decided to bring in ""wait till you see the size of the signal they used in the Pfizer study before applying for emergency use"" which is nothing to do with this article.

Adequate sample sizes work on a few things including the desired power of your study, population size, variance etc. You can't just pluck a number out and say ""this will do, that's enough to draw a significant conclusion from"".

*pp are* [*percentage points*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point)*, the arithmetic difference between today's percentage and a prior date.  For example, if a group was 55.0% today and 50.0% before, this is a 5.0 pp difference.*

The CDC indicates the data is by ""Date Administered"", but it actually appears to be by ""Date Reported"".
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC demographic data, so the tables do not match national totals.

The CDC is a bureaucratic agency that essentially wants you to live your life with zero risk.  The following are all **actual CDC recommendations**:

• **No sushi, ceviche, or raw shellfish.** ([“To avoid foodborne infection, do not eat raw or undercooked fish, shellfish, or food containing raw or undercooked seafood, such as sashimi, some sushi, and ceviche.”](https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/foods-linked-illness.html#shellfish))

• **No eggnog, homemade Caesar dressing, runny eggs, or eating raw cookie dough.**  ([“Avoid foods that contain raw or undercooked eggs, such as homemade Caesar salad dressing and eggnog. Cook eggs until the yolks and whites are firm. Do not taste or eat raw batter or dough.”](https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/foods-linked-illness.html#eggs)) 

• If you are at a restaurant, “**ask your server if they use pasteurized eggs** [in foods such as Caesar salad dressing, custards, tiramisu, or hollandaise sauce.](https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/communication/eatingout.html)” You know, like a sane person would do.

• **No rare steaks.** ([“Thoroughly cook poultry and meat.”](https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/foods-linked-illness.html#poultry))

• **Never cook *anything* – even in a microwave - without also using a food thermometer.** ([“Use a food thermometer to make sure food cooked in the oven or on the stove top or grill reaches a temperature hot enough to kill germs. . . When reheating, use a food thermometer to make sure that microwaved food reaches 165°F.”](https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/communication/food-safety-in-the-kitchen.html))

• **[Limiting alcohol intake to](https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm) “2 drinks or less in a day for men or 1 drink or less in a day for women.”**

• ""**Don’t swim or shower while wearing contact lenses** [because germs can be carried from the water into your eye.""](https://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/traveler-tips.html) 

• ""**Using a condom, dental dam or other barrier method every time you have oral sex** [can reduce the risk of giving or getting an STD.""](https://www.cdc.gov/std/healthcomm/stdfact-stdriskandoralsex.htm)  

• “**Make sure kids wear life jackets** [in and around natural bodies of water, such as lakes or the ocean, ](https://www.cdc.gov/safechild/drowning/index.html)**even if they know how to swim.**” 

• **Wearing reflective vests when walking at night.** ([“Increase your visibility at night by carrying a flashlight when walking and wearing reflective clothing, such as reflective vests.”](https://www.cdc.gov/transportationsafety/pedestrian_safety/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmotorvehiclesafety%2Fpedestrian_safety%2Findex.html')) 

• [“\[W\]hen in-line skating,](https://www.cdc.gov/safechild/falls/index.html) **use wrist guards, knee and elbow pads,** and a helmet.""


How many of the pro-lockdowners have been ordering in sushi, cooking rare steaks, and drinking multiple glasses of wine? They are careful to double-mask, but are they wearing reflective vests at night and making their kids who already know how to swim wear life jackets at the beach?

Plus, let’s not forget about all the *other* CDC precautions that do actually make sense, but **many people still do not follow**:


• [Preventing weight gain](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/prevention/index.html), [losing weight if you are overweight](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/losing_weight/index.html), and [staying in normal BMI range](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/index.html). 

•[ “At least 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity activity such as brisk walking. At least 2 days a week of activities that strengthen muscles.”](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/age-chart.html) 

• [Follow a healthy eating plan which “emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products” and “is low in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, salt \(sodium\), and added sugars.”](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/healthy_eating/index.html ) 

• [“Help children maintain a healthy weight by helping them develop healthy eating habits and limiting calorie-rich temptations. You also want to help children be physically active, have reduced screen time, and get adequate sleep.”](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/children/index.html) 

• [“Do not multitask while driving. Whether it’s adjusting your mirrors, picking the music, eating a sandwich, making a phone call, or reading an email―do it before or after your trip, not during.”](https://www.cdc.gov/transportationsafety/Distracted_Driving/index.html#prevent)

• [Don’t smoke.](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/index.htm?s_cid=osh-stu-home-nav-003)

•[ “Brush teeth thoroughly twice a day and floss daily between the teeth to remove dental plaque.  Visit your dentist at least once a year.”](https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/basics/adult-oral-health/tips.html)

• [Use condoms every time you have sex](https://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/teens/index.htm) and [regularly get tested for STD’s](https://www.cdc.gov/std/saw/talktesttreat/individuals.htm).  

• [Prevent opiod misuse.](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/patients/prevent-misuse.html)

*pp are [percentage points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point), the arithmetic difference between today's percentage and a prior date.  For example, if a group was 55.0% today and 50.0% before, this is a 5.0 pp difference.*

Notes:

* The raw data can be downloaded exact totals for every age group can be downloaded from the [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) as a CSV.  The CDC indicates the data is by ""Date Administered"", but it actually appears to be by ""Date Reported"".
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC demographic data, so the tables do not match national totals.
* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group. The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, assuming that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17.",,,1619727854,{},gwcam3q,False,t3_n0yt3d,False,False,t1_gwc3k25,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n0yt3d/daily_discussion_thread_april_29_2021/gwcam3q/,1619754169,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I've read almost every thread on this topic on various subreddits, social media etc . Generally speaking people are not claiming that dose 2 is ""totally safe"". That is not an oft-repeated claim here or really elsewhere.  it's not the consensus of the crowd.  To best of my knowledge no regulatory body or government official has claimed that either.

The oft made claim made is a more charitable one in context- that the incidence of VITT observed in connection with second doses (to date) have been ( at the time of writing) less common than post first dose incidence-  this was, and  still *is* backed up by evidence.  Anyone who made such statements are not lying, they're just reporting reflection of the statistics. 

 If the incidence changes based on vaccinating more younger cohorts with second doses, lagging reporting etc that's fine, guidance can reflect that- but that isn't what's shown yet, so naturally it's not right to claim the risk post second dose is confirmed identical to risk post first dose.  4 cases out of 4.4M per second dose is well within the background incidence and for now notably lower than equivalent post first dose development reported.",,,1619729413,{},gwcedoj,False,t3_n1brqe,False,False,t1_gwbzyh5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n1brqe/british_regulator_cites_41_more_blood_clot/gwcedoj/,1619756173,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It's preying on both a lack of knowledge of how the vaccine works and a lack of knowledge on how periods work in certain groups of people.

my experience is that 22 gauge is relatively small and can be painless, but it comes down more to luck and technique than the size of a needle. you would normally use a huge one (18 gauge) to draw the medication, as it makes it faster to draw the medication and easier to avoid air bubbles, then switch to a smaller needle.

i give myself leg injections and the first time i had no pain or bleeding, while every other time i've had pain, bleeding, soreness, etc. i am pretty bad at it though, as i have motor coordination issues and no medical training. the pharmacist or whomever will hopefully know what they are doing and make it fast and relatively painless, if not entirely painless.",,,1619647736,{},gw857yv,False,t3_n092bb,False,True,t1_gw80sam,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n092bb/daily_discussion_thread_april_28_2021/gw857yv/,1619671073,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
