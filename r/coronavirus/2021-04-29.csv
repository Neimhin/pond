I dont think thats quite right. 

mRNA carries genetic RNA instructions so that you body becomes a flu antigen factory. 

Current flu vaccines inject the already created antigen into you. So you get bits and pieces of flu without infection. Your body detects those pieces, but it dosent make them. 

With the flu mist, you actually get a mild flu infection that can only replicate in your nose, the virus can't live inside your body.",,,1619758478,{},gwe1ur9,False,t3_n16f75,False,True,t1_gwdwz3x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n16f75/flu_has_disappeared_worldwide_during_the_covid/gwe1ur9/,1619787724,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

effects on children are even less far along than in adults and the studies I have seen seem to come to conflicting results. We really don’t have a great sense of how likely kids are to get Covid in an unmasked world because they haven’t existed in that world at all. Schools are proving to be safe but schools also have many stringent mitigation strategies in place, including generally requiring masks. Youth sports are proving to be seemingly problematic from a spread standpoint. 

I live in an area that saw a measles resurgence a couple of years ago, and I had a child too young to be vaccinated at the time. It was really worrying to go out as a family. I would hate to return to that feeling again (and while the measles is much more dangerous than Covid to an vaccinated child, the risk of being exposed to Covid is exponentially greater than the risk of measles exposure during a brief resurgence due to people opting out of vaccines and letting herd immunity lapse). 

I don’t disagree that the number of immunocompromised people who can’t be vaccinated effectively is likely low.  I also don’t disagree with you that the risk of a variant developing in the US vs other countries is low. 

Where I disagree strongly is the idea that the benefit of stopping indoor masking in public in the short term outweighs any of the above harms.

The flu has to come from somewhere.  Usually the southern hemisphere has its bad season and brings it to the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.  Other countries don't have it as bad and travel is down.

Some percentage of people, even in the areas that are open, are adhering to guidelines to reduce spread.  Handwashing, sanitizer usage, and mask wearing is up everywhere.

The states that are ""open"" that I know of aren't fully open.  Take Florida, for instance.  Disneyworld is open, the Rays are playing in front of fans, Wrestlemania took place a few weeks ago.  But these are all at reduced capacity, around 20-40% of normal.

Flu usually has an R0 of around 1.5.  If the measures we've taken have reduced the spread by 50%, then the cases should decline.  If only by 33%, cases should remain steady.

The worst months for the flu are December - February.  Texas was the earliest state I recall saying they were opening everything up, and that was in March.  Even for areas where people ignored the guidelines and acted mostly as usual in February, there was reduced spread in December and January.  Typically February cases come from infections of people in January, who got infected by other people who got infected by other people in December, and so forth.  If there weren't a lot of infections in December or January, there aren't going to be many opportunities for infections in February and March.",,,1619758216,{},gwe1heh,False,t3_n16f75,False,False,t1_gwcc5jf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n16f75/flu_has_disappeared_worldwide_during_the_covid/gwe1heh/,1619787515,30,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

Right now public health officials are super excited for what medicine and public health will look like after COVID. 

1. Many countries have expanded public health coverage. 
2. Many nations have set up protocols for sharing medical research and disease surveillance. 
3. Companies and university research institutions as a result of covid are using software that makes it way easier for them to share and collaborate on research. 
4. Hospitals, research institutes, and governments now have way more gene sequencers than they used to and after covid they’ll be sitting idle, which is expensive so they’ll have to figure out some other use for them. 
5. The public is now much better informed on personalized medicine and gene sequencing and whatnot. 
6. There are several new vaccine technologies including mRNA that have received a ton of funding and will result in many other therapies. Vaccines don’t just have to be for viral or bacterial diseases. They can also be for genetic diseases. Teach your body to recognize and kill cancer.

The past 4 years have seen drastic cuts/elimination of research and filtering of research from the FDA and EPA in particular by politicians in the Trump administration.

Same happened in Brazil with Jair Bolsonaro. People getting fired because they are contradicting Jair on things like Covid and climate change/Brazilian Rain Forest.

Saying smart people are involved isn't a good enough reason to assume everything involving science is above board, because scientist usually aren't the ones with the most power.

Companies censor their own science to hide damning information about product safety. Tobacco and Oil industries come to mind. EPA and FDA come to mind when thinking about the Trump Administration.

Even the most well intentioned and honest scientist have gate-keepers, who twist and censor their research.

I'm not saying this is happening, but we live in a world where 1 shot of Pfizer could be effective, but Pfizer's CEO/board members/shareholders are pushing for 2 for profit.

I know enough now to know that's most likely not the case. But don't be so naive.

The data was adjusted to account for the differing ""risk"" each HCW (healthcare worker) experienced per-day due to the exposure of COVID in the hospital compared to the unvaccinated ""control"" group here (ie: HCWs that did not get the vaccine yet). IE: They've tried to account for the fact that some HCWs were just working days that they were more or less likely to get COVID anyway, whether they were immunized or not, based on the number of unvaccinated workers that contracted COVID.

CDC and many, many other official public health sources *still* recommend 6 foot/2 meter distance guidelines, which, if you haven't figured out yet, means they are operating under the assumption that COVID-19 is *not* airborne. It's instead droplet-transmitted. The study posted by OP makes it clear that is a mistaken assumption.

I think it's quite reasonable to argue that if the CDC and other public agencies are not setting guidelines to combat an *airborne* virus, then we shouldn't expect (or sarcastically admonish) people for not understanding that fact.

I was hoping this would help me. I got my Pfizer on Friday. Did some heave bag/boxing shit to try to get my arm working.

But it eventually caught up to me and muscle soreness worked it's way through me.

I had leg soreness for the past five days. And I'm paranoid about the blood clotting. And I had blood work and tests done for my body's autoimmune response in December. So I feel like it could be a heightened risk. But I'm probably nuts. But I'll live with that and advocate how I want for my body. 

Better than being vindicated and dead lol

NZ's COVID response was central, because they don't have a strong sub-national structure. So because the cnetral government led by their Prime Minister dictated a strong response, the entire country was protected.

Conversley, my country, Australia, the Federal Government's response to COVID was lacklustre. Instead, our state leaders, irrespective of political alliegence, were all very tough on COVID, imposing lockdowns and essentially eliminating community transmission. They they forced the Federal Government to agree to hotel quarrantine system to prevent inbound travelers reintroducing the community.

The Federal Government hated this so much that they supported a Federal Court case against one of our states (Western Australia) to force them to open their borders. This court case failed.

One suspects if the Australian Federal Government was more able to exert authority (eg. like NZ), we'd had an outcome like the UK.

The first community case in Hanoi after 73 days, patient 2911 lives in Viet Hung Commune, Dong Anh District. A truck driver, he has been to many places since coming in contact with patient 2899.

He met with patient 2899 from 8-10 p.m. at an eatery in Ly Nhan District in the northern province of Ha Nam.

The next morning he drove his own car to his home in Dong Anh District, where he came into contact with two family members.

From April 24 to April 28 he had come into contact with at least 10 people, nine in Dong Anh District and one in Me Linh District. On April 29, after learning that he had come into contact with an infected man, he reported to the local medical center and isolated himself at home. He tested positive the same day.

The building where he lives has been locked down with 21 people inside.

Patients 2912 and 2913, a 58-year-old grandmother and her 2-year-old granddaughter in the northern province of Hung Yen, are also linked to patient 2899. They came into contact with the man during a trip to Ha Nam between April 17-23.

Authorities have locked down their village, Hoang Xa, with more than 1,200 residents.
In the last 24 hours Vietnam has recorded nine new community cases after more than a month. Eight of the new cases are linked to patient 2899, who tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Ha Nam after completing his mandated two-week quarantine in Da Nang where he tested negative three times.

Emergency Use Authorization vs Full FDA approval was only done because we have not had enough time to study EFFICACY. 

#It has NOTHING TO DO WITH SAFETY.

&gt;But that's only because not enough time has passed to show how long the vaccines stay effective, Offit said.
""Frankly, the only real difference was in length of follow-up,"" he said. ""Typically, you like to see efficacy for a year or two years.""
But with Covid-19 vaccines, ""you couldn't do that. You couldn't do a one- or two- or three-year study ... because the virus was killing hundreds of thousands of people. So we wanted to get it out there.""
He stressed that the vaccines' EUA status doesn't mean they're less safe. As a member of the FDA vaccine advisory committee, Offit said the vaccines are reviewed with the same level of scrutiny as they would to get full approval.
Offit said he's confident the vaccines will get full FDA approval.

Covid isn’t a political position or a conspiracy. It may not have a big affect on you, but it may on the vulnerable people around you. You can still carry or transmit the virus to others if you are vaccinated, which is the whole idea of wearing a mask - it’s for other people.

Everywhere I’ve looked it says that the vaccine does not stop transmission of the virus and that’s why we need to maintain social distancing and mask wearing. Essentially what I have seen is the vaccine stops you from dying. That’s could be wrong I just have not seen anything say otherwise and am very open to be proven wrong. 

The virus does not really affect young people very much at all unless there very out of shape or have underlying health conditions, if they are not affected why is there a push for everyone to be vaccinated if they have no benefit too being vaccinated? I have heard that we need herd immunity, but if the people who are at risk have the vaccine why would we need it especially considering if we are all vaccinated the virus can still spread. 

As well as I know the risk of blood clot is insanely low, but so is the risk of dying as a young healthy person, why take the risk of the vaccine if there’s a possibility of blood clots?  

With talk of vaccine passports and whatnot, why would you need the vaccine to go places if you can still spread it like an unvaccinated person? What difference does the vaccine make to you if your odds of dying or being hospitalized were already astronomically low? 

I hope my questions make sense, no one I’ve talked to has been able to answer my questions so hopefully this can be cleared up for me.",,,1619805089,{},gwg8v44,False,t3_n1odmr,False,True,t3_n1odmr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n1odmr/daily_discussion_thread_april_30_2021/gwg8v44/,1619833118,-3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

So far it looks to me that in the UK there are at least 41 deaths linked to blood clotting and 209 cases of  clots with low platelet counts  after having recieved the Astrazeneca Vaccine. 

To put that in perspective the incidence of clots with low platelet counts is normally 120 in a whole year and deaths in adults from this condition would be at about 5% which is around 6 deaths a year.

So with that in mind in **just a few months** cases of low platelet clotting is almost double the national average and with 41 deaths that puts deaths at just over 20% of reported cases. Obviously some cases of clotting with low platelets may be unreported or not yet included in the figures that would bring that percentage down. 

I also could not find data on the long term effects of this condition only that it can be chronic and have an impact on longer term mortality even if it is not life threatening at the time. I don't know if the AZ vaccine induced low platelet with clotting (ITP) carries these risks.

I would just like to find detailed information an who is affected by this complication after vaccination, what the risks and mortality relating to the other vaccines are? Globally or in the UK.

&gt; That compares to a ban on Chinese nationals coming directly from China. In that older policy, anyone who wasn't a Chinese national could come directly from China and any Chinese national could come to the US via any other country.

&gt; anyone who wasn't a Chinese national could come directly from China

what?

&gt; As Azar explained when he announced the travel restrictions on Jan. 31, **the policy prohibits non-U.S. citizens**, other than the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, **who have traveled to China within the last two weeks from entering the U.S.**

This is pretty debatable. Many studies have shown it cuts transmission way down including a study from the CDC. But apparently these studies aren't convincing enough for some people who make public statements. If you read carefully they usually say something like ""we can't be sure that the vaccine reduces transmission"" as opposed to ""we are sure that the vaccine does not reduce transmission"". Like, they haven't proven it yet, so they don't actually know.

I agree with your point though that if it didn't reduce transmission, and you're at very little personal risk, then what's the point? But when you say something like this you're immediately criticized as ""anti vax"" or ""conspiracy theorist"" or ""Joe Rogan"" or whatever. But I agree it's just logic.

I feel pretty sure that the vaccine DOES reduce transmission very significantly and a lot of scientists and doctors agree, which is how virtually every other vaccine works.

Link please? Are you citing the one where they took a previous study and made questionable adjustments to the number to get it that high?

As for the actual number, the studies are all over the map:

The highest one I've seen is the CDC one. But the CDC's study showing 80% single-dose efficacy was tiny - about 4k participants (and they were young-ish healthcare workers).

The UK and Israel ran much larger studies (24k in the UK one, and a huge 1.2M in the Israeli one.) The UK found 72% efficacy three weeks after the first dose; Israel found 66%.

I figure we could be vaccinating twice as many people to achieve 80% effectiveness instead of 95%. 

Well, for starters, one dose probably doesn't have 80%+ effectiveness. 

 The highest one I've seen is the CDC one. But the CDC's study showing 80% single-dose efficacy was tiny - about 4k participants (and they were young-ish healthcare workers).

The UK and Israel ran much larger studies (24k in the UK one, and a huge 1.2M in the Israeli one.) The UK found 72% efficacy three weeks after the first dose; Israel found 66%.

Using the date for 90% of adults with dose 1, if all of them get a second dose 31 days later (1 month for Moderna), plus an additional 14 days for immunity to kick in, that will put us at a date of: Saturday, July 10th (- 10 days), for 90% of adults fully vaccinated.

Notes: 

* If the Pfizer EUA is expanded to age 12, the eligible population will be increased to 6,020,000+. I will also make the change for the MA total population to 7,029,917 (from 2020 census) at that time.
* (- n days) means it is n days later, further away, compared to the peak of 60,522 back on 4/14.",,,1619745969,{},gwdea6r,False,t3_n1coqf,False,False,t1_gwcol5h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n1coqf/us_administers_2374_mln_doses_of_covid19_vaccines/gwdea6r/,1619774838,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This is in response to the simple question of how the leadership behaves and whether any of this is reflected in death rates, not how the population behaves. For all the TV appearances and hoopla of Andrew Cuomo, Ron DeSantis ultimately did a better job protecting the elderly in a state disproportionately burdened with retirees. Understandably, New York was one of the first states to have to deal with the pandemic, and perhaps they can be forgiven for transferring infected people back into elder care homes, as monumentally stupid as that might now appear. 

Also, with respect to looking at the populations: Given that [obesity is a lot higher](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4692249/) in GOP counties, and possibly older Americans are more likely to vote GOP, the mortality rates will be strongly distorted by factors other than politically-linked compliance to leadership demands.

Do any of the current vaccines provide sterilizing immunity?

The answer is actually No. Therefore, this virus will continue to mutate via natural selection pressure regardless of vaccination status. Most likely at a rapid rate as the single strand nature of this RNA virus allows for rapid change and the advent of multiple strains to arise in just one individual - particularly those with weakened immune systems - and to spread quickly due to the aerosilized nature of this virus. 

To also throw some more water onto the hopium induced by vaccination - this virus appears capable and fit to survive in pretty much any mammal with ACE2 receptors.

The problem isn't the yellow card scheme, but uneducated misinterpretation of the data.

If you read the drug analysis print for [almost anything else](https://info.mhra.gov.uk/drug-analysis-profiles/dap-selector.html?agency=MHRA) and don't understand what you're looking at, you might assume that just about any drug causes death by all sorts of mechanisms that actually have nothing to do with it.

&gt; **There was over 685 fatalities post AZ 14 days ago in the UK that has not been investigated yet, than number is probably closer to double that amount now - in other words the 1/40.000 seems correct from NO/DE/DK.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Problem being that is much, much worse than C19 for anyone under 60**, as the deaths has been among healthy relatively young people. Also many more are having life altering sideeffects like non fatal brain hemorrhages.

Because all of this is total horseshit.

We have restricted the use of the vaccine as appropriate for patients who are low-risk for COVID-19 (currently the under 30s without other health conditions, may later be revised to the under 40s if case rates continue to decline and thus reduce the risk of infection).

So to run through a quick list of bullshit from your post:

1- No, that data isn't 14 days delayed, nor did they stop reporting it 14 days ago the vaccine analysis prints are published every Monday. The document has ""26th of April"" printed on every page.

2- No, those aren't ""fatalities that haven't been investigated yet"". Cases are not removed from the corresponding drug analysis print post investigation.

3- No, that isn't ""much, much worse than C19 for anyone under 60"". Covid-19 also causes blood disorders, and in the UK we've had &gt;6200 deaths in the under-60s age group, of which around 700 had no pre-existing conditions. At an estimated death rate due to CVST of roughly 1 death per 700,000 doses or so, COVID-19 is more than 10x more likely to lead to death in that age group, even by the most pessimistic interpretation of the data.",,,1619735450,{},gwcsaqf,False,t3_n1brqe,False,False,t1_gwcpf85,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n1brqe/british_regulator_cites_41_more_blood_clot/gwcsaqf/,1619763450,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The employee is one of the latest cases linked to China Airlines (CAL), a major carrier in Taiwan. He works as a housekeeping manager at Novotel Taipei Taoyuan International Airport, where many CAL flight crew members quarantine after returning to Taiwan.

Health and Welfare Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the CECC, said on Thursday that when a guest checks out of the hotel, their room is disinfected. Thirty minutes later, the room is cleaned by housekeeping staff and then checked by a manager.

""Based on this protocol, there is little chance he (the manager who tested positive Thursday) was infected through contact with contaminated surfaces,"" Chen said.

""We suspect that others (who work at the hotel) were infected first, and they infected the manager,"" he said.

As there could be a ""chain of infection"" within the hotel, with many areas contaminated, Chen said the CECC has decided to move roughly 400 staff members and hotel guests to government quarantine centers, where they will be tested for COVID-19.

The only exceptions are three employees at the hotel who have developed a fever and been sent to hospitals, as well as some pilots from foreign airlines who were staying at the hotel and are scheduled to depart Taiwan Thursday, Chen said.

Nearly all guests at the hotel are flight crew, of either CAL or foreign airlines. They stayed in one of the hotel's two buildings, with regular guests at the other building.

The manager, a Taiwanese man in his 40s, began to show symptoms of COVID-19 on April 17. He visited a clinic three times to seek medical attention from April 19-26.

On April 27, he went to a local hospital, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia, testing positive for COVID-19 on Thursday. The man has been in an unstable condition and is now in an intensive care unit, Chen said.

The CECC is investigating where he has been in the past two weeks.

In addition to the manager, two other cases related to CAL were reported on Thursday. One is the wife of a cargo pilot who tested positive for COVID-19 on April 20, the other a cargo pilot who recently returned from the United States.

Including these cases, the number of COVID-19 infections linked to CAL has increased to 16 over a 10-day period.

These include eight Taiwanese cargo pilots; three relatives of Taiwanese cargo pilots; a hotel employee; two Indonesian cargo pilots, one of whom was confirmed with COVID-19 in Australia; and two relatives of one of them.

The CECC has so far been unable to determine how the pilots became infected.

Chen did say, however, that six of the infected Taiwanese pilots had stayed at Novotel Taipei Taoyuan International Airport, and it is possible that they were infected while there.

The employee, in his 40s, developed symptoms on April 17 and sought treatment at a clinic three times between April 19 and 26, but his condition did not improve, the CECC said.

On April 27, he went to a local hospital, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia, and he tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday, the CECC said, adding that the patient is in an intensive care unit.

The man was a senior housekeeping employee at the hotel, in charge of checking the cleanliness of the rooms, and he also helped deliver items to the flight crews in quarantine there, according to the CECC.
The employee wore a mask and gloves while on the job, it added.

Three other employees at the hotel have developed fevers, and they are being tested for COVID-19, while all the other staff and hotel guests have been moved to government quarantine centers, the CECC said. (Update: Possible COVID-19 cluster probed at Taoyuan airport hotel: CECC)

The other new domestic COVID-19 case is a Taiwanese woman in her 40s, the wife of a CAL pilot who tested positive on April 20, the CECC reported.
The third case linked to CAL is a cargo pilot, who returned from the United States on April 25. The Taiwanese pilot, in his 50s, tested positive during quarantine after he developed symptoms of the disease.

With the confirmation of the three new cases Thursday, the number of COVID-19 infections linked to CAL has increased to 16 over a 10-day period.

According to the CECC, they are eight Taiwanese cargo pilots; three relatives of Taiwanese cargo pilots; a hotel employee; two Indonesian cargo pilots, one of whom was confirmed with COVID-19 in Australia; and two relatives of one of them.

So far, the CECC said, it has not been able to determine how any of the pilots became infected.

Besides the three new cases linked to CAL, Taiwan also reported two new imported COVID-19 infections Thursday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 1,121.

Of the total, 1,051 patients have recovered, 12 have died, and 58 are in hospital, according to CECC statistics as of Thursday.

Globally, COVID-19 has infected over 149 million people in 193 countries and regions, with more than 3.1 million fatalities, CECC figures show.

 [Q&amp;A: Are COVID-19 Vaccines Safe and Effective? (ucsd.edu)](https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/qa-are-covid-19-vaccines-safe-and-effective)  This gives a summary of how the vaccines work and answers the question about 'altering DNA'

 [mRNA vaccines, explained - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvA9gs5gxNY&amp;list=WL&amp;index=12)  This video Vox made is actually pretty good at explaining the vaccines and how they compare to other vaccines we have.

 [Can vaccines cause or spread diseases? | Northern Rivers Vaccination Supporters (nrvs.info)](https://nrvs.info/faqs/can-vaccines-cause-or-spread-diseases/)  This talks about vaccine shedding. In order for this to be a possibility, there has to be a live virus in the vaccine. mRNA and  adenovirus vaccines don't have live viruses, and the mRNA doesn't have any virus, so there's no way to 'shed'. The only evidence of vaccinated people shedding and infecting others was with the oral polio vaccine back in the 1950s, and we don't use that anymore. If your family is still concerned, the mRNA would be perfect for them as there is no virus to 'shed.'

I have a vaccine hesitant family member as well. Not full blown anti-vax but tells me she just doesn't trust the vaccine. I've offered to show her things to explain it but she doesn't want to hear it. There's nothing more I can do, at this point it's up to her. Hopefully seeing everyone else get it will push her in the right direction.",,,1619735052,{},gwcrfuj,False,t3_n0yt3d,False,True,t1_gwcbif8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n0yt3d/daily_discussion_thread_april_29_2021/gwcrfuj/,1619762984,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

From a purely self-interested point of view, young people willing to live with some level of risk to their lives can rationally and correctly decide to decline the vaccine. 

Consider that Singapore has had 61,086 cases (which the Ministry of Health admits is an underestimate for various technical reasons) but only about 30 deaths. A risk of 0.05% is very low compared to other risks in life, like eating sugary foods or smoking. By comparison, Singapore also has very safe roads, with only about 120 to 160 fatalities per year -- so &gt;4 times more dangerous than COVID, but nobody is paranoid about driving because with a population of 5.7 million, this still ranks low on the list of risk factors. The reason for the low COVID deaths in Singapore is because the infections have disproportionately affected migrant construction workers, and these workers span 20 to 40 years old, with an average age of 30, and are all super-fit and get plenty of sunshine.  Rogan is not wrong to say that from a purely self-interested point of view, it's reasonable for healthy, fit, young people to let everyone else get vaccinated but decline it for themselves. 

However, from a disease dynamics point of view, everyone should get vaccinated, including children.

The matter, considered controversial, was much debated between parliamentarians, the Presidential Palace, in addition to companies and countries that produce immunisers.

&gt; Despite the attempts of agreement, the government leadership in the House was against the approval of the bill, while most parties released their parliamentarians to vote the way they wanted. Now, the text will be analyzed by the House of Representatives before coming into force. 

&gt; The project intends to facilitate Brazil's right to manufacture immunizers against the coronavirus. According to the text, authored by Senator Paulo Paim (PT-RS), will be allowed, in addition to temporary patent breaking of vaccines, the manufacture of diagnostic tests and drugs of proven effectiveness against the disease, while the state of health emergency. With this, the matter intends to release the production of immunizers, medicines and inputs, ""without the need for observance of industrial property rights"". 


&gt; The report by Senator Nelsinho Trad (PSD-MS) names the breaking of patents for the production of vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants, as well as its active ingredients and any inputs, inventions or utility models necessary for its production, and the medicine Remdesivir. Trad changed the original text and made it clear in the substitute that collective negotiations with other nations and international organizations will be up to the Executive, which ""should continue to send efforts in order to enable international cooperation to enable universal access to pharmaceuticals, vaccines and therapies needed to combat the coronavirus.

&gt; According to the text approved in the Senate, patent owners must make available to the government all information necessary for the effective reproduction of protected objects, and the government must ensure the appropriate protection of this information ""against unfair competition and dishonest commercial practices.

&gt; In addition, the government must publish, within 30 days of the publication of the law, the rules to be followed by companies that will manufacture vaccines and medicines after the patent is broken.",,,1619742657,{},gwd7a7n,True,t3_n1iaur,False,False,t3_n1iaur,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n1iaur/brazil_senate_passes_a_bill_that_allows_breaking/gwd7a7n/,1619771201,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The reason it’s taking them longer to compile data is because they’re including real world data from the UK.  None of the other approved vaccines in the US have done that - because there were no real world shots done at that point when they were approved back in Nov!

It’s like saying it takes longer to write a full thesis rather than a one page abstract. Duh, obviously it’s going to take longer, there’s a lot more data included.

For the record, I am all for a thorough evaluation and especially using the real world data now that we have it. But I think these AZ haters really should check their own bias. The FDA approval isn’t important for Americans and other wealthy countries - but it sure as hell is important for emerging markets who cannot afford the expensive mRNA vaccines (which are for profit vs AZ at cost) and the symbolic confidence boost from the FDA would be welcomed.

People always add this qualifier about how the discussion is only about outdoors, but I don't see why.  

I'm far from an anti-masker, I've worn my mask religiously ever since it was advised to do so, and I still wear one today.  But I don't see why we still seem to be so far removed from talking about removing masking requirements from indoors too.  Every piece of science I've seen indicates that vaccinated people don't need to worry about catching or spreading covid in any environment, indoor or outdoor. 

As of 10 days ago, every adult in this country can get a vaccine if they want one.   So your choices as an adult now number at 3: get a vaccine and do whatever you want, don't get a vaccine and never go into a building again, or don't get a vaccine and do whatever you want but you're going to catch covid.

Ha almost the same exact thing except my chills came exactly 10 hours after the shot not 11. Zero side effects up to that point in the day.

I was still awake and could feel it coming, if you've had chills before you know a little tiny temperature swing can set it off but sometimes you can tell you're on the edge of getting them. I felt like that so I went to the bathroom and grabbed the Tylenol just in case. It was a little colder outside my room and by the time I got back to my bed I had to get under the blankets to get them under control. Nothing unmanageable but they would be annoying if you didn't have covers, like I could still enjoy watching my shows but there was some shaking.


That lasted for awhile then mostly went away after a couple of hours. Aside from that I had a fever the next night and popped 2 more Tylenol and it broke fairly quickly. after 48 hours everything was back to normal, no arm pain or anything.

Here’s more from the source that you have provided: 

&gt;	Speaking at the webinar organised by the Department of Biotechnology, Dr. Singh said there was also a **rise in the Indian variant** (B.1.617), that has two mutations associated with increased efficacy and decreasing the potency of vaccines.

&gt;However while the relative proportion of known variants of concern, or VoC, (the U.K., South Africa, Brazil variants) is around 11%, **investigations were still on to determine to what extent they were responsible for the severity of disease.**

400,000 people for farmers protests OVER 6 months.

&gt;As of April 17. Today it’s April 30. Also, that 5037 number is among those who have been tested. It doesn’t mean that Kumbh in its entirety only affect 5K people. The actual number will shock us all if they tested all.

Guess what, you don't even have a single source showing how many people were infected with COVID because of the farmers protests

&gt;Dude are you stupid? I asked for your source and all you did was link a COVID cases tracker from NDTV. You just claimed that Kumbh only contributed 15% of total cases and you still do not have an iota of proof for the same. You also conveniently missed the fact that Kumbh’s effect will be shown in upcoming days. It doesn’t show up immediately but will be seen in the coming week

Math too hard for you? You want a scientific paper to help you divide two numbers multiplying them by 100?? Also a COVID tracker is still a better ""source"" than mashable lmao, we're talking about a pandemic, not paper mache craft. Go back to blogging.

((1217952(all time cases in UP) + 810955(all time cases in WB)) / 18762976(total cases till now in India)) * 100 = 10.813%

Kind of like if you get chickenpox at a young age your immune system remembers how to fight it and will likely fight off future infections.

The exception would be if you work with vulnerable people. Those are at risk of covid and other diseases, even when they are vaccinated. And there is a certain percentage of the vulnerable, that are so vulnerable, they can’t even get the vaccine. So health care workers should be required to get the vaccine. 

But if you’re working in IT for example? I really don’t think that’s necessary, and it would reduce your personal freedom. The chances of getting sick after having the vaccine are veeeery small. And even without requiring vaccination, there will be enough people that are immune from infection &amp; non mandatory vaccination that herd immunity will kick in.

I used to enjoy his podcasts for the guests he has on because he really curated a very interesting and educated group of scientists but his personality is so intolerable. He is seemingly very insecure because he often talks over and around his guests without absorbing their information if it conflicts with his narrative or pre-formed opinions. I find it incredibly difficult to listen to because joe conflates his knowledge of the issue with a professional who’s dedicated decades of their career towards this specific area of research as if they are intellectual peers. Sorry Joe, reading a few articles (and maybe a book or two on certain topics) doesn’t make you the equal of your guest - LET THEM TALK! 

It’s especially ironic because he often talks about how he believes the whole world should microdose on hallucinogens because it suppresses the ego and would make people better. He’s disproving his own thesis because he uses hallucinogens regularly and his ego is anything but in check. Based on how often he interrrupts his guests to be heard, he needs to assert his ego and “expertise” constantly and challenge expert opinions formed after years of experience and research. It’s almost laughable. 

His level of insight is extremely flawed and I believe dangerous given his influence. He clearly has substance use issues and drinks and uses drugs frequently including kratom which he has personally invested in. He talked about taking four times the recommended dose and getting high which isn’t shocking since it acts on opioid receptors.

&gt;Are they the same antibodies and memory cells from natural infection + vaccines or are they different?

Depends on the vaccine, and we kinda don't fully know, but it's not that important. Your immune system prefers to rely on existing immunity that already works before making new kinds of immunity. I'm not sure about memory cells, but I think there are new ones generated for each antibody form. 

&gt;Do the natural antibodies take over?

False dichotomy here, there aren't ""natural"" and ""unnatural"" antibodies really, though I suppose you could call monoclonal antibodies administered as a drug ""unnatural"". The spike antibodies from the vaccine are mostly identical to what you would have generated for the spike from an infection (with very minor differences due to whichever parts of the spike are changed VS original Wuhan isolate in whichever variant you caught). Antibodies for the neucleocapsid are only from infection or certain vaccines (that aren't available in the US). I've heard discussions on /r/covid19 and on TWiV about how our immune systems seem to really like to make neucleocapsid antibodies. This may be related to previous coronavirus infections. 

Do they ""take over""? Well, no. They may in some cases ""do more of the work"" neutralizing viral particles, but I don't think they like displace each other really. Maybe they won't be produced as much later on. Neucleocapsid antibodies won't ""take over"" for sure, they are non-neutralizing. If you get infected with a variant that has a lot of changes on the spike compared to the original Wuhan virus spike, newer antibodies from the breakthrough infection will likely be much more effective. 


&gt;Does this have any effect on how long antibodies from vaccines may stick around?

It probably makes them last longer. People who were infected and then recovered and then vaccinated had crazy high numbers of antibodies. They will wane over time, but will be made again quickly as soon as you get another exposure.",,,1619804094,{},gwg6jmx,False,t3_n1odmr,False,False,t1_gwg2vh9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n1odmr/daily_discussion_thread_april_30_2021/gwg6jmx/,1619831852,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I’d like to know how big of a “problem” he thinks it could be. At that point we would have a whole year of adult GenPop vaccination under our belts and almost half a year of children/teen vaccination plus whatever boosters they come out with and distribute around that time. 

I would rate a problem as what we had this last winter or what we are seeing in Brazil and India which have much lower rates of vaccinations. I just don’t see that happening with our vaccination process. We might see an increase in cases but that should be expected and shouldn’t really result in restrictions being put back into place.

&gt; Angeles County is set to hit a milestone in COVID-19 vaccinations that no one is happy about.

&gt; For the first time, the county will not reach its goal of administering 95% of its weekly supply, officials said this week. The reason: Appointments for the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine have decreased by about 50%.

&gt; Health experts and officials have attributed the drop to a variety of reasons, including ongoing hesitancy around the vaccine and access issues.

&gt; . 

&gt; Countywide, officials said about 18% of residents have missed their second-dose appointments. Demand has also dropped across the state and the country.

&gt; . 

&gt; While transmission, hospitalizations and deaths related to COVID-19 remain low throughout the state and in L.A. County, health experts have said that ongoing vaccinations continue to be key in the fight against the virus. But a vaccination rate of 100% is unlikely, experts have said, and getting the remainder of unvaccinated eligible residents to get a shot could take some time.

I don’t understand your objection to me saying that the mRNA vaccines offer a more limited view of the virus. They do. It’s one spike protein versus all the other antigens that are present in inactivated vaccines, such as the N protein (which is less effective but nevertheless). 

Efficacy wise yes mRNA vaccines are vastly superior to inactivated vaccines produced by China. Clearly the cellular approach leveraged by mRNA is excellent. However—these are two different technologies that require independent trials to confirm efficacy.

The S protein is the most significant site for antibody binding and was selected for targeting for that region. Other antigen sites on the virus have been shown to only make minor contributions to antibody sensitivity. 

Covaxin has also been shown to be less effective in trials than any mRNA vaccine 

1. The reasoning you are presenting for Covaxin being more durable is not valid (as we’ve seen with Chinese vaccines). Even so many vaccines for other viruses using an inactivated virus approach require more significant boosting compared to other types.

Its much easier to get people to keep following your policy if you dont issue caveats and new information that cools people's perspectives down. If the CDC had come out originally and said ""you don't need a mask outside, and there are few if not no lab-confirmed surface transmissions"" then it's a lot harder to keep everyone at 100% effort if the veneer of an apocalyptic disease sheds away.

Look, people here will defend the CDC and die on the  hill for it, but fact is their messaging has changed and shifted and not always been honest. So when you dont see the CDC telling you these things, it's not because they didn't know (these are the top virologists in the world), its because they chose not to tell you.

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

Reporting to the State President and officials from the Health Ministry and the city, leaders of the Da Nang Hospital for Lung Diseases said the hospital has done a good job of treating COVID-19 patients, noting that it is currently providing treatment for 58 patients, 14 of whom have tested negative for the virus thrice.

Secretary of the Da Nang Party Committee Nguyen Van Quang said the city will upgrade this hospital so as to better meet the need for medical examination and treatment, including for COVID-19 patients.

President Phuc pointed out very high risks of coronavirus transmission since the pandemic is developing complicatedly around the globe while Vietnam shares a long borderline with some countries hit hard by the pandemic, and it is also intensively integrating into the world.

Applauding Da Nang’s anti-COVID-19 measures, he stressed that as it is a major tourism hub with a large number of visitors and hundreds of fully booked flights, the city as well as big municipalities like Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hai Phong, and Can Tho must stay ready to take actions if there are any new cases.

He repeated the spirit of “fighting the pandemic is like fighting an enemy” and told the Ministry of Health and Da Nang to combat the disease in the strongest manner like what have been done in the recent past.

That the health sector must stay ready in any circumstance and exert all-out efforts to maintain the obtained achievements and prevent the disease from returning, the leader said, warning that a health crisis would lead to an economic crisis.

The President also demanded expanding the vaccination to more groups while continuing to import vaccines so as to proactively prevent new outbreaks.

In Hanoi, after two people having direct contact with Patient 2911, who works at Thang Long Industrial Park and was confirmed on late April 29, tested positive for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 once, local authorities have been taking prompt actions.

Vice Chairman of the municipal People’s Committee Chu Xuan Dung on April 30 asked leaders of Dong Anh district and Thang Long Industrial Park to swiftly trace contacts of the two suspected cases, and that if these suspected cases are confirmed, contract tracing must be completed by 5pm on April 30.

He demanded relevant sector and Dong Anh district make drastic efforts to curb the transmission, increase examination, and fine any person ignoring disease prevention and control measures.

Patient 2911 earlier had close contact with Patient 2899, who finished his quarantine period after arriving in Vietnam and returned home in northern Ha Nam province but then was found to be positive for the virus.

Meanwhile, Ho Chi Minh City decided to temporarily close bars, karaoke parlours, and discos from 6pm on April 30 after one case of COVID-19 was recorded in Binh Tan district.

The new patient in HCM City, No 2910, was confirmed on April 29 afternoon. Earlier, this patient also met Patient 2899.

As of April 30 morning, Ha Nam province had recorded two more COVID-19 infections and one suspected case linked with the hotbed in Dao Ly commune of Ly Nhan district, raising the total cases there to seven.

During the night of April 29, local authorities collected samples for COVID-19 testing from the 1,068 residents in Quan Nhan hamlet of Dao Ly commune, where Patient 2899 resides.

The Health Ministry also sent experts from the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology to help the province with testing and contact tracing./.",,,1619799882,{},gwfwlud,True,t3_n1xgf4,False,True,t3_n1xgf4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n1xgf4/vietnam_state_president_demands_maximum_efforts/gwfwlud/,1619826395,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Ultimately you're designing a vaccine that's targeting a specific protein. The more variations there are in that protein, the more complicated it is to neutralize them all. So reason stands that if you let COVID continue to mutate in millions and millions of new hosts, you're increasing its biological diversity and making the surface vaccines must target much broader and thus, more difficult.

Now maybe it really will be that all the mutations that come along are easily defeated. Maybe also enough people will have antibodies from natural infection or vaccines for COVID to just fade away.

I believe that the odds of either thing are very very low for young and healthy people. Depending on how you define ""young"" and ""healthy"", like a 15-40 year old person in good health with no health conditions is probably at something like a one in a million chance of dying from covid, [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/covid-19-comorbidities-are-the-elephant-in-the-room-7d185bd6cfe2) is one source.

The chance of getting side effects from J&amp;J is statistically close to the same, 1 in a million, and of Pfizer and Moderna probably even lower.

So people are weighing two things that have a one in a million chance. It's actually kind of hard to make a rational decision about it.

But, for most people it isn't the risk of getting injected with covid vs. getting injected with the vaccine. You may or may not get covid. If you go to a vaccine center you're definitely getting the vaccine. So your odds of dying from covid are only relevant if you actually get it, and you most likely won't get it, so the actual odds are even lower.

From this perspective, I hate to say it but Rogan has somewhat of a point. The odds are very low and you probably aren't changing your own personal safety very much by getting the vaccine. You would be helping society in a small way because you'd reduce that very small chance of you getting it and spreading it.

But the risk of covid has always been heavily concentrated in a small group of people (elderly with health conditions). The day is coming relatively soon when covid will just be something that we live with, probably forever, because we'll never get rid of it. It's most important to protect those that are the most vulnerable.",,,1619812982,{},gwgq9wl,False,t3_n1odmr,False,False,t1_gwglhsw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n1odmr/daily_discussion_thread_april_30_2021/gwgq9wl/,1619842532,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

What strikes me is what seems like a complete lack of urgency to end lockdowns and resume normal life. And the consequences of the lockdowns are very real.

There has been no long term, by definition. Sometimes people have long term effects from any illness. Maybe because of an underlying health condition or poor treatment or who knows what. Sure we can worry about all kinds of things but this just seems like worrying about the boogeyman.

I agree with your original point that Rogan is saying what a lot of people are thinking but getting criticized for it. There are people freaked out by the idea of taking a brand new vaccine. I personally am not one of them but part of me cannot blame them. And they are adults and can make their choice.

There are also people that think that they are young and healthy and probably won't get covid and even if they do it won't be a problem for them. I will admit I am one of these people. Once I saw who it was affecting I have not been the least bit worried about getting it myself for over a year. I know people that got it and recovered without a problem. Yes I understand that it is not ""just the flu"" but I was just never worried about it.

So I get where he is coming from. Unfortunately as a public figure he is indirectly encouraging people to not get the vaccine. On one hand sure it would be great if 100% of people took it. On the other that was always a dream. No vaccine has ever been taken by 100% of people and even 70% or 80% would be really good.

The more likely connection is that big, diverse countries are hard to govern and prone to social division, which leads to dissatisfied populations electing leaders who have tough guy personas (despite largely making libertarıan policy decisions). Big countries almost invariably have the most shocking case and death numbers for reasons that should be obvious. Unfortunately, that analysis doesn't allow for the same kind of political point-scoring.

An *actual* autocratic regime (as opposed to merely having a leader who LARPs as a dictator) is a massive advantage during a pandemic. They can do things that democracies can't do. Likewise, if any leader wanted to take full control and crush their opposition, a pandemic is the perfect opportunity to do so.

EDIT:

Another factor is that socially divided countries tend to have populations where people don't trust each other, which leads to people displaying the kind of selfish attitudes that we've seen in the US over the last year.",,,1619816497,{},gwgxond,False,t3_n2311f,False,True,t3_n2311f,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n2311f/autocratic_nationalists_are_struggling_to_deal/gwgxond/,1619846491,4,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That 100% evolved later to people dismissing the risk once it was an established monster and downplaying this virus and equating it to nothing more than the flu. 


But i think it’s just fair to acknowledge that at first it was just a way for people to not panic. Because it was really terrifying at first and nothing was making sense and everyone was trying to rationalize as a means of coping. 


Also, for a long long time many people truly did not realize the annual devastating impact of the flu, so some of those early quotes as well I think was bringing attention to our health systems ability to manage that disease on an annual basis without society collapsing. 

Anyways I’m not at all saying this is “just the flu” I am well aware.

2.

The problem really is that our incredibly incompetent government denied to sign a contract with Pfizer last August, gravely delaying our vaccination program and putting us in this horrible situation we are now.

Also, to OP: lower quality is a simplification of the chinese vaccine. Sinovac, for example, is an inactivated vaccine, so it was expected to have lower efficacy, but with sufficient vaccination, it could too lead us to herd immunity, and at least we are seeing signs of mortality reduction in the elderly, which is for now a much more important metric than efficacy against symptomatic infection.

The overall numbers have plateaued, but if the UK variant is still shrinking and the Indian one is rising, there could come a point where that one just continues to go up and up and up with the measures we currently have in place. That's exactly what happened originally with the November lockdown--the original variant shrank away, and the UK variant increasing in its share of infections was the first sign that it was spreading much faster and overtaking restrictions.

That said, the case they make for that here is VERY speculative and not especially strong, and certainly doesn't suggest that vaccinated people are in more danger of infection or severe disease. Of the two UK papers we most often see in here talking about covid, the guardian is the one that often overblows risks and scare stories about covid (while conversely the telegraph downplays covid and has overblown scare stories about restrictions). It's best to sort of look at what they're both saying and then wait for more scientifically backed sources, really. Might be a problem, but I suspect it *probably* won't be.

&gt;The community exposure of each date was calculated as the sum of multiplications of the number of national newly detected cases in each day in the previous 18 days by probability of COVID-19 positives getting infection in each of 18 days before day of detection.

That seems wrong, because community spread would not be even throughout the entire nation. Certain areas of the country accounted for most of the cases, actually (lower income and certain ethnic and religious groups).  But this was at one particular spot, Sheba Medical Center.  Why aren't they using just the area around there?

I like that they are trying to take additional factors into account, but I don't think that this was a correct way to do it.

And on top of that, there are 4 other things:

1. their adjusted numbers are a fairly large outlier when it comes to the other studies on it, while the unadjusted numbers are not; and
2. the sample numbers are small.  When it is 11 people with symptomatic cases, the swing from a lucky case or two is pretty large.
3. Because of #2, the confidence range is gigantic.  The 95% confidence level is 71% to 92%, 72% to 84% for the adjusted ones, and 52% to 87% and 38% to 74% for the unadjusted ones.

Don't mind mate but your comment just had me recalling some info I must have read years ago in regards to a study. But the general gist from what I recall was along the lines of it being entirely debatable that those who compete, or are considered to be in that 'elite' athletic group are actually any more healthy than the 'normal' active adult. 

It's was a bit like an F1 engine, being it's so highly tuned and dialled in, something like a squirt of lower grade fuel that would merely cause a hiccup for your standard mass produced engine will instead be highly catastrophic. An Olympic athlete in that final month of preparation will be so finely tuned in order to perform at the best of the their abilities, that they're teetering on the edge of catastrophic failure with an immune system that's so highly strung, it's highly susceptible to any cold, flu germs etc at which stage their body just doesn't have the reserves it needs to fight them off as easily as it would for the normal active adult.

His excuse is that they had no evidence ""outside of a hospital setting"" that masks were effective. Ok, let's take that as true. If they are effective in a hospital setting, why would you tell people they shouldn't wear them? Telling people they aren't effective but they're free to do it is one thing, he literally said you shouldn't wear one. On top of that there was clear evidence that mask wearing was effective at the time. He lied.

He lied becuase he had a paternalistic view that he couldn't tell the truth - there weren't enough masks - without Americans hoarding them away from healthcare workers. So instead of saying ""don't buy masks, make them"" he said ""don't wear masks"".

And that date is anticipated to be before fall classes start, so schools are doing it preemptively. I'm not sure how common the knowledge that FDA approval is on the horizon is in the general population.
2. You have your crowd of ""it's too new, we don't know the long term effects!"" which ok, fair, I see your point. However, mRNA vaccine tech isn't new, so we at least have some data on effects of that. We're also starting to get evidence of the long-term effects of COVID and honestly, I'll take my chances with the vaccine, assuming COVID doesn't kill me. And yes, some vaccines have had some *rare* effects that weren't seen previous to mass roll-out (looking at you J&amp;J), but I put emphasis on the word rare. We also don't have data on long-term efficacy. Which we can't because this is an ongoing event, so unfortunately we just have to find that out as we go. Which is why the companies are preparing for boosters. Just in case so we can hopefully avoid a supply bottleneck when or if we need them. 
3. Anti-vaxx culture is alive and well. So is denier culture. Many of us have the unfortunate experience of finding out how many of our close circle belong to one or both of these groups. So long as that's alive and well, anything COVID or vaccine will be a ""big deal"". We already have seen how much of a deal they make out of vaccines with DECADES of research and efficacy data behind them. This is no different.

The optimal point in time to start restricting travel is at positive inflection points - when cases stop falling and start rising; not when they're already astronomical. And even then, the resulting hurried repatriation flights will cause their own superspreader event unless you are absolutely sure to quarantine everyone you repatriate. Or just not have repatriation flights, which is entirely illegal, immoral, and inhumane.

Beyond that, quarantine at national boundaries is entirely futile. It's sort of like trying to separate the hot and cold oxygen atoms in a room by just putting up a divider between the two halves. Remember:

 * You don't know *who* is sick
 * You *do* know that there *are* novel variants in India and not in the US

And why aren’t they factoring in natural immunity into the herd? All I see is this push for vaccines when nature has a way of taking care of things. I get that there are lasting effects for some survivors of Covid, but we don’t yet know the long term effects of these vaccines- and before anyone tells me that typically there are no long term effects, keep in mind that this is new technology and not your traditional vaccine. I don’t like this wait and see approach, nor do I like the coercion and manipulation to put this in our bodies. Something is wrong here. 

Also, studies have shown antibodies in covid survivors up to 8 months after infection.

With vaccinations slowing down over the past couple of weeks and the 7-day average of new cases down over 80% from their peak, I'm going to reduce updates next week to around four times a week. I feel daily updates are becoming less useful as first dose vaccination rates converge for age groups between 18 and 64.  Daily posts by others will continue to monitor overall vaccination progress.

Daily demographic statistics are still available from the [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends).

It appears likely that at least one vaccine will be approved for those aged 12 to 15 in May. This will make about 17 million or 6% more people eligible for a vaccine. After this occurs, the 16-17 year old and 16+ categories will be adjusted.

The CDC indicates the data is by ""Date Administered"", but it actually appears to be by ""Date Reported"".
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC demographic data, so the tables do not match national totals.
* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group. The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, assuming that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17.",,,1619807555,{},gwgegwk,False,t3_n1odmr,False,False,t1_gwg8kzr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n1odmr/daily_discussion_thread_april_30_2021/gwgegwk/,1619836174,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

But, let's point out the other side of the coin real quick:

&gt;If multinational corporations or governments forbid you from buying/selling or traveling because you want more data before you make a medical decision

Accepting the risk of a contagious pathogen is also a medical decision.  So, yeah, there's loads of people who want more data on the long term effects of COVID.  ""There’s no data on the long term effects on fertility of *COVID-19*"". 

So, back to my original sentence:

&gt; ""Ostracized"" might be a powerful word, but, no, we shouldn't be accepting the argument that there is a legitimate concern regarding fertility here because there isn't.

I'm saying, I don't think we should ostracize them, but we should absolutely be telling them that this is not a legitimate fear.

Now, I will say, my thoughts regarding ostracizing people are because I believe we will achieve some semblence of herd immunity.

From the article:
&gt; If an employer requires its employees to be vaccinated, adverse reactions to the vaccines are considered “work-related” by OSHA. Employers who require COVID-19 vaccines must notify OSHA within 24 hours of an employee’s inpatient hospitalization (or within eight hours of an employee’s death) resulting from an adverse reaction.
&gt; 
&gt; For employers subject to OSHA’s recordkeeping requirements, if the adverse reaction meets other general recording criteria (e.g., days away from work, restricted work or transfer to another job, or medical treatment beyond first aid), the reaction must be recorded on the employer’s OSHA 300 log, even if it does not lead to hospitalization. For example, if an employee uses a sick day because of fever and chills following administration of the vaccine, the reaction must be recorded. On the other hand, if an employee merely requires over-the-counter medication to ease soreness at the injection site, the action need not be recorded.
&gt;

&gt;It's true that the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines have emergency use authorization from the FDA and not full approval yet.

&gt;But that's only because not enough time has passed to show how long the vaccines stay effective, Offit said. 

&gt;""Frankly, the only real difference was in length of follow-up,"" he said. ""Typically, you like to see efficacy for a year or two years.""

Instead of trying to kill the messenger maybe public health officials should actually address what is being said.

A lot of young healthy people are being told that their risk to getting serious covid is low and that there's a chance for serious side effects if they get the vaccine. When they hear this they don't think getting the vaccine is worth it, regardless of how it could benefit to society. Not many people are willing to take personal risk for the greater good.

The truth there is a huge personal benefit to getting the vaccine regardless of age.  Its not even close.  The risk of dying or having long term symptoms from covid is much higher than the risk of serious adverse reaction from the vaccine, even when young and health.  There are professional athletes, who are healthier than the average bear, who have caught covid months ago and still have shortness of breath.

But maybe you think you can avoid covid long enough for ""herd immunity"". When you factor in the high likelyhood that corona will become endemic(extremely contagious, worldwide, animal vectors) and never really go away the chances of being able to avoid covid forever goes down to zero. Your choices essentially become take the vaccine or take the virus.

I got the vaccine. I'm young and healthy. I'm also a MD. The reason I got it, and got it for my wife as soon as possible wasn't to save to world.

&gt; CDC is tracking the number of manufactured vaccine doses that are not administered (wastage). However, this information is not currently available on the COVID Data Tracker. A small amount of wastage is expected in any vaccination program

If you look hard for specific states/sites, you may find some info

&gt; The CDC requires all organizations that administer the vaccine to report the number of vaccine doses “that were unused, spoiled, expired, or wasted as required by the relevant jurisdiction.” The CDC also asked states to describe their wastage monitoring method during the distribution planning process.

&gt; ... reporting requirements vary and are not reliably communicated to vaccine providers. Even when the rules are clear, they are not regularly enforced, nor are numbers reported to the public.

(Article was from January, hence the January date)

I figure prolonging the pandemic is terrible for the environment in a zillion ways.  Whatever we can do to end it will be good for animals as well as people.

As it has nothing to do with whether the pendemic will go on forever (which leads to your view on losing basic human rights INDEFINITELY being even more devastating than 1 in 1000 dying all at the same time, as you have assumed it will go on forever)

I am saying, and I repeat - if you get vaccinated, the pendemic will not go on indefinitely.  And you won't see 1 in 1000 dying either.

Whether or not vaccine passport gets implemented in a country is another argument altogether.  Don't mix them up.

Israel isn't getting back to normal because of vaccine passport.  If they don't have 70% of their population getting vaccinated in the first place, no amount of passports will ever get people there to have the freedom of hugging one another once again.

You can be vaccinated AND oppose vaccine passports in case you don't see this option.  (But once you discover many places requiring them for entry, and trust me they will, as they will want to protect their own employees etc, maybe you will start thinking if the benefits to you will outweigh your loss of ""equal rights"")

To your point of ""they will indefinitely get jabbed every 6 months"".  Think about this - there have been many pandemic in human history.  Do we need to get jabbed every 6 months for EACH of these diseases?  No.  When enough people are immune to a disease, it simply won't spread or have any chance of developing variants anymore, and it will eventually eradicate.  People become immune either by actually getting sick (1 in 1000 of dying) or getting vaccinated (1 in 10000000 of dying).  Which do you prefer?
