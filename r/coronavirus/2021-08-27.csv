[],,jayron92,,,[],,,,text,t2_yk6r2,False,False,,"Sure! I was double vaxxed with Pfizer back in April. Am 28, very healthy, and no underlying conditions. As I said, I was on a long road trip to Albuquerque. I started having a headache late in the afternoon that didn‚Äôt go away fully after taking ibuprofen. Didn‚Äôt think much of it, as I hadn‚Äôt slept much the night before and was amped on caffeine. Then, my nose started running like crazy and I was sneezing a lot. Since I have very bad allergies, this wasn‚Äôt that that out of the norm for me, but my brother started giving me the side eye, saying it could be the ‚Äòrona. I sincerely doubted it at that point. I felt totally fine and my allergies often give me a headache, especially when traveling. I‚Äôve been wearing an N95 when I go out, and that wasn‚Äôt even many place (even though I was going to the gym, often sanitizing my hands and wearing an N95). I‚Äôm actually an epidemiologist, so I felt like I was taking fairly calculated risks- good precautions, though of course there‚Äôs always some chance of getting sick even with a vaccine. 

Got to my aunt‚Äôs house, wearing a mask and distancing from people just in case. Of course, being Mexican, my abuela, tia, tio, cousins, their kids, my mom and dad and sis in law were all there in the same house trying to greet me‚ò†Ô∏è I tried not to linger much and went straight to bed. Woke up in the middle of the night feeling terrible, having chills and a fever simultaneously. Found some NyQuil and took more ibuprofen. Put on a mask, opened the window next to me for ventilation, and went back to sleep. When I woke up, I felt like a truck had hit me. Total sinus congestion, very lethargic, sore throat and muscle aches. I immediately told everybody I wouldn‚Äôt be camping with them, and that everybody should stay away, wear masks, and that I would stay in one room. I honestly felt terrible that entire day- I was only awake for 2 hours cumulatively, and I spent all that time drinking Gatorade, taking more medicine, and trying to find a damn testing site that was open and wasn‚Äôt booked since it was the weekend. 

Woke up Sunday feeling much better, but still definitely sick. Once I was drugged up, I actually felt fairly normal, just extra tired. Managed to take my dog on a long walk and also made some food for myself, since I hadn‚Äôt eaten since Friday. Went to a testing site, but didn‚Äôt know the result and everybody was heading back to the house. I sanitized the bathroom/kitchen and went back to one bedroom and advised everybody to stay away or avoid the house altogether if possible, especially my Abuela (she‚Äôs 86 and diabetic with heart disease) and all 5 of my two cousin‚Äôs kids because they were all too young to be vaccinated. Found out I was positive a little while later, but at that point I felt pretty fine. Went to bed pretty early though. 

Woke up Monday and I had to drive out with my brother and his wife (who had joined us in ABQ) since we had taken my car and they needed to be back for work. We all wore masks in the car the whole way, kept the windows down, and only they got out of the car when we stopped. That day I actually felt completely fine, just some residual sinus issues that DayQuil took away completely. I did sleep most of the car ride though. When I got home, I felt great and had a lot of energy. I actually went on a 9 mile bike ride with my dog riding with me (he‚Äôs only 10 lbs). 

I have two roommates, so I had called them and told them the situation. I spent the next week in my room almost 24/7, only doing outdoor activities by myself even though I actually felt totally fine. Whenever I went out of the room I wore a mask, and I pretty much just ordered food so I didn‚Äôt contaminate the kitchen though I  did use it some, especially for beverages. I bought some at home testing kits because I was curious when I would test negative. I ended up getting my first negative test Friday, 7 days after my initial symptoms. I also tested negative the next day. 

All in all, everyone tested and no one got sick. Not my roommates, not my brother or his wife who rode in the car with me (they both got Covid last summer), and none of the family I had stayed with. All the adults were vaccinated, but many like my mom and dad had been in the same house with me for several hours and overnight. My two cousin‚Äôs 5 kids weren‚Äôt vaccinated, but I always had a mask on around them and stayed my distance, plus they live in different houses so there wouldn‚Äôt have been very long exposure at all. So even though I got Covid, it‚Äôs actually pretty cool that everyone was protected. But also for me it adds in a VERY important public health message- that layering different preventative approaches is the answer!! We can go back to a fairly normal world if everyone gets vaccinated, wears masks, tests, and followers any other precautions necessary based on the venue. 

I have no idea how I got covid, but I‚Äôm sure as hell it was probably some asshole around me in a closed environment without a mask who ‚Äúfelt fine‚Äù even though their nose was running or their throat was sore.

If we waved a magic wand and were at 100% vaccination those arguments are pretty much over.  At the very least anyone arguing that we need masks/restrictions when our ERs aren't being hit hard and we have low infection rates would look about as dumb as New Zealand locking down for a single case.  It is frustrating when you've done everything you've been told to do for 18 mos so you can get back to normal and then are told that you can't get back to normal because other people aren't behaving. It's kind of like the teacher punishing the entire class but you were the one sitting quietly studying like you were supposed to. 

Second of all, as long as there is a significant population of un-vaxxed people there is the possibility of covid living there and mutating maybe even into a vaccine resistant strain.  Suddenly the fact that I'm vaccinated is meaningless and I'm just as much at risk.

People can refuse blood transfusions for religious reasons, which usually result in death of the patient from inadequate blood flow. If that is legal, then being able to refuse a shot would absolutely be covered as most hospital workers aren't the at risk population for COVID. Their survival rate is much greater than a person in need of a blood transfusion.

No only has Covid stress affected me but even before covid. From September 2017 until December 20th 2019 my daughter had infantile spasms, Focal seizures febrile seizures and litany of other problems. 

During that period she at one point was taking 5 medications daily
When she started ATCH her seizures exploded 10 fold I was stuck at home so I could work to afford the insurance needed for all these things. My wife at the hospital. I was ready to destroy my house when I heard that 


My daughter has had 6 brain operations 2 of which they operated with her skull open. Laser ablation, deep tissue probing. Only after late December 2019 did we get relief. 

Then can you guess what came next? 
Fucking Covid from one shit box to another 
My daughter has had seizure just caused by a flu. Naturally I'm pretty nervous guy but when an entire country's government sends in it's own military to block roads, build a hospital in like 10 days and weld people into their apartments, yeah I'm pretty fucking worried about this.

So even though my daughter's seizures stopped we gotta worry about some new airborne illness that erase all out hopes again. 

We have done everything we could to become cautious. It was only after a year and some did we relax and even though I'm vaccinated I'm not living my life like I did pre-covid. 

For 4 years now we have no relaxed. There's no relaxation for us. My vacation days at work were used to be with my daughter in surgery recovery. 

And with all my daughter has been through my father is a staunch anti-vaxxer and refuses to get inoculated not even for the sake of his own grand daughter.

1918 Spanish flu probably still fits this statement better since it killed 17-100 million people when world population was at 1.8 billion. It affected 1/3 world population. And it would affect much more if we had today's transportation back then. Now virus can transmit from one continent to another within a day by plane, this process would take months in 1918 by sea transportation. These 2 actually share a lot commons, new virus at time and had different waves. Those waves look really like there were different variants in 1918. The flu we face nowadays still have different dominant variant every year and that's why they update flu vaccine every year based on prediction. And all the questions you listed, the people in 1918 could ask the same, how could we never saw anything like this before?

SARS, MERS, and Ebola were all new viruses suddenly appeared in last 20 years. New virus do appear but we don't care about them too much anymore because they are just too deadly, for good or bad, it allows us to cut the transmission chain easier.

[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-07766-9](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-07766-9)

It took people 13 years to find the natural origin of SARS and the natural origin or Ebola is still uncertain. And the how exactly did SARS jumped from bat to people is still uncertain, quote: ""*Another outstanding question is how a virus from bats in Yunnan could travel to animals and humans aroundÔªø 1,000 kilometres away in Guangdong, without causing any suspected cases in Yunnan itself. That ‚Äúhas puzzled me a long time‚Äù, says Tu.*"" If you read the article, you will see that hunt for origin required a lot of time and luck.

In the past, you would never suspect whether a virus was natural or not because human were not scientifically advanced enough to do anything like that. But with all the tech advancement in the 21st century, boom this becomes a possibility now.

As a medical student, initially it was both frightening and to some extent exciting.  I volunteered to be on the front lines of covid testing back in March of 2020 [even received a national award/recognition for my efforts].  Originally there was a lot of comrodery, at least among medical students.  There was more volunteers than positions available, so testing sites started a lottery.  As the pandemic progressed, the burnout and isolation really took a toll.  By the fall of 2020 it was incredibly difficult to find volunteers and I can honestly state that people stopped caring.  Many... many medical students started breaking mandates and hosting large parties or traveling.  On the flip side, we had students who were patrolling their colleagues' social media counts to report to the medical school any instance where someone might be in violation of the state and university policies.  Many of the reports were warranted but some had malicious intent.  Students fling hiking with their live in partner/spouse were being reported for not staying indoors.  It really created a culture of animosity that still exists.

It's challenging because I watched my friend's mother die from COVID.  I was there to comfort my GF when both of her grandparents past away.  There were multiple COVID breakouts at our school... mostly involving a Halloween party.  Those who acquired COVID from volunteering were accused of acquiring it from a party. It's a huge mess.

\- All students get a COVID test on move in  
\- Masks requires both indoors and outdoors until that first test comes back.  
\- Masks will continue to be required indoors in any school facility all semester by both students and teachers. Limited exemptions will be made available and they will look for alternatives (i.e. online) before they offer an exemption.  
\- Failure to follow the mask rules or room capacity limits will get you kicked off campus.

Last year, all athletes had weekly testing even though official games/meets/events were all cancelled. Miss your weekly test without a good reason - off the team and possibly off campus too. My son is on the cross country and track teams so it was kind of reassuring to get the weekly ""Guess what? Still no COVID"" text from him.

The school even entered into a contract with a local testing lab so even when COVID test turnaround time was getting up to a week in many places, they were still getting results in 24-48 hours.

And how much extra did we pay for all of this? Hardly anything. One semester got out early and finished online from home so we got a refund on dorm and meal plans for the portion not used. There was federal relief money that went to students based on their financial aid profile as well. And for this coming year, total cost went up less than $500 compared to two years ago.

I think this story does highlight the need for personal responsibility wrt health, which is counterintuitive to what American students and employees have been taught for a long time...  and Marin County public schools may have a good union, but so many places just don't. Where I am (Texas), teachers are literally being attacked by parents / forced to teach in person (no protocols if you are sick because we are severely understaffed) and I am sure many feel like they have to go in with the sniffles if they want to keep their jobs.

&gt;US Open spectators now must show proof of at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine to attend matches, a change made less than 72 hours before the tennis tournament starts.

&gt;The US Tennis Association announced Friday that the New York City mayor's office decided to require proof of vaccination to go into Arthur Ashe Stadium, the main arena at the National Tennis Center.

&gt;The USTA then opted to extend that rule to cover all ticket holders who are 12 and older and enter the grounds during the two-week Grand Slam tournament that begins Monday. The event is returning to 100% capacity after all fans were banned from attending a year ago because of the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt;A CDC vaccination card -- or a photo or photocopy -- is among the acceptable ways of proving vaccination.

In the spring, students were all back on campus, except those who were homeschooling. Social distancing was limited because class sizes essentially doubled, and they were about what my sizes are now (not counting absent students, I mean full rosters.)

The issue is ignoring the data and basic biology that you learned in Biology class in High School.  MRNA never enters the center of the cell where your DNA is.  It never even has the opportunity to alter it.  It hands a ""letter"" to your RNA to build this.protein and display it.  The cells RNA does just that, deletes the mRNA file, makes the spike, displays it, the immune system reacts.  The cell is destroyed along with the spike and you're left with an immune system that remembers it.
As for long term studies, whoever is telling you that is flat out lying to you.  Full stop.  MRNA has been used for DECADES in cancer research.  It's been researched as a way to create the...I don't know what to call it but the spine for lack of a better term, of the flu virus.  The body changes, the spikes change, but the part that connects them doesn't.  Now that mRNA has the manufacturing in place, expect that to come soon along with HIV and a myriad of others.  The silver lining to Covid is we now have the infrastructure to run with this as a breakthrough on the level of the discovery of antibiotics.
If none of that was conveyed to you by your research then it's time you find better resources.  This is widely available information anhy of your research that didn't tell you this is lying to your face by omission.

As the vaccine does not offer perfect protection, some vaccinated folks will get ill, some seriously and some even die. The more they get exposed, the more so. How to reduce that exposure? Well, the more people are vaccinated, the less virus is out there (remember that the news about vaccinated spreading the virus as efficiently meant IF they get infected, then they can spread, and the vaccine does lower the chance of infection).

There are other reasons (even if the epidemic was purely among the vaccinated, they could overburden hospitals, meaning the vaccinated can't get care if they end up in a car accident or something; the more the virus is spreading, the more new variants there will be..), but the main point is lowering the spread.",,,,1630140973,{},hanumva,False,t3_pd53uz,False,False,t1_hant7w9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pd53uz/daily_discussion_thread_august_28_2021/hanumva/,1630222113.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes. People had to pay their bills and were afraid they'll get fired.  

The U.S. didn't even get --unpaid-- leave (where you can't get fired or kicked off insurance for 12 weeks because of medical or an immediate family member's medical reason) until 1993. 

In the 1920s... you saw America turn to alternative medicine because they became untrusting of science (probably the same reaction we're having now, where people are mad about being told what to do). You saw nations that hadn't embraced science before suddenly become more interested in public health (China and Russia, for example).

After the Spanish Flu, Europe and Russia went towards socialized medicine and the United States developed the employer-linked health insurance idea. Back then it wasn't for regular doctor visits, just more catastrophic care.



In other countries besides the U.S., they have paid leave (145 countries). Certain states have JUST started requiring it since the 2010s. Connecticut put a law in 2012 that employers who hire more than 50 people have to allow their workers to earn one hour of sick leave for every 40 hours they work, capped at 40 hours a year. They were the first.

But yeah... the point is - people need money to live. With minimum wages and unions, employees started negotiating for health care and time off, but unions tanked after Reagan &amp; Right to Work laws. So the gains we made in the 1950s started ending in the 1980s. And now... no one works for a single company for their entire lives anymore. Employees are seen as more expendable. 

But... because of COVID, with death and with 15-20% of people getting Long COVID and potentially not being able to work at the same job they used to, or work at all... (Hopefully there will be some recovery)... we have mass retirements and a huge labor shuffle. Employers might need to change not just wages but benefits. And Biden wants to allow all workers to accrue 7 days a year of paid sick time.

But all that still might not change the general attitude of showing up when you're sick. The U.S. puts a lot of stock in your identity being what you do for a living and employers guilt or threaten you into working... so even time off might not change that ""MUST GO IN"" attitude.",,,,1630140875,{},hanuj2g,False,t3_pcvzd2,False,False,t1_hamekse,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pcvzd2/unvaccinated_unmasked_teacher_infected_more_than/hanuj2g/,1630222061.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vaccine efficacy and the chance of a vaccinated person becoming infected aside (and wow that's a big aside), the ramifications of a large number of people remaining unvaccinated are far reaching. A few examples:

Hospitals are overburdened and understaffed, which means people will have delays in care for non-COVID related accidents and illnesses. These delays can be fatal.

The more people who remain unvaccinated, the more quickly variants will develop and spread, prolonging efforts to control the virus and potentially making it more difficult to do so.

Downstream effects on other areas are already being seen. Due to high liquid oxygen usage, Tampa had had to change it's water treatment protocol, and Orlando is threatening a boil water order. Costs to insurance companies are already astronomical, and will likely lead to increased premiums for everyone. 

I could go on, and this doesn't even address vaccine efficacy (not 100%), chance of breakthrough infection, possibility of long COVID, vulnerability of those who are unable to get vaccinated for medical reasons, etc. But the bottom line is that if you don't care about anyone but yourself, then sure, remaining unvaccinated probably seems fine. It's not just about you, though. It's about the greater good as a society.

One issue is ""nurse"" covers a wide range. LPN/LVN are associate degree prepared nurses. And while they are the minority, ASNs are out there. There is also a crazy amount of people who call themselves nurses but are not. It is strangely common to find medical assistants, nursing assistants, medical secretaries, etc calling themselves nurses. I personally have a bachelors in biochemistry and a bachelors in nursing. There are multiple dual degree nurses who are getting into the field and hopefully shifting it for the better.

Another issue with nursing that the nursing subreddit recently discussed are degree mills. There are a lot of low cost ""GET YOUR ASN/BSN NOW"" programs that are just spitting out under qualified nurses. They then fail the NCLEX 6 times before finally passing and becoming a terrible nurse who eventually becomes only qualified to work in a nursing home because they can't keep up with the pace of the hospital. There needs to be tighter control over the programs.

Nursing is also an old field. I'm a younger nurse and experience older nurses falling behind on evidence based practice. They practice based on their experience and are less science based than the newer nurses.

The nursing degree also has a lot of bullshit fluff in it that I *never* agreed with and thought was horseshit.",,,,1630150621,{},hao6dk8,False,t3_pco9w8,False,False,t1_hanvs69,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pco9w8/new_york_approves_covid_vaccine_mandate_for/hao6dk8/,1630227769.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most people in the U.S. also don't understand that the massive decline of education and experience standards for the majority of nursing professionals these days. Whereas in the 1980s, most outpatient clinical nurses were LPNs at minimum, and ideally RNs, the standard for outpatient nursing care has shifted to the much lower- salaried CNA and MA. In a lot of southeastern states, outpatient groups even have MAs serving as their practice managers. You go to the doctor in the 1980s and the nurse triaging you had at least 2 years of education and experience, and could be entrusted with basic health and medicine questions. In 2021, the person triaging you in your doctor's office is barely skilled enough to measure your blood pressure in a traditional cuff accurately. 

Now imagine all these MAs and CNAs running around, calling themselves nurses, spouting complete nonsense, and here we are.

Source: parent has 50 years of clinical experience and a Doctorate of Nursing.

The fetal cells used by vaccine makers are descendants of those abortions and are now thousands of generations old (cells replicating cells). So those elective abortions have protected the lives of hundreds of millions (if not billions by now). So in a way, they are giving birth and still living.

Fully vaccinated people who do become infected with the Delta variant can transmit it to others. Therefore, fully vaccinated people can further reduce their risk of becoming infected with the Delta variant and transmitting it to others by wearing a mask in public indoor settings in areas of substantial or high community transmission. Wearing a mask in public is most important for people who are immunocompromised. Fully vaccinated people might choose to mask regardless of the level of transmission, particularly if they or someone in their household is immunocompromised or at increased risk for severe disease, or if someone in their household is unvaccinated. People at increased risk for severe disease includes older adults and those who have certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, overweight or obesity, and heart conditions. Members of the household who are unvaccinated include: any persons who have not completed vaccination, who cannot be vaccinated, and those who are not eligible for vaccines, including children less than 12 years of age. Fully vaccinated people should also continue to wear a mask where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance, and in correctional facilities and homeless shelters.

I know that when we're looking to move, quality of public schools is a necessary component to our choice. I know anecdotal evidence is not great evidence, and I'm just one individual, but I don't think that this is a controversial consideration when moving a family.

If the schools in an area that might otherwise be attractive are a tire fire, I'm not moving my family there. And the schools are a direct reflection of the school board. They hold the power in the school district. So doing things like releasing a statement like ""let the virus run its course"" is a pretty effective way at getting me not to move my family there.

So let's say you're the Republic party and you see a growing suburb that used to have 1,000 high school kids in it but is expanding at a rate of 10% year over year. You want to make sure that the people who comprise this 10% increase are people who share your political opinions and will vote like you when electing judges, a mayor, a sheriff, a county prosecutor, and city council members. It's MUCH cheaper to throw $100k at a local school board election and get a stooge on the board to make sure that people who value things not consistent with your party (e.g. reduced prison sentences, higher taxes, greater diversity initiatives) are steered away because they don't want their kids in a public school system that wants to let a pandemic virus ""run its course"". After all, why throw another $15 million at a senate race where you MAY affect a 1% change in the electorate where you could actually instead influence the folks moving into your area in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

It argued that many of us are in a position where we're not exactly *depressed,* but we're just languishing. We're existing, day to day, week to week, month to month -- but with no real hopes or dreams or plans that extend past the immediate.  We find ourselves not being excited over things anymore, not really looking forward to things.  We're not necessarily *sad*, but we're not feeling *good* either.  

And how could we?  How can you look forward, be hopeful, or make plans when we're in this state of never-ending flux?  When we don't know if or when this isolation can be over?  The moment things start to look up, something else appears to drag it back down.  Hopeful because the covid numbers are going down?  Well, here's a new variant and a huge chunk of the population resisting any efforts to prevent it.  

When you're depressed, you're likely to feel like you just can't drag yourself out of bed and that there's no hope or reason to live.  Languishing is just...being on autopilot.  You get up, go through the motions, and you wait.  Wait for what?  I don't really know -- life to start back up somehow?  Enough of a sense of security to be able to hope for something? A sense of meaning or purpose or just that you *can* have an impact on the world?

&gt; An unvaccinated, unmasked California elementary school teacher who came to school in May even while visibly sick infected a dozen students with the coronavirus, all too young to be immunized, according to a report published Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

&gt; The teacher, who works at a K-8 elementary school in Marin County, was one of only two staff members that had not been vaccinated. Among the teacher‚Äôs 24 students, 22 were tested and 12 tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the report, written by county health officials and experts with UC Berkeley, UC Davis and UC Santa Cruz.

&gt; Four parents of children in the class were later infected in the outbreak, which involved the Delta variant, according to the report. Of the infected parents, one was unvaccinated, while three were vaccinated. Vaccinated parents in the outbreak experienced symptoms including fever, chills, cough, headache and loss of smell.

&gt; No one identified in the outbreak required hospitalization.

&gt; Most of the students sitting closest to the front of the class were infected. A minority of those sitting at the back of the class were infected. The teacher reportedly read aloud to students while unmasked, despite rules requiring teachers to be masked indoors, the report said.

&gt; The teacher started feeling symptoms on May 19 of nasal congestion and fatigue and attributed them to allergies, according to the report. The teacher at some point began coughing, suffered a headache and seemed to experience symptoms of fever.

&gt; Nonetheless, the teacher continued working through May 21, the same day the teacher went to get tested for the coronavirus, the report said. The teacher informed the school on May 23 that the test was positive and self-isolated for a week.

&gt; The teacher‚Äôs students began falling ill on May 22.

Similarly if it's ordered too late, it will typically have gone down again. Hence it's not quite the catch all that it's often presented as. :(

 I got my antibodies tested that May...negative. Those tests were later deemed inaccurate so who knows. But we locked the fuck down once I got pregnant. Never got covid.

[],,AffectionateTry3172,,,[],,,,text,t2_6liauiww,False,False,,"""Health officials in Nebraska are so desperate for staff that they are recruiting unvaccinated nurses, an unconventional attempt to plug the shortage of nurses as the state battles a surge in coronavirus cases.  
The advertisements for unvaccinated nurses are popping up on postcards, on Facebook and on state job postings: ‚Äú$5,000 sign-on bonus!‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo mandated Covid-19 vaccinations,‚Äù the notices say. The ads are for positions in veterans‚Äô homes, psychiatric treatment facilities and other locations.  
State Senator Carol Blood first heard about the advertisements on Monday, she said, when she was inundated with messages from constituents criticizing the outreach.  
‚ÄúOur health care professionals were calling my office in tears,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a slap in the face to them. ‚ÄùOn Thursday, Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska declared a staffing emergency for the state‚Äôs hospitals. New cases in Nebraska have jumped, with hospitalizations rising to the highest level since January, according to a New York Times database.

The governor said he would issue an executive order that will make it easier for hospitals to hire nurses. The order will waive licensing requirements for hospitals in order to authorize credentials for retired or inactive nurses, defer some continuing education requirements and suspend statutes concerning new health care providers who are seeking a license to practice.  
Nebraska‚Äôs nurses, like health care workers across the country, are a year and a half into a relentless battle to care for Covid patients. The latest and most severe cases, across the country, are among those who have yet to be vaccinated.

About this data  
As the highly contagious Delta variant pummels the United States, nurses are reporting that they feel depleted and traumatized, their ranks thinned by early retirements or career shifts that traded the emergency room for less stressful jobs.  
Gov. Ricketts, a Republican, directed the state authorities to recruit unvaccinated nurses, said Taylor Gage, a spokesman for the governor.  
‚ÄúThe state responded with this campaign so nurses throughout Nebraska know that state government is an alternative career choice,‚Äù Mr. Gage said in a statement.  
The decision came after eight state hospitals mandated vaccines for their employees, KETV reported.  
Ms. Blood, a Democrat, wrote a letter to the governor on Monday criticizing the recruitment scheme, saying the state‚Äôs decision was ‚Äúof grave concern to myself and countless people in my district.‚Äù  
‚ÄúI do understand that we have a serious shortage of staff,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúWith that said, putting those who live in these facilities at risk because we need to find bodies to hire is not acceptable.‚Äù  
Ms. Blood said on Wednesday night that she had not received a reply from the governor‚Äôs office.  
The surge is being driven by the highly contagious Delta variant and low vaccination rates, health experts said. The authorities in Nebraska are struggling to vaccinate its citizens, with only 57 percent of people at least partially vaccinated. The national rate is 61 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  
Gov. Ricketts also announced Thursday a directed health measure to limit elective surgeries that will take effect on Monday.  
The statewide limitations comes days after Nebraska Medicine, Methodist Health, and Bryan Health announced that they would suspend elective surgeries to preserve hospital capacity. Nebraska Medicine cited the nursing shortage as a factor in its decision.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains a national tracking system for infectious diseases.  
Criminal communicable disease laws typically focus on infectious diseases with serious public health implications that spread through contact with an infected person's blood, saliva, mucus, or other bodily fluids. Some states have laws that are specific to a particular disease, like HIV, or a category of diseases, like sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Other states have laws that address communicable diseases generally. These laws and their punishments differ significantly among states.  
In most states, people can face criminal prosecution for spreading a communicable disease if they ***intentionally or recklessly*** expose others to the disease.

[],,Norseman2,,,[],,,,text,t2_36zfy,False,False,[],"&gt;There is still no data on the safety of the vaccine that's older than a year.

False. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccine human trials both started in April 2020 ([Pfizer ref, for example](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368728)), which, by my math, does happen to be more than a year ago. You could have easily fact-checked this yourself.

I would ask that you remember the [Gell-Mann amnesia effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton#GellMannAmnesiaEffect) and try to adjust for it. If a source tells you a bunch of things which sound surprising, look up at least a few of them, especially if it's related to an area where you have expert knowledge. If any of the things you checked aren't true, that source is peddling bullshit and should be avoided in the future.

&gt;It's not at all unusual for issues to arise years after a new treatment (whether it be a vaccine or anything else medical) is first developed and tested.

False. To quote the CDC:

&gt;Serious side effects that could cause a long-term health problem are extremely unlikely following any vaccination, including COVID-19 vaccination.

[Reference](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/safety-of-vaccines.html). When long-term side effects happen, they almost always first show up within six weeks after the medication is given - the harm is done, and it lingers. Long-term side effects first showing up after six weeks are extremely rare, but do happen occasionally, like with the Pandemrix vaccine for H1N1 which caused increased risk of narcolepsy, first appearing within about 1-2 months and rarely up to a year after the vaccine was given. It was incredibly uncommon at about 5.7 cases per 100,000 [[ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24821121/)], though people infected with H1N1 were likely to get narcolepsy as well [[ref](https://sciencenordic.com/denmark-diseases-genetics/study-explains-why-h1n1-flu-can-cause-narcolepsy/1394775)], and for the same reason.

Immune-mediated effects like that can be slower to show effects, though I have found no examples of even an incredibly rare vaccine side effect that required more than six months to first appear in any significant subset of the population. As of six months ago, we had 23 million Americans fully vaccinated, so if there were going to be some super-rare long-term effect, some of us would be showing it already and the FDA would be noticing it in the VAERS reports. That's obviously not happening, and we've reached FDA approval. So, to quote the CDC again:

##Cases
- 151,760 new resident cases weekly's report - Total Resident Cases: 3,179,714. **A change of +1,020 over last week's (150,740).** 
- 14.49% (13.80% last week increase of +0.69%) of people in Florida had tested positive with COVID before (residents case numbers only).

##Testing
- 16.8% (-3.0% than last week's 19.8%) new cases positivity rate.

##Death
- 1,727 resident death- 43,979 Total Resident Deaths. 

###Averaging the case and death numbers into 7 days
- **151,760/7= 21,680.00 new cases per day in the last 7 days**
- **1,727/7=246.71 new death per day in the last 7 days**

##Vaccinated
- **225,459 New People Vaccinated (Actual First Doses)- 12,916,873 Total People Vaccinated (Actual Total First Doses Altogether)** 
- **254,274 Vaccinated Series Complete (J&amp;J 1 dose+Second Dose Vaccines)- 10,785,185 Total Series Complete (J&amp;J 1 dose+Second Dose Vaccines)**

##Percentage for Population That Are Vaccinated 
**(18+ population is removed since Total People Vaccinated counts 12+ now and age groups go from 12-14, 15-24 so it's hard to exclude under 18 from the adult population)**
- Total Population: 21,944,577
- Everyone who's Vaccinated in the Entire State Population (includes partially and fully vaccinated): 12,916,873/21,944,577=58.86% **(+1.03%)**
- Fully Vaccinated Total Population: 10,785,185/21,944,577=49.15% **(+1.16%)**

* Doctors are more educated than nurses.
* Doctors probably take more science courrses in school, so they may be more likely to trust science than nurses.  This is a bit questionable, because, IMO, clinical practice isn't actually all that scientific.
* Because med schools and residencies are extremely competitive to get in, I would guess that doctors might be smarter than nurses, but I'm not sure.
* Doctors are far more likely to be male than nurses.
* Doctors spend less time with patients than nurses, generally speaking.
* However, a doctor is required to run a code, or intubate a patient.
* When hospitals started getting full, doctors started getting tasked with treating COVID patients, regardless of specialty.  I'm guessing this is probably true to a  similar extent for nurses, as well.

I'm not sure how all of these would interplay to give the reult we're observing, but I suspect it's something like ""doctors are involved in some of the riskiest situations involving COVID patients, so they're aware of the potential risks of the disease.  They also trust science more than nurses.  Given that, doctors are probably more inclined to want to take the vaccine.""

At a press briefing, however, Health and Welfare Minister Chen Shih-chung (Èô≥ÊôÇ‰∏≠) said the CECC learned Saturday morning of a new domestic COVID-19 case that has been confirmed in New Taipei, which will be included in Sunday's figures.

Of the six new imported cases, four involved Taiwanese nationals who recently returned from France, the United States, Vietnam and Cambodia, Chen said, while the two others were citizens of the Philippines and Pakistan.

According to the CECC, the six all tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival at the airport or during their mandatory 14-day quarantine.

The new cases bring the total in Taiwan to 15,960, of which 14,345 are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 COVID-19 cases in a single day.

No deaths from the disease were reported on Saturday.

However, Chen said the CECC also learned from New Taipei authorities Saturday morning of a container vessel captain who recently died from a fever.

The CECC is still looking into the case to determine whether or not it was related to COVID-19, Chen said.

WASHINGTON ‚Äî American intelligence agencies have not been  
able to determine if the coronavirus pandemic was the result of an accidental  
leak from a lab or if it emerged more naturally, according to declassified  
portions of a report to the White House that were released on Friday.  
The nation‚Äôs spy agencies, the Office of the Director of National  
Intelligence said, are unlikely to reach a conclusion without more cooperation  
from China or new sources of information.  
In a statement, President Biden said the United States  
would continue working to understand the origins of the virus and he called on  
China to be more transparent about what led to its  
emergence there in late 2019 before spreading rapidly across the globe.  
‚ÄúWe will do everything we can to trace the roots of this  
outbreak that has caused so much pain and death around the world, so that we  
can take every necessary precaution to prevent it from happening again,‚Äù Mr.  
Biden said. ‚ÄúCritical information about the origins of this pandemic exists in  
the People‚Äôs Republic of China, yet from the beginning, government officials in  
China have worked to prevent international investigators and members of the  
global public health community from accessing it.‚Äù  
As debates about the pandemic‚Äôs  
origins and China‚Äôs role intensified, Mr. Biden ordered the nation‚Äôs intelligence agencies three  
months ago to draft a report on the source of the virus.  
After the review, the National  
Intelligence Council and four other intelligence agencies reported that they  
believed the virus that causes Covid-19 was most likely created by ‚Äúnatural  
exposure to an infected animal through an animal infected with it, or close  
progenitor virus.‚Äù  
Before the review was conducted,  
only two agencies favored the natural exposure theory. But the new report said  
the intelligence council and other agencies favoring the natural theory had  
only low confidence in their conclusions ‚Äî a sign that the intelligence behind  
the determination was not strong and that assessments could change.  
On the other side of the debate, one  
agency said it had concluded, with moderate confidence, that the pandemic was  
the result of ‚Äúa laboratory-associated incident‚Äù in China. According to the  
declassified report, analysts at that agency gave weight to the risky nature of  
work on coronaviruses. The agency also said the accident most likely involved  
‚Äúexperimentation, animal handling or sampling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology.‚Äù  
There were two labs in Wuhan doing  
work on the coronavirus before the pandemic, but intelligence agencies have  
mostly focused on the work done at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  
The announcement from the director  
of national intelligence did not identify the agency that favored the  
laboratory-leak theory. But current and former officials said the F.B.I.  
believed that the virus was created in the lab. One former official said the  
bureau believed the virus probably escaped into the public from lab  
technicians.  
An F.B.I. spokeswoman declined to  
comment.  
The intelligence agencies all agreed  
that the virus was unlikely to have been created as any kind of biological  
weapon, the same stance the U.S. government has maintained for more than a  
year. The agencies also agreed that the initial exposures that caused the  
outbreak occurred ‚Äúno later than November 2019,‚Äù according to the declassified  
conclusions.  
Critical to the debate over the  
origins of the virus, American intelligence officials do not believe the  
Chinese officials knew about it at the time of the outbreak, the report said.  
‚ÄúThe I.C. assesses China‚Äôs officials  
did not have foreknowledge of the virus before the initial outbreak of Covid-19  
emerged,‚Äù the declassified report said, using the initials for the intelligence  
community.  
The three-month review Mr. Biden  
ordered was done to bring more scientific expertise into the examination of the  
pandemic‚Äôs origins. Intelligence agencies used that period to examine a trove of data that had not been fully scrutinized.  
That data, taken from the Wuhan  
Institute of Virology, did not provide any additional information that  
persuaded additional agencies that a lab leak was possible.  
The key piece of missing data,  
according to intelligence officials, is clinical virus samples from early cases  
in China.",,,,1630157351,{},haohq1c,True,t3_pd9ds9,False,True,t3_pd9ds9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pd9ds9/intelligence_review_yields_no_firm_conclusion_on/haohq1c/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,5ac764ae4f324fdc047c6794ccb7d2c236fea3c8,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1630157365.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

In its statement issued on August 28, the National Committee for Ethics in Biomedical Research affirmed that the homegrown COVID-19 vaccine meets safety requirements.  
  
The statement also mentioned the committee‚Äôs conclusion at its urgent meeting on August 22 to evaluate the mid-term result of Nano Covax's phase 3 clinical trials until August 18, stressing that the COVID-19 vaccine has immunogenicity on the tried cases.  
  
The committee also requested additional results of the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) of Coronavirus on Delta and Alpha variants to meet enough test results in  accordance with the approved plan.  
  
The committee proposed domestic vaccine developer Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology JSC and the research team to complete a report on updating and supplementing the  clinical trial research results of Nano Covax and send it to the ethics committee and the advisory council for evaluation and approval.  
  
‚ÄúIf Nano Covax vaccine is granted a registration certificate for circulation, it can only be used conditionally basing on the quantity and plan approved by the Ministry of Health,"" the statement said.  
  
People administered with the vaccine must be closely monitored for safety similar to those joined the phase 3b clinical trials, it added.  
  
The two agencies will specify conditions for continuing or stopping circulation when they collect enough data on the protective efficacy and safety of the vaccine, according to the statement.  
  
According to the ethics committee, the MoH has created favorable conditions for domestic vaccine producers, including Nanogen, to research and develop COVID-19 vaccines.  
  
Previously, the ethics committee convened to accept the result reports of clinical trials of the phases 3a, and assess the results of the phase 3b, of safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine developed by Nanogen.  
  
Nano Covax, a recombinant spike protein vaccine, is the forerunner in the race for domestically produced COVID-19 vaccine, followed by COVIVAC from the Institute of Vaccines and Biologic Medical and mRNA vaccine ARCT-154 (by Arcturus and VinBioCare) just starting phase 2 trials./.",,,,1630158724,{},haokf4c,True,t3_pda52w,False,True,t3_pda52w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pda52w/vietnam_vietnam_considers_granting_registration/haokf4c/,1630234568.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead, what I was doing was showing a flaw in your logic.  You used your overall chances of dying from covid while vaccinated and attributed the tiny chance all to the vaccine. That's improper reasoning, because according to your logic, NOT getting the vaccine is incredibly protective as wsell since your chances are low even without it. 

The PROPER way to determine the protection from the vaccine is to compare your chances WITH the vaccine to your chances WITHOUT the vaccine, and that's about 15X less chance of dying with the vaccine.

[],,harryyplopper,,,[],,,,text,t2_65se9,False,False,[],"The media and public health departments have intentionally underplayed natural immunity because of fear that it will give anti-vaxxers credit. But upon deeper thought it actually provides a very powerful argument to get vaccinated because prior failure to acknowledge natural immunity underplays the danger of the virus and overestimates the speed at which the vaccine loses efficacy. 

[This study](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/having-sars-cov-2-once-confers-much-greater-immunity-vaccine-no-infection-parties) conducted two days ago in Israel suggests that natural immunity is better than the vaccine. At a first glance, this appears to suggest that we shouldn't get the vaccine....but that is WRONG. Paradoxically, this actually means that the vaccine is better than we thought. The reason is that current efficacy stats compare unvaccinated to vaccinated, which has suggested that the vaccine is losing its efficacy (ie lower efficacy against the delta variant). However, if natural immunity really is as good or better than the vaccine, then the vaccine isn't LOSING effectiveness (or at least not as quickly as the numbers suggest), rather the proportion of unvaccinated becoming immune is RISING. The real measure of efficacy should thus compare (i) double vaxxed to (ii) unvaxxed AND uninfected (ie non-immune). Because the number of unvaxxed AND uninfected must logically be less than the number of unvaxxed, comparisons to unvaxxed alone can only undestate the vaccine's effectiveness and understate the death rate to the unprotected. For example, the study in the link in the title only considered *unvaccinated* (not unprotected) which means that the virus is actually more dangerous than that for those without natural or vaccine immunity.

This has three implications: 
(1) failure to acknowledge the effectiveness of natural immunity means that danger to the unprotected is UNDERSTATED by a very large margin. If you are unvaxxed and not immune then the virus is MORE DANGEROUS than the stats suggest, meaning that people may feel falsely secure by not getting vaccinated. I'll bet that the majority in the hospital are both unvaxxed and non-immune 
(2) failure to acknowledge the effectiveness of natural immunity will erode public trust, converting more people into conspiracy theorists because they feel they're being lied to (for good reason.....they are)
(3) failure to acknowledge the effectiveness of natural immunity makes comparisons between vaxxed and unvaxxed underplay the vaccine's efficacy, because the vaccine is actually more effective against NON-IMMUNITY. If half of the unvaxxed population is immune, then the danger of being unprotected is TWICE AS HIGH and the effectiveness of the vaccine may be BETTER than it appears in our naive vaxxed/unvaxxed comparisons.

I understand the desire to avoid giving anti-vaxxers credit, but open communication and transparency of the FACTS and the SCIENCE should overrule all. Science doesn't care about your feelings. Failure to do this results in erosion of trust in the system and more people turning to conspiracy theories. In this particular instance, hiding natural immunity may make the virus look less dangerous than it really is, giving the vaccine hesitant greater justification than is necessary, resulting in more needless deaths.",,,,1630164209,{},haowgxa,False,t3_pdboxp,False,True,t3_pdboxp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pdboxp/natural_immunity_is_effective_against_the_virus/haowgxa/,1630240795.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Realise that it is the result of external events beyond your control. Then get angry about how poorly mental differences are treated by society when you become a pariah for being different and thinking independently.

The reality of the situation calls for anxiety, outrage, and an outpouring of unhappiness and indignation from People.  Workers who were deemed essential were temporarily held up as heroes, then abandoned and spit on by society. Workers in low paying positions have been labelled ""low skill"" labours and systematically denied livable wages. Nurses and medical professionals risked their lives every day while throngs of idiots refused to get vaccinated or follow basic health rules, endangering themselves and others. Public trust in institutions is at an all time low. Billions and billions were made by the upper echelons of society while you were fed scraps to get by on and left to fend for yourself. You were all treated unfairly by someone at some point and are entitled to feeling whatever comes as a result.

These redidulous ""mental health"" narratives focused on medicalization and tacitly blaming people for their trauma and varied abilities to cope with external stimuli must begin to change. Diagnostic overshadowing of legitimate frustration and reactions to an inhospitable and intolerant world are all anyone will ever receive from councilors and so called ""mental health"" professionals. They will teach you how to hate yourself as a manifestation of disease and not a human being for the crime of being unhappy with the state of affairs their profession protects.

If you allow these malevolent mental health narratives into your life, any adverse reaction to being discriminated against, bullied, and treated unfairly will be chalked up as the result of a simple medical problem and your voice against such things will be discredited. Millions more people are in danger of being unjustly problematized and fed into a system that punishes them for being unhappy with due cause. Arrogant and belittling professionals who abuse their prestige and authority will tell them that their problems can be solved with medication, even if it does not eliminate the societal catalysts for behaviour and mindsets. They will do all in their power to convince you that your knowledge of real social, economic, cultural and political problems are invalid ""cognitive distortions"", and supplant it with a story that **YOU** are the problem. It is a highly sophisticated form of psychological abuse and gaslighting.

Listen to what your mind is telling you about your surroundings and realise that these states of mind and being are perfectly rational and human reactions informed by your collection of experiences. **You are not broken**. Do not allow the false conciousness of people who can ""keep it together"" scramble your self image and legitimate perceptions. Reject their attempts to pit your conciousness against itself.

The higher levels of isolation people are experiencing has a tendency to undo a lot of the cognitive dissonance and distortion imposed by society by forcing you to think and be alone with your thoughts. This is hard for a lot of people to handle, and discomfort and distress can often result. Maintain your sense of self and do not let that hindsight go to waste by being overridden by others. The world is absolutely fucked and not one person ""struggling with mental health"" is in control of their surroundings. Let yourself feel and be human.

There are a few countries like Germany which are federations like the US. So there's 3 levels that need to cooperate. And keep in mind that the states in Germany are all led by many different parties and coalition combinations. So a Social-democrat/green coalition needs to coordinate with a conservative/liberal coalition etc.
Yet in the EU we still have come up with a safe, easy and reliable system to document and verify vaccinations. (+ even some countries that aren't in the EU.. like Norway, Turkey, Ukraine).

Don't get me wrong, we also had some issues. The system wasn't ready until June so people (mostly elderly) who got fully vaccinated before that had to be sent letters with their QR code for example.

Most other developed countries have similar QR / App systems like the UK, and UAE.

The US cards look like they came out of someones printer and have 0 security features - so realistically they could be printed by someone.


&gt; Both the state I live in, and the doctor's office that I go to, have a version of my vaccination history recorded. But, both are not the same, and both are missing at least one of my vaccinations. If I go to a new doctor's office, they may be able to access my vaccination history with my permission, but there are scenarios where that wouldn't be trivial.

In Germany its actually pretty similar, the doctor that gave you the vaccine keeps track and also writes it down in your WHO yellow book. If you lose your yellow book you need to ask the doctor to look up his records and write it down again. (This is for _normal_ vaccines, so everything non-covid, as for covid we have these QR things).

This is not quite my understanding.  They have the same CT values from a PCR test, probably.  The CT values drop a lot faster in vaccinated people over time.  CT values were correlated with viral load for unvaccinated people, but we're not sure about how they're correlated in the unvaccinated.  

&gt;My question is, if the viral load is the same is it possible that the integrity of the virus coming from a vaccinated person is weaker? Basically, is it possible for there to be a large viral load but the quality of the virus has been compromised.

Totally. In fact, that's very likely.

I mean, it's pretty meaningless compared to EUA, they're basically the same in terms of safety.  Efficacy is tested for approval though, so that may be a big deal.

&gt;Based on their understanding, the FDA approved vax is completely different from what is currently being administered and won't be available for another 3 years. Now I take what they say with a grain of salt most days. 

Today should be one of those days.  Pfizer = Comirnaty = BNT162B2.  It's the same vaccine, and if they're claming otherwise, they need to provide DEFINITIVE proof, or they're being intentionally ignorant and potentially harmful to your coworkers.

&gt;I'm guessing this was something they read on their Facebook feed that got taken out of context. 

That's being generous.

I'm in the COVID patient rooms, our ER's, and my office overlooks where the freezer trucks were (thankfully they are gone for now).

I know PTSD all too well, when seeing those orange body bags going into the trucks all day long no longer became horrifying, and just another day at work I knew I needed help.

We have a psychiatry department, they offered free telephone and video therapy sessions and I jumped on it.  Thankfully they knew first hand what we were experiencing and it did help.

Even so I still pushed loved ones, and friends away for fear that I was carrying the virus.  Even after I was vaccinated I still self isolated myself (another PTSD symptom).

It's going to be a long road for all of us, if you think you have PTSD do something now before it's too late.  I didn't lose my family, might have pushed some friends too far away to get them back.

IT's sad, I see so many people that have just shut down, put a fake smile on under the mask and say I'm fine.  It's okay to not be fine, it's okay to get help.  My anxiety is in check, that being said I can't say that I'm not waiting for the other shoe to drop.

I did also read the Israel study, thanks for that.  I suppose one way to think about this is that the more effective natural immunity is, the lower the efficacy the vaccine will appear.  

I started looking at the situation in South Dakota as an example.  It has a 50% vaccination rate, and estimates are about 50% were previously infected.  People could fall into one of four groups.  Vax-infected, vax-uninfected, unvax-infected, unvax-uninfected.

If prior infection and vaccination were 90% effective, for every 10 unvax-uninfected there would be 1 in each of the groups and 2 of 13 would be vaccinated.  If prior infection was far better than vaccination it would be 1 of 11.

Looking at how things are playing out it looks more like the first scenario 

&gt;In Sioux Falls, Sanford Heath posted on Facebook that as of Aug. 24, nearly 84% of the patients they‚Äôre treating for COVID-19 are unvaccinated. 

&gt;Of the 11 people on ventilators in the Sanford Health network, 10 of them are unvaccinated.

The last Queen of England was [Queen Anne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain) who, with the 1707 Acts of Union, dissolved the title of King/Queen of England.

####FAQ

*Isn't she still also the Queen of England?*

This is only as correct as calling her the Queen of London or Queen of Hull; she is the Queen of the place that these places are in, but the title doesn't exist.

*Is this bot monarchist?*

No, just pedantic.

We just floated and let the sails be. That's how I feel life has been for a while. My partner and I have been saying we need to buy a new couch for like 6 months but neither of us can motivate ourselves to do it because that brings up the question about whether we are planning to move (we had said a long time ago we would head back to where we were born around 2022), and then the can of worms about what the hell the future holds is blown wide open.

When I stopped showering and started picking at my skin, I knew something was really wrong.  I've apparently been living with it my whole life, but it was never *this* bad.  

I was diagnosed with depression earlier in life, but treatment didn't do anything.. and I got turned off to it and ended up self-medicating by seeking out anything that gave me dopamine rushes (subconciously) to squeak by looking 'normal'.  

The symptoms are very easy to write off as personality flaws; lazy, procrastinator, careless, etc.. but there's a root cause with brain chemistry.  Women get the short end of the stick because the tell-tale hyperactivity isn't as common as it is in men.  

It may not be your issue, but I hear so many stories of people being misdiagnosed with depression/anxiety for decades before ADHD is discovered as the actual root cause of those, so thought I'd share.  

One difference that's a good indicator if ADHD or depression, is sleep issues.  If you have trouble falling asleep (staying up way too late), but then stay asleep once you do.. more likely ADHD.

I've seen so many wildly dangerous clickbait headlines about this study. We have NO understanding of long covid or associated morbidity. A much better designed study just came out suggesting even mild cases can result in cognitive problems enough to be statistically significant. We are just starting to look into the rise in diabetes cases, in children too! after infection. People are without a normal sense of smell over a year out. And I could go on. I have fibromyalgia. I wouldn't wish it on anyone except maybe people going around encouraging ppl to get an infection that can cause all these symptoms long term.  
This stuff is important for science to understand, but the lay reporting on it is absurd.  
And besides that, this study has not been reviewed.  
Does the study take into account longevity of both immunities? Also, which vaccines were studied. The US vaccines only have spike protein only. Maybe long term the best combo is an MRNA and an attenuated virus together. A study into that might be useful, but that's not what this article is.  
Many studies have shown waning immunity in the unvaccinated infected with a more extreme drop off than the MRNAs.  
Even this unreviewed study itself claims the best situation is vaccination after natural infection - it doesn't study the reverse, infection after vaccination, and it obviously has no data on mixed vaccines or even 3 dose protocols.  
We DO have a study that shows not getting covid is very significantly better, statistically, for your cognitive health, though, so consider that.  
I think this study is important only because vaccination efforts are failing so badly - in the states for the silliest reasons, but in parts of the world that simply don't have the ability or money or vaccine for mass vaccination, let alone a booster campaign, knowing that one dose of vaccine plus natural immunity can be robust is important for the long term prospects of this pandemic in places that will never be able to do full population 3 dose protocols. Knowing that with the protection on a population level from death and severe disease of one vaccine, a breakthrough infection will grant a significant boost in the immunity is good.

Yeah so, it's significantly more complicated than that. D-dimer is in general a rather ~~shit~~ iffy test, because it requires some rather specific circumstances to be useful. For a more in depth discussion of D-dimer [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClotSurvivors/comments/iv3shc/much_more_that_you_wanted_to_know_about_ddimer/). A high D-dimer is more likely to be something other than a clot, in most patients. Or in other words, it's terrible at diagnosing a clot, which is why it's not used for diagnosis, merely in the right circumstances for ruling out a clot.
  
I'm rather unclear on whether you had a diagnosed clot, or a high d-dimer (which could be caused by many things, including the immune reaction to either the shot or COVID, and isn't automatically dangerous). Unless you had significant problems due to the shot, a D-dimer taken on the same day is *extremely* unlikely to be out of specc due to the shot, as your body hasn't had any time to ramp up production of empty C19-shells yet, let alone find them and react to them.",,,,1630105910,{},ham9seo,False,t3_pcpoha,False,True,t1_hal4bzs,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pcpoha/blood_clot_risk_greater_after_covid_infection/ham9seo/,1630193102.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; why don‚Äôt you also have this concern for people who don‚Äôt exercise or smoke, or drink alcohol?

Those do not spread exponentially, and therefore do not threaten hospital collapse at random times.

[],,outlawa,,,[],,,,text,t2_95nlh,False,False,[],"Did this study specify what type of mask at all?  
Did it go into the common store-bought mask vs the other masks that are available?  
And most important did it touch on only one person wearing the mask or everyone involved wearing the mask? 

Every study out there that takes this seriously states that the ""protective effect with respect to the transmission of infective droplets/aerosols of SARS-CoV2 and that the protective efficiency was higher when masks were worn by the virus spreader.""

The layman's translation is: If everyone is wearing a mask then it will significantly reduce the transmission of the virus.   
It's what everyone (except politicians and nuts on Facebook/YouTube) has been saying since this started.  

One person wearing the mask is cute at best. There will be some protection but not a lot. The real magic happens when everyone is wearing a mask. 

Because there are several different variants of masks and the type of mask used (at least in a medical situation) depends on the situation and they perform differently.   
IE; You're not going to find a procedure mask being used in a surgical situation. 

But in situations for pure protection of the mask wearer when others are not masked an N-95 mask is the mask of choice. Is an N-95 mask 100% effective? Absolutely not, the person wearing that mask still has to get air. But it's better than not wearing one. And N-95 masks are not built for comfort, I know because my transplant team required me to wear one whenever I was in a public setting or when anyone outside of my household came to visit. 

A hypothetical for you. Let's say that you were playing the lottery, or a raffle, or anything that was going to give you something that you wanted. And it was a known fact that your chances of winning or getting what you wanted were improved if one of the numbers you picked was ""5"". Those odds went up if you picked a second number that was ""9"".   
Now, this doesn't guarantee that you're going to win. It will just increase your chance by, let's say 10%. Would you include those numbers in the numbers you guessed. Or would you say ""10% isn't much""?  
This is an abstract from the report which is affiliated with more hospitals and universities than I care to type out:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33087517/

  
On your retort about my comment of kids not getting it. YES! Yes, it started around the Fall of last year and continued through the Winter, that was the rallying cry of so many anti-mask people. ""There are no reports of kids with the virus"". ""Children are not affected by the virus"". And that message went on to some national TV stations and had flooded social media. I'm not quite sure if anyone is aware. But children have lungs. And if you happen to be a human (and have lungs) (no matter your age) you. can. catch. the. virus. Now that children are catching the virus (but I already knew this since I know 3 children in my neighborhood, one living pretty much across the street from us, that did catch it. Everyone that was singing that song back then suddenly doesn't remember ever hearing anything like that being uttered. I'm not surprised by this at all and expected everyone to suddenly cry out ""Nobody ever said anything like that!!!""

&gt;	This isn‚Äôt ‚Äúnew territory.‚Äù

 Actually it is new territory because the way in which these mandates are being rolled out is different. There is no large scale / long timeline history in the US of requiring people to have a vaccine in order to enter a restaurant, for just one example.

We also aren‚Äôt defining clear metrics, like, for how long are these vaccine requirements going to be in place? History tells us most likely once such laws are implemented they don‚Äôt ever go away. Even long after the danger of the virus has subsided. That‚Äôs because having such laws gives the govt increased powers, and the powers that be are always reluctant to give up power.

-profs are doing things (I‚Äôm part of a committee that co ducted large scale surveys of faculty showing near 100% agreement that a mask mandate is needed, we have used this data to back statements sent to administrators, etc., etc.; we have done everything we can short of those things that would get us fired)
-administrators know that nearly 100% of profs support mask mandates, but they respond that students don‚Äôt want them; so if students do support masks, it would help to send that message
-you might be surprised to learn that there are a glut of PhDs on the market and the administration sees faculty as easily replaceable; if you really want to go down a rabbit hole, read some of the many articles about adjunct faculty who have phds but work below minimum wage and receive no benefits, and may even be homeless.

But that 15X number was going from zero protection to full vaccine protection.  Lets use that, even thought he vaccine helps you less than that (again, it still helps)... 

if now you start doing things that are far more likely to expose you to COVID than what you did prior to the vaccine, then that negates a lot of the protection you had by just not being exposed, which can dwarf the protection from the vaccine.   15X lesser chance if exposed, but you are now far more than 15X more likely to even be exposed, and now you are potentially in more danger. But you get to see a movie in the theater instead of on Netflix, I guess.  

I get that that's a tradeoff that is fine with people. I have no issues with that. But you don't seem to understand that that is a tradeoff. You are not impervious just because of the vaccine.

[],,harryyplopper,,,[],,,,text,t2_65se9,False,False,[],"The media and public health departments have intentionally underplayed natural immunity because of fear that it will give anti-vaxxers credit. But upon deeper thought it actually provides a very powerful argument to get vaccinated because prior failure to acknowledge natural immunity underplays the danger of the virus and overestimates the speed at which the vaccine loses efficacy. 

At a first glance, this appears to suggest that we shouldn't get the vaccine....but that is WRONG. Paradoxically, this actually means that the vaccine is better than we thought. The reason is that current efficacy stats compare unvaccinated to vaccinated, which has suggested that the vaccine is losing its efficacy (ie lower efficacy against the delta variant). However, if natural immunity really is as good or better than the vaccine, then the vaccine isn't LOSING effectiveness (or at least not as quickly as the numbers suggest), rather the proportion of unvaccinated becoming immune is RISING. The real measure of efficacy should thus compare (i) double vaxxed to (ii) unvaxxed AND uninfected (ie non-immune). Because the number of unvaxxed AND uninfected must logically be less than the number of unvaxxed, comparisons to unvaxxed alone can only undestate the vaccine's effectiveness and understate the death rate to the unprotected.

This has three implications:  (1) failure to acknowledge the effectiveness of natural immunity means that danger to the unprotected is UNDERSTATED by a very large margin. If you are unvaxxed and not immune then the virus is MORE DANGEROUS than the stats suggest, meaning that people may feel falsely secure by not getting vaccinated. I'll bet that the majority in the hospital are both unvaxxed and non-immune (2) failure to acknowledge the effectiveness of natural immunity will erode public trust, converting more people into conspiracy theorists because they feel they're being lied to (for good reason.....they are) (3) failure to acknowledge the effectiveness of natural immunity makes comparisons between vaxxed and unvaxxed underplay the vaccine's efficacy, because the vaccine is actually more effective against NON-IMMUNITY. If half of the unvaxxed population is immune, then the danger of being unprotected is TWICE AS HIGH and the effectiveness of the vaccine may be BETTER than it appears in our naive vaxxed/unvaxxed comparisons.

I understand the desire to avoid giving anti-vaxxers credit, but open communication and transparency of the FACTS and the SCIENCE should overrule all. Science doesn't care about your feelings. Failure to do this results in erosion of trust in the system and more people turning to conspiracy theories. In this particular instance, hiding natural immunity may make the virus look less dangerous than it really is, giving the vaccine hesitant greater justification than is necessary, resulting in more needless deaths.",,,,1630163337,{},haouieu,False,t3_pcgisr,False,True,t3_pcgisr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pcgisr/having_sarscov2_once_confers_much_greater/haouieu/,1630239731.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

See last years Sturgis (unvaccinated) turning I to a superspreader event versus lollapalooza (vaccinated) with few cases.

Secondly, in the event a vaccinated person gets infected and develops disease, they clear the virus in two days and are infectious for a measurably shorter period of time.

We can see constantly all around us that the unvaccinated are the 95% of the cases hospitalized.  The unvaccinated are infecting each other, like the teacher who infected elementary students in the classroom

[],,oregondete81,,,[],,,,text,t2_18lc99h0,False,False,,"Ive worked in colleges in various positions from staff to faculty. Im not saying this devoid of knowledge about how the system works. 

Students can stage a walkout, but barring an indefinite walkout until policy changes by a significant portion of the student population administrators arent going to change anything. I think for this to be succesful you would need 35%+ of the student population willing to commit to a 2+ week strike. HOWEVER, theyve all paid there bills. So theyre playing chicken with million dollar institutions backed by loans that become more difficult to attain when you dont complete classes or fail classes. Its their money AND future on the line. This is a huge ask of 18-21 year olds. Youre a teacher, how easy is it for a student to catch up on two+ weeks of missed work over their full course load? What if they just dont change policies, do you expect them to pay for a semester of failed or withdrawn classes and that doesnt hurt them at all? 

Faculty can be fired, so has every other professional who has made collective action. Sorry the world works this way, I wish it didnt, but every labor movement has been pushed forward by enough people taking that risk to force the system to change. Consumers didnt get labor laws changed, employees did. I feel that burden should be placed on the professionals who know the most about these institutions and have the most dirtect capability to change policies. 

Sending letters about mask mandates is not everything you can do. Otherwise youd just ask the students to do the same, realizing its the most they can do too. You want students to TAKE ACTION because you realize that has an impact. Students nor faculty writing the administration will change shit. 

If 100% of faculty support mask mandates then it would seem much easier to get them to committ to collective action. Not all students want mask mandates, so youre already losing a percentage of people who would commit to a walkout. If its a consensus amongst faculty but not for students,maybe faculty should bear the burden of changing the policy. 

Im not surprised at all, Ive done it. SOME faculty can be easily replaceable. But you dont replace entire departments. A president would resign on the spot before rehiring an entire institutions worth of qualified faculty. Students would leave immediately, rehiring wouldnt guarentee any students would return, hiring qualified enough faculty to maintain accreditation would be a nearly impossible battle. The institution would collapse OR acquiesce to the faculty demands. Maybe you could even demand better pay and benfits for adjuncts so people working the same job arent left homeless. Maybe the 80% of faculty not in that situation can stand up to make changes for their colleagues who actually are powerless. 

Acting like faculty have no power at universities, thats a chickenshit take. Its tough to make decisions like this, i get that. I respect people who do make that choice and I respect people who feel they cant. I cant respect an educator who puts the responsibility and consequences of protesting an institution on their students when theyre not willing to do anything that risks their jobs or their futures. Do or dont, but dont make it your students responsibility to take a risk you yourself are unwilling to take.",,,,1630165911,{},hap0cjx,False,t3_pcz911,False,True,t1_haoqylw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pcz911/uga_professor_resigns_midclass_after_student/hap0cjx/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,937708aa5e462b2940a8cc82ec40b45ef43f9d14,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1630165927.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Kidding! The good news is that we're not a homogeneous group. Yes, if you are part of the 24 hour news cycle things seem pretty bad. But they're supposed to. There are bad things going on but there are also companies whose entire business model is based on spreading fear.

We can't control anybody but ourselves so the first step is to moderate media consumption. How? By replacing it with something else. Personally, I've gotten into the idea of growing a [permaculture food forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAaHB_wqpIA). I have no ability to do this right now (I rent where there's no usable land to start one) but just the learning and putting the focus on that, specifically that, has been incredibly helpful to my mental health.

Why? Because learning about the ecosystems of forests and [how to mimic them](https://youtu.be/B5NbybtxG7Q?t=103) so that nature does the work to grow an abundance of diverse fruits and vegetables is the exact opposite of what we get from the 24 hour news cycle.

Beyond that, it allows us to have a [genuine impact on the local ecosystem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GJFL0MD9fc) which is, in fact, doing something to combat climate change. And all that extra food is going to have to be shared or sold. Opportunities to create community. It opens you up to being less reliant on just-in-time inventory food centers. Your grocery store is largely in your back yard.

In a larger sense, I think a mass movement for home gardening would make in impact at the societal level, but that's wishful thinking that something like that would happen. Instead, we can only focus on ourselves and for me, the answer is growing a [permaculture food forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChXQ-WMNXVk).",,,,1630171939,{'gid_2': 1},hapebvn,False,t3_pd8mvn,False,False,t1_haoiy01,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pd8mvn/anxiety_depression_poor_mental_health_our_brains/hapebvn/,1630250618.0,59,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Smallpox has existed on earth and been endemic within the human population since around the time that agriculture was first widely adopted in the Fertile Crescent--something like 8000 to 9000 years ago. There is clear genetic evidence that it jumped species from rodents to humans perhaps 5000 years before that during the last glaciation. The switch from hunting/gathering to agriculture allowed settled populations to exist in one place and under far higher densities which in turn caused the virus to be transmitted and multiply at a previously unimaginable rate. It continued to burn through afflicted masses in discrete outbreak waves from that point up to the present day.

You also have other studies claiming 80%+ efficacy(infection, not hospitalization) vs delta variant for Pfizer as well.

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.22.21257658v1

What seems to be the key is the interval between the doses; In the study you quoted, the interval between Pfizer doses was 3 weeks, vs 4 weeks for Moderna.

Recent studies show that longer interval(6-14 weeks) offer twice the immune response vs the delta variant compared to the 3-week interval. Your study showcasing Moderna being better might just be that it's the 4-week(moderna) interval that offer better immune response than the 3-week(pfizer) one.
