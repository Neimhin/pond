But I don't think it is unreasonable to expect things as mass vaccinations to be easier for richer countries. Now, when I look at GDP/capita graphs I see that Spain current development level is about where Sweden was in 2000 and for Portugal the year is about 1993. And Sweden would probably have been better at mass vaccination in 1993 than today, so in a way that tells me that this difference in development is irrelevant for this question. But I find it reasonable that the first idea should be ""Why is this richer country underperforming these other countries"".

You also mentioned Norway: they are obviously at a completely different level ecenomically and have already outperformed us all in terms of deaths due to COVID. This is not a coincidence, they are super rich and competent and have done better than anyone. Since they are not an EU member (and small) they got access to vaccines a bit later, but they have been doing well with vaccinations, although not at the level of Spain and Portugal. 

The richest of all major countries, US, is hugely underperforming in respect to vaccinations. Due to low confidence in government.

While you don’t *need* your appendix to live, it does serve a purpose and you are better off with it than without it. On top of that, surgery of any kind (whether necessary or not) introduces significant risk of complications. *It is not a failure of the medical system that a patient is made to wait before going into surgery when the appendix has not yet burst.*

There are tons of stories on this thread alone of people having to wait hours and hours until their appendix ruptured before being taken to surgery *both before and after Covid.* While I get the point of this article, it’s absolutely ludicrous to say “this person had to wait until their appendix burst to go into surgery and it’s all because of Covid.” If you’re going to make a claim, at least back it up with real evidence rather than a compilation of anecdotes. 

Ever since Covid there has been a huge movement against “false science”, which is fantastic. Unfortunately, despite the claim of this article being something that the majority of people want to see proven, the article itself is a prime example of false science.

[],,manchotendormi,,,,,,[],"It should also be noted that it’s standard practice to observe and monitor patients with acute appendicitis rather than taking them straight to surgery. Appendicitis where the appendix is inflamed but not ruptured can be successfully treated with antibiotics alone 73% of the time according to [this](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/stomach-cramps) article. It can also on occasion resolve itself. 

While you don’t *need* your appendix to live, it does serve a purpose and you are better off with it than without it. On top of that, surgery of any kind (whether necessary or not) introduces significant risk of complications. *It is not a failure of the medical system that a patient is made to wait before going into surgery when the appendix has not yet burst.*

There are tons of stories on this thread alone of people having to wait hours and hours until their appendix ruptured before being taken to surgery *both before and after Covid.* While I get the point of this article, it’s absolutely ludicrous to say “this person had to wait until their appendix burst to go into surgery and it’s all because of Covid.” If you’re going to make a claim, at least back it up with real evidence rather than a compilation of anecdotes. 

Ever since Covid there has been a huge movement against “false science”, which is fantastic. Unfortunately, despite the claim of this article being something that the majority of people want to see proven, the article itself is a prime example of false science. An article should not be given credence based on the popularity of the claim but instead the validity of the evidence it provides and unfortunately, there is no valid evidence here.",,,,1631774176,{},hd1thrj,False,t3_poqczw,False,True,t1_hcyh94n,/r/Coronavirus/comments/poqczw/a_boy_went_to_a_covidswamped_er_he_waited_for/hd1thrj/,1631886549.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_p194aoi,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],,Petal_Chatoyance,,,,,,[],"Viruses have one 'goal', and that is to reproduce and make more viruses. If they kill their hosts quickly, that means less time to reproduce and spread in any given host. The best case scenario for any disease is to become chronic in a host without killing them - a free ride, as it were.

That is a strong evolutionary pressure. Mutations that favor not killing the host, and thus increasing the ability to reproduce - and spread to more hosts - are mutations that are selected for. That is why viruses tend to become less deadly over time.

Unfortunately, that process is random and haphazard as it occurs, and sometimes mutations can make a disease more deadly (Delta Covid is an example of that). It takes time and rolling the viral dice, over and over, until the right mutation happens that is optimal for the virus - and thus better also for the host in terms of survival.

It should be noted that nothing in this means that less deadly also means 'not screwed up for life'. There is little evolutionary pressure to not mess you up - look a polio. An invalid that must be taken care of spreads disease very effectively in the right context.

I don’t think so.  80% of my friends are right around where the Democratic Party is, which is what I’d describe as right of center, and some of my friends are much further to the left. 

If I ask any of them “Is ivermectin a drug that is approved for human use” they would say yes. 

If I ask any of them “is ivermectin still used to treat some diseases in humans” they would say yes. 

If I ask any of them “is there evidence that ivermectin is effective against Covid-19”, that’s where they would say no. 

Most of my friends are also aware of the difference between drugs formulated for human use, versus for animal use. Many of my friends use HeartGard for their dogs to combat heart worm, and that’s ivermectin.  

A lot of my friends also understand that medicine is frequently dosed based on body mass.  A 180 pound human is going to need a different dosage than a 1,000 to 2,000 pound horse. 

I don’t think it’s fair to characterize “liberals” as misunderstanding ivermectin. 

And yes, some doctors have prescribed ivermectin to treat Covid. Especially in Latin America. And there were some reasonable sounding hypotheses about how ivermectin might help people fight off Covid. But there was no evidence, which was the first concern. And now as data has kept rolling in, there IS evidence, and it’s showing that ivermectin does not have a significant impact on people’s ability to fight off Covid. 

There is some new data - https://www.wired.com/story/better-data-on-ivermectin-is-finally-on-its-way/ - that shows some things like fluvoxamine may help fight Covid. But ivermectin does not have a significant impact.  Many of the prior data people were pointing to, like the Elgazzar study that showed ivermectin was 90% effective in curing Covid, we’re found to have faked data, plagiarized sections of the study, duplicate patients that were double counted with only a slight falsification of patient data, etc. https://www.statnews.com/2021/08/25/ivermectin-for-covid-19-abundance-of-hype-dearth-of-evidence/  Removing that one study from the data, but keeping all the other small studies on ivermectin, makes the data look like there is no impact from ivermectin treatment on Covid outcomes. 

The majority of “Liberals” that I know read and research this data, and don’t have “opinions” on ivermectin, except that there’s currently no evidence that ivermectin is useful in treating Covid, and that the CDC and FDA currently don’t recommend ivermectin to treat Covid.",,,,1631793336,{},hd2glpo,False,t3_poqczw,False,False,t1_hczbktu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/poqczw/a_boy_went_to_a_covidswamped_er_he_waited_for/hd2glpo/,1631899429.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_d390ptsl,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If others have been Vaccinated, they aren't effected, if they already recovered, they have immunity surpassing what the Vaccines give you anyway. And 99.98% of people who have this in my age bracket recover. I can prove I had it last year and recovered long before I got poked about 4 months ago.   


**The issue is that I simply believe each of us should have an inviolable, unbreachable right to absolute and perfect secrecy and privacy and choice in our medical records, and that that choice should in no way impact how we participate in society - it never did for decades before this, and shouldn't now**. And this should hold **regardless of the circumstances of wider society.**  


And also : Again, been Vaccinated for months. This is more a philosphical point than anything else.  


Sidebar here - Not everyone actually ""participates in society"" to an equal degree - I have a job I go too, do very well, then I go home and spend 12-16 hours on my PC every night for fun, usually gaming. I have no wife, not many IRL friends, and I keep to myself. I don't go out tot eat anyway, I don't go to movie theaters and haven't for years, and I live in a rural area far away from the hussle and bussle of a larger city. I literally keep to myself and don't talk to anyone at all IRL when not at work.  


And finally, once again, we need to hear the case for natural immunity. Even before I was jabbed (out of choice) I could have proven I had natural immunity with tests. My brother caught it when I was visiting them in Texas at the time (visiting from out of state) and I managed to get it from him while I was visiting. The HEB he worked at had 8 employees get it at once including him. We  both recovered with mild to no effects, and in fact the only reason I know I had it is because weeks later I bought an antibodies test, tested poisitive, and haven't had it again after - not before I was vaccinated, and certainly not after.

It kept raining and now the water had reached his waist. A boat came by and a guy in the boat said: “Hey, jump in. We will take you with us”.
“No thanks”, said the man. “I’m a firm believer in God. He will rescue me”. He sent the boat away.

“No”, said the man. “I’m a firm believer in God. He will rescue me. Don’t worry about me”. The boat sailed away.

It still rained and the water now reached his mouth. A helicopter came by and a guy in the helicopter threw down a rope and said: “Hi there my friend. Climb up. We will rescue you”.
“No”, said the man. “I’m a firm believer in God. He will rescue me. I know he will”. The helicopter flew away.

It kept on raining, and finally the man drowned.

When the man died, he went to heaven. When entering Heaven, he had an interview with God.
After giving a polite greeting and sitting down, the man asked: “Where were you. I waited and waited. I was sure you would rescue me, as I have been a firm believer all my life, and have only done good to others. So where were you when I needed you?”

This is why you've heard the phrase ""herd immunity"". We rely on most getting the vaccine to protect the few unlucky ones. This is how we've eliminated smallpox, as well as polio in the US. Even with breakthroughs, you are still less likely to catch covid after being vaccinated, slowing spread, and providing some protection to more vulnerable who may not be as protected.

This is why some people are so angry at those who refuse to be vaccinated. They are too shortsighted to see, or simply don't care, that their decisions are putting other people at higher risk. In the case of an infectious disease, health is public, and an individual's actions can harm others. They are also putting strain on US health services, causing a need for areas to keep restrictions around to try and manage the surge. Antivaxxers are actually prolonging  the pandemic in the US unnecessarily. We'd as a whole have more ""normalcy"" with a higher vaccine uptake because hospitals wouldn't be as strained. After kids are eligible, we could have even potentially gone back to normal with a higher vaccine uptake.

If you measured the antibodies and Ig*x* in the vaccinated you wouldn't necessarily find that they had decreased by 36%.

What I take issue with is that the 8 month range selected has nothing to do with an optimized vaccination protocol. It just happens to be when the two groups were vaccinated. The groups were vaccinated over a four month period of time and the 8 month measure reflects the date of the earliest vaccinations in the prior and the latest vaccinations in the later group.

Last couple weeks we're vaccinating mainly 12-17yo and 18-24yo. 25y- 49y age group are 89% fully vaccinated and age groups 50yo and above we have 97% and more fully vaccinated. New COVID-19 infections have been declining every week, despite since mid August 100% of new cases are of the more dangerous Delta variant (we were one of the first EU countries was hit by Delta variant).

 Despite this we had mask mandate in streets/outside until this week. Sports events and cultural events still have attendance limitations, restaurants and business still have capacity limitation, government are considering removing mask mandate in closed spaces like businesses next week when we hit 85% of all population fully vaccinated, right now we still have mask mandate in closed spaces. Despite hitting 85% of population vaccinated, kindergarten/preschool will keep limitations and covid measures (I'm parent of young child, I read about that), parents can't enter the building and every worker still have to use mask, not sure about schools, right now there's mandate for everyone - teachers and kids (above 10 yo ) use mask, don't know if it keeps after next week, but I think government will keep mask mandate for schools too.

Vaccination by itself doesn't stop the spread of COVID-19, but high vaccination rates works well to have less infections, and is great reducing people in ICU with covid. Florida, Texas and other republican States had criminal policies opening everything and dropping mask mandates with low vaccination rates. It's really sad to see politics mixed with vaccines and mask use.

[],,weII_then,,,,,,[],"“Oh so because there's more of it, it makes it more important?”

Yes, that’s how immunology works. Less deaths is a good thing. The benefits of getting vaccinated far outweigh the risks. Far, far more people die of covid-19 and its complications than even have adverse shot reactions, so you can take your weird, unrelated Afghanistan argument and shove it where you shoved your double standards. 

“It's all anecdotal”

No, it’s not. You keep using that word. I don’t think it means what you think it means. The facts and the science you can easily find on CDC and local health department websites directly refute so much of the BS you’ve spewed…

“nobody knows what the endgame is and it's a constantly changing narrative because it's an evolving situation.”

For once, yes, that’s accurate. The whole “we demand a solution” isn’t how medicine and science work; you’re setting yourself up for disappointment and anger and you don’t have to do that. This shit isn’t dealing in absolutes and you gotta stop expecting it. The most we can hope for until a silver bullet is found is to take care of ourselves with vaccinations and take care of others by wearing masks and social distancing. Being mad that there isn’t a clear end game is no reason to spread misinformation or deny science and reality.

“Why isn't treatment being pushed?”

It isn’t being pushed because there isn’t an answer yet. Demanding answers doesn’t make them come from thin air. There are literally hundreds of studies trying to find a treatment like we would have for a common cold… you aren’t seeing any news on it because this shit is difficult and nothing has been a  silver bullet yet.

“Everyone's solution is get the vaccine and it's not even a fucking solution.”

If it reduces your risk of hospitalization and death by 10x, then yes, ir totally is a solution.

“No talk of eat healthy, take vitamins, exercise. Fattest fucking country in the world and everybody wants a magic pill or jab to solve all their problems.”

Eating our veggies now won’t help us get healthy enough to beat covid. We need something NOW to lessen the load on our hospitals and healthcare system.

“The news mocks Ivermectin, they even know the truth and history behind it yet only talk about it as a horse paste. Why?”

I trust the fact that no reputable studies have found a link between ivermectin solving the covid-19 problem. You ask yourself: why am I talking about ivermectin, a drug whose ingredients I don’t know whose label clearly says “dewormer” talking about taking a drug that doctors and scientists are telling me not to take? Why am I not in favor of a vaccine, which is literally in, out, take a couple sick days, and now I am far less worried about dying?

“Just check my downvotes :)”

It then is up to policy makers and people to decide what to do with that information. Science itself does not have an inherent morality or suggested path. Science tells us that continued emission of greenhouse gasses will lead to very significant changes in the global climate. The impacts will include increased severity and frequency of wild fires, floods, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves, unstable polar vortexes, along with other severe weather events. Additionally we will see sea level rise, ocean acidification, mass extinction, changes to ocean currents, among other significant impacts. The combined consequence for humanity will be destabilization of the food supply, mass human displacement, economic instability and potential contraction, decreased quality of life, and death. We then choose what to do with that info. It then becomes a moral decision outside science as to whether we stop emitting.

What has happened, especially recently, is that science has given us forecasts for consequences that are obviously terrible, but for one reason or another groups of people want to ignore those forecasts for an agenda. Because of this, people have ascribed a moral imperative to science that tells us we are marching to an obvious doom. The science isn’t making a moral decision or telling you to do anything, we are based on what the science says. With COVID, science tells us COVID kills and hurts people and that masks and vaccines make it kill/hurt way less people. Obviously people dying is bad so we should try to avoid that outcome but some people have an agenda that is violated by the actions needed to avoid that outcome, so they try to ignore what the science says or refute it because people dying in mass is obviously bad. It’s easier to attack or ignore the science than it is to fight the moral battle they will obviously lose. Could you imagine COVID denying politicians saying “We know people will die of COVID and it will clog emergency rooms, we don’t care”. They know that sucks to say, so they either deny, ignore, or fight the science or pick a different battle like one based on personal freedom. People then refute with “follow the science” with respect to prevention measures like masks and vaccines as if the science told them people dying is bad, it didn’t. That is a moral judgement which science didn’t make, albeit an obvious one. You made an obvious and pretty straight forward moral judgement pertaining to the outcome of clear cut science.

Here with boosters, the science tells us the boosters increase protection both from infection and serious disease a non-trivial amount. That’s all the science says. We then have to make the moral decision about whether that increased protection is worth using vaccine in this way and the logistical struggles of distributing more doses domestically. So when people are saying “the science says we don’t need another dose” what they really mean is “I do not believe the extra immunity conferred is worth the cost or risk of giving people another dose”. That’s a moral judgement that science did not make. Some person with their own values, beliefs, background, and agenda did. It is a moral judgement to decide what path with respect to boosters is preferable. Science doesn’t say anything about what you should or shouldn’t do or what is good and what is bad. People making moral judgements do. Science tells us what will happen if I pour boiling water on myself. I choose not to do it because I have ascribed a negative value to the outcome science suggests will happen. We need to disentangle what science says from moral judgements. This helps keep science dispassionate, protects scientists from political influence, and makes decision makers accountable to their moral decisions based on scientific information.",,,,1631766298,{},hd1i5o0,False,t3_poyktr,False,False,t1_hd03807,/r/Coronavirus/comments/poyktr/fda_staff_say_pfizer_covid19_boosters_may_not_be/hd1i5o0/,1631880430.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_93c75wbf,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;And I can assure you, this more than compensates for whatever ""negative sides"" of owning real estate you can imagine.  

Maybe for you. I don't want to be stuck living somewhere I don't like if the value of the property drops and I can't sell it. Do co-ops have some kind of guarantee that owners can leave at the end of a year?

I don't care what rich people do, owning real estate ties you to a community. I don't want that, I don't want to know my neighbors. I've been living in my current place for a year, don't know the name of anyone I share a wall with and like it like that. Not very interested in having to meet with a group of people to make decisions about the building though I imagine that can be handled by email instead of in person.

Renting means I can pick up and move to the other side of the country or down the street at the end of the lease. Buying property doesn't afford me that freedom. The way I look at it the lack of equity is the price I pay for that freedom.

I'd much rather see public housing be available to multiple income levels so I could live in a comparable place to what I have now for the same price and still be able to move when I want.

If we had an outbreak of a hyper contagious ebola strain or had covid been as deadly as the original SARS, there's no way they could ever move fast enough to respond effectively.   It doesn't seem that they understand that doing nothing is just as risky as moving too fast.

Just in the last few months! Even if we give them some slack for messing up early on, when this was a brand new crisis and everyone was confused! 18 months in and they still shoot themselves in the foot over and over again!

Just an example.

&amp;#x200B;

The FDA will approve shots for children under 12. They will approve 2 doses of Pfizer at about 1/3 of the dose adults get for kids 5-11. Thousands of children have gotten these shots over months. They know what potential side effects there are. 100 million over 12 in the US alone have gotten the shots. They know it is pretty safe and effective.

So they could offer it to parents who will sign a waiver **right now** as school has started and huge amounts of children are infected every single week. Every. single. week. 

But they don't. They need more data. Always ""more data"". We don't have time for them to fulfill their data needs, It is a crisis. They need to stop worrying about scaring the ""vaccine hesistant"". 

Fact: there is almost no chance that vaccines will not be approved for children. A whole bunch of kids would need to end up dead and that hasn't happened.

And he, his wife, and one of their kids caught delta.  He needed convalescent antibody treatment.  Said it sucked, but also said “it’s the exact same for my vaccinated buddy.”

There’s a logical fallacy name for ignoring degrees of severity, but I can’t remember what it’s called.

The whole “fewer people are affected, and fewer people are affected severely” just bounces off.

In other things, the guy is smart and competent.  Covid just reaches into some severe paranoia / persecution / anti-control hole in some people and makes them blind, resistant to information, and downright cognitively impaired.

I care about people, and even the idiots, I do not want them to suffer.  

But I think out of fairness, unvaccinated people should have a penalty added to their insurance the same as smokers do.

Also, I think unvaccinated people should be at the bottom of the hospital triage list, and not eligible to use a 10% per-hospital reserve capacity.

I don’t know how, but something needs to be done for care workers.  Especially RTs dealing with so much dying and stress.  People are quitting, and suffering empathy fatigue, and increased substance abuse.

That being said, I think it'll make a solid dent, but not a massive sell-off that would crash prices. Boomers are living longer.

I do think the market at large will cool off the most once 1) rates start going back up, 2) COVID dies down, 3) labor shortages force immigration policy to change (be more favorable to low skilled labor), 4) housing starts (new constructions) really start gaining steam as builders look to make money and take advantage of things and 5) new construction techniques disrupt the market by making it cheaper (modular homes, robotic construction, etc).

That could all take a while though, but I think this is a special situation in some ways. It's like the perfect storm. A massive generation newly hungry for houses to build a family in, interest rates that make mortgages attractive (even with costs of buying), a once in a generation pandemic and WFH movement forcing people to bigger spaces, and a once in a generation financial crisis that completely annihilated the housing sector (2008). This was bound to happen, really. Builders overcorrected and stopped building in 08, and labor became more and more expensive and restricted. A pandemic was the perfect match to light that fire.

All that's happened already.  Hospitals all across the country are already running at 110 - 140% of technical capacity, having converted every available bed, started treating people in hallways, and cancelling all non-emergency care.  There's now nowhere to go to absorb the continuing increase in covid cases in many places.  There are no more beds to reserve for vaccinated people.  They cut those to the minimum they expected to need, to free up beds for covid patients and if you happen to present for care at a time where more than the minimum expected number of other vaccinated, non covid related emergency need other patients are there, there's nowhere to put you until someone dies or is discharged.  And the quality of care for those folks is being compromised, because discharges are happening sooner than normal, to help make that room.
 
That's what happened to this kid, who waited all those hours for someone to make room for him.  Covid has pushed hospitals across the country to use up every bit of theoretical capacity they have, and to make difficult choices to reduce their theoretical ""reserve"" in order to make room for patients presenting with an emergency need for care for covid. And when you show up with a non covid emergency need of any kind, you're out of luck, right along side all the additional covid people coming in.

I dispute that because many anti-vaxxers actually _do_ belong to a racial group that has been subject to many government demands. Black Americans _do_ have the context you're alleging white Americans lack, yet they're reacting in similar ways.   
  
I think a better explanation is a lack of education, and more specifically how a lack of education leaves you vulnerable to conspiracy theories. This accounts for why both poor white Americans _and_ poor Black Americans are resistant to the vaccine, because both groups for various historical reasons have not been able to receive high quality educations.

So why they went and blew the budget like that to where they could barely afford to send one student to the competition when they normally would have had way more students attending is anyone's guess.

My Spanish courses were all like that. I hated public speaking, and the teacher hated me. She would intentionally make the exams be public speaking, reading off of notecards, so that the sports kids could pass easily (some of them were actually quite smart, they just blew off the class). Even then, she still had to curve the grades so much that I could sit out on the big test that was weighted more into our grade each progress report cycle and still average at least a 95.

&gt; Broward County’s mayor announced Wednesday that the county will give bonuses to vaccinated employees and charge unvaccinated ones as part of a tactic to boost vaccination rates while navigating a state mandate that bars local governments from requiring COVID-19 vaccines.

&gt; Mayor Steve Geller said during a news conference Wednesday that all fully vaccinated employees will receive a one-time $500 bonus, and that all unvaccinated employees will see a $20 surcharge on their biweekly paycheck and will be required to get a weekly COVID-19 test. The bonuses and surcharges only apply to county employees receiving benefits, he said.

&gt; “I refer to this as the carrot and twig approach because it’s not a huge stick,” Geller said.

&gt; The new rule will go into effect no later than October 1 and will include a 60-day incentive period for employees to get their shots, Geller said.

&gt; After the 60 days, those who have not shown proof of vaccination will begin paying the biweekly surcharge. Employees who get vaccinated after the incentive period will see the surcharge disappear from their next paycheck, but there will not be any back pay.

&gt; If at the end of the year, the county finds that an overwhelming percentage of employees are vaccinated, “we will leave it at that,” Geller said.

&gt; He said the policy is meant to encourage employees to be fully vaccinated and to “take into account the healthcare-related costs associated with COVID-19-positive unvaccinated employees.”

&gt; Geller said he did not know what percent of the roughly 6,800 county employees are vaccinated.

&gt; The announcement came two days after Gov. Ron DeSantis said Florida will fine local governments $5,000 for each employee who is required to be vaccinated, threatening some cities and counties with millions of dollars in penalties for adopting strict vaccine “mandates.”

&gt; DeSantis’ office did not immediately comment and referred questions to the Florida Department of Health.

&gt; Gainesville, Orange County and Leon County have each passed requirements that employees be vaccinated or be fired, with exemptions for religious or medical reasons.

&gt; Geller said the county is trying to work in compliance with both the governor’s executive order and state laws.

&gt; “We believe we have the legal right to do more if this is not sufficient,” Geller said. “We are trying this first step to try and get us where we need to go.”

That’s still being determined.

At least, it does it this way with most other illnesses in healthy people and, again, this is something science is racing to figure out.          A test like this may have some benefit to check, just a few weeks after vaccination for antibodies in cases (like mine) where there is reason to suspect the vaccine did not ‘take’ due to illness or medication or frailty. But even that is a very imperfect window into that problem, but if that’s the only window you have, it nsy have some value.           It might also, depending on what we find out about antibody levels, help detect who is vaccinated.

&gt; How do vaccine effectiveness studies differ from vaccine efficacy studies?

&gt;Vaccine efficacy refers to vaccine protection measured under optimal conditions where vaccine storage and delivery are monitored and participants are usually healthy. Vaccine efficacy is determined in RCTs, usually clinical trials. Vaccine effectiveness measures how well a vaccine works in real-world conditions.

If the flu shot is 39% effective like it was in 2019-2020, it would be 60% effective in reducing serious illness in only 39 out of every 100 people that were given the shot. Which is 23.4% in real world conditions.

Is she alive? Yes, of course. Has her life quality gone back to the level it was before she got sick? No and as far as anyone can foresee it's unlikely to do so.

She has 2 kids who don't qualify for the Pfizer vaccine yet because they are under the age of 12. She isn't really worried they would die of COVID-19 - the total number of kids who died from COVID-19 in the whole course of the pandemic in Poland is 5 and 3 of those had severe preeexisting conditions.

But this doesnt have to be necessary if current vaccine still protects well:

&gt; The CEO of BioNTech, the German company that developed a COVID-19 vaccine with Pfizer, told DW that the biotech firm's existing treatment is likely to work on the newly discovered, more contagious strain of the virus. A new vaccine would ""technically"" take six weeks to develop, says Ugur Sahin, but mandatory testing means it would be much longer before it could be used to inoculate people. https://www.dw.com/en/new-coronavirus-strain-vaccine-can-be-developed-in-6-weeks-says-biontech-ceo/av-56034578

Yes, people getting vaccinated increases pressure on the virus as its habitat is shrinking. It's like cutting down a forest. The less forest there is, the less likely something living in the forest is to survive.

And the forest analogy goes even further: if the forest is cut down slowly enough, animals living inside the forest are given time to evolve such that they can live outside the forest.

And this is the biggest problem with anti-vaxxers: They are breeding grounds for the virus (they are infected more strongly and for longer periods of time, giving the virus the opportunity for mutations to accumulate and infect other people). It is only a matter of time until a mutation occurs that can get around the anti-bodies of the vaccine (and also of those that had Covid as the immune system reacts on the same spike protein). And then we will have to start the whole process of getting a new vaccine developed again.

The longer this shitty situation goes on, the higher the probability is, that such a mutation occurs.

Oh, and by the way: the delta variant is a good example of such a mutation and that it does not need vaccinated people. It was first identified in India in December 2020. Long before anyone there had been vaccinated.

Even though I may disagree with you on the particulars of what should be publicly available or not, I completely understand your argument.  When all of the data is laid bare, you will have shills, ignorant people, and conservative talk show hosts abusing data to no end to try to make their points (which are not in the publics benefit).

That being said, although that can be chaotic in the short-term, I think it all works itself out in the long run, in that given enough time it becomes more and more obvious who is abusing data and who is interpreting it correctly.  Trust is built over time, but if the data isn't on record, or available, it is hard to verify that someone's decision, based on that data, was a reasonable decision (I'm thinking CDC or similar here). I don't see a strong argument for hiding data, especially raw data, as long as it has been adequately stripped of any personal data and is represented accurately in what it contains and doesn't contain.

Although I may not tell my mechanic how to fix my engine, I do feel the need to be literate enough about vehicles (if I am going to drive one) to have an idea of when my mechanic is trying to pull a fast one and charge me $5k for something which should be closer to $3k, or not even required at all.

Think of last year's covid-19 as classic apple pie (wild-type and alpha). Lots of people got it and it's pretty popular starting in March of 2020. Now masking and social distancing recommendations came out as the mortality rates spiked so people stayed away from apple pie until around the Fourth of July ('Murrica) and it saw a resurgence in popularity. It died down again for a bit because people remembered it, and then it got popular again for the holidays. The thing about classic apple is that it was good, but not so good that people couldn't resist taking a slice if they went around others with it.

Now last fall/holiday season covid-19 was like hey, I'm great as classic apple pie, but lets go for Dutch Apple because everyone loves crumble topping and it seems to be crushing it in India. Dutch apple is Delta.

So Dutch Apple Delta (DAD) comes out in the US as early as March 2021. Now people enjoyed classic apple, but they're going absolutely gangbusters over DAD. It is based off the classic apple, but has additional things (crumble topping = spike protein mutations) that makes it so much more popular (communicable). It is a similar **but different** product. DAD evolved from the classic apple and has its properties plus some new features of its own. 

That's what you're talking about: two related, but different products because one is the next generation. That's why the papers sourced from data pertaining to last year's classic apple (wild-type and alpha) aren't necessarily great resources when talking about the Dutch Apple that hit store shelves this year.

In a new study published on Sept. 15 to a preprint server—the study is not yet peer-reviewed—researchers at Moderna, which makes one of the two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (the other is from Pfizer-BioNTech), report that people vaccinated within the last eight months had 36% fewer breakthrough infections than those who were vaccinated a year ago.  
That suggests vaccine-induced immunity is likely highest shortly after people get their recommended two doses of the vaccine, and starts to drop afterward. The Moderna vaccine received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in Dec. 2020; the FDA is currently reviewing the company’s request for full approval of the shot.

[],,GlobusGlobus,,,,,,[],"There are many reasons for this. One is that we went strictly age group by age group. But I would say that the main reason is that in Sweden the consensus among medical professionals is that it is always morally wrong to vaccinate with the goal to lower spread. Earlier in the pandemic there was an opinion that children never got seriously ill. In such a situation vaccination of children would have been only made to limit spread and would have been impossible in Sweden. The average population would probably have given support, but high ranking doctors would have rioted and written opinion piece after opinion piece on the immorality of vaccinating kids not for personal safety, but to stop spread only. There hase already been quite a few of these opinion pieces in Sweden filled with anger predicated on the fact that there might be vaccination of kids only to limit spread!

Now there is clear evidence on long COVID for a large portion of kids, so now the the Swedish health agencies can clearly make the case that the vaccination is done specifically to increase safety for the individual child.

I think the situation has been similar in Norway, there it is was decided last week to give children only one dose (in Sweden there will be two). But outside of the Nordic countries the debate seems to be different, perhaps the view on vaccination in the medical profession is different elsewhere. It seems to me that the view in healthcare is a bit more individual here than in other areas (I could be wrong.).",,,,1631800819,{},hd2vf7q,True,t3_ppbgrr,False,False,t1_hd2o7ik,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ppbgrr/sweden_children_between_12_and_15_years_of_age/hd2vf7q/,1631907610.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_i22apm2,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At this stage, it's hopefully too late to be necessary. At any earlier stage of the pandemic, it would have been a nice alternative if it let us return more people, as hotel quarantine spots are strictly limited, and that's caused huge problems for Australians abroad that want to come home.

No one, that I have seen, is advocating it for contact tracing or regular domestic purposes. Only border crossings, as an alternative to managed quarantine systems.

Quarantine has been the cost of *not* losing 0.2% of our population as the US has to this disease, harm countless others, and has allowed states that have managed it well to opt out of basically this entire pandemic.

Nearly everyone who has died from COVID likely had antibodies, their bodies just didn't produce enough or they had comorbidities.

It's a completely pointless endeavor because by time they show up it's too late to do anything to mitigate the severity of the infection: they're either going to have a mild case or a severe case and all you can do is try to keep them alive.

My husband had a mask on and the assturd neighbor who knew I had 4.5 mos long haul shit went into my husband’s face giving him shit for wearing a mask.

A 5 point harness helps even more than a regular lap and shoulder belt.  A helmet and a HANS device helps even more.  We don't mandate any of those things because we as a society make a choice that a certain amount of risk is acceptable relative to the burden of something that would reduce the risk.  It's usually quantifiable.

I can't even get anyone to tell me their own opinion on the quantifiable benefit from a vaccinated person wearing a low quality cloth mask, let alone any sort of study or scientific paper discussion the quantifiable benefit.  With masks, we're just supposed to accept that any amount of benefit, no matter how much, is enough to justify a mandate, while we don't do that in any other part of society.

Those additional icu beds aren’t normally required for general healthcare and there are always free beds available. 

Outside of for profit healthcare, I don’t think many countries have double the icu capacity they need.  

In the us hospitals are owned  and run as different identities , atleast that’s my understanding vs in Canada where hospitals are owned /run by the government so icu capacity is spread/adjusted across all hospitals in a province while in the Us it’s not. 


So for example in my province of 1.4 million there were ~74 icu beds with one nurse assigned to each bed for normal care and additional icu beds for after surgery care etc.  Icus run at say 80%-95% Capacity that fluctuates based on people coming in, recovering and moving out of the icu or dying.   It’s not typical that Icu care last weeks. Anyhow They increased the icu capacity to 140 available beds, doubling the amount of icu capacity as required but that means taking highly trained nurses off surgery recovery  meaning surgeries get cancelled.     We could triple icu beds theoretically as we have the room, but what we and nobody else has is highly trained icu nurses to staff those beds on a one to one basis so they shifted to 1 nurse per 2-3 patients which lowers the quality of care.   You can’t scale up icu nurses as it’s takes 6months to a year ontop of being a registered nurse which is 2-4 year post secondary school degree.  The requirements for nursing in Canada is higher then in the us based on all thr issue I see with us nurses that have moved to Canada and require additional schooling before being certified in some instances. 

High daily cases of Covid means higher icu admissions because 2-5% of Covid patients require icu care and support and when you consider These icu patients tend to stay in the icu for weeks or months before recovering or dying that means people aren’t being cycled out of icu as fast as people are coming in. 

So in normal  no-covid times icu bed capacity is not An issue as it can be spun up or down based on needs at the expense of some surgeries etc.   But having capacity for a prolonged pandemic that comes around once every 100 years isn’t something you pay to have that capacity on standby.",,,,1631748481,{},hd0iavx,False,t3_ponrtt,False,True,t1_hd09bmw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ponrtt/canada_alberta_healthcare_system_on_verge_of/hd0iavx/,1631862828.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_4d7ne,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was having abdominal pain for two days and it coincided with my period so I thought it was that bad. But then I couldn’t walk because of the pain so my husband said we’re going. Last time I was in the ER, they treated me like a hypochondriac so really didn’t want to go especially around that time when vaccines were not available for my age group.

Went to the closest ER to avoid the COVID crowd. I think they would not have moved me up if I had not been almost rolling on the floor in pain. First thing they did was the appendix test and it hurt like hell. They ordered imaging (I didn’t see it) but my husband thought that they already knew my appendix burst by then (he has some EMT background so he asked some questions that led him to believe that). That hospital does not have an emergency surgery facility and they just barely closed when we got the imaging and negative COVID test results back. They had to transfer me to the main hospital (the one we avoided going to) to get surgery. 

Once at the hospital, they didn’t know where to put me yet. They also have someone in the operating room. They said to wait a couple of hours. I forgot to say that my husband wasn’t with me anymore since he’s caring for our son at home. The couple of hours changed to 4 hours. It was already 3am and I haven’t eaten nor drank anything. Finally, I was told that the person in the OR was in bad shape so they were there for 12 hours. I had surgery the very morning but had to do the antibiotics and be stuck in the hospital longer.

222 patients at a Teaching hospital in New York city were evaluated from March 12 – Apr. 13 2020 with a follow up on May 12, 2020 if they were still hospitalized. The authors examined the treatment regiments and outcomes of patients that required intubation, non-invasive ventilation (NIV), and initially were started on NIV but then required intubation at some point in their hospitalization. Of the 222, a total of 135 (61%) required intubation, with 44 (21%) of the 135 patients initially starting with NIV then proceeding to intubation. Of the patients requiring intubation the mortality rate was 82% (n = 112). To break it down further, for initial intubation the mortality rate was 82% (n = 75) and NIV to intubation was 84% (n = 37). 

[Journal of Community Hospital Internal Medicine Perspectives](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20009666.2020.1830516) 

Single center retrospective cohort study involving adult patients in ICU (n = 132) with Covid-19 from March 3 – April 22 2020. Overall mortality 69% (n = 92), 78% (n = 104) required mechanical ventilation, of those that required mechanical ventilation 24 survived and 80 did not survive (76% mortality if requires mechanical ventilation). Patient population from acute care community hospital in North New Jersey area. 

Last side note, I probably should not have been as vague as to say “most of my intubated patients.” I would appreciate it if you would stop referencing 80% which I never said. Without hard data (that unfortunately was not made available to us from management or leadership) I didn’t want to put a number to it. Gun to my head I would estimate approximately 60-70% of my intubated patients earlier in the pandemic and it probably dropped to around the high 40’s towards when I left a few weeks ago. Take this with a grain of salt though as this is an estimate of my experience and as I demonstrated above it is a single data point in an ocean of information that needs to be analyzed.

  
Which is kind of my overall point: throwing one number out there from a study a year and a half old when new data is flowing in literally sometimes by the hour isn’t a good idea in these settings. Context makes a lot of difference when evaluating this kind of information and in its absence things get misinterpreted which can easily lead to misinformation.

[],,DiprivanDapper,,,,,,[],"Okay sorry this took me a bit. So real quick, after searching through several journals and search engines I wasn’t able to find anything specific in the way of Delta vs. Alpha vs. Wild type variant and their mortality rates for mechanical intubation. I’m sure that the data is floating around out there, but I’m honestly not sure if it has been pulled from healthcare systems and analyzed yet (at least in a place that is publicly available that I am aware of). Peer-reviewed articles take time to write due to the process of forming the hypothesis, creating the study methods, collecting and analyzing the data, and the peer-review process which (from what I have heard) can be a massive headache. There will likely be studies coming out over the next couple years that are able to give us answers to this question, but at the moment I’m not aware that they exist. **If anyone else in the comments has any references to recent studies about this question please feel free to link them!**

  
That being said, let’s talk about a few things for context because as I was reading and looking for articles, I starting to consider how this is a bit like comparing apples and oranges at the moment with the data available.  
  
**Overall Covid-19 numbers for the US as of 09/14/2021**  
[Hopkins](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/): US confirmed cases 41, 478, 328; deaths 665, 870  
[Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us): cases 42,379,837; deaths 684, 063  
[WHO](https://covid19.who.int/): cases 41, 066, 110; deaths 657, 114  
  
**Couple dates to note:**  
Delta variant first identified in US in March 2021 ([https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2783478](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2783478))  

  
Delta-plus variant first identified in US in May 2021 ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896841121001232](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896841121001232))

  
[PRoVENT-COVID study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30459-8/fulltext) is published online on 10/23/2020. It evaluated ventilation management in patients with Covid 19 and was a national, retrospective observational study done at 18 ICUs in the Netherlands that evaluated patients between Mar 1 and Apr 1, 2020. It basically looked at a bunch of clinical variables (ventilator settings, patient vital signs, proning therapy and various treatments, etc.) and the subsequent patient outcomes. Intensivists used this study to make new treatment recommendations including proning therapy parameters which we weren’t using early on in the pandemic.  
  
For the study you sourced I looked at the WHO data for the weeks included. Then I looked at the numbers a year later (when Delta first hit) and compared. The thing that stood out the most to me was that the death rates were so similar even though the total confirmed cases were so much higher in 2021. So, to credit your comment above, yes as we learned we were able to treat more effectively; however, this was also coming off of the tail end of the holiday season in 2021 so we were likely to see a spike in confirmed cases and deaths. The thing about Delta is that it doesn’t necessarily hit the body systems harder, but it is more communicable so you’re going to see a higher case rate statistically and that is where our hospitals have been running into trouble. Additionally the death rates being so high in March and April of 2020 was because it was the very beginning of the pandemic hitting the US and we didn’t know to treat with things like proning therapy and IV steroids (there were actually preprint articles earlier on based on previous, but the best data on hand at the time, that said we shouldn’t use steroids with covid…oops). So as far as the comparison between mechanical ventilation and which is strain is worse (wild type or delta), again can’t really be teased apart with these factors (at least by me).

Now, I do want to address your initial number of 35.7% that you referenced above. Here are a few studies that show very different numbers depending on the geographical location and facility type for that time frame.  
  
[American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.202006-2405OC)   
Authors examined patient cases between Jan 1 and July 8, 2020 from 69 studies across 23 countries (total 121, 009 patients of which 57, 420 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation or IMV): Case fatality rate (CFR) for IMV overall was 45% across all 69 studies, however 54 of the studies included patients still in the hospital at the conclusion of the study. For these 54 studies the range of lowest possible to best possible hospital CFR was from 43% to 64% (though the authors say 67% in the discussion section, so between 64-67%). Among patients with a known hospital outcome the definitive hospital CFR was 56%. They also mention the potential for outliers of older patients not receiving IMV for various reasons and therefore would not have been captured in the analysis.

Canada can handle and has handled covid very well by balancing measures to restrict infections vs hospitals resources.. I think MB is the only province that shipped patients to multiple provinces for care.  But in comparison to the the load that the USA dealt with, no we would have been crushed.. But as you said the vast majority of Canadians separate science and medicine from Politics and i think in general have a much better quality public school system. 

Comparing rural healthcare to larger city centers isn't  really a fair comparison as rural hospitals do not have the population density to justify trama specialists that would address all circumstances.   There are many many people in the us that have suffered worse by health care.


Insurance  can be deducted from you paycheques in the USA but with all my co-workers in the USA they have CO-pays, deductibles they have to cover before insurance kicks and god forbid you go to an in network hospital and have an out of network dr treat you.  I have co-workers have have paid beyond 10k multiple times because of these situations and as i understand it, the health insurance the us division of my company has is better then most in their experience.

In Mantioba, getting a Doctor doesnt take long at all.. Mine Retired and i switched to my Wife/kids general Dr whos highly rated without issue. All of my friend have switched Drs as their retired without any issues and atleast in my case i could have transferred to the DR that came in when mine retired.  On friend is had a couple of months to find a new one but used walkins until they got them and didn't have issues.  To be fair i have not used rural hospitals more then a few times and the service was always good but they were not life threatening :D 

Pharmaceutical companies are monster corporations down there, and they made up 40% of research published in some large journals (older data) But some of that is other countries having reasearch labs at US universities and ALOT of research is done by large universities and publish.   But discounting the amount of  research and advancements contributed by publically funded/single payer heath care in the rest of the 1st world would be silly and your talking point is one used to justify private healthcare when its really about population numbers and the amount of schools that contribute to that research.

[],,damnsignins,,,,,,,"My mom's kidneys failed last year in May. They barely managed to get her a bed because of COVID patients. 

She was on a ventilator for two weeks. The nurses did they best they could to take care of her, but its wasn't easy because they were swamped with COVID patients.

After two weeks of ventilation and dialysis, they were able to get her breathing independently again (with continued dialysis) and moved from the Critical care unit. They started her on physical therapy. She'd developed ICU dysphoria from being kept in a medication induced coma for the duration. They said it would got away after a couple of weeks. It didn't. It had accelerated the development of dementia. 

The nurses tried their best to be on top of her care, but they barely kept up because the hospital was packed with COVID patients trying to recover.

After two weeks, the hospital was required to discharge her because insurance stated she was in severe risk anyone. She had to transfer her to a sister hospital because a majority of skilled nursing facilities has become active COVID patients only.

After two weeks at the sister hospital's skilled nursing care department, she had to be transferred out again because the loophole they used with her insurance to keep her the ran out. They managed to find her a bed at a skilled nursing facility.

Within the first two weeks of being transferred there she had gone blind. She was taken to optometrist and he said her blood pressure had dropped below normal so many times that she had eye strokes that had damaged her eye nerves and chases were she's never see again.

The nurses at all the facilities over the past eight weeks had been so busy with COVID patients that they weren't able to provide the level of care on observation that would have helped maintain her blood pressure with medicine. She'd struggled with high blood pressure for nearly a decade, but lost her vision to low blood pressure...

She was in and out of the ER repeatedly during this period and was being transported to DaVita facilities for dialysis treatments three times a week. Most of the skilled nursing facilities with in-house dialysis were COVID patients only, and the one they managed to get her into didn't have in-house dialysis. 

On July 22nd, 2020, my mom went into cardiac arrest at a DaVita dialysis facility, mid-treatment. They resuscitated her and got her into an ambulance. She had a second cardiac arrest on the way to hospital. 

My mom died at 6:24am on July 23rd, 2020. She spent the last month of her life in a skilled nursing facility, blind, surrounded by strangers, barely coherent because of early onset demntia  completely isolated from family and friends because of COVID-19 procedures designed to protect patients from people infected wit COVID-19. 

My mom went through 10 weeks of pure hell. She experienced her worst nightmare. Everything she told me she never wanted to live through for decades. And most of it can be contributed to COVID patients flooding the hospitals. She received diminished healthcare for weeks because of overpacked medical centers dealing with people who couldn't mask, isolate and wash their hands.

I am in Alberta - where the article says we currently have four pregnant ICU patients - but I still talk regularly to people who just refuse to even believe that younger people (eg 20-50) are at risk right now with delta ripping through. Maybe as our average death is still skewed higher, but I think some will just continue to refuse to believe unless it’s them - and these aren’t even all anti-vaxxers I am speaking too, they are people who support triage with unvaccinated being a factor, etc.  I really think the inability to “see” what is happening in the hospitals and ICUs, to “see” who is occupying those beds, to “see” what happens to those patients bodies as the disease ravages through, is doing a really disservice to people’s understanding of what is happening right now. 

Our ICUs here are overwhelmed, electives all cancelled again, we are going back into several restrictions again even with something around 79% eligible 12+ with at least one shot (something like 71-72% 12+ fully vaccinated) and bringing in vaccine passports. It’s going to be a long few months to get things maybe under control again.  I do feel it’s going to be at minimum a couple more years before we can even talk about this being endemic as we are now still just dealing with roller coaster after roller coaster due to opening things back up to early when too many are still refusing to do their part.

Meanwhile I had to watch a bunch of FIRST RESPONDERS protesting vaccine mandates from their employers yesterday. 

Sorry for long rant, it’s early in the morning but I am just so angry at those who continue their anti-vax, Covid denialism, etc and putting so much pressure on healthcare, and the rest of us who also suffer for their “faith over fear” crap.

&gt; If we define ""wet"" as a sensation that we get when a liquid comes in contact with us, then yes, water is wet to us.

J&amp;J indeed uses an adenovirus, but it is essentially used as a vessel to contain genetic code to make Covid spike proteins. 

mRNA does the same thing, but instead the instructions are suspended in lipid nanoparticles. This is also the reason they have to be kept so cold.

The above data lets me see the probability for a young person how is healthy and vaccinated is extremely low. As you can see from the CDC website below less than 15,000 people died under 40. A quick Google search yields 166 million people are in the US under 40. This means that the probability of dying from covid under forty. This means that 1 in 11,066 people in my age group died from covid. If you add excellent health you cut that by 66%. To 1 in 33,535. While exact data is not available for the true number of deaths in vaccinated people it is incredibly rare. The CDC says it is something like 11 times less likely. This would then make my risk to be 1 368,888. I actually think the risk is somewhat lower than this, but I am comfortable with that risk. By the way, according to the national weather service, the chance of being struck by lightning is 1 in 1.22 million.

Reducing the active ingredient would have a negligible impact on production so long as the bottleneck remains fill and finish which it is. 

The reason they are reducing the active dose is because more noticeable side effects were received from the Moderna vaccine. The increase in active ingredient may or may not have triggered a stronger, more robust long term immune response - but the high dose probably isn't needed for a booster. So if it means people get fewer side effects, then that is positive. 

Keep in mind that there are concerns about myocarditis with these vaccines. If Moderna was linked to slightly higher rates of myocarditis, then it would be logical to reduce dosage if it was not believe that - at least for boosters - it would likely drive much difference in immune response. 

All else being equal - and while I truly doubt this is the primary driver of this - keep in mind that Moderna is entirely dependent on the emergent mRNA vaccine field.

It is my understanding that a vaccine would make your body produce antibodies to only the spike protein.  In a natural response to the virus, your body would take a look at the actual virus and produce antibodies for various structures it encounters on the outside of the virus, some of these being more effective than others.

Edit  because I didn't mean to post so soon - 

&amp;#x200B;

At the very least

1. It depends on the Antibody test
2. Doctors aren't prescribing antibody tests unless medically relevant (i.e. you have some long-covid symptoms and want to get to the bottom of the issue)

[],,LongjumpingMessage36,,,,,,[],"I agree with what you’re saying. The problem with stuff like this is the kernels of truth. People who say “we’re all going to get it anyway” aren’t wrong. We will all - most of us at least - eventually be exposed to a sufficiently high number of virus particles that would cause disease in us unless we have a prior immunity (and sometimes will cause disease even if we do already have some immunity). 

The problem is that people who say that usually mean “we’re all going to get it anyway, so what’s the point of delaying, let’s just stop masks and stop testing and stop vaccines, get everyone infected, and then it will be endemic and we will be at a new normal level of life in the world, rather than having to regularly consider new facts as they appear”. I mean, to the extent that their opinions are thought through well enough to form a thought like that.  

The goal of the medical community and public health messaging is also to get to a point where enough people have either a disease acquired or vaccine induced immunity. BUT, they also recognize that if we were all to immediately get exposed, sending let’s say 10% of America’s non-immune population to the hospital, that’s probably ~150 million non immune people and let’s say 15 million hospital visits. We can’t handle that in the son of a few weeks. We have around 900k total hospital beds (not ICU beds). The death rate would NOT be 1% or 2% of cases if people can’t access medical treatment, it might be 5 or 10%.  So what the medical and public health communities are doing is saying that we need to SLOWLY spread the virus (by masking, distancing, etc.), until a significant percentage of the population has immunity from vaccination or disease acquired sources. Then we can hopefully move forward from this. 

So - sure. There’s kernels of truth in saying “everyone’s going to get it anyway”.

False. Unvaccinated people ARE harming people.

* Unvaccinated people are more likely to get/spread COVID. 
* Unvaccinated people are more frequently ending up in the hospital, taking away care from other people (cancer patients, heart attack patients, etc.). Just see all the recent news of states rationing care, cancelling surgeries, postponing treatment, because the hospitals are full of mostly unvaccinated COVID patients. 
* Unvaccinated are preventing herd immunity, putting immunocompromised /suppressed people at an increased risk for contracting and dying from COVID. Sure, some of these people can advocate for themselves and get the vaccine, but their bodies may not produce enough antibodies. They depend on society to protect them.
* Sure, we can wait for natural herd immunity, but while we wait for the virus to burn through communities, many people die that don't need to and didn't ask to. The grandparent with a lower immune response to the vaccine simply because of age. The patient with an autoimmune disease who can't take the vaccine or has a lower immune response to the vaccine because of the steroids they have to take. The cancer patient whose MRI or tumor removal was cancelled, leading their cancer to spread and become less treatable. That's just deaths. What about the long-covid harm? The psychological harm on healthcare workers?  The psychological harm on family members who lose 1, 2,3+ loved ones. The harm on the child who grows up without their dad?

The numbers that are thrown around for efficacy, 65%,72%, 89%, etc. are actually the combination or average of a bunch of different numbers. Vaccines have different levels of efficacy against 1) infection, 2) serious illness/hospitalization, and 3) death. There is a lot of variance in how effective the vaccines are against simple infection or mild illness, but not much difference for serious illness or death. Basically, the more serious the outcome, the more effective all of the vaccines are, statistically speaking. But, for whatever reason this gets boiled down to a single number so like ""62%"" is an average or combination of all of these numbers.

Also the differences in efficacy are most pronounced among the elderly with health conditions, who are the ones that are most often hospitalized. Like note ""average age 65"" in that study.

Except in Mississippi and West Virginia, members of these churches and other people who have religious beliefs against immunizations can be exempted from school immunization requirements.

Although there are few religions with an absolute objection to vaccines, there are many more groups within other religions who are opposed to getting their kids and themselves vaccinated, which helps explain some of the outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases that have occurred recently.

These religious groups include:

Some Amish
Some Dutch Reformed churches
Some Muslim fundamentalists

I am all for hearing out someone's Constitutional rights, no matter how contrived I expect it to be. When two sides each think the other is completely unreasonable is exactly when it's time to step back and imagine how it will play out in court. 

There's a yahoo article on this saying their claim is a ""religious conviction to oppose any involvement in abortion"" and ""all COVID-19 vaccines use cell lines derived from fetal tissue in their development, production, or testing.""

The quoted phrasing is important because they're not claiming the vaccines *contain* aborted fetus cells. The claim they're making about the development is so broad that it's true enough to be problematic for them. 

([source](https://www.science.org/news/2020/06/abortion-opponents-protest-covid-19-vaccines-use-fetal-cells) time) 

The vaccines were developed in part using elective abortive fetal cell lines, and yes some high up Catholic figures like Archbishops are opposing this, in spite of the Pope's well known support. I don't know how the Court's interpretation of the structure of Catholicism will work, that's bound to be messy. 

Another problem for those seeking exemptions is proof that this is sincerely held given how broad the logic they have apply is. Look how widespread development is from these cell lines is per the source linked above:

&gt; Cells derived from elective abortions have been used since the 1960s to manufacture vaccines, including current vaccines against rubella, chickenpox, hepatitis A, and shingles. They have also been used to make approved drugs against diseases including hemophilia, rheumatoid arthritis, and cystic fibrosis.

Notice those are ""including"" lists - I expect there are a lot more vaccines and drugs that people who try to claim this sincerely held exemption could be using or have used / given their family. It seems clear that even the most carefully phrased sincerely held religious exemption is going to get tossed out for anyone who's plugged into modern medicine in almost any way. There might be 1 in a million hardcore families out there that have been antivax homeschooling and rejecting medicine and yeah this is a legit belief for them, but crybaby karens whose families have their shingles and chickenpox shots are about to graduate from collapsing our hospital systems to jamming up the court systems too if they have to sift through their indvididual medical records to examine sincerity of belief.",,,,1631795788,{},hd2kwzp,True,t3_pp0oxa,False,True,t1_hd0ggm2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pp0oxa/cnn_judge_suspends_ny_state_vaccine_mandate_for/hd2kwzp/,1631901789.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_562v1lzk,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND  
BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine encoding a prefusion-stabilized, membrane-anchored severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) full-length spike protein. BNT162b2 is highly efficacious against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and is currently approved, conditionally approved, or authorized for emergency use worldwide. At the time of initial authorization, data beyond 2 months after vaccination were unavailable.  
  
METHODS  
In an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, multinational, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned 44,165 participants 16 years of age or older and 2264 participants 12 to 15 years of age to receive two 30-μg doses, at 21 days apart, of BNT162b2 or placebo. The trial end points were vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety, which were both evaluated through 6 months after vaccination.  
  
RESULTS  
BNT162b2 continued to be safe and have an acceptable adverse-event profile. Few participants had adverse events leading to withdrawal from the trial. Vaccine efficacy against Covid-19 was 91.3% (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 89.0 to 93.2) through 6 months of follow-up among the participants without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection who could be evaluated. There was a gradual decline in vaccine efficacy. Vaccine efficacy of 86 to 100% was seen across countries and in populations with diverse ages, sexes, race or ethnic groups, and risk factors for Covid-19 among participants without evidence of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine efficacy against severe disease was 96.7% (95% CI, 80.3 to 99.9). In South Africa, where the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern B.1.351 (or beta) was predominant, a vaccine efficacy of 100% (95% CI, 53.5 to 100) was observed.  
  
CONCLUSIONS  
Through 6 months of follow-up and despite a gradual decline in vaccine efficacy, BNT162b2 had a favorable safety profile and was highly efficacious in preventing Covid-19.

It's also a question of how much they are testing, finding more asymptomatic cases. It's really hard to compare country to country, I feel like anymore, just because the different approaches will show different results.

I'm really torn on the booster. I'm not a fan of the administration jumping ahead of the science. I definitely think there's a group of the population that needs to be boostered, but this is going to be a mess and it will make people even more splintered and it's going to be a bad look across the board. And I say that as someone who will get the booster if I'm told I'm eligible.

I think you are right, 100%, why it will be pushed through. It won't be for as much as hospitalizations/deaths from breakthroughs, but to curb the spread via breakthroughs.

BACKGROUND  
On July 30, 2021, the administration of a third (booster) dose of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccine (Pfizer–BioNTech) was approved in Israel for persons who were 60 years of age or older and who had received a second dose of vaccine at least 5 months earlier. Data are needed regarding the effect of the booster dose on the rate of confirmed coronavirus 2019 disease (Covid-19) and the rate of severe illness.  
  
METHODS  
We extracted data for the period from July 30 through August 31, 2021, from the Israeli Ministry of Health database regarding 1,137,804 persons who were 60 years of age or older and had been fully vaccinated (i.e., had received two doses of BNT162b2) at least 5 months earlier. In the primary analysis, we compared the rate of confirmed Covid-19 and the rate of severe illness between those who had received a booster injection at least 12 days earlier (booster group) and those who had not received a booster injection (nonbooster group). In a secondary analysis, we evaluated the rate of infection 4 to 6 days after the booster dose as compared with the rate at least 12 days after the booster. In all the analyses, we used Poisson regression after adjusting for possible confounding factors.  
  
RESULTS  
At least 12 days after the booster dose, the rate of confirmed infection was lower in the booster group than in the nonbooster group by a factor of 11.3 (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 10.4 to 12.3); the rate of severe illness was lower by a factor of 19.5 (95% CI, 12.9 to 29.5). In a secondary analysis, the rate of confirmed infection at least 12 days after vaccination was lower than the rate after 4 to 6 days by a factor of 5.4 (95% CI, 4.8 to 6.1).  
  
CONCLUSIONS  
In this study involving participants who were 60 years of age or older and had received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine at least 5 months earlier, we found that the rates of confirmed Covid-19 and severe illness were substantially lower among those who received a booster (third) dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine.",,,,1631757363,{},hd112yz,True,t3_pp404e,False,False,t3_pp404e,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pp404e/protection_of_bnt162b2_vaccine_booster_against/hd112yz/,1631871861.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;  
&gt;**• labeling people who always appear positive or do not share their emotions as being stronger or more likable than others**  
&gt;  
&gt;**• urging people to thrive no matter what adversity they face,** such as by telling people that they must use enforced time at home during the COVID-19 pandemic to develop new skills or improve their fitness

[],,DiprivanDapper,,,,,,[],"Welcome to More Information Than You are Probably Looking For:

Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is used when other supportive measures have not been or would not be effective with the patient's current condition. From least amount of oxygenation support to highest amount normally goes Nasal Cannula (NC)/Simple Mask &gt; Midflow Nasal Cannula (Midflow) &gt; Venturi mask &gt; Highflow nasal cannula (HFNC) &gt; Biphasic Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP) &gt; Endotracheal Intubation with ventilation. Sometimes we skip steps depending on the patient condition and urgency of supportive need. A non rebreather mask is somewhere between Venturi Mask and HFNC, but is not normally meant for more than a short term intervention and as a necessary band aid to buy time to correct an underlying problem.

So if healthcare providers (Paramedics, ED providers, ICU intensivists) are looking to intubate and ventilate they have exhausted, or know the patient's condition wouldn't tolerate all of the other options. 

Note: this is more specific to the inpatient setting and EMS wouldn't normally use interventions such as HFNC and BIPAP (that I know of) because they are attempting to keep the patient stable until they reach the hospital and things like nasal cannulas, non rebreathers, and intubation are better for that clinical setting. This intubation discussion is also specific to conditions such as respiratory failure, sepsis, etc. where respiratory support is needed to maintain oxygenation and can even help balance pH imbalances due to respiratory and metabolic pathologies.

I suspect a large amount of the people already vaccinated are in easy to reach places: Wealthy countries and/or urban areas with good refrigeration and transportation infrastructure.  Some of the people in those countries are refusing the vaccine, but for now let's ignore them and focus on the folks that want the vaccine but can't get it yet.  I think reaching many of those people, especially the ones that live in remote places is going to be a lot more difficult.  mRNA vaccines might not be the right way to do it given the cold chain storage requirements.

I think we should be looking a lot more closely at the efficacy of multi-dose J&amp;J style vaccines for hard to reach places in the world since it can be stored for up to 2 years at conventional freezer temperatures (-4F) and several months at normal refrigeration temperatures.  Certainly we should distribute Pfizer and Moderna to countries that can make good use of them (Argentina?) but for some other countries the mRNA vaccines may not be a good fit.

Vaccines are a finite good. We can only make them so fast, and wealthy nations are sitting on a surplus waiting to see if boosters are needed for their vulnerable or general population before they donate them to areas of greater need. In a perfect world we would agree its a global pandemic and it's better for everyone to be covered with at least 1 dose before we give out any 3rd doses, but given the political need to protect our own population, the question then become *how* beneficial the 3rd dose is. Right now the evidence is pretty clear that it's almost certainly highly beneficial for blood cancer patients and organ transplant patients, probably highly beneficial for other immunocompromised patients and the elderly.

When I look at the situation that we have right now I'm rather dismayed.  We have a huge number of countries with like 60-70% vaccination rates.  Just enough to keep highly contagious variants like delta circling around and infecting vaccinated people.  Those individuals may not typically have severe symptoms but there is a huge risk of vaccine resistant mutations occuring in what is an already highly infectious variant (think delta spread with mu-like vaccine resistance).  We either need to vaccinate the whole population to reduce the spread enough for delta to mostly die out or introduce boosters to keep vaccinated people from getting infected.  The only exception might be if we can also show that people infected this way tend to achieve super-immunity (which is a possibility, but I don't think we've adequately shown that yet).

Unless we are willing to start strapping anti-vaxxers down to tables and forcibly inject them it seems like boosters are our best bet to prevent vaccinated people from getting the virus and potentially creating a new super variant.  Unvaccinated populations are absolutely at risk and need to be treated, but there's no selective pressure there for vaccine resistance.

[],,NeoRyu777,,,,,,[],"I've spent a while thinking about how to reply to this. I think, ultimately, it comes down to this. 

When you're sure that you're right, and you see a loved one making what you perceive to be a mistake that will cost them greatly (maybe even kill them) down the line, you want to stop them and make them understand.

So when you're taken in by a group of conmen, it's natural to spread the word of what you believe is the truth. I think that being fooled by people is forgivable, and so is spreading that. 

What isn't forgivable is closing your eyes and ears to reality, or electing to ignore it to cling to a position that hurts other people. 

The sticking point is that many of these people have been convinced by these conmen to believe that mainstream media are all liars, to trust their evidence of their own ears and eyes alone. When the evidence we have are numbers and facts, those are conceptual things, not as compelling, not as visceral as things you can grasp with your own senses. 

The only way to convince these people is to expose them to the truth, and let the light of day sear away any illusions of what we're facing. We need to take them to the ICU and listen to the ever-present alarms of people struggling to breathe. We need to make them watch someone die of COVID-19, horribly and tearfully struggling to live just a little longer. We need to make them witness the exhaustion of the doctors and nurses struggling to keep up. 

I don't have the energy to hate or wish ill upon people who are still blinded by false beliefs recited to them by charismatic charlatans. The only priority right now is convincing them of the truth, in any way we can. If that truth only comes at the price of their deaths, then that is a sad truth that will hopefully spread through their friends and family.

&gt;Using bayesian poststratification, the adjusted estimate of seroprevalence among those aged 16 to 64 years in Kenya was 48.5% (95% CI, 45.2%-52.1%). This estimate varied little by age or sex, but was higher in Nairobi (61.8% \[95% CI, 53.2%-70.6%\]), the country’s capital city, and lower in 2 rural regions, Nyanza and Western, adjacent to Uganda.

5000 deaths divided by the 48.5% seroprevalence of Kenya's population of 50M gives a CFR of 0.0206%.

Yearly covid-19 boosters seem unlikely at this point.

However, a third shot isn't strange at all. If you look at many other vaccines, such as the childhood vaccines, you'll note that they often have months or more between doses. Why is this? Because research has apparently shown that these intervals give the best long term protection. The problem is that testing these longer intervals takes a lot of time.

The covid-19 vaccines have such a short interval between 2 doses because it was more or less the shortest interval that made sense. Longer intervals are very likely to offer better long term protection, but there wasn't time to test that before rolling out the vaccines.

However, I understand the scientific desire to get more people on the planet their initial dosing to reduce the chances of another variant mutating to evades vaccines more effectively than delta. 

It's tough. I want my booster to maximize my personal safety against delta. But I remember last spring feeling like things would be back to normal by fall, and dismissing the possibility of a more dangerous variant. I don't want to make that mistake again. 

I am willing to admit that despite following the news closely and reading plenty of abstracts of scientific studies, and having a university degree in science, I am not equipped to judge the risks of another variant developing and causing yet another even more destructive global wave of infections. Therefore I will accept whatever scientific, economic, and ultimately political consensus emerges, knowing that it is messy and prone to reversals as new data are gathered. 

Authorities don't always get things right, but they tend to do better than lay people most of the time. I'm generally all in favour of scapegoating authority when they seem to be mistaken, but in times of crisis like these, I feel that unity behind informed authority is important, for the sake of social cohesion. We only need to look at antivaxers to see what happens when we easily discard our trust in authority in a crisis. It's easy to remember times when authorities were too slow to come to what to us was an obvious conclusion.

Because supply is still limited worldwide. As soon as the US approves booster for everyone elegible, Pfizer is going to focus on providing the US with doses, limiting the amount exported to other countries. Here in Argentina we are supposed to be getting 20 million doses of Pfizer before end of the year.

To my knowledge she wasn't pregnant at the time and wasn't planning on getting pregnant until after they were married. They were concerned about what the vaccine could do to their fertility and the baby they hadn't even conceived yet.

She was a science teacher too. She was also pretty religious and got in argument with her students about abortion and how it was wrong. And had arguments with other teachers about immigration. So there's that.

I got vaccinated. My husband did too. I went off birth control in May. I'm now 9 weeks pregnant and the more I read about pregnant women and COVID, the more thankful I am that I got the vaccine. And I'd get a booster while pregnant if it becomes available and is recommended.

[],,Synonyms26,,,,,,[],"HÀ NỘI — People living in high risk or very high risk areas must be tested for SARS-CoV-2 three times a week, while those living in other areas tested every five or seven days.  
  
This is part of the latest guidelines sent by the Ministry of Health to steering committees for COVID-19 prevention and control in provinces and cities nationwide on Tuesday. The guidelines concentrate on testing and preventive measures to take when localities implement social distancing.  
  
According to the ministry, ramping up testing was important to control the disease. In areas with a high/very high risk of COVID-19 infection, rapid antigen tests should be given priority to immediately isolate positive cases.  
  
Rapid antigen tests and RT-PCR tests could be combined.  
  
In areas with less risk of infection, pooled testing can be used based on specific conditions, for example, combining testing samples from people of the same family, the same building or neighbours.  
  
Under the guidelines, localities should arrange testing sites for small areas. Volunteers and people can help take samples for rapid antigen tests.  
  
If unable to conduct mass testing, areas at high/very high risk must report to the national steering committee for COVID-19 prevention and control or ask for help from other areas.  
  
The Health Ministry asked localities to set up and operate mobile healthcare stations based in communes/wards which have high/very high risks of infection. Schools, community houses and offices could be turned into a mobile healthcare stations so that people could access health services as soon as possible.  
  
Communes, wards and towns that are under the 'new normal' stage must also prepare sites, medical equipment and staff to use in case their situation worsens.  
  
Authorities must continuously evaluate COVID-19 risks to decide to impose social distancing measures or loosen the measures in specific areas. Social distancing measures must be loosened step by step while screening tests are maintained.  
  
In the guidelines, the ministry emphasised that social distancing measures should be put in place in as-small-as-possible areas, for example, a hamlet, a residential group or a street.  
  
The social distancing aims to stop infections and control the disease as soon as possible – within 14 days.  
  
Social distancing measures must be implemented strictly. During social distancing, the supply of food and other essentials for affected people must be ensured. Medical measures like testing, treatment and vaccination must be conducted systematically. Measures are also needed to ensure that people can access health services early, at the grassroots level.  
  
In the last few months, 23 provinces and cities in Việt Nam have implemented social distancing measures and stricter measures to control COVID-19.  
  
Social distancing brought positive results in curbing COVID-19 infections.  
  
However, in some localities, social distancing has been extended due to improper implementation of measures, a lack of detailed goals, scale and time to apply social distancing or insufficient testing.  
  
According to the ministry, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing and may last for a long time, especially with the presence of the Delta variant which can spread much easier and faster than the original SARS-CoV-2 and other variants. — VNS",,,,1631807255,{},hd3b4nv,True,t3_ppfvuf,False,True,t3_ppfvuf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ppfvuf/vietnam_people_in_high_very_high_risk_areas_to_be/hd3b4nv/,1631916287.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,Synonyms26,,,,,,[],"HÀ NỘI — HCM City will continue imposing social distancing under the Government’s Directive 16 until the end of September, but ease the lockdown in some districts where the situation is stable.  
  
The announcement was made at a press conference held by the Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control of HCM City on the evening of September 15.  
  
At the press conference, Vice Chairman of HCM City People's Committee Lê Hòa Bình said the city's plan on measures to prevent and control the COVID-19 pandemic in the city from September 16 to September 30, 2021 was to continue to apply social distancing and other tough pandemic prevention measures throughout the city in the spirit of Directive No. 16 of the Prime Minister.  
  
The motto was to thoroughly, strictly, drastically and effectively apply appropriate measures to prevent and control the COVID-19 pandemic in each specific area.  
  
The city will continue to issue travel permits to groups of people who are allowed to travel. The travel permits issued by the city police will continue to be valid until September 30, 2021.  
  
For the areas where the pandemic has been basically controlled, which are District 7, Củ Chi district, Cần Giờ District, processing zones, industrial parks in these districts and hi-tech parks, people are allowed to go to the market once a week.  
  
The management boards of processing and industrial zones and high-tech parks guide enterprises to organise the implementation of production plans according to Plan No. 2715/KH-BCD of the city Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control and the Safety Criteria of the city People's Committee.  
  
In addition, the city also piloted the implementation of the COVID Green Card associated with a personal QR code. The pilot still has to ensure the implementation of the 5K message and periodic antigen testing.   
  
Shippers supported with testing costs   
  
According to the plan, shippers of tech-based delivery services/platforms can operate between districts and Thủ Đức City from 6am to 9pm daily, instead of being limited to just one district/Thủ Đức City.  
  
Pooled sample testing (three people) must be performed on these shippers every two days. The expense for this will be paid by the city's authorities until September 30.   
  
The city allows the following businesses and households business (with business registration licenses) to operate from 6am to 9pm daily: postal and telecommunications services; office computer equipment, learning tools; take-away food services (these businesses have to operate under the ""three on-site"" method, selling only through online ordering); agricultural production support services, veterinary facilities; maintenance and repair services for machinery and equipment, means of transport and supply of components and spare parts for this activity; food production, processing and trading.  
  
The above-mentioned businesses are only allowed to operate in the area of one district or Thủ Đức City; and must perform pooled testing among three people every two days. The businesses will bear the cost themselves.   
  
Employees who work on-site at these businesses must be vaccinated with at least one dose and perform COVID tests every five days individually or in the form of three-people pooled testing. Testing expenses shall be paid by these businesses themselves.  
  
Construction work and sport activities  
  
The city allows construction work and transport construction sites to operate on the basis of compliance with the set of safety criteria issued by the City People's Committee.  
  
Chairmen of people's committees of wards, communes and towns shall consider and decide to allow sports activities at parks in residential areas and apartment buildings in ""green zones"" as long as anti-pandemic regulations are met.   
  
Vice Chairman Lê Hoà Bình also said that the city assigned the people's committees of District 7, Củ Chi District, Cần Giờ District to urgently prepare plans. For the remaining areas, depending on the pandemic control situation in the area, they will consider piloting the reopening of some activities later.   
  
At the same time, the Department of Health was assigned to closely monitor the pandemic situation in the pilot areas, advise on treatment and support forces when necessary; conduct impact assessment in pilot areas so that the city can give appropriate direction after the pilot ends. — VNS",,,,1631807207,{},hd3b08w,True,t3_ppfv96,False,True,t3_ppfv96,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ppfv96/vietnam_hcmc_continues_social_distancing_until/hd3b08w/,1631916222.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Speaking with the media, Sơn said that the city authorities had decided to adjust management in “green zones”, which are COVID-19-free areas, so that it would be more convenient for residents.  
  
Residents travelling in 19 districts that are recognised as “green zones” will not have to show certificates or documents to the police and inspectors.  
  
Residents in “red zones” – zones with COVID-19 cases, will still strictly follow regulations of social distancing based on Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính’s Direction 16. They are only allowed to travel in necessary cases and must show their papers to the inspectors.  
  
If residents travel from “green zones” to “red zones”, their papers will be checked.  
  
Depending on the specific circumstances, districts will issue detailed instructions to local residents.  
  
The city will remove checkpoints in green zones, and maintain checkpoints in border areas between districts.  
  
If any new COVID-19 cases are found, the checkpoints will be restored.    
  
Hà Nội on Wednesday allowed restaurants and food and drink establishments to reopen for delivery, starting noon Thursday, but only in districts that have recorded no community COVID-19 cases since September 6.  
  
The establishments are also required to close before 9pm every day.  
  
19 districts and townships – Ba Đình, Ba Vì, Bắc Từ Liêm, Cầu Giấy, Đan Phượng, Gia Lâm, Hoài Đức, Long Biên, Mê Linh, Mỹ Đức, Nam Từ Liêm, Phú Xuyên, Phúc Thọ, Quốc Oai, Sóc Sơn, Sơn Tây, Thanh Oai, Ứng Hoà, and Tây Hồ – are at a ‘new normal’ level, or have no community cases since September 6, according to the official list from the health department late Wednesday.

That means you're not just allowed to go about your day as normal.  In healthcare settings they're doing mandatory daily/weekly tests and they have to wear what's called a ""papr"" which is a super-inconvenient-to-wear respirator.  They look like [this](https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-4s9liwcv/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/399232/507800/FELIX200-American-PAPR-Powered-Air-Purifying-Respirator-pic1__59150.1617919150.jpg?c=2).

The accommodation must be reasonable not only for the anti-vaxxer, but also the employer.  For instance wearing a papr is just not reasonable for most jobs outside of healthcare.  The Washington State Patrol for instance made a blanket statement that any public facing roles will not have accommodations.  There is just no way that they can reduce the increased potential exposure from the unvaccinated patrolmen/women to the public at large without removing them from the public facing roll entirely and there's just nowhere else to put them.

[],,aunsafe2015,,,,,,[],"&gt;""4.2% of infected children wind up in ICU.""

Let's explore that statement.

Check out the American Academy of Pediatrics reports at [https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/](https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/)

""Among states reporting, children ranged from 1.6%-4.1% of their total cumulated hospitalizations, and **0.1%-1.9% of all their child COVID-19 cases resulted in hospitalization.**""

Let's call that ""0.1-1.9%"" range 1% for simplicity.  The title of the article in the OP is that 21% of hospitalized kids end up in the ICU.  If 1% of kids who test positive end up hospitalized (per the AAP data), and only 21% of those end up in the ICU, that would mean that 0.2% of kids who test positive end up in the ICU.

Where is your 4.2% coming from?  I see this from the JHM Study linked in the article:

""Among 19,976 COVID-19 encounters, 15,913 (79.7%) patients were discharged from the emergency department (ED) and 4063 (20.3%) were hospitalized.""

So I assume you are taking the 20.3%, and multiplying it by the 21% of the headline, to get 4.2%.  However, I don't think the 20.3% is saying that 20.3% **of all infections** result in hospitalization.  It looks like it is saying that 20.3% of people who came to the hospital were admitted.  The other 79.7% ""were discharged from the emergency department.""  Presumably only a relatively small fraction of infected people go to the emergency department at all.

Right?  I think the AAP provides very sound and transparent data, and the fact that AAP says about 1% of kids with positive tests ends up hospitalized is very difficult to square to your assertion that ""4.2% of infected children wind up in the ICU.""  As I describe above, I think a more accurate number is probably that about 0.2% of kids who test positive end up in the ICU.

Thoughts? Not trying to start a fight.  Just trying to make sure accurate numbers are being posted.  I'm open to correction.",,,,1631808577,{},hd3efi6,False,t3_ppc29o,False,False,t1_hd37k9v,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ppc29o/21_of_children_hospitalized_with_covid_require/hd3efi6/,1631918078.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_1h7koj2a,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;The order goes into effect Sept. 22 and will require patrons to prove they're fully vaccinated, or have been tested within the previous three days. 

&gt;Health officials say Contra Costa County has seen a severe spike in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations this summer, due to the increased prevalence of the highly infectious delta variant and unvaccinated residents. 

&gt;While the worst of the latest spike has seemingly passed, Contra Costa County is still seeing daily case rates comparable to February. Between Aug. 15 and Aug. 31, there were 15 COVID-19-related deaths in the county. That number increased to 20 between Sept. 1 to Sept. 7. 

&gt;County health officials estimate unvaccinated residents account for 95.9% of the county's deaths so far. 

&gt;COVID-19 case rates are five times higher in unvaccinated county residents compared to fully vaccinated residents. Hospitalization rates are 16 times higher and death rates are approximately 22 times higher. 

&gt;""This order is necessary now to save lives, protect our overburdened healthcare system, and slow the pandemic enough to keep our schools open, Dr. Chris Farnitano, the county health officer, said in a statement. ""Reducing community transmission of the virus now is key to preventing future spikes in cases from overwhelming our county's hospitals during the winter months."" 

&gt;The new order applies to businesses where patrons remove masks to drink or eat indoors (including entertainment venues) and indoor fitness facilities, including yoga and dance studios.  

&gt;The order also requires workers in these indoor venues to show proof of being fully vaccinated by Nov. 1, or to test weekly. 

&gt;Proof of vaccination includes showing photo ID and a vaccination record card from the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC), or copies or photos of the cards. Documentation from health care providers are also acceptable, as are digital vaccine records issued by the state of California. 

&gt;People can visit myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov for a link to their digital vaccination and can go to cchealth.org/coronavirus for more information about the county health order or where to find a vaccination site in Contra Costa County.",,,,1631798971,{},hd2rcsw,True,t3_ppdaqw,False,True,t3_ppdaqw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ppdaqw/contra_costa_county_in_the_bay_area_california_to/hd2rcsw/,1631905335.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_58900d68,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. Not making a big deal out of a set of mixed and seemingly contradictory study results that don't affect the best course of action for the vast majority of people or
2. Using those results out of context to suggest conclusions not suggested by the studies themselves and/or using those results as a political weapon to accuse the government of dishonesty/evasion/negligence

Both actual directly linked studies are listed as pre-publication, non-peer-reviewed studies, so even if they did suggest that natural infection is a more reliable protection than vaccination it would *still* be irresponsible and premature for anyone to change public health policy based on them. But let's dig in a little.

Of the two studies directly linked, one is dedicated to the question of whether covid-19 immunity from infection is good enough to justify reserving vaccines for those who have *not* been infected. The study concludes that yes, it is.   
The other study is a comparative study of the relative strength of immunity from infection, one specific vaccine, and an infected person who has also had that specific vaccine. This study concluded that the vaccine provided the least protection against breakthrough infection of the three options, and that having one dose of vaccine after recovering from covid-19 infection provided the strongest protection.

The OP article then tries to use this new, as-yet unverified information to insist (in hindsight) that the government is responsible for ""thousands of American lives"" because they did not blindly rely on natural immunity *before it was even proven to work*, and have not immediately changed public policy at the appearance of the first (again, not even peer-reviewed) signs that it does.",,,,1631743052,{},hd06gnu,False,t3_pouynb,False,False,t1_hczcew7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pouynb/natural_immunity_to_covid_is_powerful_policy/hd06gnu/,1631857054.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_17evtc,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Remember, that it is through the receptors in the respiratory tract that the virus enters the body. If the virus is killed in the mouth throat and nose, it may reduce the dose of virus a person receives and therefore give the immune system more of a chance to fight the virus (before potentially becoming overwhelmed by the virus) as the body would be initially presented with fewer viral particles. 

Plus, the thought is that by reducing viral load in the mouth, nose and throat, it can reduce viral load overall and potentially reduce severity of symptoms, and also reduces risk of onwards transmission because fewer Covid virions may be expelled from the mouth and nose. 

It is also thought that by reducing viral load in mouth throat and nose it can reduce the risk of the virus creeping down into the lower respiratory tract and causing pneumonia.

At the moment it’s hard to get in since the country closed its borders to most international arrivals back in March 2020 to keep covid out. But they are talking about opening that up once we get to 80% double dose nationally (we’re currently on track to reach that around November). 

Some states/territories have had bad covid outbreaks and there are 3 out of 8 currently doing it tough at the moment while they ramp up their vaccination rates (Eg VIC currently has about 400+ cases per day and NSW 1,200+ cases per day), but the other 5 states are pretty much covid-free. We have a case here and there but the contact tracing is so good they find the contacts and those people do 14 days home quarantine while the rest of the population goes about as per usual (although we currently wear masks indoors in case we do get an outbreak). 

We are heading into summer so that’s also good timing for us.

What does ""a little less effective"" mean? The evidence that mrna vaccines offer substantially more protection against serious disease than the single shot Janssen vaccine is growing and compelling.

For example, [this peer reviewed VISION network study in the New England Journal of medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2110362). 

&gt;The effectiveness of full messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination (≥14 days after the second dose) was 89% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87 to 91) against laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to hospitalization, 90% (95% CI, 86 to 93) against infection leading to an ICU admission, and 91% (95% CI, 89 to 93) against infection leading to an emergency department or urgent care clinic visit

And for Janssen (no calculations against ICU admission because fewer people got the shot)

&gt;The effectiveness of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was 68% (95% CI, 50 to 79) against laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to hospitalization and 73% (95% CI, 59 to 82) against infection leading to an emergency department or urgent care clinic visit.

~90% efficacy vs ~70% efficacy is quite a lot, it would mean that Jannsen vaccine recipients were ~3X as likely to be hospitalized with a breakthrough case.",,,,1631746174,{},hd0dd9r,False,t3_pol10r,False,True,t1_hd087d9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pol10r/daily_discussion_thread_september_15_2021/hd0dd9r/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_4wmax,False,False,False,10db89dfe81d1e4b0def0750ad5058a0ecbe99de,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1631746185.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

&gt; The new data from Delaware add to a growing body of early research showing that the shots offer strong protection, even as the highly transmissible delta variant circulates.

&gt; Delaware’s numbers show not only that vaccinated people make up a small share of cases but also that they have a very low rate of infection. The post-vaccination infection, hospitalization, and case rates are better indicators of vaccine efficacy than the percentage of breakthrough cases, hospitalizations, and deaths out of a state’s total, experts say.

&gt; In Delaware, people who got the one-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine have had the highest post-vaccination case rate, the state reported. Of the 43,947 people immunized, 333 had confirmed cases, representing 0.76% of J&amp;J recipients.

&gt; Among the more than 274,000 residents who received Pfizer, 1,385 cases were reported, representing 0.51%, according to the data analysis, and 589 cases were reported among the more than 190,000 people who got Moderna, representing 0.31%.

&gt; In total, 0.45% of vaccinated Delawareans had tested positive as of Aug. 30, according to state data, or 1 in 222 people. In New Jersey, it was 1 in 286. Data Pennsylvania released Tuesday showed that 1 in 17 unvaccinated people have tested positive in 2021 compared with 1 in 122 vaccinated people.

Educated people throughout this pandemic have tended to be more compliant with public safety measures.

California as a state also has MediCal, a state welfare system that gives people who qualify for it access to decent healthcare, meaning more people in CA are insured.  

And as part of the crisis response, early on governor Newsom used state funds to provide emergency shelter to CA’s large homeless population, which helped reduce community spread.

Previously mentioned in another study in July:
&gt;Extension of the interval between vaccine doses for the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was introduced in the UK to accelerate population coverage with a single dose. In a study of 503 healthcare workers, we show that after priming following the first vaccine there is a marked decline in SARSCoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels, but, in contrast, a sustained T cell response to spike protein. This divergent immune profile was accompanied by robust protection from infection over this period from the circulating alpha (B.1.1.7) variant. **Importantly, following the second vaccine
dose, NAb levels were higher after the extended dosing interval (6-14 weeks) compared to the conventional 3-4 week regimen, accompanied by a clear enrichment of CD4+ T cells expressing IL2.** These data on dynamic cellular and humoral responses indicate that extension of the dosing intervalis an effective, immunogenic protocol and that antiviral T cell responses are a potential mechanism of protection.

And I agree with that. Right now, however, the vaccine is not approved for children ages 5 to 11 - which encompasses all of my children. Combined with how eligible people have the choice of getting the vaccine or not, I'm not comfortable exposing my kids to that. Other people are. 

&gt;And the only way to change their mind is for enough of them to die in as publicly visible a fashion as possible. Hence the desire to spread these videos.

I disagree. The only way to change their mind is to make them see the evidence with their own eyes, to experience the pain and exhaustion and misery as strongly as possible. Take them on a tour through the ICU of every hospital in a 30-mile radius. That would do the trick for a number of them, I think. 

&gt;I think we are also glossing over some very important HOWs here. HOW did these people get lead so astray? What made them fertile targets for these charlatans? What makes them attack things like mask mandates, which are NOT scary.. just inconvenient.

How were they led astray? That bit's simple. Conservative media, and misinformation campaigns. We've known that for ages. 

What made them fertile targets for charlatans? Life, basically. A lifetime of little frustrations, of life changing out from under them frequently (30 years ago we didn't have computers in every home, 20 cell phones were just becoming a thing, 10 years ago we had an economic crisis, etc.). When given a reason for those frustrations, an outlet to vent upon, an enemy to go up against, well, conservative media captured them. And set them up for this. 

&gt;Consider, for a moment, the fact that I do not necessarily think masks do a great deal either, but I wear them anyway because if it helps others a little then it's worth it. Because I could be wrong. Because it doesn't cost me anything other than minor annoyance and that annoyance is worth any bit of help it might give.

I do the same, because masks have been shown to help prevent spreading. They are an inconvenience, but no more than that. I don't understand the people who protest them, but I think it's that they see it as a first step towards controlling individual freedoms, and they see it as possibly making their children's immune systems weaker, by not exposing them to the usual gamut of germs and viruses that they're expected to grow up with.

All over a disease that - again - they believe is not that big a deal, because they've been convinced of that by the ""experts"".

It depends on the vaccine.   There are various antibody tests that look for antibodies to the ""S"" or the ""N"" proteins.   ""S"" is the spike protein which is the molecular grappling hook the virus uses to enter cells.  ""N"" is the ""Nucleocapsid"" protein, part of the viral shell.   

For all the vaccines used in the US and I think Europe (Pfizer, Moderna, Astrazenica, J&amp;J/Janssen) it should be possible to  distinguish natural immunity from vaccine-only immunity.

Those vaccines expose the immune system to a variant of  the virus's spike protein but not any other part of the virus.

Most people with natural immunity develop immunity to both the spike and other parts of the virus (including the ""N"" protein).

It's lower than the unvaccinated person living the same exact like

&gt;How about the one on likelihood of being asymptomatic while still being contagious? 

This is basic science. If you have no symptoms you are less likely to spread any disease. This is why hand washing, covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze and social distancing creates less chance of getting colds, flu's, covid and other transmittable diseases.

&gt;How about the higher likelihood of being asymptomatic when you are vaccinated?

Okay? This means people will spread the disease less. See above answer if you are unclear. The whole point of the vaccine is people stop dying. 

&gt; How about the fact you are still contagious before you fight the virus at all?

You in a way aren't. Your body needs to be infected to some degree in order for you to be contagious. 

&gt; You have no idea what you are talking about. The truth is you just want to go out and not feel like a pile of trash while doing it

That's not true at all. The studies and science say the vaccines lower transmission rates, hospitalizations and deaths. Look I'm trying to give you rational answers. Every single point you made is also true of the unvaccinated. The difference is the unvaccinated spread it faster. The unvaccinated spread it more frequently. The unvaccinated spread it more severely. The unvaccinated are 99% more likely to die than the vaccinated.

&gt;”This past year, for Alabama, the year 2020... we are going to have more deaths in the state of Alabama than we have ever had in the history of the state of Alabama, by a lot,” Harris said Wednesday in a COVID-19 Town Hall today with AL.com. “We’re going to have around six or seven thousand more people who died in our state this past year than any year we have ever had, going back to the year 1900. That’s how far I’ve asked our staff to go back.”

&gt;Harris also noted another grim record set in 2020 - Alabama had more deaths than births for the first time ever.

&gt;”This is the first year in the history of Alabama that we’ve had more deaths in our state than we had births in our state,” Harris said. “Our state shrank last year. And it’s not a coincidence that that’s about exactly the number of deaths we had from COVID.”

&gt;Data from the Alabama Department of Public Health shows there were about 7,000 more deaths than births in Alabama in 2020. It also shows there were 10,605 more total deaths in 2020 than in 2019.

&gt;”Our state literally shrunk this year for the first time in history, even going back to World War II, when people were serving overseas; going back to the Spanish Flu epidemic, when we had the flu in our state; going back to World War I. We’ve never seen that happen before in the state of Alabama until COVID this past year.”

What I cited is from a real world, apples to apples study analysing vaccine efficiency **against serious disease** in the New England Journal of medicine, published September 8th, 2021. 

That vox video from March 2021 is entirely irrelevant. It's true that the numbers from the original studies cannot be directly compared. The populations of the trials may be different, and the variants circulating may be different.

But what vox is saying about the efficiency against hospitalization and severe disease being 100% is misleading. The trials the video talks about did not have the statistical power to determine effectiveness against serious disease to a high level of confidence.

Here's the Janssen vaccine briefing those numbers originally reported in the media are from: https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download

MRU, With Onset at Least 14 or at Least 28 Days After Vaccination, Per-Protocol Set, Study 3001

&gt;Any positive
PCR

&gt;100%
(31.1,
100.0)

For example, the vaccine efficiency against this outcome is indeed 100%, but the 95% confidence interval is 31.1% to 100%.

[],,techorules,,,,,,[],"Well I think you should be careful not to oversimplify.  I've lived around half my life in each of the two countries and have a good enough understanding of the differences.  Im not quite sure you do.  Where have you heard or read that hospitals in the US are for-profit?  Some are but most are non-profit.  Both have lots of for-profit and non-profit actors.  The issue is more money is spent per capita in the US by a long shot, almost double that in Canada.  I think after thinking about this is the big difference why why Canada cannot handle a big covid wave as well as comparable US systems.  Thank God Canadians are less dumb than Americans on covid overall (Alberta notwithstanding).

Besides $ spent, the biggest difference is the setup is who pays of course, which for Canada is a single (gov't entity) payer with funds raised through taxation.  If you're younger than a Senior in the US this often is provided by employer sponsored plans so this premium typically comes off your paycheck and typically your employers pays an even bigger chunk than the subscriber.  It's not that different of a system honestly.  But of course the way health care is administers is different in parts.   And it varies greatly state by state and provide by province.  Where I live (Massachusetts) there are very few gaps - it's rare to lack health insurance.  And we have as good health care as anywhere on earth (matches our human development index which is top of US).  But this isn't true of other regions so it really matters where you live.  Likewise the last province I lived in in Canada was Nova Scotia and health care there, I am sorry to say, is comparitatvely poor and worsening.  You can't even get a family doctor for years if you were to move there.  Also my family member in NS was sick and they put him ambulance and sent him for a town hospital to a city hospital three hours away and his conditioned worsened during the ride and it almost killed him, he was left in much worse shape and franky never recovered from those injuries.  So I can read the numbers and I have family who've lived it.  But I have no doubt that the worst healthcare in Canada is better than being underinsured or uninsured in the US.  So again, I will not generalize on which system is better because it depends who's asking!

System wise you're right there is more capitalism in the US healthcare system.  It speeds innovation but can be incredibly ugly too.  We all (including smaller countries like Canada that regulate drug prices fiercely) benefit from that as the multi-payer systems (i.e. US)  basically powered the drug industry that has made boatfuls of money and also helped raise life expectancy dramatically over the last 25 years.  At times it can be out of control and the FDA reigns it in.  And it hasn't lifted everyone's boat and you can go bankrupt because of healthcare in the US....  thing is you can in Canada too it's just different - it's typically due to drug prices not hospitalization.

&gt;**What improvements have you made to the ventilation system?**  
       
&gt;Most newer buildings rely on mechanical heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, known as HVAC, that use a combination of air filters and outdoor air to dilute and remove viral particles and other pollutants. Buildings can take a number of steps to improve the performance of ventilation systems and increase the amount of fresh air, including:  
          
&gt;**Improving their MERV ratings**    
        
&gt;The filters used in ventilation systems have what’s known as a MERV rating (MERV stands for Minimum Efficiency Reporting Values). The higher the rating, the better the filter is at trapping specific types of particles.  
    
&gt;Before the pandemic, many buildings used MERV 8 filters, which allow for comfort and energy efficiency but aren’t designed for infection control. New industry guidelines advise buildings to upgrade to at least a MERV 13 filter, which traps 85 percent or more of risky particles. However, not every ventilation system can upgrade to a MERV 13 filter. In some cases, a MERV 11 filter may be the highest grade filter the system can handle.   
           
&gt;**Disabling demand-controlled ventilation**   
      
&gt;To save energy, some systems monitor building occupancy based on carbon dioxide levels, which rise when we exhale. When fewer people are in the building, the system reduces the rate of outdoor air. “It’s a way to stop ventilating the space to save money,” said Richard Corsi, incoming dean of the College of Engineering at University of California, Davis. “But after people leave an area, we need to continue to ventilate so we can purge the space of any aerosol particles left in the air.”  
          
&gt;**Increasing outdoor air**   
      
&gt;Air quality experts recommend adjusting outdoor air dampers, which are movable plates that can bring in more outside air. This isn’t advised in communities with poor outdoor air quality, such as areas with active wildfires.

&gt;Don’t be intimidated when asking about ventilation systems. A company that has done the work will have answers at the ready, and the right answers will be obvious. Recently I suggested that my friend ask his gym what it had done to improve ventilation. He is vaccinated and only goes to the gym when it’s not busy, but the reply was encouraging

&gt;“We have increased the heating ventilation air conditioning (HVAC) filters to hospital-grade MERV 13,” they wrote. “And opened outdoor HVAC dampers to achieve a higher level of air exchange in the center.”  
      
&gt;**Can the windows be opened?**  
     
&gt;Some older buildings and classrooms may not have modern ventilation systems, but simply opening windows can improve air quality. A recent study of infected college students in an isolation dormitory at the University of Oregon found that [opening a window](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/05/health/covid-ventilation-college-dorm.html ""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/05/health/covid-ventilation-college-dorm.html"") could reduce the amount of coronavirus in a room by half.

&gt;While opening a window can help, the effect is greater if you can cross ventilate by opening windows on different sides of the room. Open windows aren’t practical during cold weather or in areas with poor outdoor air quality. Adding box fans to windows and turning on exhaust fans in kitchen and bathroom areas can also improve ventilation in homes and in buildings without modern systems.  
          
&gt;**What is the air change rate?**  
      
&gt;The air changes per hour, or ACH, number is the industry standard to indicate how often the air in a room is replaced by outdoor air. (Cleaning the air with filters can create the equivalent of air change.) While some experts suggest [four to six air changes per hour](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2779062 ""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2779062"") (that’s fresh or clean air every 10 to 15 minutes), many buildings fall short of that standard. It’s recommended that schools have an ACH of at least 3, but many classrooms are closer to 1.5, experts say. Airplanes and newer hospitals may have anywhere from 10 to 20 air changes per hour. Air change rates or their equivalent can be improved by upgrading the overall ventilation system or filters, increasing the amount of outdoor air (by opening windows or ventilation dampers), adding exhaust fans or by adding portable air filters.  
    
&gt;While there’s no magic number for air change rates to avoid Covid-19, the higher the better, said Dr. Corsi.  
           
&gt;**Are you using portable air cleaners?**  
    
&gt;Portable air cleaners equipped with HEPA filters can do a surprisingly good job of removing viral particles from the air, but only if the right machine is used for the size of the space. Look for a machine with a clean air delivery rate, or CADR, of at least 300 cubic feet per minute, and read the manufacturer guidance for choosing room size. You may need more than one machine for a larger space. The Association for Home Appliance Manufacturers [has a guide for buying air cleaners](https://ahamverifide.org/consumer-resources/ ""https://ahamverifide.org/consumer-resources/"").    
    
&gt;Adding an air cleaner can partly compensate for a less efficient ventilation system, depending on the size of the room. In some cases, “one of these little portable air cleaners can effectively double the ventilation rate in the classroom,” said Dr. Corsi.  
      
&gt;[A study in a Melbourne hospital](https://www.afr.com/policy/health-and-education/cheap-domestic-air-cleaners-can-cut-covid-19-spread-melbourne-study-20210811-p58i01 ""https://www.afr.com/policy/health-and-education/cheap-domestic-air-cleaners-can-cut-covid-19-spread-melbourne-study-20210811-p58i01"") recently showed that adding two portable air cleaners to a patient’s room eliminated 99 percent of aerosols in minutes, reportedly raising the protection level equal to about 30 air changes per hour.  
         
&gt;**Who is monitoring air quality?**  
      
&gt;Carbon dioxide sensors can indicate how well a ventilation system is working. Virus scientists and air quality experts sometimes carry portable CO2 detection devices. Linsey Marr of Virginia Tech, one of the world’s leading experts on viral transmission, has used such a device to check levels at her gym and in grocery stores.  
    
&gt;“Carbon dioxide is in our exhaled breath,” said Dr. Marr. “If the levels get high indoors, it means people’s exhaled breath is building up, and that exhaled breath of course could contain virus if someone is infected.”
    
&gt;[Howard County public schools](https://news.hcpss.org/news-posts/2021/08/update-on-hcpss-measures-for-enhancing-air-quality-in-school-buildings/ ""https://news.hcpss.org/news-posts/2021/08/update-on-hcpss-measures-for-enhancing-air-quality-in-school-buildings/""), in Maryland, use CO2 sensors in school cafeterias to monitor air quality. If your company isn’t using CO2 monitoring, you can buy your own machine for $100 to $200. In general, you don’t want the CO2 number to rise above 800. In gyms, where people are breathing heavily, Dr. Marr advises leaving or masking up if the number goes above 600.  
      
&gt;**Does the building rely on unproven technologies?**  
    
&gt;Many companies are installing what the Environmental Protection Agency calls “emerging technologies,” including one called a needlepoint bipolar ionization system. The system claims to use positive and negative particles to help remove viruses from the air. But many of the world’s leading experts on indoor air quality, including [Joseph Allen](https://twitter.com/j_g_allen/status/1369582135359766532 ""https://twitter.com/j_g_allen/status/1369582135359766532"") at Harvard and [Shelly Miller](https://twitter.com/ShellyMBoulder/status/1369505746505801730 ""https://twitter.com/ShellyMBoulder/status/1369505746505801730"") at the University of Colorado, Boulder, have questioned the [effectiveness of the technology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013232100158X ""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013232100158X""). “There’s a reason you haven’t seen a single indoor air quality expert recommend this technology,” tweeted Dr. Allen.  
    
&gt;The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), which makes recommendations about indoor air quality standards, has said that bipolar ionization is one of several unproven technologies. “Convincing, scientifically rigorous, peer-reviewed studies do not currently exist on these emerging technologies,” [the group has said](https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/filtration-disinfection ""https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/filtration-disinfection"").  
     
&gt;The E.P.A. has said another concern is that the devices can create potentially harmful byproducts. “As typical of newer technologies, the evidence for safety and effectiveness is less documented than for more established ones, such as filtration,” [the agency wrote on its website](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/can-air-cleaning-devices-use-bipolar-ionization-including-portable-air-cleaners-and-duct ""https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/can-air-cleaning-devices-use-bipolar-ionization-including-portable-air-cleaners-and-duct"").  “Bipolar ionization has the potential to generate ozone and other potentially harmful byproducts indoors.”  
        
&gt;Despite skepticism about the technology, many workplaces are installing them anyway.

[],,DiprivanDapper,,,,,,[],"I would say for the context of that study that is about reasonable. But remember the context is what needs to be taken into account because it evaluated 69 total studies across multiple countries and regions so there is going to be some pretty big variance between data points when you break it down. So an average rate of 45% may not accurately represent what is happening in individual areas. The authors mentioned a weakness in their study being that some of the studies examined had low n values (total number of participants) due to the size of the hospital. That number would best be interpreted by ICU and critical care providers weighing the risk-benefit of intubation with current resources based on the patient condition (context).

If you are interested in these papers, but can't access the full articles if they are behind a paywall you can always email the authors. I'm not sure about other countries, but from my understanding in the US authors are usually more than happy to send you the article. 

**Big** side note though, and this isn't necessarily directed at you u/Tenacious-Tea because I don't know your background and training, but this sort of information is not necessarily always good for the general public. Now **before** anyone gets out pitchforks and torches, what I mean by that is **context**. Someone may look at those numbers and say oh that's a 40% chance I'll die if I'm intubated, I don't want to be intubated, I would rather not be. This happened often in the ICU and we had to try to explain to patients that it wasn't the intubation that was causing mortality but the progression of the disease process to the point that it required IMV support to maintain life. It drives me nuts when I see media outlets get ahold of ""breakthrough research"" and make a big deal out of ""we could have the cure for cancer"" or some such as if they even understand the nuances of treatments and how research is conducted in those areas. Then there is a lot of misunderstanding across social media, conspiracy theories are born, misinformation is spread, and people stop believing the experts because they heard the friend of a cousin had this happen to them. 

The format and level of information from these articles is meant for those trained in the areas of expertise for which they are written. It is normally only with the experience and training that someone is able to adequately reach accurate and valid conclusions from the data; and they still sometimes get it wrong (seriously read any discussion section of a paper and half of it is describing where they could have made errors so that when someone else attempts to reproduce the science they can attempt to control for those variables). I don't tell a mechanic how to fix my engine or replace my spark plugs and I would not expect that same mechanic to tell me how the intricacies of their body systems.

1) You can look at the subset of the J&amp;J trial that occurred in the US without the confound of variants and you will see that J&amp;J still performs worse. 2) The claim about incidences rates being different affecting vaccine efficacy is also just plain incorrect as vaccine efficacy is a relative measure to the unvaccinated, it is specifically designed so that incidence rate does not affect the outcome.

&gt;The numbers that are thrown around for efficacy, 65%,72%, 89%, etc. are actually the combination or average of a bunch of different numbers.

Very few people are talking about averages here. This is actually the first I've seen anyone describe an average of multiple different vaccine efficacy outcomes. Many people my not clarify what outcome they are talking about, but I have yet to see someone average outcomes together.

&gt;Basically, the more serious the outcome, the more effective all of the vaccines are, statistically speaking. 

This is one interpretation. I would argue the more plausible interpretation is that the vaccines has to protect less and less to prevent more severe outcomes. Not dying is an extremely low bar for a treatment, not being hospitalization is a little higher, and symptomatic infection is very high.

Finally, new data from CDC looks at hospitalization rates across Pfizer, Moderna, and J&amp;J and found that HOSPITALIZATION vaccine efficacy from J&amp;J the lowest by a large margin.

&gt; Across all ages, VE was significantly higher among Moderna vaccine recipients (95%) than among Pfizer-BioNTech (80%) or Janssen (60%) vaccine recipients.

I'd recommend editing it with the accurate information.

1 out of every 5 **current cases** are in Florida.  That doesn't speak to total deaths to this point.  It does give us some indication of deaths over the next few weeks, but even that's subject to demographic factors as it's not always a perfect relationship.

Worldometers has FL at just shy of 50k deaths with 680k total deaths.  So that's a little more than 1 in 14.

As to where this discussion kind of came from, you're looking at about 1 death for every 430 floridians.  So for a dozen deaths, you'd expect right around 5000 people.  &gt;4 people per units is probably a high number, but that's assuming a peanut butter spread.  That's unlikely.

My guess is that she's still making *some* money that doesn't get put toward repair but most of the benefit is that once her properties are paid off using our rent money she'll have a bunch of equity and then all the rent money becomes a passive income stream.

Maybe then she'll be rich? But if it takes until she's 60 or 70 for that to happen I'm not sure she would be able to work or contribute to society in any meaningful way anyways. And the effort put toward keeping the places repaired and livable should count for something, no? Maybe not enough to be ""rich"" but then again, what do you consider rich? If she's making millions of dollars per year off our rent money I would say that's rich. But if she ends up having an income stream of 200k from our rent money when she's retired...is that rich?

I mean, I would love to be rich without working. Or at least be at my current lifestyle without working.

To still raise the life expectancy we will have to invent vaccines faster and actually use them faster aswell. Sure until now we needed many years to get a working and well-studied vaccine.

The Mayo Clinic, American College of Gynecology, Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine, all agreed that women should get vaccinated because the fact that they're pregnant put them at a higher risk. However, the CDC was still hesitant to give the go ahead.

  
In August the CDC recommended women get the vaccine not because they had more data on if it was safer but because of the data showing the growing number of women getting hospitalized with Covid since they were unvaccinated.

Study's bottom line:

&gt; The proportion of hospitalizations that are due to severe COVID-19 has changed with vaccine availability, thus, increasing proportions of mild and asymptomatic cases are included in hospitalization reporting metrics. The addition of simple measures of disease severity to the case definition of a SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization is a straightforward and objective change that should improve the value of the metric for tracking SARS-CoV-2 disease burden.

Interestingly they also found that severity dropped in both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups:

&gt; Among 47,742 admissions in 38,508 unique patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, N=28,731 met the criteria for moderate-to-severe COVID-19. The proportion with moderate-to-severe disease prior to widespread vaccine availability was 64.0% (95% CI, 63.1-64.9%) versus 52.0% in the later period (95% CI, 50.9-53.2%), p-value for non-constant effect, &lt;0.001. Disease severity in the vaccine era among hospitalized patients was lower among both unvaccinated (55.0%, 95% CI, 53.7-56.4%) and vaccinated patients (42.6%, 95% CI, 40.6-44.8%).",,,,1631808107,{},hd3d9pu,False,t3_pp8aq3,False,False,t1_hd32wsi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pp8aq3/daily_discussion_thread_september_16_2021/hd3d9pu/,1631917462.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_j54oj,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't want to force them to take a vaccine.  I want the vaccine to be required for them to interact with me and mine.  I think it is absurd that you are online schooling instead of them, if they're scared of what should be a simple requirement for school.

&gt; over a disease that they're not convinced is that big a deal.

And the only way to change their mind is for enough of them to die in as publicly visible a fashion as possible.  Hence the desire to spread these videos.  

I think we are also glossing over some very important HOWs here.  HOW did these people get lead so astray?  What made them fertile targets for these charlatans?  What makes them attack things like mask mandates, which are NOT scary.. just inconvenient.  

These people have culpability in how they have been fooled.  The arrogance and selfishness and mistrust of anything that doesn't fit their echochamber is what made them targets in the first place.  

Consider, for a moment, the fact that I do not necessarily think masks do a great deal either, but I wear them anyway because if it helps others a little then it's worth it.  Because I could be wrong.  Because it doesn't cost me anything other than minor annoyance and that annoyance is worth any bit of help it might give.

Only 9 states had lockdowns In March through June, these were Cali, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas City (Not the whole state), Mass., Michigan, New York, Oregon and Wisconsin. California was the only state to have a 2nd lockdown from 12-07 through 12-28. Every other state has been open. Sure states have restrictions, but not lockdowns where businesses are forced to be closed when non-essential.

These are things like closing of schools, all non food/doctor/drug stores, non essential production, cancellation of venus and public places, some where curfews and stay-at-home orders. So the answer is no, the United States cannot handle another 30 days. We will not be getting more stimulus checks or unemployment benefits.

 I think you are completely missing the point that areas of high vaccination tend to have lower infection rates. Another huge thing which you love to ignore is Breakthrough deaths, which is a huge part of getting vaccinated. We can deal with people spreading a virus that give you cold like symptoms. What we cannot deal with is people spreading a virus that has already killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and millions world wide. I cannot find the stats on unvaccinated vs vaccinated deaths, but the unvaccinated are 8-10 times more likely to die. We need a vaccine, and I honestly have no idea why you are so anti-vax, but it is very disappointing. 

Your solution is have a lockdown, which sure it'll work to lower the spread for a bit, but it won't eradicate it.
