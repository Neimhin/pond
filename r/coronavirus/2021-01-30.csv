Going to disagree on the ""things people can't change"" part though. Once I understood the dynamics of transmission, I was able to do risk assessment in every situation I was in. I still wore a mask where required, but I never really worried about it because I was never anywhere that I would really need one. It meant that I could focus my energy much better than people who are walking around in vague fear that the virus is going to get them walking in the park.

With respect to work environments, though, you are absolutely right. And it's hard not to conclude that the reason the CDC and the WHO have de-emphasized environmental and exposure factors is they decided early on that there was no way many people could safely work...and they didn't want that message out there.

If anything, individualist thinking drives that type of approach of questioning everything and taking nothing for granted and testing every hypothesis to see if it breaks, because individuals who exist outside institutions or collective identities can do these actions without social or emotional consequences, ie, being shunned from the group (think of the Middle Ages when religion dictated all aspects of life in the west, which was slowly over time discarded in favor of greater questioning, exploring, and scientific discovery all rooted in individualism).

* April -  May: 80M Pfizer doses ([Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/pfizer-to-deliver-u-s-vaccine-doses-faster-than-expected-ceo)) 
* April - June: 100 million doses of Moderna ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/moderna-says-increases-2021-covid-vaccine-production-by-20percent-to-6doses-this-year.html))
* Feb-June: 100 million J&amp;J doses - 100 million Americans ([Source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/535853-johnson-johnson-on-track-for-100-million-vaccine-doses-by-end-of-june))
   * End of March (220M doses; 110M people vaccinated) w/o J&amp;J
   * End of April (\~290M doses; \~145M people vaccinated) w/o J&amp;J
   * End of May (\~370M doses; \~185M people vaccinated) w/o J&amp;J
   * End of June (500M doses; 300M people vaccinated) with J&amp;J doses
   * USA has about 265 million Americans 16 years or older ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States) as of 2018)
* This doesn't include the Oxford vaccine which could seek out approval in the next month or so 
* Nor the Novavax vaccine which pending US phase 3 clinical trials could be done by the end of April and approval in May.
* Week of Jan. 25th they will distribute 8.6 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna. The next week (Feb. 2nd) they will distribute 10.1 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna.  That is a 15% increase week to week. ([Source](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cdc-anaphylaxis-reaction-coronavirus-us-b1793644.html?utm_source=reddit.com))

Depending on how backend loaded the J&amp;J vaccine rollout is and how many Oxford vaccines they get, the US could give everyone their 1st dose by the beginning of May to the end of June.

So with about full vaccine immunity response, you have 473 cases which resulted in 2 deaths and 38 current hospitalisations after 7 days which amounts to 0.4% and 8.0%.

It can take years for long term side effects to occur in humans. You don’t get liver failure from drinking only once and you don’t just develop it in one day. You can get COPD from smoking even though you quit 10 years ago. You are at a greater risk of getting shingles as an adult if you don’t contract chicken pox as a child. 

Your right I don’t have kids but that doesn’t mean I didn’t grow up with 5 siblings. I went to school and dedicate my life to working for big Pharma. 

Again that is where you are completely wrong. Children are only low risk in the sense that if they get Covid they don’t need to be hospitalized. Covid in children and young adults is asymptomatic meaning they 100% can contract Covid and give others Covid while displaying absolutely ZERO symptoms that an Adult with Covid would have. I hate to tell you but there is absolutely ZERO scientific evidence that states once teachers are vaccinated that schools magically become safe. 

Like I said before covid keeps creating multiple variants. Meaning your child can go to school and help develop a Covid variant that isn’t protected under the current vaccine. This means one day your kid can come home and be completely fine but little do you know just gave you and your entire family Covid that is not protected under the current vaccine. If you cause this to happen I can promise you it will be 2020 all over again and everything will shut down until they can develop a new vaccine.

* DOT's Ferry Division will pre-treat and clear walkways at the Staten Island Ferry terminals.
* On Monday, DOT is placing a temporary halt on Open Streets &amp; Open Streets: Restaurant street closures. Diners may not be seated in Open Restaurants roadway setups and partners should remove or secure tables/chairs &amp; remove all electrical heaters. It's also recommended that restaurants remove any overhead coverings or regularly remove any snow.

**Department of Buildings**

* DOB issued a weather advisory reminding property owners, contractors and crane operators to take precautionary measures and secure their construction sites, buildings, and equipment during high winds.
* The Department will be performing random spot-check inspections of construction sites around the City. If sites are not secured, the Department will take immediate enforcement action — issuing violations and Stop Work Orders, where necessary.

To safeguard construction sites, builders, contractors, and developers should take all precautionary measures including but not limited to the following:

* Tie down and secure material and loose debris at construction sites.
* Cover electrical equipment from exposure to the weather.
* Secure netting, scaffolding, and sidewalk sheds.
* Clear icicles and vulnerable snow masses from sidewalk sheds, and supported and suspended scaffolds.
* Clear roofs, overhangs and gutters of melting snow and ice.
* Brace and secure construction fences.
* Call 911 if there is an emergency on a construction site.

To secure a building, property owners should take all precautionary measures including but not limited to the following:

* Bring inside loose, lightweight objects such as lawn furniture, potted plants, garbage cans, garden tools, and toys.
* Anchor objects that would be unsafe outside, such as gas grills, or propane tanks.
* Secure and clear roofs, awnings, umbrellas, and overhangs of melting snow and ice.
* Ensure gutters are clear of debris to allow drainage.
* Secure retractable awnings.",,,1612124365,{},glikf18,False,t3_l9jljy,False,False,t1_glifxa8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l9jljy/nyc_suspends_vaccinations_as_snowstorm_that_could/glikf18/,1612437605,6,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

All the vaccines attack the spike, it's a good strategy don't get me wrong, who would have predicted this happening haha. However, now we need to neutralize the up spike as well as the down spike. I suspect that will be the next vaccine. But different NSP (nuclear shuttle proteins) could be another strategy of attack in aiding the war.

&amp;#x200B;

No one would believe such a bald-faced lie. This is 100% embarrassing yourself. You know that Tibetans, Inner Mongolians, Uighurs, Hong Kongers and the Taiwanese are being oppressed on a massive scale, do not like and fundamentally distrust Han Chinese (maybe you've heard of the Tibet uprising, the Hong Kong protests etc.). They are ruled by fear and oppression and have no choice in the matter - if they had a vote we both know they would vote for independence from China, which is why they aren't given one and are controlled through ruthless crackdowns. This alone is enough to demonstrate your intellectual dishonesty. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Racial tensions are high \[in the US\] and there's deep rooted division within the nation.

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose the only difference between the US and China in that regard is that the Han Chinese are in a position of complete dominance over their minorities, and its politicians over its population in general, or China would reveal itself to be very divided as well:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic\_issues\_in\_China#Modern\_China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_issues_in_China#Modern_China)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The standard of living in  the U.S hasn't really changed all that much in the meantime for the  average person. Infrastructure is shit while higher education and  medicare is only affordable to the top 10% of the society \[...\]

&amp;#x200B;

I would again point out that you are solely focused on negative comparisons with America, when other countries are just as appropriate as a point of comparison, i.e. Germany, Canada, South Korea. America does have deep seated economic problems because it has never provided the same level of welfare as most other developed democracies. I readily admit that and America's other failings but you can't say the same of all, or even most, capitalist / democratic countries, so that hardly counts in favour of socialist autocracies.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;China:  no wars other than when its borders/sovereignty are at risk of being  violated. No killing, no invasion, no interference in other country's  internal affairs.

&amp;#x200B;

You need to stop giving me softballs, this one is so easy to knock out of the park you're starting to make me feel like a professional. China had no justifiable reason to seize Tibet, Xinjiang or Inner Mongolia in the early days of the CCP, it's borders were not at risk it just wanted more power, resources and control (the annexation of Tibet flatly contradicts your points). Equally, at this point in time China has no place trying to invade Taiwan, which poses no military threat and has been a culturally, politically and geographically distinct country for almost a century (although they frequently threaten this). 

&amp;#x200B;

China may have confined exercises of military power to its borders (and neighboring territories) but that is only because in the early days of the CCP it did not have the military power to project its interests at distance (New Zealand also didn't occupy its nearest neighbours for the same reason). After the early days of expansion - Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Tibet - it had more than enough territory and problems to look after without fighting far flung wars. China also has a ridiculous habit of disputing territory with almost all of its neighbours, especially in the Indo-Pacific Ocean, where it's territorial claims are absurd and have been rejected flatly by the Hague Court. It is not hard to see that China creates conflict with its neighbours by pushing unnecessary and unfounded territorial claims (hiding behind the idea of border disputes to justify its crimes). This is hardly a meaningful defense since China is the aggressor in almost 100% of these cases.   

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I  do not see how China's system is performing worse. Do you? 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I do. China would have become rich almost whatever form of governance it chose. China did not lift itself up by its own bootstraps, it did not engineer its way out of poverty, it's system of governance didn't surpass that of other countries and thereby produce unrivaled results. Foreign countries invested in China and this massively changed the country (the same is true of Japan after WW2), but China took the money and failed to deliver on its end of the bargain. Instead of democratising and opening up (economically and politically) the CCP have abused millions upon millions of their own people to try and keep a tight control of power and have burned trust with their former partners and allies (which is why Huawei's 5G infrastructure is being shut out of foreign countries, why there was a trade war, why countries are trying to relocate supply chains elsewhere, why a long list of of companies are trying not to source cotton from Xinjiang, and who knows what else in the future). China's system is self-defeating and can only be sustained through constant abuse and oppression of its own people because the CCP have no moral legitimacy and would have to reform if they couldn't force themselves on their people.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This is  exactly why the the West has focus the narrative on ""(market)freedom,  (sham)democracy, and (individual)rights"", and produce atrocity  propagandas

&amp;#x200B;

We talked about misinformation and conspiracy theories earlier, and about people believing them with little to no evidence or understanding of the issues involved. I provided you a wealth of evidence that there were atrocities going on in Xinjiang before and you waved it all away with vague, generalised appeals to why we should not trust anything coming from the West (even though many of the critics also come from China), despite having no real proof that the multitude of sources cited were wrong or that their evidence was lacking. I invite you to see that you are the conspiracy theorist - you believe that there is no abuse going on in Xinjiang even though you haven't visited Xinjiang to confirm this and the weight of evidence is firmly against your position, because of a generalised distrust of the West based on propoganda and conspiracy theories of Western interference that you credit without hard evidence (which you like to invert by calling this a narrative, propoganda or a Western conspiracy theory). When you are arguing against the evidence and don't have good reasons to justify your own position you are the fool, not anyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To  answer your question, I do not care about ideologies. I simply look at  results. CCP, despites its shortcomings, has served the core interest of  Chinese people incredibly well: sovereignty, stability, peacefulness,  and prosperity, in that order. 

&amp;#x200B;

You do care about ideologies, you very clearly do. That is also why you refuse to accept serious criticism of China, it is why you choose to overlook / deny atrocities all over China (Tiananmen, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea) and ignore evidence that contradicts your position. The human cost of what has happened to journalists, academics, artists, religious practicioners, free thinkers, lawyers, political rivals / dissidents, ordinary people and ethnic minorities across China is terrible and you should be ashamed for wasting your time unconvincingly trying to pretend it isn't happening and therefore doesn't matter.",,,1612124181,{},glik0rs,False,t3_kpmh37,False,True,t1_glijwc0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kpmh37/chinese_web_users_remember_wrong_done_to/glik0rs/,1612437400,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

But the negative should also be obvious. Information spread  publicly have real, widespread consequences on the society and should  not be taken lightly.  Misinformation, conspiracy theories,  disinformation can all evolve into huge costs for individuals and  societies alike. While one could of course hope that the “bad”  information will get debunked by the “good” ones, remember that it cost  way more effort and resources to combat fake news than coming up with  them, and many times the damage is already done way the truth surfaces.  So for me, the answer is definitely not clear cut and I think a healthy  compromise is the way to go.

&amp;#x200B;

This is indeed a problem that is being faced by countries around the world, and has recently become a challenge for open, democratic societies in particular. There does seem to be a minority in society that are attracted to, and which are susceptible to conspiracy theories, extreme ideologies etc., worse, there are elements that appear to be steadfastly committed to and convinced by these kinds of ideas (i.e. with little or no firm evidence they become supremely confident that they now know the truth about the dangers of 5G, vaccines, the motivations of our political and financial elite, the way race relations should be handled etc. etc,). In response Western countries are now trying to formulate new demands that they would put on outlets that facilitate or aggressively publish conspiracy theories, misinformation etc. (Facebook, Twitter and so forth). 

&amp;#x200B;

Broadly speaking I believe these efforts have been misguided, just like the Chinese measures we are discussing, but we are in the early days of the process so the solutions offered may improve over time. In any case, you cannot reasonably imply that the deliberate spreading of conspiracy theories / misinformation, and a medical professional trying to alert colleagues to a possible healthcare emergency are at all comparable or analogous (in accordance with your own argument this is rational people in a professional environment doing what anyone would expect them to do). I don't know if you meant to make this association but if the measures in place result in this being flagged as a problem then the measures in place represent an unhealthy rather than a healthy compromise, I hope you can come to appreciate. In the broadest context, I suppose you would have to reckon with whether the great firewall is a good idea in principle. Would you choose to live under it (to never really know the outside world, whether the information you are consuming is real or not, living in a bubble according to your governments designs and prescriptions?).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Take U.S for example, twitter and FB accounts  get banned all the time for “spreading misinformation”. Trump, who  literally represents the voices of almost half of the Americans, is  effectively being shut out of all modern communication platforms. Anyone  not blind would realize that censorship is alive and well in the U.S  mainstream media. Oh not to mention how whistleblowers like Snowden,  Assange, Chelsea Manning, etc gets persecuted for revealing mass  surveillance and war crimes.

&amp;#x200B;

Straight back to fudged comparisons with the US, every China defender's favourite form of hollow succor. In any case I agree with much of this and I absolutely deplore the censorship of the right in American politics (in particular, the frequent painting of the right as being far right, and certain, extreme elements of the far left as being something amenable to decent, moderate society), but this is not an excuse or a justification for China's own censorship - which is on a scale incomparable to that in the US, as you already well know. Two rights don't make a wrong, we should condemn both countries here, not one or the other, or fall into letting both off the hook because of whataboutisms.

&amp;#x200B;

I would contend that whistleblowing is a fairly complex and distinct example of this kind of problem. It is hard to draw a line on any issue (what is acceptable, what is not, what are the exceptions or mitigating factors?), doing so at the scale of Snowden or Assange's whistleblowing is even more difficult, though I wish more countries and business could see that whistleblowing is often a public good (as in the case of Snowden), and provide protections for this under the right conditions.     

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""so  I'd ask the very straightforward question, do you think open,  democratic or closed autocratic governments or political systems tend to  produce better results (or are more likely to achieve a better society)""

&amp;#x200B;

After reading your response I should point out a few things that will weigh heavily on my assessment of the points you have made below. First, *you appear to have focussed primarily on economic indicators*, I appreciate that these are important as well, but I am also interested which system produces a better society, i.e. a social, legal and political environment that you would choose to live in, and is likely to produce decisions that will continue to make this the case in the future etc. I feel like this is not an unusual interpretation when talking to people who defend China because in recent decades Chinese civil society has been hollowed out by attacks on religious practicioners, rival politicians, journalists, human rights advocates, lawyers, free thinkers, artists, influencers, foreigners, minorities etc. etc. (social, cultural, intellectual and artistic gains have lagged behind economic gains over recent decades). Second, *you frequently point to the fact that China has become a lot richer and cite this as a sign that the Chinese government has done something right*, but broadly speaking this is the result of foreign financial investment (Western money and business know how pouring into, and being invested in a relatively under-developed country that had a lot of room to grow and absorb capital). This investment was made on the basis of China's promises to open up its economy on accession to the WTO, which it still has not honoured. China would have done well economically whether it was capitalist, socialist, democratic or autocratic if this were the case, so I don't see why this would be an argument in favour of socialism (or evidence of good Chinese governance). Equally, it is China's autocratic tendencies that are now at risk of sabotaging its business deals with the world at large (Australia, India, America, the UK), along with technology theft this is what precipitated the trade war with America and is guiding other countries to try and move manufacturing away from China (in other words, China was enriched because it promised to be less autocratic, now that it is lapsing back into autocracy it risks selling itself short and failing to achieve its potential. Admittedly Xi Jinping has already gotten what he wanted out of this relationship, however illicitly, and can now likely snowball China under its own momentum, but that does not really do anything to recommend authoritarianism now does it?):

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""The  standard of living in China has risen at incredible pace for the past  20-30 years. Infrastructure is well-built, economy is now the 2nd  largest in the world, 

&amp;#x200B;

I already answered this above, but infrastructure is well built in Japan as well. There is a clear correlation between when a countries infrastructure was built and the quality of the infrastructure (the more recent the better typically). Any country in China's position, capitalist or socialist, would have enjoyed good infrastructure - see Japan, Dubai etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Higher education

&amp;#x200B;

Chinese people in China are achieving high levels of education, although it would be prudent to point out that they are not achieving a well-rounded education (in politics, art, religion, foreign affairs, history etc. etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The government has pulled over 600 million people  out of extreme poverty \[...\] medicare are at affordable cost. 

&amp;#x200B;

I acknowledge these points, in themselves they are good things, although it should be observed that poverty has all but been eliminated in most advanced countries, capitalist or socialist, and China has shown no real ambition to do anything other than pay lip service to socialism in recent decades (inequality continues to grow, wealth redistribution exists but is not  to the degree that you would expect of a truly socialist or communist country).

For example I think that short range public transport within the city is very safe unless it is overcrowded (shouldnt be when people are home officing). M reasoning is that everybody has masks, it is well ventilated space because doors open every 2 minutes at a stop, it is mostly half full, not too crowded, people spend only 15-20 minutes on average there, and you can move within the vehicle if you are concerned somebody is infected. But how many people actually get sick because they went on a tram and followed save guidelines.

In my humble but very controversial opinion, people who caught covid either A) didnt follow safe guidelines like masking, distancing, hygiene etc. and basically it is their fault and it was preventable or B) they caught covid from a coworker who belongs to A group, which is only partially preventable, because you would have to have a good sealing respirator on all day long or C) who caught it from a housemate who belongs to A group.

Basically I would like to know how many people caught covid due to not following safe guidelines, and who caught it absolutely silently (like touching an infected surface, or breathing in aerosol that either travelled very far from the source and was in the air for hours and infected someone long after the source left

TL;DR From people who caught covid, what is the ratio of ""douches who didnt respect safety measures"" vs. ""people who didnt do anything wrong but still somehow caugh covid""??? because in my opinion this pandemic is getting so out of hand because 80-90% are douches who did not prevent catching it...",,,1612124112,{},glijvf5,False,t3_l97t6x,False,True,t3_l97t6x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l97t6x/daily_discussion_thread_january_31_2021/glijvf5/,1612437325,-5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That's not even remotely close to our situation here. The last lockdown we had affected a few thousand people in one tiny corner of Sydney from the week before Christmas and New Year's Day for the southern part of the locked down region and about 9 days of January for the northern part. I was stuck in the south and there went my Christmas vacation. Before that? South Australia had one for three days and prior to that it'd been months before any state had one of note.

Most of the rest of the country? Freely open and disease free for months. We just finished having a period of compulsory masks in all public areas for a few weeks in NSW which really isn't a big imposition anyway.

TL;DR - most of the country's been back to normal for many months and the rest of the country has been mostly normal and not greatly inconvenienced over that time either. Full sporting arenas with no-one catching Covid-19 (because it's not in the community anymore for now - actually we've had 2 weeks of no detected cases anywhere in the country).

New Zealand's been even better off and they've been fully open domestically for long stretches of months at a time. They'll deal with their current situation very quickly.

Anyway, now multiple vaccines are here after less than a year and after the population's vaccinated over the next one, we'll reassess the situation.

&gt; It’s like some on here don’t want this pandemic to end, just because they don’t like talking to other people.

I honestly think those people are a minority. Let me offer a little reality check as someone who's been fortunate enough to work from home since March, while also following fairly strict restrictions to avoid catching COVID, meaning I limit myself to outdoor dog walks, grocery stores, and a few other essential errands when they are absolutely needed. I've done zero restaurants/takeout/fast food since March.

I love working from home, think it's great, and would love to continue doing it after the pandemic is under control/over. I get to spend time with my dog, I don't have to choose between 2 hours of commuting a day or 40 minutes of commuting a day with a $15/day parking pass, and eating at home is certainly less expensive. What would make it better is being able to be more social once the work day is over. I would love to get back to meeting up with friends/family for happy hour before heading to an NBA game, or getting together for extended family birthday/holiday celebrations. Since March, I've seen my dad once in person, seen my brother once in person, and seen no other friends and family in person. That sucks and I can't wait for it to change. I miss going to the movie theater, my body misses having access to a gym, and I would like to be able to go to other events again (concerts, etc).

As for work, there are times where I miss being in the office. I've worked at the same hospital &amp; research institution off and on for 17 years, so I have many connections there. It's nice to attend a weekly research conference in person or visit the on-campus cafeterias because of the chance encounters with old friends and colleagues that you may not cross paths with virtually. 

Ideally, I would like to work from home with the option to be in the office, say with reservable desk space. Have an important meeting you would like to have in person or want to attend that research conference in person? Reserve a desk/kiosk for that day. Most importantly, I want to avoid returning to the daily grind of commuting to a cubicle only to have no meetings/nothing important to do in-person once I'm there. Yes, an occasional water cooler conversation can be nice, but not at the expense of 2 hours of my day on public transit.

&gt;The virus is a grim menace now because it is an unfamiliar pathogen that can overwhelm the adult immune system, which has not been trained to fight it. That will no longer be the case once everyone has been exposed to either the virus or vaccine.  
&gt;  
&gt;Children, on the other hand, are constantly challenged by pathogens that are new to their bodies, and that is one reason they are more adept than adults at fending off the coronavirus. Eventually, the study suggests, the virus will be of concern only in children younger than 5, subjecting even them to mere sniffles — or no symptoms at all.  
&gt;  
&gt;In other words, the coronavirus will become “endemic,” a pathogen that circulates at low levels and only rarely causes serious illness.

Fact is, Australian's looked at what we were told would needed to be done to keep everyone safe, said ""shit's fucked, but fair cop"" and did it.

Second, the argument is basically saying it's ok to prevent a more vulnerable person getting a vaccine and potentially dying so that rich person can use their money to save more people (if compelled to).

But they could have saved so much of the US with internal border controls, which Australia still has and which NZ has also used during the second wave in Auckland.  

There is an argument that for the US the Constitution prevented this, but in fact the Supreme Court precedent from 1900 did not declare state border closures unconstitutional and there was room for states to at least try to close their borders.  NZ's lockdown was actually ruled illegal by the NZ courts, but the govt did it anyway and then passed a retroactive law making it legal, and for the future.  

The failure of 49 out of 50 US governors to even attempt to manage their borders shows the lack of political courage.  And closing the border doesn't even have to mean banning entry, just requiring 2 week managed quarantine for anyone entering the state.  Hong Kong and Taiwan manage such quarantines with electronic monitoring, NZ and Aus use hotels.

In both the US and UK there was a window when they could have eliminated the virus. By summer numbers were very low in most US states, lower than Victoria during its outbreak.  The same was true in the UK.  A lockdown then, instead of opening up could have eliminated the virus and prevented the massive autumn/winter wave.  

But by then the whole thing was so politicised in the US that it was impossible.

Even here on left-leaning Reddit people fawn over him (like whenever that video of him throwing out the first pitch after 9/11 is shown).

[],,poincares_cook,,,[],,,,text,t2_uea8mi,False,False,[],"&gt; Israel should have finished vaccinating the oldest part of its population a few weeks ago 

Not really, we've only started giving out second doses 3 weeks ago, with most of them administered in the last two weeks (nearly half of all of them in the last week). two weeks ago only 2.6% of the Israeli population got second dose. Then there's the deaths lag behind hospitalization that lag behind new cases which means that we need to wait a while for the drop to manifest as most only got second dose very recently.

Another large factor is that there is a lot of variance between demographics, in some demographics the % of elderly vaccination is extremely low, and too often the same demographics have some of the largest COVID spread and unwillingness to follow restriction. The differences are sometimes massive, in secular cities like Ranana and Kiryat Mozkin you have 50% after 1st dose 30% after second, while Jerusalem it's 20% and 10%, or Beitar Elit with 8% and 3.5% (the numbers aren't as bad as they first appear as the later cities have much younger demographic but it's still very significant).

This manifests in different results, [this](https://rotter.net/User_files/forum/6015da1b22ed52191.jpg) is a graph of change in number of cases in the 10 most vaccinated cities, [this](https://rotter.net/User_files/forum/6015da0e223b249e1.jpg) is in the 10 least vaccinated.

So it's lag, a lot of spread in general and the fact that those choosing to vaccinate first also tending to be the responsible people creates this situation.

We should be seeing hospitalizations drop in the coming weeks. I'd be surprised if we don't have a huge drop before two weeks from today.",,,1612067047,{},glg3wik,False,t3_l8uwvi,False,False,t1_glg0bys,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8uwvi/vaccine_found_92_effective_in_israel_in_first/glg3wik/,1612391710,35,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That must be why you said it makes no sense for them to pay anyone who isn't working. 

&gt;I'm saying what businesses literally did after they got assistance. 

They did not get the assistance I have spoken to. 

&gt;You said it wasn't true that people lost their jobs due to the shutdowns when it literally happened.

And I am correct, that is not what literally happened. Please stop lying. They lost their jobs because there was not remotely enough government assistance. 

&gt;I agree with that. More assistance would've kept more people employed. I'm not arguing that. I'm arguing it shutdowns did have an effect.

No you aren't. You are trying to make it sound like government assistance doesn't work and can't work. If that isn't your goal you are doing an amazing impersonation. 

You completely removed the context of additional government assistance from your first response in a cowardly attempt to support your own objectively incorrect position. 

I explained how additional financial assistance would have had a cascading effect of keeping more businesses solvent and more employees paid. You ignored that, too. 

Your response to actual proof that the assistance I mentioned resulted in fewer closed businesses was a logical fallacy that ""These two countries had good government responses but some people still lost their jobs!"". 

Many businesses had to lock their doors and tell their employees to stay home because of COVID. Then, ***because of a lack of government assistance***, those businesses no longer had enough money to continue paying their employees. Because of a lack of regulations and laws there was no safety net set up for those businesses or employees and the people in power at the time decided not to do remotely enough. 

If that assistance had actually been provided then many more businesses could have been able to keep many more employees on their books even if they didn't have to or were unable to directly paying them. Fewer layoffs, fewer firings, just extensive LOAs, furloughs, sabbaticals, whatever you want to call it.

In developing countries, oral polio vaccines might be given due to the cheap cost and ability to create immunity in the community, since it can be spread quite easily by the fecal-oral route. This is the vaccine that contains a weaker version of the live virus and has a small chance of reverting to its wildtype form, potentially causing polio in someone who isn't vaccinated.

With regards to the influenza vaccine, there are various forms as well (attenuated vs. killed), but the main purpose is to protect you against certain strains of the flu. Scientists have to predict every year which strains they believe will be most prevalent during the flu season, but aren't 100% correct all of the time.

I received the first dosage of the moderna vaccine exactly two weeks ago. I experienced the usual side effects, chills the first night, and then my arm swelling up at the injection site the next day and generally hurting like someone took a baseball bat to it. I was fine after like 3 days. Three days ago, the lymph nodes around my neck have been hurting like hell, to the point it hurts to swallow, and I hear a crackling in my ears (both ears hurt as well). Also my head has been hurting non stop too. Two nights ago I was feeling extremely nauseous on top of that. I can’t seem to figure out if these are continued side effects of the vaccine. Only reason I’m doubtful is because this would be such a delayed reaction since it’s been 2 weeks already. Has anyone gotten either of the vaccines yet, and has experienced anything similar?

I gave a call to my doctors office yesterday and the receptionist said these don’t sound like covid symptoms and I may be coming down with something. Unfortunately I’m waiting for a new insurance to kick in, so I don’t want to go in and pay out of pocket unless absolutely necessary.

One possible explanation is that Tokyo was somehow super vigilant early on and successfully contained and traced every case and eliminated them. To consider that happening in a huge, densely populated city is kind of impossible for me.

But I agree that another explanation is a difference in how the fatalities are reported. For example it has been found that 95% of the people that died with covid had other serious health conditions like diabetes, heart disease etc. What if Japan only reported covid deaths that were exclusively from the virus, i.e. people who died ""from"" the virus rather than ""with"" the virus? This would reduce the number of fatalities by 95%.

An even simpler explanation is that some countries simply don't report these numbers publicly to other countries to look better. I feel pretty sure that China is doing this for example.

No, it's how goals of all types work. Goals have nothing to do with companies, though companies do often apply goals.

Big projects (especially wartime projects of all types) have goals attached to them. Environmental improvements have goals attached to them. This is hyper-common stuff in government.

So, from memory we have:

Pfizer: Approved

Moderna: Approved

AZ:Approved

Sanofi: Likely failed*, production switching to pfizer.

J+J: Looking good so far, rumoured UK authorisation in mid-late Feb, EMA likely March.

Curevac: Can't recall any new news on that vaccine, gone quiet?

Novavax: Recently concluded stage 3 trials, results look good and production may start soon, however it's another one that the EU was very late to sign up for. UK approval expected in March, EU possibly April.

Valneva: Yet another that the EU was very very late to sign up for, mass production has started in the UK already, stage 3 trials are yet to start, UK authorisation may be in Summer, so that's certainly out of the current urgent timeframe.


It's worth noting that of the several that the EU signed up late for there are big questions over contracts and deliveries priorities, as clearly that has been a bit of a weakness...

It looks like the EU should focus on ramping up production on AZ, Pfizer and prepare for J+J, I would be amazed if; 1: Germany didn't want to start it's own trials on the Russian/Chinese drugs, 2: The EU comission let them go that way, Hungary is one thing, one of the pillar nations of the EU? Not so sure. 3: EU industries didn't throw their weight and protest by the backdoor at funds going to Russia/China. $: The EU populations didn't reject those drugs and risk increasing anti-vax movements.

&gt;The second is that the news of the mutations and the implications they bring is being over sensationalized by the media, as the media has been doing with every speedbump over the course of this entire pandemic. I think this is what people are a little sick of. No, the mutations aren’t ‘fake news’ but really the headline that should be shared with the public is vaccines still prevent severe illness from all known mutations thus far.

Then, according to the pov of the EU, AZ should deliver 10M doses to the EU. When this should happen (after the UK orders or in parallel), is difficult to assess, as people on both sides are literally dying.

In this scenario, I think most people (including Brits) would agree with the 10k surplus doses being diverted to the EU. But there’s not much point contemplating it at the moment because there *isn’t* a surplus and probably won’t be for quite some time. The British general public would never forgive their government if they donated much-needed vaccines to a rich and developed institution like the EU while still in a strict lockdown and averaging over 1000 deaths a day. 

&gt;Similarly, assume the UK is to receive 20M doses of BionTech, got 18M and applied them as first dose. Germany got 10M doses applied 5 as first dose, keeping the rest in storage.Now the production drops massively for a few weeks. BionTech can produce 15M doses. Should that all go to the UK because of the second dose factor? I don't think so, but it's not a completely ridiculous argument, either. 

No, in that scenario, of course I wouldn’t say UK should get all the doses. But again, it is a wholly unrealistic scenario because the British government wouldn’t carry on giving first doses of Pfizer vaccine without a steady incoming supply of second doses. And it takes weeks to brew the vaccines, so the pharmaceutical companies would know quite a way in advance whether they can meet the demand in time, and warn the recipients if not.",,,1612123442,{},gliif1z,False,t3_l9ciym,False,True,t1_glibwbl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l9ciym/uk_confident_of_covid_vaccinations_after_securing/gliif1z/,1612436587,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

What draconian measures were used to contain the outbreak in Shanghai and Beijing? Care yo elaborate?

&gt;You can't keep saying its because we didn't lock down hard enough. That argument is so weak and only results in tighter restrictions.

Why not? Compare Florida's numbers to Australia's then. Care to explain the difference in trajectory?

&gt;Which means living for a year of this and trying no alternative to locking down.

New Zealand only had a lockdown for 2.5 months in 2020. They had vastly more freedoms compared to the US in 2020. The same goes for Finland, Singapore, Australia and China.

&gt;Your views are based on bad science.

What are your views based on?

&gt;The WHO 2019 pandemic guideline didn't recommend lockdowns.

https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/04/15/834021103/who-sets-6-conditions-for-ending-a-coronavirus-lockdown

They clearly said differently in 2020.

&gt;There is an abundance of data suggesting there is no correlation between lockdown stringency and suppression of the virus.

Go on, show this data. You keep touting Florida as an example, but you do realize that their numbers are still really high, right? Florida's cases/deaths per capita aren't actually good.

Meanwhile, tell me how Florida's recovery is going compared to China's or even NZ and Australia.

&gt;Yes some measures should be taken to protect the old and susceptible but closing society on a whole is insane.

Why? That clearly prevents a loss of life. I think it's the most sane thing to sacrifice some freedoms for a short period for far more long term gain. 

I think it's insane to refuse to wear masks. I think it's insane that one cannot keep their gatherings to a small group for a couple of months. I think it's insane to want to host large parties in the middle of a pandemic. I think it's insane people, if applicable, cannot adapt to work or study from home.

&gt; I'm talking about countries that already have been in lockdown for a year and are really suffering do to it.

Yeah, if only you had a co-ordinated nationwide lockdown for 1-2 months like the successful countries rather than haphazard lockdowns lacking in any co-ordination to actually work.

&gt;Coronavirus is already there and there is no stopping it. So lift restrictions because they are doing more harm than good.

Like Sweden? They still have restrictions via social distancing and WFH recommendations. Many other countries also have them via mask mandates.

They don't prevent people from working, so why the opposition to them?

&gt;Australia cut itself off from the world

So did the US. Go research on how non-essential land travel in/out of the US was banned. Go research on how international air travel was restricted to only US residents and a very select few countries. The US visa office was closed, do you actually understand how difficult it was for an international traveler to enter the US?

Seriously, want to tell me how that didn't effectively construe the US cutting itself off from the world when you barred travel from the hotspots early on?

&gt;Also, i don't buy into these death stats.

Blame Americans. They're always doing things like that with Australia and New Zealand. Australians are quite a bit more cynical about our government's performance.

&gt; would you say Australia is a shining example to other countries with less money and higher population density

I think there are lessons to be learnt and data to be collected everywhere, especially where victories have been had. That said, it's always incorrect to suggest ""just do what X country did"". It's too simple an answer for complex topics such as COVID.

&gt; You say highly urbanised, but even Sidney has a population density that can be compared to a French village. I can't find a capital that has a smaller population density than Canberra (444/km2).

Partially because Australian cities are geographically large, but mainly because Australian cities are measured differently from most of the rest of the world. The Local Government Areas in central Sydney have population densities of 3,000/km^2 to 8,000+/km^(2),  and this region is a much closer analogue to how other global cities' population densities are typically measured.

For comparison, the figure you probably saw for Sydney (~420/km^(2)) is for its metropolitan area. Paris's metropolitan area has a population density of around 650/km^(2).",,,1612096101,{},glh33fd,False,t3_l93jc4,False,True,t1_glh1m5q,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l93jc4/australia_records_14_consecutive_days_of_0/glh33fd/,1612410271,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

הנה דוגמה למקרה הגיוני בו קיים שימוש במילית ל' לפני המושא: ""הוא מסר את הכדור לחברו"".
הפועל ""לימד"" אינו מתאים למשפט הנ''ל, מפני שהמשמעות של ""לימוד שיעור"" היא ללמד לקח. לעומת זאת, ""העברת שיעור"" פירושה להקנות למישהו ידע חדש או יכולת חדשה, כמו שהתכוונת להגיד מלכתחילה. 
לפיכך, ניתן לאמר: ""הוא העביר לילד את השיעור"". (לחילופין, ניתן להשמיט את המילה ""שיעור"" ולנסח את המשפט: ""הוא לימד את הילד את החומר"", ולמרות השימוש בשני מושאים ישירים, המשפט נשמע תקין). 
כנראה שאתה צודק וקיים חוק כזה (ותמיד יש יוצאי דופן).

I’m Uk based.  We’ve done terribly.  100k deaths etc.  Something strikes me as strange though - the government has really tightened its approach to lockdown.

First time round and in the months that followed, we (they) were always taking about getting the economy going.  Opening the tap etc.

This time around - we might talk about schools March 8th but not much else.

It seems to me it’s either the 100k milestone or the vaccines arrival has suddenly got them taking it more seriously.

Which got me thinking.

The AZ vaccine (I believe) should have been ready for trials September, but there was a delay as they were lacking in volunteers.  The first lockdown had been too effective.

Is / was it the case that the government / scientists / Illuminati (joke) new the only real way out of this was with a vaccine and the only way to achieve this was to invest heavily in it, and make sure we have enough victims, sorry volunteers to fully run the trials?

If we had taken the NZ approach, would the same vaccine progress have been possible?

In  Denmark most of the positive tests is sequenced, combined with a high  test rate (almost 2% of population per day) and low positivity rate  (&lt;1%) the numbers from Denmark are perhaps the most accurate out  there.

The lockdown are bringing  down the infections R(0) = 0,7 but beneath that the British variant are  growing and from week 3 make up 13% of cases. From medio Februar the  British variant will be dominating and driving the numbers. It seems  that B117 is growing around 60% per week even with the current  lockdown..

**Current lockdown measures** (from medio December):

* All schools are closed.
* People who are able to, work from home.
* Only shops that are open are food related and health related.
* Restaurants: take away only.
* Mask mandated in public transportation and indoor public spaces.
* No gatherings of more than 5 people.

**Additional info:**

Numbers are still smal so uncertainty is high'ish.

Sure it makes logical sense, to consider pausing vaccinations for the less risk groups ""to help vulnerable people worldwide"" but that logic doesn't address what happens, when even one of the people in the ""less risk groups"" gets sick, much less dies because their country put other people ahead of their citizens.

The WHO can keep saying things like this, which totally ignore the realities that the UK and other so called ""rich"" nations face, which would result in them sending their citizens and tax payers money and resources to people who are neither.  

To do what the WHO wants/demands is a lose/lose scenario for the UK and other ""rich"" countires, the only winners would be those citizens/nations who are fortunate enough to be on the receiving end of this deal.

In the end, vaccinations need to be made available to pretty much everyone, because this is probably the only way to try to get this under control.  But it's way too big of an ask, when it comes to asking the UK or other nations to potentially kill their citizens to help/save/protect others.

I pretty much end up feeling like this every time the WHO makes an announcement like this.  I guess that they may feel that they have to or have no choice, but it's still pisses me off every time I see/read/hear one of these kind of statements being made by the WHO.

A nation is pretty much required to take care of their own, before looking to help/take care of others, if they don't then they will not be able to stay in power, unless the nation isn't a democratic or representative type of gov't.  

Mask up, social distance, and do what you can do to limit/reduce the chance of being exposed and potentially get infected.

If China can do it in Shanghai and Beijing, that excuse just goes out the window.

Lockdowns aren't going to be effective if they aren't properly enforced or if states don't co-ordinate it properly. No point having a lockdown if you're just going to allow to travel from states that haven't enforced one without any kind of screening.

Also, you might want to look at NYC's or even Florida's numbers after they achieved numbers. Lockdowns do work, but long term suppression relies on people following the measures along with active isolating and contact tracing.

&gt;Of course not all states are affected equally, but what evidence says that it was because there was no lockdown?

Extra deaths? Look at the aforementioned countries.

Mental health issues? Tell that to the citizens of those countries who have to deal with much looser restrictions without the threat of a pandemic.

So really just speculation on my part, but I am following the conventional wisdom of those with far more experience in the topic.

&gt;…we still do not know if someone who was vaccinated can develop asymptomatic infection and transmit the virus. Although the phase 3 clinical trials were designed to determine whether vaccinated individuals are protected against disease, it will also be important to understand whether vaccinated individuals are less likely to transmit the virus. This is likely but not ensured.

Prior to june of 2017 I was a full time parent for 4 years with a casual job while kids were at school/daycare and saving up to study. I was in a relationship and a functioning adult.

My ex (and mother of the kids) asked to move back in with me when the guy she left me for broke up with her, I said no.

What followed was a 2 month long stalking and harassment campaign by my ex targeting myself and my gf. Only stopping when I got a restraining order.

My ex's response to the retaining order was to take the kids out of school the next morning after I dropped them off and make a false report of sexual abuse of our 3 year old, against me.

It was investigated by both DCP and then again by family Court. Thrown out both times and ex warned to never bring it up again. So she spread the rumor socially instead.

Those who knew me, cut off contact with my ex. It's the people who dont know me who believe her. They are the ones who have targeted me. 

I have been living in fear since then being repeatedly attacked, stalked and harassed in public.

Except when there is a lock down.

It's the one time I get any peace. Since during lock downs there are almost no cars outside the apartment so anyone watching my place stand out. There aren't any crowds in public places for them to blend in with so I can move more freely to get affidavits witnessed or get food/medication (diagnosed with PTSD as a result of ex's tantrum).

My heart goes out to anyone negatively affected by the lock downs or virus. I have been isolating myself since 2017 and it was a horrible thing to get used to. But I had one hell of an incentive program. Ending up in hospital after an attempted social outing really adjusts what you are comfortable with, quickly. But I had the advantage of being able to actually see why I couldn't go out. It made it easier for me to rationalize.

I can't even imagine what it must be like to go from a normal life, to a locked down existence because of something that a lot of people haven't personally seen the existence of. I'm not saying it's not real, just that it must be hard for those who haven't seen someone close to them hurt by this virus but are locked down all the same.

There's really no point in trying to figure out how many people and who to blame individually. All that does is place stigma on people who get it, which will make people in the future either avoid testing or keep it secret if they do get a positive test, so they'll be more likely to be around others while infected and potentially spread it.

I agree with the other person who replied that said this rhetoric comes from people wanting to believe they can control whether they get sick or not, but even when you do your best, you can't control everything a virus does. And that's okay. It doesn't make anyone weak and it isn't anything that should make people any more fearful. All you can do is your best.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; This one was, according to the CEO, and if the Commission have a legal argument on that, they can put it in-front of a Belgium judge and make their case, which to date, they have failed to do. 

I think it is this clause that explicitly states AZ cannot be obliged to any other third party contract under any circumstance. So contractually they are not allowed to put the UK in front of the EU. If they did, it is a breach of contract.

It is clause 13.1 - e of the AZ-EU contract:

&gt;AstraZeneca represents, warrants and covenants to the Commission and the Participating Member States that it is not under any obligation, contractual or otherwise, to any Person or third party in respect of the Initial Europe Doses or that conflicts with or is inconsistent in any material respect with the terms of this Agreement or that would impede the complete fulfillment of its obligations under this Agreement;

But I'm not a legal expert, so I prefer to stick to newspapers:

&gt;According to Soriot, there is no breach of contract because the contract would merely require ""the best possible effort"" to honor the agreements. According to him, there was no hard obligation. In addition, ***he suggested that the United Kingdom had priority for deliveries because London signed a contract with AstraZeneca ahead of the EU.***  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;The contract also shows that AstraZeneca's two UK sites are expected to make vaccines for the EU. ***The pharmaceutical company does not say in the contract that the United Kingdom will be given priority***, as Soriot suggested. London states that vaccines manufactured in the United Kingdom are intended for the British.

The EU put in an order for X amount of AZ vaccine doses with the condition that these doses are to be manufactured from Belgium.

India didn’t order and pay for AZ vaccines. They made a deal with AZ (and I’m guessing in cooperation with other low income countries) to be the manufacturing hub for the developing world &amp; in return to get X amount of vaccines for the domestic markets too. 

So basically the EU paid a sum and put in an order for a couple hundred million doses. India on the other hand didn’t pay anything but offered a service to supply not only India but also other developing countries. 

So you’re wrong in the sense that India is doing it out of benevolence and they “didn’t have to distribute free vaccines”. The agreement specifically states that the vaccine was given to India to supply both the internal market &amp; the wider developed world.

We have about 93 million Americans with some natural immunity to COVID-19. This works out to be about 28% of the population.

Source: https://covid19-projections.com/path-to-herd-immunity/

We also have administered 30 million vaccine doses so far, all of which have been the 2 shot vaccine. We're also administering about 1.3 million doses a day now, and that number is only expected to increase. We have 100 million doses of Pfizer and another 100 million doses of Moderna ordered for now, so it's easy to see how we'll be able to administer all of those doses between now and June (when we're due to receive more), so let's say this is 100 million fully vaccinated Americans due to Pfizer and Moderna by June 1st.

On top of that we have the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. The company released their data yesterday, and based on the timelines for when the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were approved, this should mean we're able to start putting those doses into arms around late February. These doses are 1 shots, which gives them a notable advantage of the currently approved vaccines. Additionally, the US is set to receive 100 million doses of the J&amp;J vaccine between now and June.

So those 100 million 1 shot vaccines combined with the 100 million Pfizer/Moderna vaccinated Americans comes out to 200 million fully vaccinated Americans by June 1st. This comes out to 60% of the population.

Let's also say we need 75% immunity from COVID-19 before reaching herd immunity. Well 75% of 330 million works out to 248 million. If you assume about 120 million Americans will have some herd immunity to COVID-19 by June 1st, an assumption that I consider to be reasonable, and then assume that the proportion of those Americans vaccinated correlates with the proportion of total Americans who have been vaccinated, this means that 40% of 120 million will have herd immunity without vaccination. Which actually works out to be 48 million Americans, exactly where we'd need to be for herd immunity.

This isn't even factoring in the AZ/Oxford or Novavax vaccines, which will very likely be approved between now and June. Even if you factor in a bit of margin of error in these (admittedly rough) calculations, it's pretty fair to say we'll have a great shot of reaching 75% immunity by July 1st.

The one obvious flaw in this math is that it doesn't account for a current lack of vaccine for children. But I will say that 1) Fauci expects a vaccine for children to be approved in the summer, and 2) a good amount of children have, and will continue to, acquired natural immunity to the virus.",,,1612047397,{},glf2ftz,False,t3_l8gzzn,False,False,t1_glez684,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8gzzn/daily_discussion_thread_january_30_2021/glf2ftz/,1612076203,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There are about 330 million people in the United States.

[In 2017](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6826a5.htm), about 7700 people died every day on average.

That means that  (7,700/330,000,000) \* 100% = 0.002333333% of people in the United States will die every day. This is normally: no COVID, just average-year death causes.

Assume we are vaccinating only a million people every day -- this would be on the low end for where we are now.

0.002333333% of 1,000,000 is about 23. That is to say: if you took 1,000,000 people at complete random from the United States every day, about 23 of them can be expected to die. Let's say that 1,000,000 people in the U.S. eat yogurt for breakfast. 23 of them will die the day after eating yogurt -- spooky, right?

Not exactly. Yogurt's not killing them. They may well have died anyway. (This isn't a perfect statistical thing, though. Some percentage of those 23 will be car crashes, will be murders, will be suicides, etc. But some percentage could be, say, a heart attack or stroke that'll make it look like the yogurt killed them.)

All that means is that, of the million (low estimate) who get the vaccine everyday, some nonzero number may very well die. This is to be expected, and it will be overreported: news doesn't report on every single person that gets the vaccine, but they are substantially more likely to report on someone who dies right after injection. Again, not perfect: I hope it's not overreaching to say most deaths are not out of the blue. But some nonzero percentage are, and if they come in the hours after the vaccine there's bound to be suspicion. But there's a very good chance they would have died anyway. Expand that to four days after, as your family member does, and a good few more may die. Also consider whether the deaths are exaggerated given the age range of current vaccine recipients.

Nothing's impossible, but given that the vaccine has been given to millions upon millions, we'd probably know if it was actively causing deaths. Medical professionals smarter than you or me haven't seen anything to worry about. It's silly to worry.

This entire population could easily be vaccinated in the next two months. 

Furthermore, most restrictions that are in place are solely for the purpose of not overwhelming our hospitals. Once deaths and hospitalizations are at such a low level, there's really no legitimate argument to keep things shut down. Regardless of what you think of ""long covid"" it is frankly pretty rare and getting infected with covid is in all seriousness not that bad if you are young, so the danger of long covid is not a valid argument for staying in a form of lock down.

J&amp;J and Novavax are both Vector vaccines. So is Oxford/Astra Zeneca. Moderna and Pfizer are mRNA vaccines. During the same period of time as the mRNA trials, the Oxford vaccine had an overall efficacy around 62% to 70% or so. The fact that J&amp;J and Novavax are at similar efficacies should have been expected. The immune system doesn’t just create a response to the viral RNA, but also creates an immune response to the adeno virus used for the vector. 

I think the lowered efficacy has everything to do with the vaccine type and less to do with the variant. The antibody titers from the mRNA vaccines seems to be substantially more robust that those from the viral vector ones.

The 28 day second-shot window was not because it is believed to be a sweet spot for efficacy.

Within reason, there is no theoretical reason to believe that getting a second dose 2 or 3 months after the first will materially change of efficacy boost for the second dose.

Now in terms of why not get pharmaceutical companies in Australia/South Korea etc to manufacture pfizer/moderna.

Centralizing distribution of a vaccine with uneven supply and multiple varieties, a couple of which have strict refrigeration requirements, across a large country with off-shore states and territories would be difficult to accomplish centrally without significant planning and pre-existing infrastructure.

Decentralized distribution seems like the best choice for this problem.

[],,ImpartialSpectator81,,,[],,,,text,t2_6yiqxugj,False,False,[],"My advice is for you to:

1) compartmentalize as much as you can. Try to have a consistent schedule where you work on school work for an hour here and do housework an hour there. I know this is very difficult with a 1 year old, because they will cry regardless of what you are focusing on. But if you focus on doing class work in a certain chunk of time and housework at another time, you can focus more on the task at hand and get in a flow. If you don’t have a plan you will be reactive and change gears as fires come up. 

2) meal prep, meal prep, meal prep! Take one or two afternoons a week to make some of your meals for the week. This will save time and money because you won’t have to spend as much time each meal prepping and cooking. Plus your spouse can take a meal to work and not have to buy a lunch each day. You can be more time effective, cost effective, and always have a healthy option available. 

3) read *I will teach you to be rich*. He talks about the idea of spending extravagantly on things you enjoy while mercilessly cutting costs on things you hate. My advice is to not only do this with money, but with your time as well. If you are like most people, you work all day, get off work, eat dinner, and then watch tv for hours. Before you know it, it’s late at night and you have to go to sleep. Then you wake up, hit snooze and wait as long as possible before getting up. Then you go to work. This cycle repeats and it always seems like you are running late and can’t get ahead. So really focus on trying to mindfully establish a schedule. Limit passive activities like watching netflix and try to do more active things like exercising or reading a book to your kid. Even something like having a meal with the tv off can have a huge difference. I would recommend outlining a schedule and sticking to it. Set a timer if you are going to watch tv for example. This can be very important to your spouse who works long hours. Odds are he is not getting much emotional or psychological reward at work, try to do something that he can value when he is not at work. 

4) look at local resources that you have access to but have not taken advantage of. The best example of this would be a public library. I know covid has probably impacted the resources they offer, but they have clubs and groups that you could join or take your kid to. Even if these clubs are not meeting now, you can still check out books and other forms of media that you can use and your kid can enjoy. Many libraries have digital content that you can access from home. 

5) focus on the things on my list, exercise, sleeping (I know it’s tough with kids), reading, hobbies, etc. these things are known stress reducers. Try to block off some time each day or week to focus on these things. I find it helpful to not fill up your entire schedule, leave some buffer time so if your kid needs attention while you are supposed to be working on research, you can have more flexibility to do what you need to do. 

6) take a deep breath and stay calm. Covid will not last forever and you will eventually graduate and have more options. I know it sucks now, but it will eventually get better. Just try to do what you can to be in the best position (mentally, emotionally, physically, etc) when it is over. Shit will happen no matter what happens. That is life. the only thing you can control is how you react to what life throws at you.",,,1612060983,{},glfslof,False,t3_l8jt65,False,True,t1_gleu2xd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8jt65/covid19_1_in_3_adults_anxious_depressed/glfslof/,1612386039,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I'm absolutely thrilled we have pounds of cure on the way. However our total inability to contain or mitigate/prevent the disease, regardless of the excuse, is **a huge failure**. Frankly the choice is a no-brainer:

A) Have a quick and science-driven response which brings life close normal after a few months. Unemployment is kept under control by paying workers $1200 every 2 weeks. Those who are affected have manageable healthcare costs. Vaccine roll out is 2-4 months behind a few countries, but free for all citizens. Country has very few deaths per capita, and limited impact on the economy

B) Country has a completely uncoordinated response, with many (even in leadership positions) deny the severity of the disease. Cases skyrocket, putting hospitals over capacity and necessitating mass graves.Depending on where you live, you either spend a whole year in lockdown with mass unemployment, or have no restrictions burdening many with a record increase in medical debt. Fortunately your country is at the front of the line for vaccines, but there is literally no distribution plan until late January, leaving many of the doses left unused. Novel strains start popping up which are more contagious and might be less responsive to said vaccine

One would only choose B under a veil of nationalism. Fortunately the US isn't the only country with a developed vaccine, and the world had a robust response without us.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Happy_Time

&gt;British experience in the first two years of World War II, which included the massive losses incurred to their shipping during the ""First Happy Time"" confirmed that ships sailing in convoy — with or without escort – were far safer than ships sailing alone. The British recommended that merchant ships should avoid obvious standard routings wherever possible; navigational markers, lighthouses, and other aids to the enemy should be removed, and a strict coastal blackout be enforced. In addition, any available air and sea forces should perform daylight patrols to restrict the U-boats' flexibility.

&gt;For several months, none of the recommendations were followed. Coastal shipping continued to sail along marked routes and burn normal navigation lights. Boardwalk communities ashore were only 'requested' to 'consider' turning their illuminations off on 18 December 1941, but not in the cities; they did not want to offend the tourism, recreation and business sectors. On 12 January 1942, Admiral Andrews was warned that ""three or four U-boats"" were about to commence operations against coastal shipping (in fact, there were three), but he refused to institute a convoy system on the grounds that this would only provide the U-boats with more targets.",,,1612081778,{},glgo9ur,False,t3_l93jc4,False,False,t1_glgmgxe,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l93jc4/australia_records_14_consecutive_days_of_0/glgo9ur/,1612402278,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This somehow morphed into endless lockdowns and stressing out every time cases increased even though this was literally the plan initially. And then if you don't wear a mask you are literally killing people.

The fatalities are concentrated in people age 65+ with health conditions and it has surprised me that these people keep dying. Like you think think that after 3 or 4 months of fatalities the same group of people that those people would then be extra careful. But apparently there is a steady supply of people who don't know the facts. Which I think is the fault of the media, they portray the virus as something that is super deadly to everyone and it simply isn't.

Meanwhile they lock down the people that are at little risk, the relatively young and healthy, in the name of protecting the people that are already locked down to some extent, which is people in nursing homes and the elderly.

- You and the rest of Sweden also consistently ignore that the decrease in cases coincides with your long Christmas holiday. Now all your schools have been open again for a couple of weeks without any protective measures. It’ll be interesting to see how this develops in the near future.

It kills gorillas and other congregational apes possibly worse than humans so now everyone knows not to scavenge meat from dead gorillas anymore.   A number of outbreaks in the 80s were people finding a # of dead apes and butchering them.   

When it does pop up It tends to burn itself out because of human reaction (we get really scared really quick). It’ll hit a village and just start killing people. Most people will shun that area (and threaten people who come from it).  People have learned that it’s the caretakers who get sick so people have learned that caring for your sick family members is pretty much the most dangerous thing you can do.   So some people are left with food to die while others receive good treatment if the outbreak is being professionally managed at that point.

The first, is that the rise of specific mutations isn’t the greatest news. We should carefully monitor this and understand what it means. This isn’t fake news as maybe some would say. 

The second is that the news of the mutations and the implications they bring *is* being over sensationalized by the media, as the media has been doing with every speedbump over the course of this entire pandemic. I think this is what people are a little sick of. No, the mutations aren’t ‘fake news’ but really the headline that should be shared with the public is *vaccines still prevent severe illness from all known mutations thus far*.  If you have a jar of 1000 jellybeans and one green jellybean, it is disingenuous to center the story of the jellybeans around the colour green. 

I think we get a little too wrapped up in the hopes of achieving the Hollywood ending to this story - a perfect vaccine where no one suffers ever again, celebration in the streets with the ewok song from ROTJ, the hero scientist who discovers the vaccine gets the girl - and any deviation from this is supposed to be a massive disappointing blow. The reality, is that we’re going to move past Covid-19 and it’s not going to be as pretty as some would like. Mutations may sneak past our neutralizing antibodies but that doesn’t mean we are left protection-less. The vaccines still give our cells the handbook to fight this virus off. Yes, we will all probably get a cough and stay in bed for a few days. Yes, fewer but *some* will get really sick and require a hospital bed and even fewer than that will die - but they will be small enough %’s of the total that our hospitals will be able to handle it and life can resume as we knew it BC (before covid).

What are the statistical odds of this happening to two different congressmen?  That’s such a small cohort, the odds have to be astronomically high?  

Based on the responses I got last time it happened, and what I’ve read about the pandemic, the possible explanations boil down to the following.

- You’re not fully protected until 2-3 weeks after the 2nd shot.  So there’s a 6-8 week window after getting the first shot that you can still catch it.  He got infected then.

- It prevents severe symptoms but may not fully neutralize replication.  Therefore the whole “it doesn’t prevent spread, just sickness” thing.

- He became infected by a variant.  The variant escapes antibodies and the existing vaccines are less effective theory.

- His test was a false positive test and he doesn’t actually have it.

There's nothing else to do in a grocery store but work in a cashier position?  Even as a cashier, there's no other shift where they could be assigned but where the hazard to them or to customers might be lessened, such as a less-busy time of day, or a lane where fewer customers pass through per day (i.e. not the ""1-10 items"" lane).  No way to adapt, no way to mitigate the risk in any foreseeable way.  A pandemic and the availability of some employees that are vaccinated changes nothing in the equation.  Full steam ahead, straight into that avoidable iceberg that might lay in the path.

I'm saying the employer needs to work with the employee to best try to balance the greater risk to themselves, the customers, and other employees because some employees chose not to get vaccinated and some did.  That's it.  It's not rocket science.  I'm saying where there is flexibility within the workplace to strike a balance between that freedom of choice and the impacts, you exercise it.  You adapt.  To do less is to be irresponsible to everybody involved.

I've worked for decades and have on occasion been reassigned to do different jobs, given different tasks from my usual routine, etc.  It happens.  It is challenging but sometimes that kind of adaptability is part of the job.

Frankly, my job in the last year has been turned upside-down because of the pandemic and it has been insanely stressful.  But I'm committed to completing the requests my employer has made of me despite the high level of difficulty.  Whether I can sustain it, I don't know, but I'm trying.  My employer also asked employees to make certain contract-related sacrifices so that they didn't have to lay people off, which I and others have also agreed to.  We're all working on this problem.

Maybe I'm out of touch with reality because I'm fortunate to still have a job, but maybe the willingness I and my fellow employees have for some give-and-take with our employer in this situation is why.  I just think it's unfair for people to have the freedom to choose whether or not to get vaccinated (which I truly believe they should have), but the employer to have no ability to adapt the workplace to that choice.

Some businesses have less flexibility, especially smaller ones.  I understand that.  If that's your point, I accept it.  You roll with what you've got, but to give no thought to what's actually possible in a given workplace isn't right.",,,1612102980,{},glhcfnx,False,t3_l8n07c,False,True,t1_glfpgj5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8n07c/covid_vaccines_are_slowing_spread_of_virus/glhcfnx/,1612415270,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I am not a conspiracy theorist or whatever but I have never understood how you could count these fatalities with such certainty given that a vast majority of the people that died had multiple other serious health conditions.

That said, why do you think the UK's method of counting fatalities within 28 days of a positive test overinflates the number? When they switched to this method from the previous one the number of fatalities actually decreased.

Even elderly people with health conditions can continue to live for many years and if they get covid and it cuts their life short this is arguably a ""covid fatality"" even if they were going to die one or two years later anyway.

Another way to visualize this whole thing is through ""excess morbidity"" which is deaths that are above the statistical norm.

&gt;The cases underscore how many variants could already be circulating in Brazil and raise concerns among scientists that the co-existence of two strains in the same body could speed up mutations of new variants of coronavirus.

The 17 community transmissions include four cases in Hanoi. ""Patient 1724"" and ""patient 1725"", who had come into close contact with ""patient 1694"", are residents of Dong Anh and Me Linh districts. ""Patient 1814"" and ""patient 1815"" are residents of Nam Tu Liem District.

Hanoi has reported a total 13 cases, all linked to Hai Duong Province, the country's biggest Covid-19 hotspot.

Another Covid-19 hotspot, Quang Ninh Province, confirmed three new cases, ""Patient 1726"", ""patient 1727"" and ""patient 1740"", taking its count to 25 since the country's new outbreak wave began last Thursday.

The three patients are residents of Dong Trieu Town and all related to Hai Duong's Chi Linh Town.

The southern province of Binh Duong recorded its first community transmission. Its ""patient 1801"" resides in Phu Giao District.

Hai Duong has another nine cases, five of whom are living in the locked-down area and four others are those who previously had their samples taken in Chi Linh Town for testing. The province's infection tally is 188.

Ninteen imported cases include those from Germany, China, France and the U.S. who have been quarantined upon their arrival.

Authorities on Sunday also reported a Vietnamese man from the northern province of Phu Tho tested positive for the novel coronavirus upon his arrival at Japan's Narita Airport on January 18. Thirty two people who had come into close contact with him have been put under quarantine.

The latest Covid-19 wave with 238 community transmissions in the last four days has come right before the Lunar New Year (Tet), Vietnam's biggest holiday which peaks on Feb. 12 this year.

Hai Duong has recorded 188 cases, Quang Ninh (25), Hanoi (13), Gia Lai (4), Bac Ninh (3), Hoa Binh (2), and HCMC, Hai Phong and Binh Duong one each.

The sources of transmissions of the outbreak have not been identified, with the first patients confirmed being a man working at Van Don Airport in Quang Ninh and a woman working at Vietnam Poyun Electronics Co. Ltd in Chi Linh Town of Hai Duong.

Vietnam has registered 1,817 cases and 35 deaths so far.

The pandemic has infected more than 102.5 million people worldwide, killing more than 2.2 million.""

In Denmark most of the positive tests is sequenced, combined with a high test rate (almost 2% of population per day) and low positivity rate (&lt;1%) the numbers from Denmark are perhaps the most accurate out there.

The lockdown are bringing down the infections R(0) = 0,7 but beneath that the British variant are growing and from week 3 make up 13% of cases. From medio Februar the British variant will be dominating and driving the numbers. It seems that B117 is growing around 60% per week even with the current lockdown..

**Current lockdown measures** (from medio December):

* All schools are closed.
* People who are able to, work from home.
* Only shops that are open are food related and health related.
* Restaurants: take away only.
* Mask mandated in public transportation and indoor public spaces.
* No gatherings of more than 5 people.

**Additional info:**

Danish R(0) numbers have a generation of 4 days I think it is while the UK uses something like 6 days.

Numbers are still smal so uncertainty is high'ish.

NJ population density is the highest in the nation.
NJ is clearly in the depths of real winter... everyone is indoors.

It is highly likely that NJ death rates would be significantly higher using FL methodology.

Is it worth the economic impact? Unfortunately that will not likely be known until looking back on this time period several years from now.

Personally, I think if it’s shown that restrictions were too costly and responses like those in FL were the appropriate path... it was just due to luck. There is no compelling scientific data guiding the FL decision and leadership there is no smarter or better than leaders in other states. In fact the decision seems mainly predicated on the FL tourist based economy, and if that is the way the state wants to go I have no issue with it.

CDC wants all the ballparks open - and they want vax mobiles going to neighborhoods.

**Guidance for Planning Vaccination Clinics Held at Satellite, Temporary, or Off-Site Locations**

[https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/mass-clinic-activities/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/mass-clinic-activities/index.html)

These clinics may be provisionally located at walk-through sites (churches, community centers, outdoor tents) or other settings such as mobile, curbside, or drive-through sites.

&amp;#x200B;

However, **large-scale clinics,** such as those held in arenas or stadiums, those held over multiple days or those conducted during emergency scenarios, will likely require added logistical and technical considerations.

So many people are depressed, anxious, gaining weight, drinking too much etc. They can’t take this much longer and the side effects of these policies will begin to create a health crisis of their own. 

Once we’ve been vaccinated there’s nothing more we can meaningfully do about this and we’ll just have to get on with it and manage it as best as possible by updating the vaccine as required. Unfortunately it means that some more people will get sick and die than before but we’ll just have to accept that. We already accept around 10,000 flu deaths each winter without a second thought, now we’ll have to accept some Covid deaths as well. Hopefully the vaccines will keep this number relatively low but either way annihilating our entire society and everything that makes life worth living to suppress this is insane.

As for the EU-AZ contract, most legal debate I have read does not believe there is a breach of that contract and the EU's case is weak. The EU would have brought in lawyers behind the scenes rather than press conferences if their claim was strong. If you read the interview with the AZ CEO, he claims that the EU application was late, but they went ahead even though they and the EU knew it was a difficult and was a ""super stretch goal"". We don't have the correspondence between AZ and EU - it would be very interesting to check that. Everything in the contract talks about ""reasonable best efforts"" - clearly a very weak promise.

Also note that making vaccines is not like manufacturing widgets. It's a biological process which is very difficult to get correct and to improve yields. It's quite possible that if everything had gone right, the doses would have been delivered. Normally factories take many months to build up to full capacity.

And luckily perhaps, the general apathy towards defying authority in Australia allowed those measures to be implemented.",,,1612091572,{},glgybui,False,t3_l93jc4,False,False,t1_glguzte,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l93jc4/australia_records_14_consecutive_days_of_0/glgybui/,1612407702,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
[],,burtzev,,,[],,,,text,t2_3yb2p,False,False,[],"Not 'all' the population. This is what they are talking about when the subject of 'herd immunity' is discussed. Let's look at it from the point of view of the virus, call him or her 'Mr or Ms V'. 

It begins when V find a new happy home, but there's a problem. V has only a limited time in the abode. At the end of that time either the landlord has kicked him or her out or the comfy home falls to pieces ie the patient dies. Now, when a landlord kicks V out they change the locks. V can't get in anymore (unless they change their appearance as this article suggests). During the rental period V has to come upon some other unguarded house to move into. Otherwise he or she will wither and die out in the cold, cruel world. 

When V hits town there are endless houses, all with no locks, and life is good. As the landlords become aware of V, however, it takes the poor virus longer and longer to find an unlocked door. V's chances plummet, and eventually the poor thing is almost certain to die homeless. 

The development of a vaccine fits into this metaphor in the sense that someone has taken upon themselves to provide the landlords with locks just in case V drops by. This is how the usual epidemic or pandemic develops. The likelihood is that the locks/vaccines will not be totally ineffective. In fact that is close to being utterly impossible. What this means is that the percentage of people infected and the length of the pandemic will be reduced by a certain factor that depends on how effective the vaccine is. 

Now, as to 'telling or not telling'. This virus has become the most studied virus to ever exist. There is a huge amount of information, and much of the information is still in dispute. The upper levels of all governments are completely and *totally* dependent on the advise of a much greater number of experts in various fields, AND what these experts know is almost entirely open to the public. It's public knowledge. It can't be hidden. The capacity of the rulers of a given country to comprehend such matters varies, of course, from fairly intelligent, humble and willing to follow good advise to mentally incapable and uncaring except for their own interests. An example of a politician with high mental capacity would be Angela Merkel of Germany, She was a research scientist in quantum chemistry until 1989. The crowd is much thicker at the lower end of the ladder. 

The trick to all this is that there are few, perhaps none, politicians in the world today capable of forming anything beyond an educated  layperson's view of the problem. There are many, without naming names, who are incapable of grasping even that view of the subject. 'Intellectual' or 'orange-assed baboon' and all points in between all have the same limitation; they can't 'hide' things that are common knowledge amongst the experts. They may make statements meant to frighten or to create a false optimism (""it will be over by Easter""), but that's all they can do. The facts are out there. All that's left is to play on emotions - which is not really ""hiding"" anything.",,,1612091562,{},glgybhv,True,t3_l99o4x,False,True,t1_glgvfz4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l99o4x/new_clinical_trials_raise_fears_the_coronavirus/glgybhv/,1612407696,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Kids transmit less as per the CDC, and seeing as you had no idea how ventilation works I somehow doubt you know more than the CDC.

It’s not gaslighting to go with the facts.

My kids are at home, our schools don’t require masks and our community spread is off the chart so the reduction in transmission isn’t nearly enough to make it safe, but I am looking into a prestigious private school in the region that requires masks, has HEPA filters installed, and ventilates as much as a hospital. That’s still one less kid in the local public school, so it’s win-win.

Driving is safer, but will likely require someone to stay in hotel/motel/airbnb or with friends/family. Unless you live near the border, which is somewhat more understandable, provided they have enough vaccines to spare. 



&gt;Just going out on a limb here but I’m gonna say the people traveling to get the vaccine believe in science


This is part of the problem. One can ""believe in science"" and still be uninformed. Those people need to take an evolutionary biology course or actually *listen* to what the experts have to say: we need to limit the spread until the vaccines can be administered or we may render them less effective or possibly even altogether ineffective. This virus is mutating faster than we predicted because we have rampant spread. A lot of people who have recovered are getting reinfected because the genetic diversity of the virus has continued to increase exponentially.


Just because someone trusts that the vaccines work does not entitle them to walk over someone else's corpse to get it. Yes, they work amazingly well, in fact. As long as we, as a society, don't fuck them up by  breeding and then circulating a variant that is specifically resistant to them.


And I'm not even getting into the ethical considerations yet, this is just why it is a bad idea from a scientific perspective.

I have to lay down now. 

By the way, I live in New Jersey, and I can't imagine anyone here doing this and getting away with it. Maybe because we were literally the worst state for cases early on per capita (yes, worse than New York per 100k, we are *still* the worst per 100k despite lower overall numbers the rest of 2020 'til now), but our Governor instituted mandatory masks so early on that everyone just did it. In May and even June, I remember going down the list because my wife thought all states had mandatory mask requirements in public, but that wasn't true. Only like one or two other states did. She said what about New York? Nope. Even in NYC, it was only ""guidance"". 

So in NJ, even people that I'd never think would follow the rules just wore the damn mask and was blind-sided by news coming in over the summer elsewhere. I think it's cause people here are so aggressive even when they're doing something they disagree with, that they expect everyone else to do the same. Nobody will pass up an opportunity to say, ""Hey, I gotta wear it, so you gotta wear it,"" when you're at Target or wherever. Parents telling other parents to tell their kids to put the masks on. I've seen people get up and leave, but never fight back about ""muh freedumbs!""

The ONE time early on that I forgot to social distance was in a line for mother's day cards. I walked up to the cards and didn't realize there was a line just to look at cards and stay distanced and a guy yelled at me and goes, ""Hey man, social distancing, we're all social distancing, get in the line!"" I just said I didn't realize and I was sorry, cause it was right next to a line to a register. The guy said he was sorry, but appreciated that I understood. No fuss. No muss. But if I protested, everyone else in that line would have joined in a chorus of telling me to STFU, get in line, or get out of the store. 

So you kind of risk being yelled at in public even by people who wouldn't wear one if they lived in some other state.

VIRUSES DONT LEARN

With the crazy high rates of cases in the USA, SA and Brazil the virus has more chance to mutate.

Some of those mutations are more transmissible, some may have increased vaccine resistance.

The solution is to slow the viruses transmission

2) Lockdowns

3) Distancing

4) Vaccinations

His career isn't just a bad blame game. 

For most of his adult life, he was a public servant. He career really took off after getting fired from high-paying public sector jobs (he was the former head of Tourism Australia and Tourism NZ) due to corruption issues. As he is a master of cultivating  relationships in high areas, he falls 'up', not down.

Australia's news media are mostly pro LNP (the current Coalition government), and many of them, particularly News Corp (which also owns Fox News in the US) will defend Morrison to the death. Media fawn over him, as he releases streams of announcements which they will gladly lap up for. He is well-known for orchestrating Australian Federal Police raids on trade unions and media outlets which badmouth him. 

News Corp is extremely aggressive at pushing climate change denial and will tear apart any politician who thinks of taking action against climate change. In fact, he does not truly owe his power to the Australian people - he attained power from News Corp as it led a smear campaign against his first political opponent in the LNP, and has constantly done everything to keep him in power.

**So far, his career is corruption, creeping authoritarianism, and dedicating the nation's resources to protecting fossil fuels. He is also supported by a media protection racket.**

**In the 90s and 2000s, the LNP Coalition government introduced superannuation tax concessions, negative gearing and franking credits (dividend imputations), whilst eroding media concentration laws. The mechanics of these laws are complicated, but put simply, these ensured the older segments of the population got much richer at the expense of younger generations. This effectively created a loyal voter base (it is really just vote buying). Due to the large size of older populations, younger and more progressive voters were destroyed at the polls by gigantic tsunamis of older generation votes (particularly Boomers).**

A picture emerges. He pisses off the nations treasury to buy votes from the older generations. He probably wants to establish a fossil fuel dictatorship. Now Covid arrives.

The way he handled the pandemic was an absolute sham. If he had his way, we would be going the way of the UK. Thankfully, the state premiers (equivalent to a US governor), imposed harsh restrictions and gave regular press conferences, thus bypassing him. Morrison was more interested in a Hillsong conference (his favorite prosperity gospel-preaching church) than stopping a pandemic. T Morrison was basically dragged kicking and screaming into action. The real heroes are the state premiers. **Our secret sauce on how we handled the pandemic well lies in the states who mostly ran the show.** 

You may remember how Melbourne had a particularly nasty outbreak which leaked from hotel quarantine. Victoria's premier copped a lot of flack for weak quarantine practices and he also happens to be a master of deflecting blame and there's the 'everyone's guilty but at the same time everyone's not guilty' atmosphere. Morrison attacked the VIC premier, but he stood his ground.  Once the outbreak in VIC was fully brought under control, Morrison took credit for Dan Andrew's (VIC premier) actions (like everyone other state).

**So a disturbing picture emerges. His modus operandi is fairly simple. Hide from any tough situation, blame anyone who slips up, and take all the credit for it once the situation is resolved. Thank god the Constitution gives state governments a large amount of autonomy.**

CTU also wants people to be able to work from home if they are high risk for severe coronavirus complications or who live with someone who is.

CPS has agreed to some increased testing of staff and students and work-from-home status for high-risk employees, according to the union. But the district’s plan would allow about 20 percent of workers who live with a high-risk relative to work remotely.

The district also has agreed to prioritize vaccinations for staff in hardest-hit communities but the union said no details have been offered.

A lot of hospitalizations and deaths. Cases even more so as the Ultraorthodox have a TFR of 7, they have enormous families living in very small apartments. Add on top general in compliance and you get a party,

&gt; they are most hesitant to both vaccinate and follow social distancing 

This is a bit more complicated. Ultraorthodox are themselves split into different communities. The larger one are fine with vaccinating, but some of the smaller ones have a very anti vaxx mindset and are very non compliant.

To a lesser effect this is true to the Arab population, they are also comparatively non compliant (less big gatherings but also less masks) and are very anti vaxx, with some Arab towns having under 3% vaccinated.

You need to realize that Israel is burning through a huge wave that started before the vaccination campaign.

New York City was a major covid hotspot in the beginning of the pandemic. Tokyo is also a major international city hit by the virus. Now, take New York's population density and compare it to Tokyo's. You'll find that Tokyo's population density is about 2.5 times the population density of New York.

As of May 1, 2020, New York reported about 13,000 total deaths, while Tokyo only had 97 total deaths. This means that the ratio of covid deaths to residents of New York would be 1:669 people, while in Tokyo the ratio is 1:237,000.

Most mutations are neither detrimental nor beneficial and their spread is purely circumstancial. Some mutations offer an advantage to facilitate the spread (like being more infectious or causing less symptoms) and therefore obviously have a better change of spreading widely, but circumstance and luck still play a huge role.

Your argument relies on the variants competing against each other, which isn't at all necessary and as far as I know not even probable. However in that scenario, you are correct, the circumstances would make the spread of a vaccine-resistant strand more likely in partially vaccinated environment. Unfortunately multiple infections are very much a thing, although a quick web search didn't really yield any information about the current Coronavirus mutations.

&gt;RNA viruses are perhaps the most intriguing biological entities in which to study mutation rates. They encode their replication machinery, and thus their mutation rates can be optimized for their fitness (in comparison to small DNA viruses that use the polymerases of their host cells). **Their inherently high mutation rates yield offspring that differ by** ***1–2 mutations each*** **from their parent \[**[**9**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6107253/#pbio.3000003.ref009)**\], producing a** ***mutant cloud of descendants*** that complicates our conception of a genotype’s fitness.

99.99999% die off before they get out because it was a fatal mutation.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;However, their mutation rates are ***almost disastrously high***, and a small increase in mutation rate can cause RNA viruses to go ***locally extinct.***

Maybe Germany could have competed to be even faster since it had funded the development, but where does that leave the 26 other countries?

The fact that AstraZeneca massively oversold it's vaccine and wasn't quite honest in its statements to the media can certainly not be blamed on the EU. AstraZeneca should be delivering hundreds of millions of doses to the EU, US, UK and other countries by now. 

Everybody was wondering why AstraZeneca didn't apply for approval to the EMA in December. Now, that the company announced its massive shortfalls in production a few days ahead of the EMA's approval, the reason becomes obvious. Once approval is granted, the ""best efforts"" clause no longer relieves the company of the obligation of having to fulfill the terms and conditions by supplying vaccines as per contract.

They were put on a flight with other just-released people and the person sitting on the plane a row in front of them also got infected, then he infected his whole family.  

In another case a hotel maintenance worker took the same elevator as an infected guest hours later and must have touched the same button, becoming infected.  

In another case one of the defence force soldiers became infected, though we don't know exactly how.  But he then went to lunch with a friend and the friend became infected.  Then the friend visited a different cafe.  A woman who worked in a shop 60m up the road from the cafe became infected by him, but we still don't know exactly how. Maybe they passed on the street just as he coughed, maybe they touched the same door handle?

That depends on who you consider the most vulnerable, the UK has only just passed the half way mark of it's top 4 vulnerable groups (of 9), groups that make up over 90% of the deaths from Covid. It has taken over a month to get 14% of the country 1 of the 2 jabs. There have been ~100m vaccinations done worldwide, you would need ~1.5B to cover the most vulnerable groups in every country. 

If every country shared just for the most vulnerable it would take 2 years just for the top groups, not including key workers. or those over 65 without clinical vulnerabilities. It is unlikely schools would be able to open in that time let alone hospitality industies or travel. That isn't going to happen.

Requiring teachers to work without being fully vaccinated adds unnecessary risk or health and safety for the educator and at a time when we can wait a month to do it safely. I fully feel for your daughter and family. At the same time, your perspective that they should be working is very specifically: you choosing the health of your daughter over the health of the teacher. Reminder - worst pandemic in 100 years.

""If teachers are going to skip the line and get a vaccine, they can go back to work. They just moved the goal posts to be that all adults and children need to be vaccinated before they will go back.""

Agree. Obviously this is district-by-district, but I believe teachers should be first in-line for vaccine and then go back to work - or skip the vaccine and stay remote. Sounds like we are aligned, i just would wait until teachers have both vaccines + 14 days.

With regards to the IDEA act. With all due respect, bringing this up in January 2021 is quite simply unreasonable. You are not alone. 330 million Americans are making sacrifices and losing a year of their lives, in some case the last year of their lives, because of the pandemic. Literally everyone reading this and everyone not reading this, around the world, has made gigantic sacrifices. I strongly support all rights for the disabled  - but those rights need to be put into context during COVID.

Finally, I recommend you read ""The Two Income Trap,"" by Elizabeth Warren. It sounds like you've found yourself in the trap. If I were in your shoes, I would have one parent staying home. In fact, that is what I expect of nearly all families with children during the pandemic. Please sacrifice some money and find a way to keep one parent home to raise your child during these difficult times, rather than sacrificing a teacher to maintain two careers. I know this is not easy in America - and I am more making a statement against the American system (including healthcare) rather than your personal circumstance.  That's what my family did. My wife is an immuno-compromised teacher of kids young enough that social distancing is unrealistic. It has been clear that since March no one cares about her health. She took the year off and we have sacrificed her salary for her health and safety as well as that of our fellow Americans. Re-entering the profession is a question-mark after what we have seen with regards to lack of care for educators by parents, administrators, and the general population.

I say all this with love and compassion, and really do appreciate you sharing your perspective.

   * USA has about 265 million Americans 16 years or older ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States) as of 2018)
* This doesn't include the Oxford vaccine which could seek out approval in the next month or so
* Nor the Novavax vaccine which pending US phase 3 clinical trials could be done by the end of April and approval in May.
* Depending on how backend loaded the J&amp;J vaccine rollout is and how many Oxford vaccines they get, the US could give everyone their 1st dose by the beginning of May to the end of June. That assumes that everyone who is eligible will get it (I am hearing 80% are willing), vaccination distribution reaches more than 3M per day and no supply issues.
* Week of Jan. 25th they will distribute 8.6 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna. The next week (Feb. 2nd) they will distribute 10.1 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna.  That is a 15% increase week to week.

But I would argue even so, the summer lockdowns worked. In fact, Florida's summer wave was worse than California's in part because DeSantis refused to shut down. We saw the same thing in Arizona and Texas, two other states that refused to shut down for a while. When they did shut down, they bent the curve successfully. 

In contrast, I believe by October onwards, lockdowns were entirely ineffective. You can look to California as the exemplar here. We had tight restrictions, but everyone I know was still socializing in small groups. And it got chilly enough that those were held indoors. Yes, Californian weren't going to superspreaders at bars. But there was enough community spread that between essential work and socializing indoors, we saw exponential spreading. So here closing businesses doesn't really make sense.

(This is to say nothing of the baffling closing of outdoor dining which doesn't seem evidence-based at all. I suspect this was  an attempt at ""signaling"" by Newsom but it was a miserable failure.)

Because the government would be covering most of or all of their pay, and not everyone is an amoral jerk and will, if possible, continue to help their employees able to do silly things like buy food. If you need a capitalistic argument for this because you think people who don't work deserve to starve to death, if a business keeps their employees happy and healthy despite not them being able to work, those employees will be even happier and healthier when they are able to work again, and will tell other people how great their boss is which will increase business and public opinion. 

Treating your employees is not just something you should do for moral reasons, it is the long-term economically correct decision. 

&gt;Australia had a great government response and their unemployment rate went up. New Zealand who had an incredible response saw their unemployment rate increase. 

And without the financial assistance they provided it would have gone up ***MORE***. That is my position. Perhaps I did not explain it well enough, and if so, I apologize. 

I did not attempt to say that ***NO ONE*** would have lost their jobs and that zero businesses would have closed. My argument is that ***vastly smaller amounts*** of jobs would have been lost.

Socio-economic status explains about half of the increase in the Swedish study, and it appears that obesity and diabetes and other underlying health conditions are mentioned as possible causes for the remainder of the  difference. While there are genetic factors for the underlying health conditions, cultural and socio-economic factors are incredibly important in those risk factors. 

For example, diabetes, high-blood pressure and obesity disproportionately affect African-Americans, but sub-Saharan Africans have low rates of all three risk factors. In contrast, North Africans and Middle Easters generally have very high rates of the three risks. But cultural and dietary factors seem to be in play in North Africa and the Middle East. Sedentary lifestyles, portion size of meals, etc. I spent a couple weeks on holiday in Morocco about 15 years ago and I have never experienced meals like that. Five courses and each course was enough to fill you up on its own. And culturally, it’s not really possible to refuse what you are served, so you just eat to the point of bursting. I did that for two weeks and couldn’t even imagine doing that your whole life.

Interesting aside. Read a study recently that did suggest a genetic risk factor concerning one’s percentage of Neanderthal DNA. The study was done by the people who sequenced the Neanderthal genome at the Max Planck Institute in Germany. 

The study pointed to a link between high percentages of Neanderthal DNA and Covid outcomes, based of deaths of UK residents from Bangladesh. 

But here’s the thing. Sub-Saharan Africans have lower levels of Neanderthal DNA than everyone else (.3 percent vs about 2 percent), and East Asians have more Neanderthal DNA than Europeans, North Africans and Middle Easterners. Yet East Asians have relatively low Covid deaths. I don’t know, but that suggests that nurture beats nature when it comes to Covid.

There are an infinite number of ways to define ""winning"" here. 

International travel is a silly one because, by definition, it is an inter-dependent condition. Everyone will restrict travel to places with COVID out of control, even after vaccine roll-out. No one wants to risk a vaccine-resistant mutation.

But all of that is nonsubstantial-- I think the thing I've been focused on in this discussion is how someone can define anything as a win other than preventing death and suffering.  *Maybe* impact on unemployment and median income as 2nd/3rd considerations? Again, not amazing in the US relative to AU.

For what its worth, the USA isn't the worst in per-capita deaths-- we're about 8th worst there (1,313 per million). Australia is at 36 per million. 
We might have all adults vaccinated by July, they might by October.

Is the higher death/disability really worth the ~4 months head start on full vaccination? What the hell is the point of winning on vaccination if we lose on death and economic impact on the majority of citizens. 

We can leave it here, I just need to voice how totally arbitrary and callous it is to contest Australia's superiority over the US in their COVID response",,,1612056835,{},glfkqtp,False,t3_l1oq4y,False,True,t1_gkm1e4b,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l1oq4y/australia_posts_zero_virus_cases_state_chief/glfkqtp/,1612382058,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There is a big difference between all those deaths you quoted (would like to see your source btw) because each and every one of them are direct cause/effect and are isolated incidents.

This is a pandemic. One person's actions (or inactions) can cause a hundred additional cases. One car crash won't lead to someone else dying ten miles away a couple weeks later.

Schools previously wouldn't let kids in school because their MMR, DTAP, Polio, or Meningitis vaccines weren't current.

Your comments wouldn't be filled with such hateful and often spectacularly misleading comments (I just skimmed through your comment history and you have *completely* made up, misrepresented or misunderstood so many things) towards Astrazeneca, and to the UK. E.g variant identification,.  It's clear you do not have such noble and pure intentions about fostering international cooperations.  

The conditions for the AZ license were specifically that it should be non-profit with production widely distributed production to maximise access and protect against vaccine nationalism. It is the only vaccine that came with such license able to be freely produced elsewhere 

You are pretty much regurgitating EU propoganda in some cases, much of it now clearly falsifiable. I've read some Belgian newspapers in the past days.  It's kind of creepy almost to see the disconnect in reporting to even Australian or US coverage of this topic. UK has some terrible papers and tabloids but I never expect this kind of thing from reputable media in Western Europe. 

I'll share with you a quote from the recent Der Spiegel piece 

&gt; If every manufacturer, even the later losers, had been offered contract security early on and generous support in setting up production facilities, it would now be possible to vaccinate at full speed. ...Rarely has a committee of inquiry been more appropriate than on this issue. Unfortunately, the procurement process was so non-transparent that the extent of the failure only became apparent when it was almost impossible to correct. .. The blame is assigned to the manufacturers. Justified dissatisfaction is dismissed as anti-European sentiment. Anyone who complains is denigrated as a vaccine nationalist - even if they only want the best for all of Europe. The EU has apparently long since achieved herd immunity. Unfortunately, only against criticism

So moving on from passe projections of vaccine nationalism', Let's talk about the wider picture for a second beyond Brussels;  the distribution of vaccines managed by the World Health Organization (WHO); Gavi, the Vaccines Alliance; and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), is meant to solve so-called vaccine nationalism, 

Uk started funding this early: 

https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwilliams1/2020/03/27/uk-makes-worlds-largest-donation-to-find-a-coronavirus-vaccine/?sh=5766068a5d86

Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has now recently repeatedly highlighted the fact that “Team Europe” (including member country contributions) is the largest contributor to the COVAX Facility. 

Source: https://ec.europa.eu/international-partnerships/news/team-europe-contributes-eu500-million-covax-initiative-provide-one-billion-covid-19-vaccine_el

In fact the largest donor is United Kingdom, eclipsing EU 

I invite you to click the tab 'Vaccines and COVAX"" AMC donors as of 18 December 2020

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_to_COVID-19_Tools_Accelerator

Notably of the €500 million provided by the EU, the lion's share — €400 million — is a loan from the European Investment Bank (that in part supports now non existent vaccines like Sanofi) and not a direct contribution (something in common with the EU own 'funding' for vaccine development 
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1597339415327&amp;uri=CELEX%3A52020DC0245)

https://iffim.org/donors

Again, I'll let this above link speak for itself, as can the following. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAVI

&gt; In the period of 2016–2020, the UK was Gavi's largest donor in the 2016–2020, 

without the US, UK would be largest state donor to WHO as well, as well as being the first and one of historical largest donors to IMF pandemic relief CRRT above EU 

The facts are AZ vaccine is the most widely distributed vaccine in the world, more than  1B doses are being produced and distributed around the globe **with the goal of no profit, or in many cases no cost**,  it's licensed out freely in technology transfer agreements, somewhat akin to open source software and able to be made in local places across the global 

 there are 150M+ ready to be distributed in Q1 alone via covax.  These agreements were funded predominantly from UK with co-operation of India's SII and charitable organizations with the express goal of co-operation and international vaccination 

Meanwhile pfizer/Biontech has only of several days ago, more than 8 months after AZ finally agreed to donate ""up to"" 40 million doses to covax. 

 here you are ranting about vaccine nationalism' and dispariging the most equitable, fairly priced vaccine candidate there is and trying to act like you're on some moral high ground. 

https://donortracker.org/country/united-kingdom

&gt; European Union Institutions (EUI; including the European Union or EU and the European Investment Bank or EIB) are the fifth-largest donor globally, with total official development assistance (ODA) at US$14.8 billion

https://donortracker.org/country/eu

&gt; The United Kingdom (UK) is the third-largest donor country in absolute terms, spending US$19.4 billion (current prices) on official development assistance (ODA) in 2019 according to preliminary data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

I have some more data on funding specifically of EU vaccines to address your quetion  but can't be shared due to terms of PDF, it's a paid for analytics service  therefore think it would be easier, -- as someone that seems informed enough to take such strong stances on this topic--   if YOU link me your public data sources on what you feel represent the total EU funding. No need to rush. 

Please don't neglect to mention the ' unusual' nationalistic loans like below to products that havent materialized but of course swept under the rug for now

The vaccines given EUA is are safe even if you hear [about someone dying or having some crazy side effect.](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/04/get-ready-for-false-side-effects)


They [work so well](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l7apag/just_004_of_israelis_caught_covid19_after_two/) and are so safe that super smart super rich [people are paying to cut in line](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kzbsfk/some_wealthy_americans_accused_of_getting/) to get them. If they weren't safe and effective, those people wouldn't be paying that much for access to the vaccines.

There’s no such thing as [vaccine side effects that take months or years to show up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k96ng0/how_is_it_possible_to_create_a_safe_and_effective/gfldup9/) If there is a side effect, [it shows up right away.](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2017/0615/p786.html)  Phase 2 trial participants have had the vaccine for over 6 months, and there are [no worrying](https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20201217/covid-19-vaccine-faq-safety-side-effects-efficacy), lingering, or [delayed side effects.](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/covid-19-vaccine-myths-debunked)

Getting the virus is worse than getting the vaccine.  Getting the vaccine is better than getting the virus.

The currently approved vaccines work against [new variants, all of them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kqz7y5/comprehensive_mapping_of_mutations_to_the/)  Even that new one [you just read about](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l15czh/neutralization_of_sarscov2_lineage_b117/).  S[eriously,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4pnde/mrna1273_vaccine_induces_neutralizing_antibodies/) it's [very probably](https://reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l6vs1t/in_vitro_studies_demonstrate_pfizer_and/), [not going to be a problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l0yqe6/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gjwov3s?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) 

 You can feel free to ignore any news story or blog or comment that uses the word “strain” instead of “variant”.  [There are currently no Covid19 “strains”, only variants.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC8ObD2W4Rk)

Many variants aren't that great at being viruses.  [Some have already gone extinct](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/19/danish-covid-mink-variant-very-likely-extinct-but-controversial-cull-continues), and the rate of extinction will probably increase over time. Yes, that mink variant you were worried about last year is probably gone forever.

 Reinfections are exceedingly rare, [like less than 1 in 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kyj0bx/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/) (maybe in the 1 in 10,000 range).  In those rare cases where it does happen, reinfections seem to be milder than previous infections. 

Milder cases, especially asymptomatic cases [are worse at spreading the virus](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kcy2e0/weekly_question_thread_week_of_december_14/gg8tp7n/).  It therefore follows that even a less effective vaccine that still reduces symptoms might reduce transmission. 

Plus, we have [studies using monkeys](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03041-6) that show both strong immunity to being exposed, and sterilizing immunity from multiple vaccine types.  This means that the monkeys were unable to spread the virus once they were vaccinated, the virus couldn't take hold in their bodies.

Looks like [Pfizer's vaccine may also prevent spread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l0a6jf/pfizer_vaccine_may_prevent_transmission_of/) in addition to preventing disease.

Immunity from the vaccine is [comparable to](https://www.verywellhealth.com/antibodies-from-vaccines-and-from-natural-infection-5092564), or better than immunity from an infection.

If the virus were able to evade vaccine induced immunity, it would likely also evade the immunity generated by infection, leading to a lot of reinfections.  We’re not seeing a lot of reinfections.

Immunity from clearing an infection lasts [*at least 8 months*](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/koxkm1/sarscov2_infection_induces_longlived_bone_marrow/), though [probably a lot longer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/klpvp7/sarscov2specific_t_cell_memory_is_longlasting_in/)  It's too soon to say ""lifelong"" but [that is a possibility.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4nkco/the_immune_system_mounts_a_lasting_defense_after/)

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/) probably a lot, lot longer, probably many years. 



The OG SARS virus, the one from 2003, gave detectable immunity [both 6](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/12/7264) and [12 years later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kvbz9y/weekly_question_thread/gizs32j/)   

Covid19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, OG SARS was caused by SARS-CoV. Looks like both of them came from bats.  [They’re 79% the same.](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930251-8) (PDF Warning)

So it follows that immunity from the current vaccines may last just as long, or even longer.
 [Vaccines](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-much-will-it-cost-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine#:~:text=The%20cost%20for%20each%20dose,to%20cost%20%2419.50%20a%20dose.) are likely cheaper than [tests.](https://www.advisory.com/en/daily-briefing/2020/06/17/covid-test-cost#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20New%20York,as%20%24100%20or%20less)

The rollout of testing was slow, and people complained, just like they’re doing now with the rollout of vaccinations. [ News stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kuyacf/daily_discussion_thread_january_11_2021/giwdkki/) about how testing was flawed, delayed, only for rich people, etc., will all be recycled for stories about vaccinations.

600,000 people were vaccinated. They weren’t all exposed to the virus afterwards.

My daughter has a rare disorder and severe intellectual disability. The school system has done almost nothing for her in 11 months. She still is unable to communicate her wants and needs to us effectively even though she was making progress before last March with an AAC. My wife cannot work because trying to educate my daughter virtually requires that my wife act as a one-on-one aid 16 hours per week.   


Under IDEA the school system is required by law to provide Free Appropriate Public Education. There is nothing about the last 11 months that is appropriate. Obviously, we aren't oblivious to the pandemic - which is why we have done everything we can to facilitate school for her. There is a growing body of evidence that school can be safe and that virus transmission in schools is generally lower than that of the broader community.   


Further, her needs have been completely ignored by our local school board. They stopped holding a public forum in March 2020 and have ignored our many e-mails, video messages, and even a story we had published in a local newspaper - they declined to comment. Meanwhile, the president of the teacher's union get's face time with the board every meeting and the board has almost exclusively only discussed concerns of teachers.  


Our teachers have had their first vaccination, getting priority over people with pre-existing conditions, and some over 65, and they still refuse to even go back to work in-person to only teach vulnerable populations of students: homeless, ESOL, disabled. I am an administrator and have been required to be in-person since July 1 - not comparable to having 2-5 children in your classroom, but I do work in person with others every day. Our teachers would have to take 2-5 students per classroom and they won't do it.  


Kid's aren't learning. Many are facing mental health issues that are going unaddressed because the school psychologist isn't seeing them. CPS referrals are down 34% from the prior year. Abusive parents aren't beating their children less, we just aren't seeing it and getting those kids help. If teachers are going to skip the line and get a vaccine, they can go back to work.

###**CDC Updates Contraindications to COVID-19 Vaccination**

— Casts wider net on allergic reactions to vaccine components

The CDC logo over a close up of a syringe drawing from a vial of COVID-19 vaccine
Anyone with a history of immediate allergic reaction of any severity to any component of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines or to polysorbate should not be vaccinated, the CDC said in updated interim guidance.

While previously the agency released guidelines for contraindication to vaccination, it's now broadened to include those with a history of immediate allergic reaction to a previous dose of or any component of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, including polyethylene glycol.

In addition, people developing severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis after a first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine should not receive a second dose.

All ingredients in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were listed by CDC in an ""interim clinical considerations"" document posted on the agency's website (see Appendix B). Polysorbate is not a vaccine ingredient but was included because people sensitive to it may also react to polyethylene glycol.

People with allergy histories involving these substances should be considered for allergist/immunologist referral to determine if they can receive the vaccine, the agency said in a call with clinicians.

""This guidance is being updated primarily because starting in a few days, people who got their first dose will be eligible to receive a second dose and we thought providers needed more guidance,"" said the CDC's Sarah Mbaeyi, MD, on the call. ""We are continuously reevaluating our guidelines to make sure they are based on the best available information, so providers had more information available when people started coming in for their second dose of vaccines.""

CDC guidance defined an ""immediate allergic reaction"" as any hypersensitivity-related signs or symptoms such as urticaria, angioedema, respiratory distress such as wheezing, or anaphylaxis that occur within four hours following exposure.

But it is important to distinguish allergic reactions from other symptoms, such as vasovagal symptoms or vaccine side effects. Mbaeyi noted about 90% of people with anaphylaxis present with skin findings, ""which can be helpful in distinguishing allergic reactions from other reactions.""

She added that most immediate allergic reactions occur within 15-30 minutes of vaccination, whereas vaccine side effects, such as fever, chills or fatigue, occur a median of 1-3 days following vaccination.

Those with immediate allergic reaction to any vaccine or injectable therapy not related to a COVID vaccine component or polysorbate requires a balance of the risks and benefits of vaccination. Mbaeyi said in those cases, vaccination may be deferred and the individual may wish to consult with an allergist-immunologist.

Risks may include risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, risk of severe disease or death, an unknown risk of anaphylaxis and the ability of the patient to be vaccinated where appropriate medical care is immediately available for anaphylaxis.

However, as before, history of allergic reactions not related to vaccines, injectable therapies or components of mRNA vaccines -- such as food, pet dander, or latex -- is not a contraindication to vaccination, Mbaeyi said.

Those with a precaution to vaccination or history of anaphylaxis due to any cause should be observed for 30 minutes following vaccination, and all other persons should be observed for 15 minutes afterwards.

Tom Shimabukuro, MD, also of the CDC, said that cases of anaphylaxis following COVID-19 vaccination had received outsized media attention. ""These are still very rare events,"" he said.

Nature doesn't have a will or anything, it's not conscious. There is not, for instance, an opposing force that would try to keep humans alive if we were near extinction. We're always pushing up against the planet's human carrying capacity, so disaster always happens. 

It's like, if a skyscraper falls over in a strong wind, was it gravity's tripwire? No. Gravity is blind, it just makes everything fall. We've been able to push the limit of building height higher and higher, and there's no penalty for it - Small buildings don't fall over sympathetically or anything.

&gt; I'm fear to think what else lies in wait.

More animal-borne viruses for as long as people eat meat. More pollution-related problems for as long as hydrocarbon fuels are burned for energy. Lead is still a problem in a few places, water supplies, aviation gas, etc. People still fight over religion. It's not clear if imperialism really ended, racism and poverty and hunger sure didn't, and there will always be people who want to make democracies back into their own monarchies.

What scares me most is that we can't coordinate very well. The solutions to these problems are mostly knowable and feasible, but it's hard to keep everyone on the same page. It seems like mind-viruses form almost instantly and spread online way faster than any biological virus, and then they form cysts that protect them from treatment.

The catch is that nobody knows nor **can** anybody know the exact time when a given point mutation in a virus has occurred. The 'probability' is that the mutation occurred before whatever segment of the population was vaccinated in whatever country. This, however, is probability, not certainty. 

There is no way on God's green Earth that anyone can tell 'when' something as simple as a point mutation happened. You may be right that some or even all of these mutations occurred prior to the (recent and very spotty) vaccine provision. No country, except perhaps Israel,  has achieved anywhere near the coverage where there is significant selective pressure from the direction of vaccine resistance. 

What is the situation where you 'can tell' the approximate time of a mutation ? That is what is done in genomic studies of bacteria and eukaryotes. In such cases the researcher looks at whole genes, counts the number of point mutations and hazards a guess informed by the fact that different genes mutate at different rates. There are, however, more 'molecular clocks' than there are time zones, and not a won is 100% accurate. 2 difference - recent. 10 differences - some time ago. 50 differences - heading to deep time.",,,1612118460,{},gli7k7t,True,t3_l99o4x,False,True,t1_glh8gel,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l99o4x/new_clinical_trials_raise_fears_the_coronavirus/gli7k7t/,1612431192,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You're comparing the US to Europe to claim it isn't an outlier, but that's not the right comparison to make.  A better comparison would be Canada, which has the same urban population rate, a colder climate and a similar demographic structure.  The US death rate is 2.5 times higher than Canada's.  (And that's not to say Canada has even done very well.  They also have made the stunning mistake of letting arrivals self-quarantine, which many people just won't do.)

Do you really think China does things right?

You can cherry pick any two countries and say lockdown did/didn't work, just as I can do with florida and california. I'm not saying florida's numbers are good, I'm saying that they are the same as places that had much stricter lockdowns. Across the board, there are so many examples of places with strict lockdowns and high excess mortality (Peru, Italy, Belgium, UK)  and there are also places that had light or no restrictions (Sweden, Switzerland, Uruguay, Estonia) and had moderate or low excess mortality. And I believe excess mortality is the best metric because it rules the influence bad testing, the way deaths are counted, co-morbidity, etc. https://ourworldindata.org/search?q=excess+mortality This is a good database. Also, pandadata https://www.pandata.org/ has measured the relationship between lockdown stringency and excess mortality. My views are rational thinking, looking at the actual benefit of what we are doing, versus the enormous cost. 

I don't consider one year to be a short period. If we try to stop the spread for a couple months fine, but once its here it isn't going anywhere. Who says you are saving life with these measures? Suicides, drug overdose, domestic abuse, diagnosed cancers, child abuse, depression, loneliness all have skyrocketed through this pandemic. And I know multiple people who have been affected by these issues. I know people that aren't getting cancer treatment because of this. I don't even know someone who knows someone who died from covid19. And on top of that, we know that a very high percentage of people that die from Covid were very old or had underlying issues. I have loved ones that could have their compromised by this virus. But I also have loved ones that are seriously comprised by these measures. The difference is we have no control over a virus, we have control over the measures though. 

Yeah i actually support Sweden's approach. Made recommendations to the public, kept stores and schools opens, advised that masks don't offer protection.

Sure if you isolate entire ships for 40 days then its obvious that would have an impact on spread. But we are well past that point because the virus is everywhere. A quarantine is used to stop the spread. We haven't stopped the spread nor will we ever at this point.

I really take everything from mainstream media with a grain of salt. But now I can see where your logic comes from. 

Perhaps the reason is that people need to leave their homes for their own sanity. We need connection and to be able to go out and do things, see friends, family, travel.

EVERYBODY mishandled the cruise ship passengers plus folks returning to California from Asia. 

PLUS folks flying in from Europe after the Italan outbreaks.

Yeah, maybe you shouldn't comment if you don't actually know what their COVID policies are.

&gt;just as I can do with florida and california.

Why would you do so with states that allow for travel between them without much restrictions? It's one of the reasons Finland is doing better than the EU countries that didn't impose any restriction on air travel within EU.

&gt;Across the board, there are so many examples of places with strict lockdowns and high excess mortality (Peru, Italy, Belgium, UK)

Peru is an impoverished country that has socioeconomic factors which affect the efficacy of its lockdowns.

Italy's two lockdowns did their jobs in suppressing the outbreak. That obviously require maintenance via things like mask mandates and strict enforcement of social distancing guidelines.

UK took too long to impose a lockdown, so what's the argument there?

&gt;Sweden

Have you looked at Sweden's latest numbers compared to its immediate neighbours?

You seem to miss the point of a lockdown though. A *decisive* lockdown is meant to address an outbreak that's surging. Once the surge has been dealt with, the goal is to re-open gradually while maintaining the aforementioned measures along with contact tracing and isolation/quarantines. Whoever said a lockdown was needed for a year? If that's the case, then it's a failure from the top down. I would certainly blame the previous administration - because their inability to coordinate state lockdowns is why they see such reduced efficacy and increased duration in the US.

&gt;https://ourworldindata.org/search?q=excess+mortality

Your link literally shows high numbers for excess mortality and you somehow conclude that COVID deaths are overcounted, really?

&gt;https://www.pandata.org/

Why don't you link to the actual peer-reviewed study then?

&gt;My views are rational thinking, looking at the actual benefit of what we are doing, versus the enormous cost.

What's the enormous cost facing countries like China and Australia again? New Zealand? Finland? Singapore? Vietnam?

&gt;If we try to stop the spread for a couple months fine, but once its here it isn't going anywhere.

Nope, but it can be managed so that hospitals and frontline workers don't get overwhelmed. The numbers can be reduced via measures so that contact tracing is effective and clusters can be detected early and contained.

The most effective way so far is through a decisive and *federally co-ordinated* lockdown. When did that happen in the US?

&gt;Suicides, drug overdose, domestic abuse, diagnosed cancers, child abuse, depression, loneliness all have skyrocketed through this pandemic.

Funny, why don't you see that happening in countries with stricter lockdowns than the US? It's almost as though having the necessary stimulus to tide people through the lockdown helps.

&gt;I know people that aren't getting cancer treatment because of this.

People don't get access to such treatments if hospitals are overwhelmed too. Is that better?

&gt;But I also have loved ones that are seriously comprised by these measures. The difference is we have no control over a virus, we have control over the measures though.

The failed measures under Trump =/= a properly implemented lockdown being ineffective. Not having mask mandates or enforced social distancing guidelines to ensure businesses can be opened safely =/= lockdowns not working.

You seem to shift all the failures of poor leadership towards lockdowns. Why?

&gt;Yeah i actually support Sweden's approach.

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/sweden-toughens-up-coronavirus-rules-as-infections-and-deaths-rise.html

These measures? Funny, they share many similarities with lockdowns. I guess you're fine with it if it just isn't called one, right?

&gt;Meanwhile people were still visiting family and friends.

Finland had a lockdown for 2 months from Feb to April 2020. After which they've actually had looser restrictions than Sweden. The same goes for New Zealand. It goes the same for many countries with strict lockdowns. Meanwhile, unlike those countries, Sweden had to impose much stricter measures last November.

The result? Stricter measures for a couple of months in exchange for an economy that recovers more quickly, in exchange for returning to normalcy sooner and in exchange for far fewer cases/deaths. I think it's obvious which choice I'll choose.

&gt;taking into account the well being of society as a whole.

Tell that to the high number of COVID deaths Sweden has from the start. Or tell that to the elderly in care homes who were effectively forced into lockdown via isolation until September 2020. That's not 'a whole' as you're positing.

People don't come back from death or even long term sequelae. As someone who's young, I absolutely can deal with a quick lockdown without issue.

Well the public knows the EU contract, it was release and it's not hiding behind it. Unlike the UK that claims it's for ""security reasons"".

&gt;The UK government put together the coalition of organisations to manufacture the AZ vaccine. The vaccine would not exist without the large amount of funding and organisational help.

Just like BioNTech received funding from EU, so the vaccine that kicked off USA, UK and Isreal wouldn't exist either - imagine the EU claiming all European supply for themselves.

&gt;Why shouldn't the UK get a preferential contract over the EU, given the amount of effort, and the fact that the EU signed 3 months later than the UK, leaving little time for manufacturing development? Also note that this vaccine is sold at cost, is freely given to others who want to manufacture it (like India and the EU).

Well that seems to be a problem for AZ that's signing contracts that can't be fulfilled, ain't it? Missing 70 million doses out of 100 million, with a 2 month notice? Are you kidding me? 70 million doses is enough to immunize 90% of German population, this isn't a ""ups we didn't manage to make 1 million doses :("".

It was AZ that said they would sell at cost, it wasn't EU that claimed that. The EU is buying BioNTech vaccines with a margin on top of cost, just like every other country.

It was AZ that said they had the production capacity to deliver 100 million doses by March up until last week.

The EU didn't demand that vaccines would have to be produced in specific places, neither that any contract would compromise the agreement - you should check the contract it's pretty clear.

If they didn't have time to fulfill such orders, then maybe they shouldn't have taken the contract, right? Basically they breached the contract, compromised the vaccination programme that could have been invested into other vaccines like BioNTech or even get approval to China or Russia vaccine instead of wasting time with AZ trial.",,,1612119968,{},gliav24,False,t3_l9c4rn,False,False,t1_gli885z,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l9c4rn/coronavirus_germany_open_to_chinese_and_russian/gliav24/,1612432824,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The problem relates to **inadequate results in older adults in Sanofi’s Phase 1/2 trial,** which the company traced back to an inadequate formulation of their vaccine, Su-Peing Ng, global medical head for Sanofi Vaccines, told STAT in an interview.

&amp;#x200B;

if they had trials with a 4 month gap.. 

we'd still be waiting for Phase 3 Trials, not vaccinating right now.

so there's certainly a matter of urgency to get through trials.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;imperative that we stick to the script

because that's the way the trials were run.

&amp;#x200B;

but it's ALSO scripted to vax with 2-3-4 MONTH intervals.

because we do it to 

**all the babies**

that have no immunity to anything.

&amp;#x200B;

so.. what I'd like to see is the scientific/medical explanation about the why infants (with ZERO protection) can hang with such large gaps between boosters and adults cannot.

&amp;#x200B;

i fully appreciate the desire to stick to the way the trials were conducted.. but the lack of baby vax vs adult vax explanation bugs me.

&amp;#x200B;

is there a scientific reason (besides because trials) that says you can't do it like polio?

You asked why it was wrong for the EU to block vaccines but fine for the UK and USA (not that either of them have really blocked exports, only required prioritisation). The reason for that lies with when the made those requirements as this allowed the manufacturers to set up supply chains to deliver vaccines to both of those countries and the rest of the world. 

In this case the UK required a dedicated supply until it had been provided 100 million doses. Therefore AZ set up factories in the UK to do this. When the EU then signed a contract (3 months later) they then started to set up another supply chain in the EU to deliver those doses. As a company such as Pfizer already had a supply chain in the EU (and the EU made no such demands) they had no reason to set up a separate supply chain to deliver doses to countries such as the UK. If the EU had decided it wanted similar prioritisation last summer Pfizer could have investigated other supply chains to meet the needs of the UK and others. The issue is the EU deciding that it now wants to do this because of it's own mistakes and giving other countries and the manufacturers no time to work around these demands.

Now onto the other point you've suddenly raised. If you read the AZ/EU contract it only specifies the requirement for AZ's best efforts to meet it's schedule. As this was intended to be done using it's supply chain within the EU (and funded by the EU) which hit problems (in part due to the short time from the EU signing a contract to expecting deliveries) then AZ have still made best efforts to meet the contract. There is no requirement to use factories in the UK (funded by the UK government) until the UK has received it's 100 million does as this would violate the AZ/UK contract and would therefore be far more than expected by ""best efforts""

Do you think Canada will wait for their phase 3 clinical trial in Mexico/US (30K) to be over before approving?  We haven't even gotten any documents from Novavax.  According to how long we know phase 3 trials take the Novavax US/Mexico trial should be over at the end of April and approved in May.
