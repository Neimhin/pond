You strike me as liking the taste of corporate boot.

&gt; When they open a store in an area they bring a ton of jobs with them and all sorts of benefits for consumers. When you make the environment unprofitable they will leave, then you will call the area a food desert and talk about injustice.

John Galt is that you?

Again there is a massive gulf between unprofitable and a bit less profitable. Corporations, retailers in particular will spend hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars on a number of relatively wasteful things before they spend it on payroll.

What you aren't addressing is the why. Corporations do this because every time wages grow, it moves the goalpost permanently for them. They want wage stagnation because they want to maximize profits, and are completely uninterested in the quality of life of their labor.

And this lab took this virus (the 96% match) and was trying to make it more contagious to humans, exposing it to human lung cells in petri dishes for the (noble) purpose of finding a vaccine.

Containing the virus has been linked to better economic outcomes across the world. The countries that saved lives, saved their economies.

The economic cost of Covid to the USA is estimated at 90% of GDP.

“The estimated cumulative financial costs of the COVID-19 pandemic related to the lost output and health reduction is shown in Table 1. The total cost is estimated at more than $16 trillion, or roughly 90% of annual GDP of the United States. For a family of 4, the estimated loss would be nearly $200,000.

“The estimated cumulative financial costs of the COVID-19 pandemic related to the lost output and health reduction is shown in Table 1. The total cost is estimated at more than $16 trillion, or roughly 90% of annual GDP of the United States. For a family of 4, the estimated loss would be nearly $200,000. About half of this amount is the lost income from the COVID-19-induced recession; the remainder is the economic impact of shorter and less healthy life.""

It is already confirmed SARS (as we know) originated here. The virus of COVID-19 has a 96.1% DNA match with the RaTG13 virus they already knew about that originated there (which killed 3). Most of the scientific community presumed it came from Wuhan. 

And when I read article like [""Discovery of novel fungal species and pathogens on bat carcasses in a cave in Yunnan Province, China""](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7473127/), I can help but feel like ""science has gone too far"".  Like why though? We talk about how important it is to prevent the spread of these viruses in humans to avoid mutation, but do nothing to cull it in the bats now. Sure, I could be reasoned to be ignorant and not appreciate the science behind the using these to create better vaccines later, but there has to be a point where that's where it's too dangerous.

Are you saying that they were collecting sample
from the wet market to test for viruses? Obviously that’s stupid.

I’m guessing you may have been saying that they wanted to study transmission patterns at the wet market, though. This is just as implausible. First, that wasn’t what this lab was for. Secondly, with no outbreak going on, what are they studying? They’d much more likely study something like transmission patterns with computer models. And yes those models may, for example, be based on how people interact at a wet market. But it’s idiotic to think that a lab would choose to be next to a wet market to create those models. 

Especially since scientists from this lab routinely traveled hundreds of kilometers away to collect samples from bats who are susceptible to this type of coronavirus. You’re telling me it was much more important for them to be next to a wet market to examine how people interacted than it was to be near populations of animals that provided the samples for the *actual* kind of research they did?

I don’t claim to understand why they had a lab in Wuhan, it’s probably a simple explanation. But I am confident that explanation is not “because they predicted viruses were likely to break out there.” I mean, haven’t we already debunked that the wet market was inherently dangerous?

I only evidence of treating the virus after it has spread to humans (eg: develop therapeutics or more easily develop a vaccine like manufactured hybrid virus). That's like saying we develop better smoke fans without putting out the fire that's burning.

But you can still take samples and cull the bat population. The concept of ""we need to better treat a new virus in case it mutates"" while at the same time just letting it replicate and mutate can easily become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I know I'm ignorant in this subject. I looked at what Peter Daszak (tasked by WHO to find the COVID origin) has to say about bat culling and he's against it. The reasoning is strong it can hurt the ecosystem because they eat inspect pests and pollinate fruits, and also bats are ""beautiful and interesting"". He also says it can be worse when those who try to cull do a bad job and end up infecting themselves like what apparently happened in with the Nipah virus in Malaysia. But I'm not sure if he's being honest here, because everything I read [says the opposite](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/02/25/515258818/a-taste-for-pork-helped-a-deadly-virus-jump-to-humans).

There's a heavy emphasis on  individualism, deep-rooted suspicion of public authority, and an extremely divided political culture. Combine that with social media and self-reinforcing echo chambers and you have a recipe for disaster. All of these attributes are present in other Western nations as well, but only the U.S. really dials it up to ten in areas like the polarization of the political climate, which is why the U.S. fared worse than many other Western nations, IMHO.

Some of these elements (like a focus on individualism) are actually beneficial in many contexts, but clearly are detrimental in context of taming a pandemic. You really need public deference and collectivism to make a lot of public health measures work to their fullest extent. Virtually from Day 1, the pandemic was bizarrely politicized. Something as simple as wearing a mask rapidly went from being a politically agnostic, common-sense precaution to being framed in the context of individual rights, or seen through the lens of Democrats vs. Republicans. 

One really interesting thought experiment would be how would things would look differently in the U.S. if the government had said at the start of the pandemic that it was a biological attack by a non-state actor like ISIS (i.e. some terrorist group had stolen and released the pathogen from the lab in Wuhan?) - obviously, this isn't what happened, but imagining how things would play out differently if it had is interesting to think about. I believe you'd see MUCH, MUCH higher compliance with health restrictions, because the narrative would've been about ""coming together to foil the terrorists!"" versus a red vs. blue issue.

However I don’t agree with calls for vaccinated people to be allowed to roam in stores or restaurants or generally in public without masks because this creates a false sense of normalcy that actually we don’t have yet because we still have so many unvaccinated.

I'm confused what you mean by this. For example with covid we found out that ""natural transmission"" is more likely to occur when people don't wear masks and don't follow guidelines. The solution to that isn't found by looking where the virus came from.

I'm all for discovering what caused the virus, but let's not pretend it'll change HOW WE ARE SUPPOSED TO MITIGATE NEW VIRUSES BEING SPREAD WHEN THEY OCCUR.  Because they WILL occur. And maybe looking into covid will help it occur less often. Maybe that's what you mean? Although the better way to prevent new diseases would be to fix the climate change issue. As the world heats it becomes easier for new organisms like that to develop for a variety of reasons. Nor would looking into the origins provide us with any insight into what to do WHEN a new virus occurs.

Evidence is information that increases our belief of a proposition.

The Covid-19 is 96% related to viruses found in horseshoe bats.  
These bats are found in Southern China, not Wuhan  
The Wuhan virology institute is the only BSL-4 lab in China  
The lab has one one of the largest collections of corona viruses in the world  
The first evidence of the virus was in Wuhan  
The lab was known for sloppy safety protocols  
Genetic analysis of the virus shows that it emerged in October at the earliest  
We have yet to find the animal reservoir that had Covid-19.

These are facts.

Dr Fauci said ""However, the alternative explanation which most public health individuals go by, is that this virus was actually circulating in China, likely in Wuhan, for a month or more before they were clinically recognized at the end of December of 2019,""

Yes - the virus was circulating in Wuhan before the CCP admitted that it had a problem. That doesn't imply there is no evidence of a lab accident.

I agree right now there is no evidence right now to support the theory that the virus was engineered and didn't evolve.

I \*disagree\* that there is no evidence that the virus could have escaped from the BSL-4 lab \*that just happens to be in Wuhan\*. That does not mean it's a slam dunk fact that it happened. It just means there is much more evidence to support the idea than there is evidence to disprove it.

Show us exactly what animal reservoir it came from. Show us exactly how it jumped to humans. Let us get into the Wuhan lab, no hiding, no tricking, let us have the raw data and let us come to our own conclusions. CCP has made sure that can never happen. It made Chernobyl look like a paper cut.

Then Dr Andersen and Dr Lipkin make fools of themselves by pivoting away from the question ""Did this virus emerge from the Wuhan Institute of Virology"" to non-sensical issues where they have no special expertise.

Andersen actually goes full ad hominen on Redfield with this little screed :

'""It is clear that not only was he the most disastrous CDC director in U.S. history where he utterly failed in his sworn mission to keep the country safe, but via his comments, he also shows a complete lack of basic evolutionary virology,"" Andersen said.'

Dr Andersen you have lost credibility with me with this stupid statement. Stick to the issue at hand, don't pivot, don't distract. 

Then we have this little piece of scholarly inquiry:

""Lipkin called Redfield's comments ""counterproductive,"" especially given the rise in [discrimination and violence](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anti-asian-american-hate-incidents-up-racism/) [against Asian Americans](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/asian-american-hate-crimes-incidents-3800-last-year/) during the pandemic. ""We should be moving away from finger-pointing,"" he said""

Dr Lipkin, that's just what the CCP wants. It wants people like you and Dr Andersen to preemptively discredit the idea that \*it\* screwed up and \*accidentally\* released a \*naturally evolved pathogen\* from its lab into the whole world.

This has \*nothing\* to do with Asians or non-Asians. It has everything to do with the CCP's desire to not lose face over its massive mistake.

Please keep in mind, everyone, that nobody has suffered more from the CCP than the Chinese people themselves.

Someone should research these two and see if they have any conflict of interest.

Mammalian genomes are also full of junks whereas viral genomes are incredibly compact and the orfs are even overlapping.
