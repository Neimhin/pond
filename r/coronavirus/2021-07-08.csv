The data on mixing and matching doses (first and second doses) out of the UK showed that it made sense for those who got the AZ vaccine to get Pfizer as their second dose. For those who got Pfizer as their first shot, the data showed that the immunity (as measured by titers) was similar when getting a second dose of either AZ or Pfizer . . . BUT the T-cell response seemed to be better for those who got AZ as their second dose. 

Adenovirus vector vaccines - such as AZ and J&amp;J - are thought to have an advantage in stimulating T-cells, which are the long-term protection component of immunity, so the data makes sense. A third dose of an adenovirus vector vaccine (J&amp;J in the US) would probably be more effective than a third dose of Pfizer - again this is a LOT of spectulation because we don't even know if the FDA will authorize a booster shot. 

I got two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. If I had my choice of a third dose, I would select J&amp;J, due to the data on mix/match vaccines I cited above. My second choice would be Moderna because it makes sense to get something a little different. My third (and final choice because I'm in the US) would be a third dose of Pfizer.

They‚Äôre literally saying comply or die. 

I just want people to be nice to each other.  Treat people like people and not like nameless faceless disease vectors.

I also caught covid last November and recovered easily.  And then I took my two shots of moderna in a January probably before most people here were eligible.  I haven‚Äôt been a transmission risk for quite awhile now, and even took a vaccine I probably didn‚Äôt need for the comfort of others that left me far more ill than covid did.  Yet I was forced to endure endless mask theater for 6 more months as if I was a constant infectious disease vector for six months straight, masking for 10 or 12 hours straight every single day for work.  My goodness.  I‚Äôm willing to entertain the notion of masking while I‚Äôm actually sick so I don‚Äôt infect others.  But if this pandemic never happened, I would only have to endure a mask for a week or so at most until I‚Äôve recovered.  But in covid pandemic world, I had to wear a mask for 1.5 years straight, 6 months of that when I posed zero transmission threat to anyone.  I‚Äôve endured enough senseless security theater and I won‚Äôt do it anymore, no matter how ‚Äúselfish‚Äù they‚Äôll think I am now.

Thank you for the video link, it 100 % proves my point. I didn't move to a reservation after college or hung there for a few years. I straight up lived on one until I was in my mid 20's.

""it's been Indian or native"" 

So exactly what I've been saying this entire time? The people I have lived with used the term native and consider Indian offensive, just as the video says. Not everyone, but enough that I don't use the term.

Most vaccinated people don't get sick. When a vaccinated person comes into contact with the virus, replication is just barely happening, there isnt enough time for a mutation to spread if one even iccured at that stage necause it is neutralized by the body and no further replication happens, meaning any mutated virus does not replicate. Once the virus is in the body, the immune system reacts immediately, and in a vaccinated person the virus is neutralized immediately. 

Partially vaccinated people are still much, much less likely to get sick, and less likely to get severely sick if they get sick at all. With less severe illness there is less virus replication and therefore fewer chances for mutation as the body knows how to fight the virus.

If a vaccinated person does get sick it's likely they do not hold onto immunity or only partial immunity from a vaccine (this is not most people), which some people don't and is normal, or they have encountered a different version of the virus which they are still likely to not get as severely sick unless the virus is different enough. 

Mutation happens in every single person who catches the virus by happenstance of imperfect replication similar to the way cancer happens. MOST mutations don't benefit the virus, some do.

I hate the misinformation about UK. For starts vaccines are amazing and no this post isn't supposed to or intended to be fear mongering but people suck with numbers.

I am not claiming you are, but for example you said:

&amp;gt;Cases wise the last time we were in a similar place (case numbers and trajectory) was mid December and we were admitting &amp;gt;2000 people into hospital a day.

That isn't true. The only real data would be if you had a lull or move back to effectively zero spread for a few months, then a new wave begins.

That wasn't December, that was Early September &amp;gt; Late October.

There was a small reduction, then the wave got worse in December. Moreover the more cases and higher positivity, the more cases missed.

Anyway it wasn't until October - end of October when deaths spiked. Nearly 2 months after the beginning of the surge. Before then it was 20-50 people daily, then around October 20th it jumped to 70, then following week hundreds.

Will that happen with this wave in the UK? Well no, like I said it's not meant to be fear mongering. But I keep seeing ""30k cases but only 9 deaths, back in December it was 1700 deaths"" but if you look at the actual data, and compare it to when the last wave actually started... (End of august/beginning of September) it had a lag of roughly 1- 1.5 months before deaths started to skyrocket.(and similar number of cases as well, stop comparing it to December/janurary lol)

Deaths also increase with hospitalization, because hospitalized are overburdened. People who would otherwise live, will die in a crowded hospital. 

The wave in the UK started End of May/Beginning of June.

Like I said this is not meant to be fear mongering, but we are starting to see an uptick in deaths. While the most vulnerable are safer due to vaccines, and we won't see waves of 2k dead daily, it does not mean the upcoming wave is going to be tiny. We haven't even seen the deaths from it yet.

I hope to be wrong, but people pointing at UK right now really have to wait until at least July is over and August is half way through. I would love to be wrong, and like I said it won't be as bad as previously but people forget the more cases the more missed cases(if you get 10k positives, likely 12-15k were actually infected, in the UK if you are getting 70k cases, likely 300k were actually infected, and if COVID death rate is 0.6%... Well 1700 deaths * 166 = 282,000 cases).

Also in October 2020 they were admitting about 300-600 people to the hospital daily. 

Kinda like the 3-4 hundred now!

They knew their local stuff better at the beginning (the only kind of advantage they ever had) - but Europeans had ways to get, record and share this knowledge blazing fast, because they did it for centuries.  
Architecture? Middle Ages cathedrals laugh.

Upon arrival in April, everything was closed except groceries and I had to make an appointment to go to Hema to buy some dishes. I thought this was a bit overkill. However, I didn't have to wear a mask at work (large company, mixed office and shop work) and I was literally the only vaccinated person in the building of 200+ (I'm American and got Moderna in late May). I thought being at work without a mask when I couldn't even go to a store with a mask being allowed was pretty crazy too; half the US office was already vaccinated by that point and we still had a mask requirement to enter the building. 

I couldn't go to Keukenhof and be outside in a garden without getting a negative rapid test, but just a few weeks later, I was at a packed Madurodam without a mask or test or anything. It was a such a rapid change in policy with no real change in vaccination or even really infection rates. The day I left, I could eat inside a sit-down restaurant without a mask while infection rates were going up beyond what they were when I arrived and there was a take-out only situation just two months prior.

It seemed to me that the vaccine situation had basically not changed in the 90 days I was there. The only other vaccinated person at work was a guy that had travelled to the US division and gotten vaccinated there. The vaccine schedule website just said early June for the 40-50 age group and mid-June for the 20-40 age groups without anyone I knew in those age groups having been invited to schedule an appointment even in early July.

1. I said that SARS-CoV-2 was novel. First sentence of my earlier comment.

2. I never said anything about scientists creating a new virus.  I don't want to confuse lab-made with lab-leaked.

3. Everything written below is my original point that we shouldn't dismiss the lab-leak hypothesis.  Lab-leaks/accidents have happened around the world (US, UK, Venezuela, USSR, China, etc.).  It's happened before, and will certainly happen again.  Therefore, we should not dismiss the hypothesis until evidence disproves it.  
Accidents happen, including with strains like SARS-CoV-1.  SARS-CoV-2 exposure events here in the USA have come from lab mixups and spillages.  That happened after the pandemic started, but still, my point is that accidents happen.  
Here's a pandemic triggered by a lab-leak...

The Reemergent 1977 H1N1 Strain and the Gain-of-Function Debate (article from 2015):  
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4542197/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4542197/)

That article talks about gain-of-function research in Russia and how the 1977 H1N1 flu outbreak came from a strain that hadn't been seen for 20+ years.  The 1977 outbreak killed 700,000 people worldwide (mostly age 25 and younger), despite being mostly mild.  And it came from a strain that wasn't seen in the wild since 1957.  The younger ages could indicate older people had previously been exposed and therefore had some immunity.

And here's an article from a non-profit regarding several lab-leaks (some bacterial, most viral): [https://thebulletin.org/2014/03/threatened-pandemics-and-laboratory-escapes-self-fulfilling-prophecies/](https://thebulletin.org/2014/03/threatened-pandemics-and-laboratory-escapes-self-fulfilling-prophecies/)

Again, all I am trying to do is point out that it has happened before, and therefore, is a possibility.

The CDC is currently preparing for booster shots. Point is, anyone who is trying to say covid is over, Forever is flat wrong. We don‚Äôt know enough. 

‚ÄúThe U.S. government is planning for the potential need for Covid-19 vaccine booster shots ""just in case,"" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told the CNBC Healthy Returns Summit on Tuesday.

Drugmakers and some scientists say people will likely need a booster shot of the Covid-19 vaccines and possibly additional shots each year, just like for the seasonal flu.

Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson have said they are developing booster shots or next-generation versions of their vaccines that will bolster protection.‚Äù

""What we're talking about is thinking ahead,"" she said in the interview with CNBC's Meg Tirrell. ""What happens if in a year from now or 18 months from now your immunity wanes? That's really our job is to hope for the best and plan for what might happen if we need further boosters in the future, the way we get flu vaccine boosters every year.""

‚ÄúLast month, the Biden administration's Covid response chief science officer, David Kessler, said Americans should expect to receive booster shots to protect against coronavirus variants. He told U.S. lawmakers that currently authorized vaccines are highly protective but noted new variants could ""challenge"" the effectiveness of the shots.‚Äù

[],,NumeralJoker,,,[],,,,text,t2_o4svm,False,True,[],"Modern media, both social and traditional, is also a far stronger form of propaganda than I think most people realize. Especially news media and anything that presents itself as ""reporting the facts"".

In my experience, people can at least usually distinguish between fiction and reality a bit better because most fiction has a more obvious disconnect, and is presented to them as fiction. This allows for less suspension of disbelief to be used when watching say, a movie or a fictional story. They might still believe something false (like, there is sound in space because we hear it in space movies), but they usually drop that belief pretty when presented with the facts.

But that effect decreses the more the media presents itself as ""real"". People will believe a fictionary story about their home town more than they will believe a sci-fi story. They will believe a documentary more than they will believe a movie about their home town. They will believe their chosen news source more than they will believe the documentary (especially when it conforms to their already existing beliefs and doesn't challenge them). They will believe Trump at a rally more than they will believe any of the above because they can see him. This is despite the fact that ALL of these accounts can be equally fictitious and false. We are trained to respond to media this way.

The only way to actually counter it is to teach people to naturally be skeptical, question everything, and think critically. And then teach them how to discern through false information on TOP of that. To be honest, this isn't easy. It's a skill that develops over time. You have to constantly be on guard and aware of the idea that someone can try to trick you with false information and learn how to fact-check everything. People who spread disinformation also deliberately confuse the facts so it takes more time (and effort) to disprove these claims, and therefor people are less likely to have the time and energy to do it.

All of this is the result of a combination of traditional media propaganda and the smartphone age. We have never dealt with this before in history, so we're only now starting to understand the effects of it. Giving people phones without helping people learn how to use them responsibly may be the thing that destroys us in the end.

A functioning society cannot afford to see its entire health system crumble.  The vaccine is breaking the link between a rise in cases and the inevitable rise in hospitalizations and death that always followed.  This is what the UK is counting on.  They are removing all restrictions and are banking on the vaccine to break the link.  It's risky, but it will be interesting to watch.

In the UK mix / match trial they gave four different combinations: AZ/AZ, Pfizer/Pfizer, AZ/Pfizer, Pfizer/AZ. The results, based on antibody titers and T-cell response, were pretty clear that anyone given a first dose of AZ would be better protected with a second dose of Pfizer - definitely not surprising. 

The data for those who had received a first dose of Pfizer were more interesting. Getting a second dose of Pfizer improved both antibody titers and T-cell response, but getting a second dose of AZ (after a first dose of Pfizer) increased the antibody titers similarly and had a t-cell response that was almost twice as high as those receiving two Pfizer doses. Here's an excerpt from the write-up in Nature ([https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01805-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01805-2)): 

""In the Com-COV study, the highest antibody response was in people receiving the standard two shots of Pfizer‚ÄìBioNTech, but the response was almost as high in the combination of Oxford‚ÄìAstraZeneca followed by Pfizer‚ÄìBioNTech. This combination also had the best T-cell response ‚Äî more than twice as high as that from the two Pfizer‚ÄìBioNTech doses. Mixing an mRNA vaccine and an adenovirus-based one could therefore provide ‚Äúthe best of two worlds‚Äù, &lt;immunologist Leif Erik Sander at Charit√© University Hospital in Berlin&gt; explains.""

Adenovirus vector vaccines such as AZ and J&amp;J are known to provide a strong T-cell response and that's the key to long-term immunity. Using an adenovirus vector vaccine such as J&amp;J makes sense as a ""booster"" of two Pfizer vaccines - certainly more than receiving a third Pfizer dose. 

I'm not saying this is THE answer, but with the data we have right now - and what we know about adenovirus vector vaccines having a strong t-cell response -  that's where I'd put my money right now (with the choices we have in the US).",,,1625812176,{},h4kc14y,False,t3_oggjmc,False,False,t1_h4k7c6g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oggjmc/pfizer_to_ask_fda_to_authorize_booster_dose_of/h4kc14y/,1626008548,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Before Europeans came there were no Indians or Native Americans or whatever... folks were just Cree, Comanche, Cahuilla, Choctaw, Cayuga, and so forth...  ""Native American"" is not an ethnic group, although it was created to have a term along the lines of other hyphenated-American ethnic groups.  We're talking about over 500 different ethnic groups with our own histories, traditions, religions, languages, and so forth.  No two are the same.  My tribe has historically had about as much in common with the Mohawks as it does with the Uzbeks. 

We were lumped together as Indians or Natives or Amerindians, or whatever... in law by US Federal statute and jurisprudence, and in culture by colonialist otherism, named in opposition to the White colonists.  Any term that lumps us together is the same in that respect, nicely intended or not.  But that's how the world is today, and you gotta live in the world you're in.    
   
Even today we identify first with our tribe(s), not as Indians or Natives or whatever term one uses.

I agree though that the CDC and FDA look at things at a high level and I assume based on their analysis there would be a greater impact of getting unvaccinated people to get the initial shot(s) vs. focusing right now on booster shots for those already vaccinated. And they don't want to scare unvaccinated people into thinking vaccines are ineffective or that they may need booster shots.

I'm still unhappy though that the CDC and FDA are not being transparent and honest with the rest of us that are vaccinated. I believe that they are flat out lying; they know we need booster shots (soon).

While the hospitalization risk for someone 50-60 is only 4X that of someone under 30, the death rate is 35X higher. Even spread vaccination strategy would have to reduce cases by 25-30X in order to result in fewer deaths (if that is the objective function we are trying to optimize). It is not very clear that the same number of vaccines spread across a larger pool would be effective in reducing cases by 20X+ times to justify such a policy - especially with Delta which has proven to have thrown traditional herd immunity levels out of the window (50% even vaccination across 18-60 would not stop rapid exponential growth). 

Age and death risk is so strongly correlated that considering community spread reduction is very secondary to making sure the oldest are vaccinated first. Even 35 year olds have 4X the death risk of a 25 year old.

The CDC did us no favors by rolling back their suggestion with masks.  What they can do is get vaccines out for kids under 12!  

Our county here in Texas is only at 33% fully vaccinated, and I rarely see masks in public.  Abbott isn't allowing any county, city, or school to require masks, and though to be honest I think this was okay before with Delta we HAVE to roll this back.  It's the most proactive step until people get vaccinated and until our kids can get the jab.  Until then Delta will burn through the unvaccinated folks like we've never seen.  UK still has many restrictions and their cases have already spiked like 3000% in the last 6 weeks.  And some states like Missouri is already at rates not seen since the last spike.  Vaccinated states where most still wear masks will probably be spared the grunt of this, but many others not so much.  

It was nice while it lasted, but we're slowly leaving the eye of this storm for the next round.  Get the vaccine, wear a mask, and by all means keep your kids safe.

Although the number of cases on Friday was greater than those reported the previous day, the COVID-19 curve continues to flatten in Taiwan, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (Èô≥ÊôÇ‰∏≠), who also heads the CECC, said at a press briefing.

In 14 of the cases the source of infection has been identified, and the remaining cases are still being investigated, Chen said.

All the domestic cases were reported in northern Taiwan, with Taipei recording 19 cases, New Taipei 11 and Taoyuan 2, Chen noted.

The 32 cases involved 17 males and 15 females, aged from under five to over 70, with the onset of symptoms occurring from July 1 to July 8, according to Chen.

The new cases bring the total in the country to 15,185, of which about 13,500 are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 COVID-19 cases in a single day.

As of Friday, 82.8 percent, or 11,536, of the people whose infections were confirmed between May 11 and July 7, had been discharged from hospital after making a full recovery from the disease or being ruled by doctors to be no longer infectious, Chen said.

Meanwhile, the CECC identified two more highly infectious COVID-19 Delta variant cases as part of a cluster infection in Pingtung County, which started with two people whose infection was confirmed on June 30 and July 5.

The number of cases related to the Pingtung cluster infection had increased to 17 as of Friday, according to CECC data.

The Delta variant outbreak started with two imported cases -- a woman and her grandson who returned to Taiwan from Peru on June 6, the CECC said.

In addition, the deaths reported Friday were eight men and four women, aged from their 40s to 80s, who passed away between June 30 and July 8, the CECC said.

To date, 730 people in Taiwan have died of COVID-19, including 718 since May 15.

Travelers are not required to wear a mask in outdoor areas of a conveyance (like on a ferry or the top deck of a bus). CDC recommends that travelers who are not fully vaccinated continue to wear a mask and maintain physical distance when traveling.

&gt; You should still watch out for symptoms of COVID-19, especially if you‚Äôve been around someone who is sick. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should get tested and stay home and away from others.

&gt; People who have a condition or are taking medications that weaken the immune system, should talk to their healthcare provider to discuss their activities. They may need to keep taking all precautions to prevent COVID-19.

The basis to start this is probably going to be an 80%+ initial vaccination of the population.

What additionally might come with this, and I personally hope so, is people taking more responsibility for when they are/feel ill.

I do not know why a booster would put people off. We have yearly vaccinations for flu. A while ago we thought we would get a vaccine in one shot, most of them require two shots. A booster is nothing out of the ordinary.

Also regarding pfizer they do not need cash grabs, they got their orders all lined up for a long while. I wonder if the USA ordering 500 million doses ostensibly to donate if it was not preparing for a booster being required, but I do not know how many ""slots"" or orders the USA has.

I was looking for the table of the IFR per age bracket on the CDC's website but I think they took that down. Instead I guess I'll compare raw numbers. The age bracket I have is for 18-29 year olds. In the US they are 16.4% of the population, and it looks like there have been roughly 3,300 covid deaths in that age group.  There are about 36,000 traffic fatalities each year, so we could guess about 5,900 of those occur in the 18-29 age group. 

Covid has been around longer than a year now, so to be fair you'd have to scale those 3,300 deaths down in order to compare it apples to apples with the 5,900 traffic deaths. By that simple metric, a 25 year old is about two times more likely to die in a car than to die of covid, but then again every 18-29 was in a car in the past year, whereas most didn't catch covid yet, so you could scale those covid numbers back up but it starts to get even foggier exactly how much. 

So the comparison isn't totally unfair, though looking at it strictly through the lens of personal risk ignores that young people vaccinating makes the higher risk population safer.

Your immune system sees the spikes, freaks out, and makes Memory B cells which can make antibodies to the spike.  Then, when you get some of the virus in you, the spikes get covered in antibodies and can't enter cells.

&gt;Delta is [considered roughly 40 to 60% more transmissible than Alpha](https://www.businessinsider.com/original-coronavirus-strain-replaced-by-variants-us-chart-2021-6), the variant first identified in the UK in late 2020. Alpha, in turn, is estimated to be [roughly 50% more spreadable](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7003e2.htm) than the original, wild type virus first identified in Wuhan in 2019. 
       
&gt;""Fortunately, unlike 2020, we actually have a tool that stops the Delta variant in its tracks: It's called vaccine,"" said Slavitt.  
          
&gt;Though recent studies suggest [vaccines are ever so slightly less effective](https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-19-delta-variant-symptoms-headache-runny-nose-sore-throat-2021-6)  at preventing symptomatic Delta infections in vaccinated people, all the authorized shots in the US are still very good at putting a stop to severe cases of COVID-19 and deaths with Delta.  
        
&gt;""Even modest mask use combined with vaccination can really put the brakes on even the Delta variant,"" Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, [recently told Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-expert-vaccinated-people-can-spread-the-delta-variant-2021-7).

Chil¬≠dren are at ex¬≠tremely slim risk of dy¬≠ing from Covid-19, ac¬≠cord¬≠ing to some of the most com¬≠pre¬≠hen¬≠sive stud¬≠ies to date, which in¬≠di¬≠cate the threat might be even lower than pre¬≠vi¬≠ously thought.

Some 99.995% of the 469,982 chil¬≠dren in Eng¬≠land who were in¬≠fected dur¬≠ing the year ex¬≠am¬≠ined by re¬≠searchers sur¬≠vived, one study found.

In fact, there were fewer deaths among chil¬≠dren due to the virus than ini¬≠tially sus¬≠pected. Among the 61 child deaths linked to a pos¬≠i¬≠tive Covid-19 test in Eng¬≠land, 25 were ac¬≠tu¬≠ally caused by the ill¬≠ness, the study found.

The three stud¬≠ies, by re¬≠searchers in the U.K. re¬≠view¬≠ing its na¬≠tional health sys¬≠tem‚Äôs med¬≠ical records or pulling to¬≠gether data from other coun¬≠tries, were pub¬≠lished on pre¬≠print servers Thurs¬≠day. The stud¬≠ies haven‚Äôt yet been re¬≠viewed by in¬≠de¬≠pen¬≠dent ex¬≠perts and are pre¬≠lim¬≠i¬≠nary.

The stud¬≠ies pro¬≠vide some of the most de¬≠tailed analy¬≠sis yet of se¬≠vere ill¬≠ness and death from Covid-19 in chil¬≠dren, a closely watched sub¬≠ject as schools pre¬≠pare for a new aca¬≠d¬≠e¬≠mic year and par¬≠ents weigh whether to have their chil¬≠dren vac¬≠ci¬≠nated if shots are cleared for younger ages. One of the stud¬≠ies fo¬≠cused only on deaths, while the other two ex¬≠am¬≠ined the risks of se¬≠vere ill¬≠ness and death.

Re¬≠searchers had pre¬≠vi¬≠ously found the risk of se¬≠vere ill¬≠ness and death from Covid-19 among chil¬≠dren un¬≠der 18 years was rel¬≠a¬≠tively low. The new stud¬≠ies con¬≠firm the find¬≠ings, adding to the weight of ev¬≠i¬≠dence as pol¬≠icy mak¬≠ers and school of¬≠fi¬≠cials make de¬≠ci¬≠sions about mask-wear¬≠ing and phys¬≠i¬≠cal dis¬≠tanc¬≠ing.

‚ÄúHav¬≠ing a larger and larger data¬≠base‚Ä¶adds a lot to our abil¬≠ity to make im¬≠por¬≠tant de¬≠ci¬≠sions,‚Äù said Dr. Rick Mal¬≠ley, an in¬≠fec¬≠tious-dis¬≠eases spe¬≠cial¬≠ist at Bos¬≠ton Chil¬≠dren‚Äôs Hos¬≠pi¬≠tal and Har¬≠vard Med¬≠ical School, who wasn‚Äôt in¬≠volved in the stud¬≠ies. The study ex¬≠am¬≠in¬≠ing the risk of death is ‚Äúcer¬≠tainly one of the largest stud¬≠ies I‚Äôve seen.‚Äù

Some vac¬≠cines are in late-stage test¬≠ing in younger chil¬≠dren, while in use in ado¬≠les¬≠cents 12 years and older.

One thorny area for pol¬≠icy mak¬≠ers is whether to rec¬≠om¬≠mend the shots if health agen¬≠cies au¬≠tho¬≠rize the vac¬≠cines for chil¬≠dren of younger ages. The de¬≠ci¬≠sion would in¬≠volve bal¬≠anc¬≠ing the risks and ben¬≠e¬≠fits of vac¬≠ci¬≠na¬≠tion with the low risk of se¬≠ri¬≠ous ill¬≠ness and death from Covid-19.

Some par¬≠ents have been con¬≠cerned about giv¬≠ing mes¬≠sen¬≠ger RNA vac¬≠cines from Pfizer or Mod¬≠erna to ado¬≠les¬≠cents be¬≠cause of the risk of a rare in¬≠flam¬≠ma¬≠tory heart con¬≠di¬≠tion. Ad¬≠vis¬≠ers to the U.S. Cen¬≠ters for Dis¬≠ease Con¬≠trol and Pre¬≠ven¬≠tion have urged vac¬≠ci¬≠na¬≠tion, say¬≠ing the ben¬≠e¬≠fits out¬≠weigh the risks.

Sev¬≠eral coun¬≠tries, in¬≠clud¬≠ing the U.S., are of¬≠fer¬≠ing the Pfizer shot to chil¬≠dren 12 years and older. The U.K. has so far held back from of¬≠fer¬≠ing vac¬≠cines to older chil¬≠dren un¬≠der 18, un¬≠less they have cer¬≠tain se¬≠ri¬≠ous ill¬≠nesses.

For the three new stud¬≠ies, re¬≠searchers looked at var¬≠i¬≠ous med¬≠ical and study data for chil¬≠dren of dif¬≠fer¬≠ent ages for pe¬≠ri¬≠ods since the pan¬≠demic started.

Re¬≠searchers con¬≠duct¬≠ing the death study an¬≠a¬≠lyzed sev¬≠eral na¬≠tional data¬≠bases to iden¬≠tify chil¬≠dren un¬≠der 18 across Eng¬≠land who had died from Covid-19 in the first year of the pan¬≠demic, from March 1, 2020, to Feb. 28, 2021.

‚ÄúEng¬≠land is a large enough coun¬≠try and it‚Äôs had enough Covid, sadly, that we have bet¬≠ter data than al¬≠most any¬≠where else in the world on the risks,‚Äù said Rus¬≠sell Viner, a pro¬≠fes¬≠sor of ado¬≠les¬≠cent health at the Uni¬≠ver¬≠sity Col¬≠lege Lon¬≠don Great Or¬≠mond Street In¬≠sti¬≠tute of Child Health, and se¬≠nior au¬≠thor on the death study and an¬≠other look¬≠ing at Eng¬≠lish hos¬≠pi¬≠tal and in¬≠ten¬≠sive-care ad¬≠mis¬≠sions.

Re¬≠searchers from the Uni¬≠ver¬≠sity of Bris¬≠tol, Uni¬≠ver¬≠sity of York and Uni¬≠ver¬≠sity of Liv¬≠er¬≠pool were also key con¬≠trib¬≠u¬≠tors to the three pa¬≠pers. Two of the stud¬≠ies were pub¬≠lished on the med¬≠Rxiv pre¬≠print server and one on the Re¬≠search Square pre¬≠print server.

Un¬≠der¬≠ly¬≠ing health con¬≠di¬≠tions, es¬≠pe¬≠cially se¬≠ri¬≠ous brain or nerve-re¬≠lated dis¬≠abil¬≠i¬≠ties, in¬≠creased the risk of dy¬≠ing of Covid-19, ac¬≠cord¬≠ing to the study look¬≠ing at child deaths.

Fif¬≠teen of the 25 chil¬≠dren in Eng¬≠land who died be¬≠cause of Covid-19 dur¬≠ing the pe¬≠riod ex¬≠am¬≠ined had un¬≠der¬≠ly¬≠ing se¬≠ri¬≠ous ill¬≠nesses, the re¬≠searchers said, while four had chronic un¬≠der¬≠ly¬≠ing con¬≠di¬≠tions. The re¬≠searchers didn‚Äôt spec¬≠ify the se¬≠ri¬≠ous ill¬≠nesses or chronic con¬≠di¬≠tions, but said that chil¬≠dren with a com¬≠bi¬≠na¬≠tion of neu¬≠ro¬≠log¬≠i¬≠cal and res¬≠pi¬≠ra¬≠tory-linked con¬≠di¬≠tions were at the great¬≠est risk of death.

Three of the deaths were due to mul¬≠ti¬≠sys-tem in¬≠flam¬≠ma¬≠tory syn¬≠drome, a se¬≠ri¬≠ous com¬≠pli¬≠ca¬≠tion of in¬≠fec¬≠tion where dif¬≠fer¬≠ent body parts can be¬≠come in¬≠flamed. Six of the chil¬≠dren who died due to Covid-19 didn‚Äôt ap¬≠pear to have an un¬≠der¬≠ly¬≠ing health con¬≠di¬≠tion, re¬≠searchers said.

No child with a stand-alone di¬≠ag¬≠no¬≠sis of asthma, di¬≠a¬≠betes, epilepsy or Down‚Äôs Syn¬≠drome died from Covid-19, the re¬≠searchers said.

The risk of death was higher among chil¬≠dren from Black and Asian back¬≠grounds and in older chil¬≠dren above 10 years, the re¬≠searchers said.¬†Even among these higher-risk groups, how¬≠ever, chil¬≠dren‚Äôs ab¬≠so¬≠lute risk of dy¬≠ing from Covid-19 is very small.

‚ÄúTwice a tiny risk is still a very, very tiny risk,‚Äù said Pro¬≠fes¬≠sor Viner. ‚ÄúEven 10 times a very, very tiny risk is still a very, very tiny risk.‚Äù

Un¬≠der¬≠ly¬≠ing health con¬≠di¬≠tions also raised the risk of se¬≠vere ill¬≠ness, the two other pa¬≠pers said.

‚ÄúFac¬≠tors linked to a higher risk of se¬≠vere Covid-19 ap¬≠pear to be broadly con¬≠sis¬≠tent for both chil¬≠dren and adults,‚Äù said Joseph Ward, of UCL Great Or¬≠mond Street In¬≠sti¬≠tute of Child Health, who led one of the stud¬≠ies.

That study found a higher risk of ad¬≠mis¬≠sion to in¬≠ten¬≠sive care among chil¬≠dren with health con¬≠di¬≠tions such as di¬≠a¬≠betes, asthma and car¬≠dio¬≠vas¬≠cu¬≠lar dis¬≠ease. Those with mul¬≠ti¬≠ple con¬≠di¬≠tions had the high¬≠est risk. Even so, the ab¬≠so¬≠lute risk was very small, the re¬≠searchers said.

The stud¬≠ies all re¬≠lated to time pe¬≠ri¬≠ods that pre¬≠dated the emer¬≠gence of the Delta vari¬≠ant that is now dom¬≠i¬≠nant in both the U.K. and the U.S., but the au¬≠thors said there was as yet no ev¬≠i¬≠dence that the vari¬≠ant causes more se¬≠vere ill¬≠ness or death among chil¬≠dren.",,,1625786646,{},h4j4zlp,True,t3_ogizh1,False,False,t3_ogizh1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ogizh1/in_children_risk_of_covid19_death_or_serious/h4j4zlp/,1625986106,38,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Variants emerge more the more the virus has the opportunity to replicate. Every time it replicates there is a chance of a mutation. Hence, the more opportunities it has to replicate, the higher the incidence of mutation will be.   


Now, is it more likely that a vaccine-resistant variant would become a more dominant strain if there are 50% of people vaccinated *but* the presence of the vaccines alone doesn't increase the odds of mutation.

1) Even Pfizer is quoted in the news article as saying the vaccine continues to be 95%+ effective against severe disease when antibody levels drop. This would suggest there is significant long-lasting protection from the vaccine that is presumably coming from memory cells.

2) Reports from the booster trials seem to suggest a much higher level of minor side effects such as fever after a third dose, compared to second. This is consistent with your body recognising the covid spike protein (presumably because of memory cells) and rapidly launching a stronger immune defense to it.

To my understanding, memory cell action is a bit delayed compared to the action of circulating antibodies. This means that complete protection against any infection is less likely from this sort of long term immunity. However, it can still ramp up antibody production in time to prevent large viral concentrations in your body that lead to both high infectiousness and severe illness.

Additionally, sC5b9 levels were elevated both in patients who did and did not meet criteria for TMA.

Children:

‚ÄúThe researchers found elevations of C5b9 in pediatric  patients with severe COVID-19 and MIS-C, but to their surprise, they also found that C5b9 was elevated in patients with minimal or asymptomatic disease. Of the 22 patients for whom complete data were available, 19 (86%) met the criteria for TMA [thrombotic microangiopathy]. Additionally, sC5b9 levels were elevated both in patients who did and did not meet criteria for TMA. Although most children with COVID-19 do not have severe disease, our study shows that there may be other effects of SARS-CoV-2 that are worthy of investigation.‚Äù

Adults:

‚ÄúMethods: We retrospectively investigated patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 but who did not show any symptoms. Among the 139 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Yeungnam University Hopistal in Daegu, South Korea, 10 (7.2%) were asymptomatic. Their chest CT and radiographic findings were analyzed. Results: In the results, all patients (100%) had ground-glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT. Further, the GGO lesions were predominantly distributed peripherally and posteriorly in all patients. In 9 (90%) patients, the GGO lesions were combined with reticular opacity.‚Äù

This study (including a control group with n~5000) may be an interesting read. Mild-moderate acute stage. 15% reported moderate to severe symptoms &gt;8 months post infection.

Comparing seropositive vs seronegative participants, 26% vs 9% reported at least 1 moderate to severe symptom lasting for at least 2 months (RR, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.2-3.8]) and 15% vs 3% reported at least 1 moderate to severe symptom lasting for at least 8 months (RR, 4.4 [95% CI, 2.9-6.7]) (Table). The most common moderate to severe symptoms lasting for at least 2 months in the seropositive group were anosmia, fatigue, ageusia, and dyspnea.

Yes, 64 or 69 or 79% is lower than the rate the cdc found the vaccines prevented actual infection at, but as you said, all of these studies (other than the israel one which is still missing a lot of info) still find, as you pointed out, that symptoms are prevented with delta with 80-90% efficacy, and 93%+ efficacy against severe disease. That‚Äôs not far off from what we considered miracle numbers 6 months ago.

The potential lower efficacy against any infection with delta is likely a function of waning antibodies (as Pfizer alluded to) and delta being more transmissible and thus more prevalent overall. Some of it could even be just viral material being present at the time a test is administered but a true infection not taking place. Tough to know. There is SOME degree of immune escape with delta, but it‚Äôs just not any higher than numerous other variants based on numerous neutralizing antibody studies, so I think it‚Äôs a factor but much less of a factor than the others that I mentioned.

The long and short of it is that vaccinated people remain well protected from delta and all other known variants. Can you catch it? Sure. But if you do, you probably won‚Äôt know it.

We catered daily to two of the biggest tech companies in my city and when those two companies announced they had workers test positive and everyone was sent to work from home, my city shut down.

I had never been sick like this before. One night I knew either I slept sitting up or go to urgent care or I wouldn't wake up. I slept sitting up. I missed 19 days of work.

A year later, I was still struggling to perform at levels I did prior to being sick, but my illness did not fit the timeline.

Spoke to my old supervisor a few weeks ago, and he laughed and asked me if I remember how back in early February I was making a stink about instituting some Covid precautions like masks, hand sanitizers and not letting people come to work sick? I was laughed at and looked at as the girl who cried wolf.

From what I have read, and yeah there's a lot of conflicting studies, antibody counts may wane as expected after 6 months but there's no conclusive case if it's a mild drop, severe drop (no numbers have been released as I know), and what antibody level is even required to prevent infection because it's kinda hard to study as we can't ethically infect people for science. Antibodies are only part of the immune response and the other pieces such as memory T cells appear to still be holding well. 

I guess it comes down to what is the purpose of a vaccine -- prevent most/all infections by keeping antibody counts high which means frequent boosters or prevents most/all hospitalizations and deaths with none to mild symptoms which already works after 2 doses. That's not my expertise to say, I'm just an engineer. The CDC has said yesterday that at this time a booster isn't recommended. 

There is anecdotal evidence each time you receive another mrna booster that the side effects get worse and worse because you are stimulating the immune system again and again.

2. Staffing. Most hospitals are wildly understaffed right now (our hospital has ~100 open RN positions right now).

 &gt;Antigenic escape (alternatively called immune escape, immune evasion or escape mutation) occurs when the immune system of a host, especially of a human being, is unable to respond to an infectious agent, or, in other words, the host's immune system is no longer able to recognize and eliminate a pathogen such as a virus. This process can occur in a number of different ways of both a genetic and an environmental nature. Such mechanisms include homologous recombination, and manipulation and resistance of the host's immune responses. Different antigens are able to escape through a variety of mechanisms.

Here's the specific bit about the modeling:

&gt; **Background on PCCI‚Äôs herd immunity measurements**

&gt; PCCI‚Äôs forecast for herd immunity is based on an innovative yet vetted statistical and immunological model and analysis of spread and management of diseases within communities. Further, PCCI‚Äôs 80 percent range for reaching herd immunity is in line with national estimates, such as that of Anthony S. Fauci, MD, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who recently gave a range of 70 to 90 percent and the World Health Organization which gave a 60 to 70 percent range of infections and vaccines to reach herd immunity*.

&gt; PCCI‚Äôs forecast and estimates have been developed in coordination with community health leaders in Dallas County, including the DCHHS and Parkland Health &amp; Hospital System.  Recently, PCCI has been collaborating with the leadership and expert teams at the Institute for Health Improvement on modeling.

""Innovative yet vetted.""  üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ

Also:

&gt; As a county, we‚Äôre still behind on vaccinations: Only 38 percent of the total population with completed vaccination series and 47 percent of the total population with at least one dose (61 percent of adults and 80 percent of those over the age of 65 years).  While previous infections and partial vaccinations do provide a level of protection, all evidence suggests that full vaccinations are the most effective way to stay safe against the delta variant.

So the 46.6 vaccinated number is a lie - that's *single dose* for the county.  38% of the total population is fully vaccinated.

And lastly, and here's the kicker:

&gt; **How we got here** *(italics mine)*

&gt; The calculations used to measure heard immunity track (*yes this fucking moron did write ""heard"")* individual level data for both vaccinations administered and COVID test results since the beginning of the pandemic.  For those infected, yet not tested there are a 4x Adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio [AIRR] for the adult population and 5x for the pediatric group based on national and local seroprevalence data. The model also calculates an overlap 28 percent of vaccinated population of Dallas estimated to have had prior COVID-19 infection and recovered.

Sounds like to me they're taking the positive tests for the local population and multiplying that x4, or x5 for kids, and ""estimating them to have had COVID-19 and recovered.""

So there's conflicting recommendations and I don't know what trumps what. Obviously I was home with my wife, so the [caring for someone at home](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/care-for-someone.html) section says to isolate for 14 days after her quarantine ends since I tested negative, rather than going from the start of my symptoms. But the [fully vaccinated recommendation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html) says I don't have to isolate if I've come into contact with someone with COVID. Obviously I'll at least isolate until I don't have symptoms, but other than that I'm not sure what to do.

Six months after their initial diagnosis, 61 percent of the group had persistent symptoms. The most common problem was fatigue, followed by difficulty concentrating, disturbed smell or taste, memory trouble and difficulty breathing.

And she has accumulated a shelf filled with prescription medicines. About two months post-diagnosis, Flynn‚Äôs primary care physician referred her to a recently opened facility: the COVID Recovery Clinic at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) School of Medicine. ‚ÄúShe said, ‚ÄòI can treat you for all your symptoms, but I believe they could maybe find other ways to help you to rehabilitate yourself instead of just putting you on all these medications,‚Äô‚Äù Flynn says.

&gt;Since the start of the pandemic, the figure that many epidemiologists have offered has been 60 to 70 percent. That range is still cited by the World Health Organization and is often repeated during discussions of the future course of the disease.

&gt;Recently, a figure to whom millions of Americans look for guidance ‚Äî Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, an adviser to both the Trump administration and the incoming Biden administration ‚Äî has begun incrementally raising his herd-immunity estimate.

&gt;In the pandemic‚Äôs early days, Dr. Fauci tended to cite the same 60 to 70 percent estimate that most experts did.

\^ ‚ÄúExperts say reports from Israel about a drop in vaccine effectiveness against the delta variant are intriguing because the country vaccinated a majority of its population before the U.S. did, and it now faces a surge in variant-related cases. A recent study from Israel found that the Pfizer vaccine was just 64 percent effective in preventing symptomatic illness in fully vaccinated people.‚Äù

In case you don‚Äôt want to make it to the bottom of a third article, note that they admit the CDC will not reissue a mask advisory, but those same people? Still wearing masks.

‚ÄúIt's unlikely that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will reinstate recommendations to wear masks. But because of the unknown level of transmissibility of delta among fully vaccinated people, experts said in interviews that they continue to wear masks indoors when they are around people they don't know, such as in grocery stores or movie theaters or on public transportation.‚Äù

As it stands, you would have to get a pre-departure test in the 3 days before your flight, a test on day 2 and a test on day 8 of your stay in the uk, as well as quarantine for 10 full days after arrival. You have the option of taking a 'test to release' on day 5 of the quarantine, and if that comes back negative you would be able to stop your quarantine, though you still have to take the day 8 test. 

It's so frustrating that for people like you who are just wanting to come home, you have to go through all that.

Yes, I get that they technically said only vaccinated people can take their masks off. And yes, I understand their well-intentioned rationale was to provide an added incentive for people to get vaccinated.

But they should have foreseen the patently obvious fact that the mask issue is so inextricably linked to America's political culture that the second they said ""vaccinated people can take off their masks"", the message that everyone would hear was ""masks are done forever, full-stop"".

The fact they said that while the pandemic was still raging across the world has given them almost no room to maneuver when facts on the ground (like the delta variant) change. They let the ""masks are OVER!"" genie out of the bottle, and now it's going to be incredible challenging to put him back in.

Linear growth in this case would mean an R of 1. That would mean that new cases every day would be stable (300 new cases every day). Note that there are still new cases every day here, so total cases in your country are still growing, they are just growing in a linear fashion.

Anything above 1 is exponential growth, because the rate of growth of your countries cases is increasing day over day. So if you had 250 one day, and 300 the next, etc, you would be in exponential growth.

I wasn't talking about the IFR. I don't think we have sufficient data on the pediatric IFR with regards to the delta variant. I was referring to the popular pediatric death metric of the number of annual pediatric flu deaths before the pandemic vs the number of annual pediatric covid deaths during the pandemic. Again, we need a different approach against covid, because of its high transmission rate. 

Data from places like Florida, Texas, and other Southern States sound interesting. It will be very important to analyze the data and better understand the effects of covid on young children. But I don't have the data on children that are based on different regions of the country. So I cannot comment on that.

I do agree that in the beginning of the pandemic (2020 Spring) the effects of the covid on children was very mild and nearly non-existent.

&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data released late Tuesday shows the Delta strain accounted for more than 51 percent of new Covid-19 cases from June 20 to July 3. But the reality on the ground is likely much higher because states and private labs are taking weeks to report testing results to the CDC, the officials said.

&gt;‚ÄùIt is everywhere now,‚Äù one of the officials said, adding that recent data shows the Pfizer Covid vaccine works well against the Delta variant. ‚ÄúThe risk really is in the unvaccinated community. We‚Äôre starting to see more and more people get sick and need medical attention.‚Äù

&gt;Covid-19 hospitalizations are up more than 40 percent over the last two weeks in Arkansas, Iowa and Nevada. And emerging evidence from a repository of genetic sequences compiled by Scripps Research's Outbreak.info suggests that the Delta strain accounted for as much as two-thirds of new Covid cases nationwide over the past two weeks. The site notes the data ""may not represent the true prevalence of the mutations in the population.""

Which i personally know was possible in NL as i was there the wknd they opened. Next in Switzerland unvaccinated people still were still required to get a proper PCR test and not some quick tests which NL had and are just more prone to false negatives. And another big point is the uneven vaccination spread in Switzerland. 20yo could get vaccinated at the same time as 50 yo which means alot are fully vaccinated here compared to NL where the under 30yo only just started being eligible about 2 weeks ago.

 &gt;Antigenic escape (alternatively called immune escape, immune evasion or escape mutation) occurs when the immune system of a host, especially of a human being, is unable to respond to an infectious agent, or, in other words, the host's immune system is no longer able to recognize and eliminate a pathogen such as a virus. This process can occur in a number of different ways of both a genetic and an environmental nature. Such mechanisms include homologous recombination, and manipulation and resistance of the host's immune responses. Different antigens are able to escape through a variety of mechanisms.

[],,Dunyazad,,,[],,,,text,t2_rdyp3,False,False,[],"An unusually public spat has broken out between the makers of one of the coronavirus vaccines and federal health officials over whether booster shots will soon be needed.

Pfizer and the German firm BioNTech announced Thursday they plan to seek approval for a booster shot within weeks, predicting that people would require a vaccine boost six to 12 months after being fully immunized. Hours later, the Department of Health and Human Services issued an emphatic rebuke, saying ‚ÄúAmericans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time.‚Äù

The statement did not mention Pfizer by name, but said ‚Äúa science-based, rigorous process‚Äù headed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health would determine when or whether boosters were necessary. The decision, the statement said, will be only partly informed by data from drug companies.

Pfizer‚Äôs chief executive has for months predicted that boosters could be likely within six to 12 months, seeming to offer certainty on a question that has captured public interest even as public health officials and academic scientists said it wasn‚Äôt clear yet when a booster would be needed. All the pharmaceutical companies involved in making coronavirus vaccines are working on formulating and testing booster shots to prepare for the possibility.

But on Thursday, Pfizer released a statement indicating the time was near. Pfizer said its vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness had eroded, citing two lines of evidence that outside scientists have yet to see in detail. That includes an Israeli government analysis showing that as the delta variant of the virus became dominant, vaccine efficacy dropped. The study has not yet been published and its conclusions have been questioned by some outside scientists. Pfizer also cited its continuing follow-up of people who were vaccinated last summer.

‚ÄúWhile protection against severe disease remained high across the full 6 months, the observed decline in efficacy against symptomatic disease over time and the continued emergence of variants are key factors driving our belief that a booster dose will likely be necessary to maintain highest levels of protection,‚Äù Pfizer said in a statement.

Pfizer said it would submit data to regulators within weeks showing that a booster at six months ‚Äî a third shot of its original vaccine ‚Äî caused antibody levels to shoot up five to 10 times higher than the original two-dose regimen. Moderna announced similar data in May.Pfizer also announced it would begin testing a booster shot specifically programmed to combat the delta variant in August.

Scientists applauded the statement from HHS saying boosters were not imminent. While many researchers anticipate a booster may be needed and say it is essential to prepare the shots to be ready to be deployed, it is far from clear when they will be needed.‚ÄúMy opinion right now, however, is that current vaccination seems to be largely ‚Äòholding,‚Äô‚Äù said E. John Wherry, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Perelman School of Medicine. ‚ÄúBut the companies seem to suggest that their continued follow up of their trial patients shows concerning levels of waning of immunity. Not much of these data from the companies are publicly available yet. I agree that we need as much independent data and assessment as possible on this topic.‚Äù

Some experts think boosters could be needed as soon as this fall, but others think it could be years. Many predict that people will continue to be protected against serious cases of illness, even as immunity wanes. Some foresee scenarios in which people in particular high-risk groups may need to be boosted sooner.

‚ÄúNo one is saying we‚Äôll never need a booster, but to say we need it now and give the public the impression the vaccines are failing and something needs to be done as a matter of urgency. ‚Ä¶ The time isn‚Äôt now,‚Äù said John P. Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medicine. ‚ÄúThe decisions that are going to be made will be made by federal agencies.‚Äù

Pfizer announced in May that it projected global sales of its coronavirus vaccine to reach $26 billion in 2021. The company has also been frank that its current pricing ‚Äî in the United States, $19.50 a shot ‚Äî is temporary. On an earnings call in February, Frank A. D‚ÄôAmelio, Pfizer‚Äôs executive vice president of global supply, noted that a more typical price for a vaccination was $150 or $175 per dose.

‚ÄúNow, let‚Äôs go beyond a pandemic-pricing environment, the environment we‚Äôre currently in. Obviously, we‚Äôre going to get more on price,‚Äù D‚ÄôAmelio said. ‚ÄúSo clearly, there‚Äôs a significant opportunity for those margins to improve once we get beyond the pandemic environment that we‚Äôre in.‚Äù",,,1625841216,{},h4lfgir,True,t3_ogwsyh,False,True,t3_ogwsyh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ogwsyh/pfizer_suggests_booster_shots_will_be_needed_this/h4lfgir/,1626030808,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It is just somebody speculating.  He doesn't actually point to any place where there is evidence that variants are arising due to mid-level vaccination rates. He's speculating that new variants might have an advantage in places that got hit hard early. That's very different from the idea that the risk of mutations is higher in a place with 50% vaccination rate.   


If you're into stuff like that you may also be interested in this. To be fair, it is also just speculation but with more references. They do a good job presenting both sides of the argument. I happen to agree with the authors but of course it's up for debate.

It's a very common sentiment here that the only thing that matters is hospitalizations and deaths, but that's not true. The more people who get sick, the more chance of a variant developing that becomes a serious problem.

But you may have heard that the vaccines work on the variants? That's true, but it's scientifically provable that the vaccines have all lost efficacy against Delta. It is not out of the realm of possibility that there could be one eventually even worse than Delta.

Also, if we let the background infections run rampant, whenever it comes time for boosters as protection wanes (see Pfizer's announcement today), the vaccinated will be at greater danger of infection, and while they still will be protected against the most severe illness, that still opens up doors for more mutations, and puts selective pressure on immune escape mutations.",,,1625794597,{},h4jjvea,False,t3_ogiwxj,False,True,t1_h4j4v7o,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ogiwxj/delta_variant_is_covid19_on_steroids_expert_says/h4jjvea/,1625993623,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It's a sad reality and a reflection of our history, but I'd be more skeptical of a vaccine that they made it *easy* for us to get, at least initially lol.

&gt;The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 lineage was identified in October 2020 in India1‚Äì5. It has since then become dominant in some indian regions and UK and further spread to many countries6. The lineage includes three main subtypes (B1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3), harbouring diverse Spike mutations in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) which may increase their immune evasion potential. B.1.617.2, also termed variant Delta, is believed to spread faster than other variants. Here, we isolated an infectious Delta strain from a traveller returning from India. We examined its sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and to antibodies present in sera from COVID-19 convalescent individuals or vaccine recipients, in comparison to other viral strains. Variant Delta was resistant to neutralization by some anti-NTD and anti-RBD mAbs including Bamlanivimab, which were impaired in binding to the Spike. Sera from convalescent patients collected up to 12 months post symptoms were 4 fold less potent against variant Delta, relative to variant Alpha (B.1.1.7). Sera from individuals having received one dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines barely inhibited variant Delta. Administration of two doses generated a neutralizing response in 95% of individuals, with titers 3 to 5 fold lower against Delta than Alpha. Thus, variant Delta spread is associated with an escape to antibodies targeting non-RBD and RBD Spike epitopes.

Untrue. Educational policy is a mixture of state, local, and federal policy. There are plenty of federal educational mandates. It's even more federally weighted when it comes to healthy policy. Almost everything in health is federally regulated and funded. 

&gt;Whatever the case, there's a very wide range of opinion and policy across the country, and the whole issue has become so politicized that any statement that pushes for more preventative measures will be condemned as overreach.

I agree. However, the question then becomes whether the Biden administration is going to display leadership or whether it is going to play politics.

While behavioral differences are a confounding variable, the hypothesis that population density impacts COVID spread is not really supported.

At least within the US, the opposite is true: low density rural regions have the highest infection and death rates. 

Weather likely *does* play a role, but what may be the biggest driver of accelerated transmission (humidity) doesn't support most of California. Southern California has notoriously dry air, and it is worsened indoors by the need for air conditioning given the warmer client. The UK has greater humidity on average, and less air conditioning (which dries out air) is needed. That said, the connection between humidity, temperature, and COVID spread is tenuous at best - but humidity does seem to be one of the better predictors.

Also of note is that Singapore had fully vaccinated 33\~35% of its population at the time of the Bukit Merah Market outbreak and 36% of the cases in the Bukit Merah Market outbreak were fully vaccinated.  So if the population exposed by the Bukit Merah Market cluster has similar vaccination rates as Singapore overall, then efficacy of mRNA vaccines against all infections (including asymptomatic ones) by the delta variant is quite low, maybe even close to zero.

Note that Singapore is one of the few countries using mRNA vaccines that has a vigorous and exhaustive contact tracing and testing program capable of finding most infections, including asymptotic ones.

It's not supposed to make you ""feel"" anything. It's to show you that this is not a new medical technology, which is part of the misinformation out there.

The risk of *death* from covid is quite low, however the long term effects, which you seem so concerned about when it comes to the vaccines, are unknown. Long covid is no joke and who knows how long the damage lasts. Logically, it makes no sense to risk that when there's no need. You might be fine, you might have to deal with a permenetly lowered lung capacity, a loss of 2 of your senses and who knows what else. How confident are you that you'll be fine? You can say Im fear-mongering but anecdotally, I know of a few cases, also anecdotally, the 2 people I know to have died from the virus were ostensibly healthy men in their 30s. Again, how confident are you?

The main side effect of the vaccines seem to be blood clots, except the contraceptive pill can also cause clots and at a much higher rate than currently reported from the vaccines. Yet, we still use them. Why?

Your point about the cohort of people at risk doesnt detract from the fact that this virus has already changed to become more infectious. As I've said, and you've not bothered to reply to, people like you give the virus more chances to replicate and mutate. That's why people are unwilling to accept your BS excuses. Can you say for certain that the next mutation wont be yet more contagious and potentially even more deadly? What then?
