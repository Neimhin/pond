When those areas don't see an appreciable uptick, more will follow. But that hasn't happened yet, we're seeing an uptick in cases right now - people are jumping the gun a little.

What needs to be communicated is a set benchmark for when demasking is acceptable, and I can suggest one: When cases of Covid are on par with an average year of influenza.

Here's what he said about masking after vaccination:

&gt;It is likely that if you are vaccinated, that you are not going to spread infection, if you get infected without any symptoms.

#

&gt;“There are studies that are coming online now, that are going to definitively prove that.” 

# 

&gt; “That's the reason why we say when that happens, we'll pull back on the recommendation of saying people who are vaccinated should continue to wear masks,”

And about the timeline we're looking at:

&gt;“If we get a major surge and we have a continuation of an increase in cases, it is conceivable that we may be having to wear masks in 2022,” he noted. “But if we continue to get people vaccinated, and we get the overwhelming majority of people together with those that have been infected and the level of infection goes way down, we very likely will not have to.” 

As usual, everything he's said here is accurate.  TECHNICALLY speaking, we should wait until the science has completely settled the science on vaccinated transmission, and we should have ongoing covid restrictions if another big surge happens in the coming months.  But it's just... tone-deaf.  None of that is going to happen.  The science on vaccinated transmission is ""good enough"" already, or at least most people consider it to be.  And damn near nobody has any intention of wearing a mask through 2022.

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

Living aside the credibilty of the author, let's see what the sources quoted by him says:

""During this time, VAERS received 2,509 reports of death (0.0017%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC and FDA physicians review each case report of death as soon as notified and CDC requests medical records to further assess reports. A review of available clinical information including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records revealed no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths.""

So, we are talking about 2509 people dead after receiving the vaccine, but not BECAUSE they have received the vaccine. Quite the opposite, there is no link established between the vaccine and the cause of death.

Hint: allways read the primary sources, if possible, when such statements are made. Even the author doesn say ""people died because of vaccines"" (I guess he doesn't feel like going to court), he says ""died after receiving the vaccine"".

[],,TheBigBoner,,,[],,,,text,t2_5bi56,False,False,[],"My original point about people feeling uncomfortable was intended to appeal to a sense of empathy and highlight that wearing a mask is a matter of simple courtesy and respect that requires very little sacrifice on the part of the mask-wearer. It's disappointing that the argument has devolved into a facts vs feelings thing, but that isn't the reason why masks are still being encouraged by health experts. I realize now it was a poor line of argument, so I'm happy to just drop it.

The broader reasoning here is that health experts have much more to consider than simply whether or not vaccinated people can transmit the disease. They have to manage an entire society, and doing so requires keeping many things in balance at once. 

1) they should not make *any* recommendations that are not rooted in very strong scientific evidence, hence why they've waited until now to say vaccinated people can travel, the WHO took a long time to confirm asymptomatic spread etc.

2) they should keep in mind how difficult it is to enforce voluntary compliance across an entire country of hundreds of millions of people. That means not just assuming that *only* vaccinated people will lose the masks. They have to assume if they remove mask *mandates*, unvaccinated people will also stop wearing masks. This sub seems to think we should be fine letting people opt in to mask usage as necessary, when the obvious fact is this pandemic has proven people refuse to do even the bare minimum.

3) you are right that people aren't going to put up with this for much longer, but if CDC is telling vaccinated people to go ahead and gather together, travel, see family, etc, then what does it matter if you still wear a mask in the grocery store or on the plane? This seems like they're throwing a huge bone to the people who are sick of their lives being on hold, and I don't really understand what people are complaining about. 

We'll drop the mask mandate when enough people are vaccinated, but the minor annoyance of a mask (seriously, is anyone really not used to it by now?) seems worth it for now since we have an entire society to try and manage here.",,,1617555190,{},gtd28ur,False,t3_mjdefd,False,True,t1_gtcuips,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mjdefd/everyone_needs_to_continue_wearing_masks_until/gtd28ur/,1617555201,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Using the National Guard and military to help out. Then last using pharmacies which people really like to administer the vaccine.  The Biden administration is really pushing these pharmacies like CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, and other grocery chains.  Biden set a goal to within 3 weeks to have from 17,000 to 40,000 pharmacies administer the vaccine by April 19th.  It's like the saying goes under promise and over deliver.  We'll see if they are able to get that done.  I mean Biden set a goal of 100 million shots administered by his 100 days in office and that was done in 58 days.  Now he's wanting another goal of another 100 million shots administered in essentially 42 days.  That was back on March 19th when he announced it.  As good of a thing we have in domestic production, the one thing that got me proud of what Biden was doing was getting Mereck and J&amp;J to collaborate on making the J&amp;J vaccine.

Being an introvert isn't being a shut-in and living a hermit lifestyle, it means needing time to recharge by being alone and being in a quiet environment, but that there is also time to get together in a quiet setting with friends nonetheless. 

Typical Reddit.

That said, while I am pretty middle in the introvert and extrovert scale, I'd say I hate everything about this ""new normal"" except for WFH. I love WFH and hope WFH continues on, at least in a hybrid form. I love the fact that I get more sleep owing to the lack of commute to the office. I love the fact that I can log off at 4:30 or 5:00 and get an extra hour to live my life owing to not having a commute to the office. I really really dislike socializing with co-workers as well, so that is also an added bonus for me. 

Now before I get called a ""shut-in"" for not liking to socialize with co-workers, it's just I have nothing in common with co-workers and I would prefer to use my time window for socializing with my friends, aka people I actually like socializing and spending time with. And WFH, especially during normal times without restrictions, would make that easier too owing to the extra time brought on by not having a commute home. 

That said, everything else about this ""new normal"" sucks.

I think for those who could meet their social needs whether through online means or through spending time with the person/people they live with the impact was lessened. I will absolutely enjoy getting to hang out in person with a couple of friends though! (in a small group, big groups are exhausting!)  


I think for some people the extra time not having to commute also gave them more time for hobbies, exercise, or cooking that left them healthier which increased their overall happiness. Likewise if their job is in an open office or a very socially draining job where they come home from work mentally exhausted they may be enjoying the break from that.  


I'm a little baffled at some people saying they enjoyed being free of guilt of saying no to social outings though. You don't have to feel guilty when you tell someone no. if someone tries to guilt you into going to a social outing you can always just politely tell them to fuck off, it's no big deal.

You are correct that some states have supply/demand imbalance, but that still puts a limit on the number of vaccines that will be delivered. If half of state's population (e.g., South Georgia) is ""done"", that still means the per capita uptake will be low on average across the state. 

The states I listed (for the most part - possible exceptions for e.g. Florida, and maybe Alabama just because they are starting from such a low base and haven't ""formally"" opened up) will not see material increases in vaccination rates - and many will see material *declines* in the coming weeks. It doesn't mean that folks won't continue to get vaccinated, but the pace will definitely not accelerate.

Now we have social media, which are important in  the formation of public opinion. When we discuss infectious disease,  public opinion is important because if people don't change their  behavior, if they don't get their vaccines, they're going to lose  against an infectious disease...  
&gt;  
&gt;So in regard to convincing people on social media — and this is my  personal opinion — I believe that a small percentage of people will  never be convinced. They are completely irrational. And because in  science we only have rational arguments, it's impossible to convince  them. These people are not numerous; in our most recent elections, they  gained about 0.7%-0.8% of votes. But in the places where they are  particularly active, vaccination rates have dropped 20% — not less than  1% as we might expect — because they frighten other people.",,,1617509596,{},gtbe95e,True,t3_mjocev,False,True,t3_mjocev,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mjocev/roberto_burioni_on_conquering_covid_and_charming/gtbe95e/,1617509607,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The biodistribution and persistence of expressed immunogen.

Stimulation of auto-reactive antibodies. 

Induction of a potent type 1 interferon response, which has been associated with inflammation and potential autoimmunity. Thus, identification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mRNA vaccination should be undertaken.

Presence of extracellular RNA, which may contribute to edema and pathogenic thrombus formation (blood clots). Extracellular naked RNA has been shown to increase the permeability of tightly packed endothelial cells and may thus contribute to edema.51 Another study showed that extracellular RNA promoted blood coagulation and pathological thrombus formation.52 

Potential toxic effects of any non-native nucleotides and delivery system components (particularly those that have not been disclosed by manufacturers).

At a certain point the most at risk populations will have been vaccinated (or chosen not to be vaccinated). People need to get back to their lives, and states like Florida and Texas have already shown that lifting mask mandates and capacity restrictions haven’t had the doomsday consequences that those on the left insisted would happen.

Scientists discovered a new variant floating through the Bering Strait (BS) today that threatens to extend the pandemic by *four days.* The Dow is down on this breaking news.

The scientists claim that this new BS variant is more deadly, but also more likely to spread instantaneously from person to person, regardless of their distance from each other or their location on the globe. The BS variant causes a tickling sensation that can lead to pregnancy. Though viral loads are lower, symptoms can be severe. The BS variant can evade one mask, but not two or three, but *will not infect* those who make sure that their nostrils are exposed while wearing a mask.

The BS variant is neutralized by sera from recovered individuals and those who have been vaccinated. It has three foreign bank accounts and an American passport. If you see the BS variant, it may be too late, get tested four days after exposure. It is unclear whether current testing protocol is sufficient to detect this new deadly variant.

&gt; Plans for Fall 2021 Instruction
&gt; Although the current pace of vaccination is promising, uncertainty about the prevailing conditions in the fall remains. While we predict very high levels of immunity, we are planning for several possibilities:
&gt; 
&gt; Herd Immunity
&gt; With the increasing availability of vaccines and the vaccination requirement for returning students, we anticipate that our campuses will operate in the fall under conditions in which the degree of immunity is sufficient to prevent the spread of virus within the community (herd immunity). Although New York state regulations and CDC guidelines are yet to be released, with mandatory student vaccination we anticipate that this is the most likely scenario. If the science indicates that the extent of immunity of our community provides for safe campus operation, and relevant regulations allow for in-person classroom instruction, classes normally taught in person will return to that mode of instruction, without any routinely scheduled online option. All members of our community – faculty, staff and students – should begin to plan for this return to in-person teaching and learning in the fall of 2021. We will also continue to monitor visa and travel issues that might affect our returning international students and we will implement adjustments to address their needs as much as possible.
&gt; 
&gt; High Levels of Immunity
&gt; Modeling by Professor Peter Frazier’s group indicates that the risk of in-class transmission in fully occupied classes will be equivalent to that of de-densified classrooms as long as vaccination rates of students, faculty, and staff are above 50%, seating adjustments are made, and students and faculty wear standard quality masks. We will continue to track vaccination levels, evaluate the science, and carefully monitor CDC and New York state guidelines; if it is determined that we have not achieved full herd immunity, but nearly all faculty and staff and the majority of students are immunized, we will begin the semester with normal in-person instruction without a routinely provided online option, but with enhanced safety measures (e.g., mandatory high-quality mask wearing, special seating, additional ventilation, surveillance testing, etc.). Reasonable medical accommodations for students who are unable to return for in-person instruction will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
&gt; 
&gt; Lower Levels of Immunity
&gt; Although we do not expect this to be the case, if less than 50% of our student population has been vaccinated by the beginning of the semester, we will begin the semester in de-densified classrooms, with a mix of instruction modes similar to the current semester, until critical thresholds have been met. Once sufficient herd immunity is reached, we will fully institute in-person classroom instruction across all campuses.",,,1617540170,{},gtcbtij,False,t3_mjmq84,False,True,t1_gtb8pmo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mjmq84/first_ivy_league_cornell_university_requires/gtcbtij/,1617540181,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

NJ allows overweight/obesity, smokers, health conditions + elderly now

(PDF) https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/stateprograms/fundedstates/pdf/New-Jersey-State-Profile.pdf

24% of adults are obese and 14% adults smoke (I'm sure they overlap some). They got qualified Jan 15 (along with 65+ and other health issues)

60% of adults are overweight or obese (&gt;25 BMI). They qualified starting March 15

It's all honor system, no one checks. So you can't get a vaccine if you are a honest skinny healthy young adult until May 1.

does what I'm saying mean that it will go down to flu-like numbers with the vaccine? no one can know for sure, but with vaccines coming out and a good amount of people expected to take it, we can expect the numbers to go down significantly. if you want to completely eliminate covid deaths then that is unrealistic and something we have never tried to do before with any other virus. if you want to try to police people's choice on whether or not they want to get something injected into them, that is also something that has never been done before with similar viruses so why the change?

[],,toontje18,,,[],,,,text,t2_meeqp,False,False,[],"Interesting. 2 months, let's say 61 days (30+31). Today it is the 3rd of April.

So 2 months from now is Thursday, 3 June 2021.

Israel was at where the US currently is at the 24th of January in terms of first doses of the total population. So 61 days from that date is Friday, 26 March 2021.

So let's see what results the US should have achieved by the 3rd of June comparing Israel in the same time frame.

Israel % changes from 24th of January until 26th of March:

* 96.7% increase in share of population with at least first dose
* 305.3% increase in share of population that's fully vaccinated
* 89.6% reduction in number of cases per day
* 51.6% reduction in the effective reproduction number
* 77.7% reduction in number of deaths per day
* 82.1% reduction in test positivity
* 65.9% reduction in hospital occupancy
* 41.1% reduction in ICU occupancy

So how should it all look like in the US by Thursday, 3 June 2021?

* 59.9% (around 200 million first doses given) of the total population vaccinated with at least the first dose
* 52.9% (around 176 million full vaccinations given) of the total population fully vaccinated
* 6,720 cases per day (7-day rolling average)
* 0.50 effective reproduction number
* 189 deaths per day (7-day rolling average)
* 1.2% test positivity (7-day rolling average)
* 11,723 COVID-19 patients in hospital
* 4,880 COVID-19 patients in ICU

Israel was vaccinating 2.09 vaccine doses per day (7-day rolling average) per 100 people at the 24th of January, the US is currently sitting at 0.89. So certainly still a long way to go.

I have another remind me running with some who said my region will not be done vaccinating before the end of the year. I said it could be done much earlier. The most recent projections show everyone a first dose by the end of June, so it seems I am winning that one. A bit unsure how this will actually play out. Israel had a rise in cases after this happened, just like the US is currently.

Until now there is no data from the UK to support this hyperbolic and conspiratorial version of events, and in the absence of it existing it is inappropriate to jump to conclusions. 

Now it's perfectly fair to want to see the data broken down by age and gender; and there's nothing wrong with mentioning that  but even if one is emotional about this topic the facts are you simply do not know what the demographics of the individuals affected in the UK have been.

you cannot extrapolate from other countries reporting to assume there's a direct overlap and imply there's a cover up ongoing. The UK has not historically broken down vaccine deaths and presented specific granular data on ages, nor ran to present n=1 events on frontpage of media but this information is known and obviously taken into account compared with the number immunized in specific groups

The demo program for mRNA (executed only in mice) created the protein that causes bio luminescence.  We can therefore have livers or muscles that glow in the dark.

Creating vaccines instantly for any virus with a known protein antigen is achievable now (figuring out a virus's target antigen is not instant, but we can very quickly test out candidates).  Curing viruses, rather than vaccinating for them, seems to be an obvious next step.  Writing some code to create a mimic of a cancer antigen to get the immune system to hunt cancer cells seems to be on the horizon, but whether this can be done without overly complicated programming is unknowable until we try it.

We also have delivery limitations; where we are now might be compared to the card-punch era of computing.  The program must be frozen (refrigeration will be available within months), and can only be executed at the injection site (hence why we use injection into the muscle, since that tissue regenerates constantly) or the liver (where any particles that enter the bloodstream are filtered out).

JERUSALEM — On Friday morning, in the Old City of Jerusalem, in the limestone alleys of the Christian quarter, it was as if the pandemic had never happened.

The winding passageways that form the Via Dolorosa, along which Christians believe Jesus hauled his cross toward his crucifixion, were packed with over 1,000 worshipers. In the covered market, the air smelled of incense and echoed with Christian hymns. The Good Friday procession, where the faithful retrace the route Jesus is said to have taken, was back.

“It is like a miracle,” said the Rev. Amjad Sabbara, a Roman Catholic priest who helped lead the procession. “We’re not doing this online. We’re seeing the people in front of us.”

Pandemic restrictions forced the cancellation of last year’s ceremony and required priests to hold services without congregants present. Now, thanks to Israel’s world-leading vaccine rollout, religious life in Jerusalem is edging back to normal. And on Friday, that brought crowds once again to the city’s streets, and relief to even one of Christianity’s most solemn commemorations: the Good Friday procession.

The streets were packed for Friday’s procession. Last year’s was [cancelled.Credit](https://cancelled.Credit)...Dan Balilty for The New York Times

“We are so lucky to be here,” said May Bathish, a 40-year-old chorister at Father Sabbara’s church in the Old City. “When you walk the same steps that Jesus did, it is the highest privilege.”

For much of the past year, the pandemic kept the Old City eerily empty. Its shops, synagogues and churches were often shuttered, its alleys bereft of tourists and pilgrims. But with nearly 60 percent of Israeli residents fully vaccinated, the city’s streets were once again thrumming, even if the foreign tourists were still absent.

“When it is empty, it is like a city of ghosts,” said Ms. Bathish. Now, she added, “it is a city of life.”

At the gathering point for the procession on Friday, there was scarcely space to stand. Police officers blocked latecomers from entering from nearby side streets. Members of a Catholic youth group formed a ring around the bearers of a large replica crucifix, the centerpiece of the procession, to spare those carrying it from the jostles of a sea of worshipers.

Many of those in the procession were Palestinians who became Israeli residents after Israel captured the Old City in 1967, along with the rest of East Jerusalem. Around 6,000 Christians live in the Old City, alongside Muslims and Jews.

“Walk behind the cross!” shouted a church official. “Behind the cross, everyone!”

Above the hubbub, Father Amjad called on his congregation to walk in pairs. “Two by two,” he shouted through a loudspeaker. “Not one by one!”

Then the crowd moved slowly off, singing mournful hymns as they proceeded along what Christians consider a re-enactment of Jesus’ last steps.

They walked in fits and starts down the Via Dolorosa, past the site where tradition holds that Jesus was tried by Pontius Pilate, past where he was flogged and mocked, past the shops selling Christian icons and crosses, ice cream and T-shirts.

They turned left and then right, over the places where Christians believe Jesus stumbled — once, twice, three times — under the weight of the crucifix.

In the alley outside the chapel of St. Simon of Cyrene, the marchers trailed their fingers over an ocher limestone in the chapel wall. According to tradition, Jesus steadied himself against the stone after a stumble. And so many pilgrims, over so many centuries, have since caressed the stone that its surface is now smooth to the touch.

Finally, they reached the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, which believers think was the site of Christ’s crucifixion, burial and, ultimately, resurrection.

For some, the Good Friday procession carried even more resonance than usual — its themes of suffering, redemption and renewal seeming particularly symbolic as the end of a deadly pandemic appeared finally in sight.

“We have gained hope again,” said George Halis, 24, who is studying to be a priest and who lives in the Old City. “Last year was like a darkness that came over all of earth.”

For others, there was a theological importance, as well as an emotional one, to being able to gather together again.

“All Christians are part of the body of Christ,” said Msgr. Vincenzo Peroni, a Catholic priest based in Jerusalem who has regularly led pilgrimages within the Holy Land. “Being able to celebrate together makes that more visible.”

But for now, that togetherness still faces limits. There are still restrictions on the number of worshipers at Easter services. Masks are still a legal requirement. And foreigners still need an exemption to enter Israel — keeping out thousands of pilgrims, to the cost of local shopkeepers who depend on their business.

“It still feels like it’s not normal,” said Hagop Karakashian, the owner of a famous ceramics shop in the Old City, whose family designed the neighborhood’s street signs. “The locals can celebrate, yes. But something is still missing.”

The mood among Christians a few miles away, in the Palestinian cities of Bethlehem and Ramallah, was even less jubilant. Christians in the occupied territories can visit Jerusalem only with a special permit, which has become even harder to procure during the pandemic. While most Israelis are now vaccinated, the vast majority of Palestinians haven’t received a dose.

Israel has supplied vaccines to more than 100,000 Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank, almost all of whom work in Israel or West Bank settlements. Palestinian officials have obtained around 150,000 more doses.

But Israel says it isn’t obliged to vaccinate the rest of the Palestinian population, citing a clause of the Oslo peace accords of the 1990s, which transferred health care duties to Palestinian officials. Critics say it is still Israel’s responsibility to help, citing international legislation that requires an occupying power to oversee health care for occupied populations, as well as a separate clause of the Oslo accords that says Israel must work with Palestinians during epidemics.

Either way, infection rates are still high in the occupied territories and vaccination rates are low — and that has limited the number of Palestinian Christians granted permission to enter Jerusalem for Easter this year. A spokesperson for the Israeli government declined to reveal the final number.

“Without permits, we cannot come,” said the Rev. Jamal Khader, the Roman Catholic parish priest in Ramallah. “It’s a sign of the continuous presence of occupation and the limitations on movement.”

But Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection still provide spiritual nourishment for a despondent population, said Father Khader, who is allowed to enter Jerusalem through his work with the church.

“We identify with the sufferings of Christ on Good Friday,” he said.

“Then,” he added, “we find some hope on Easter Sunday.”",,,1617486838,{},gtacs8d,False,t3_mjfth8,False,True,t3_mjfth8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mjfth8/like_a_miracle_israels_vaccine_success_allows/gtacs8d/,1617486849,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

- for-profit companies saw the business opportunity of a lifetime and decided to make every effort possible to ensure they produced a safe and effective vaccine so that they be guaranteed to reap the benefits for many years to come

And that's completely ignoring the most relevant point, which is that the main reasons vaccines usually take a long time to develop are:

1. not enough funding for the actual science
2. internal corporate bureaucracy blocking the way and prioritizing other things
3. not enough funding for the trials
4. not enough humans willing to be take part in the trials
5. government bureaucracy blocking the way and prioritizing other things

There are two big things as far as I know.

The bigger thing is that a lot of the manufacturing processes for one sort of mRNA injection is identical to that of another, to the point that you could use a single production line for a lot of the process for multiple injections.  Add in that RNA is relatively easy to synthesise and it means that for the cost of setting up a line to produce a human hormone using current methods you could set up a line which could produce multiple batches of different medications which in turn could lead to a drop in price for smaller batches for more unusual uses.

Young people rarely get symptomatic illness from covid and when they do it's mild due to the lower density of ACE2 receptor sites in lung tissue. If the at-risk population is vaccinated there is no need for an experimental drug therapy on students. This is not the same as a typical recombinant vaccine. It's a medical treatment by federal definition. It has only been approved under emergency use authorization and there are no long term safety studies. What little animal studies do exist on SARS vaccines are not encouraging, although researchers took care to target the S protein in order to illicit improved specificity of the antibody response, this does not mean that binding antibodies are not a risk. Hopefully it won't cause ADE when you're exposed to a wild variant next winter. If you don't know what ADE is, or understand what I just wrote, then you don't understand the medical literature surrounding SARS vaccines. Instructing your cells to produce a viral protein without any long term studies on the consequences of immune sensitization is reckless. Blind faith in government and a corporate controlled medical system designed to profit on people isn't admirable nor intelligent.

The FDA prevented the use of drug therapeutics for covid specifically because federal legislation prohibits the use of vaccines for any disease with effective drug therapies. This is why Ivermectin is being used all over the world but not in the United Sates excluding a few brave doctors in Houston Texas. Bangladesh has been administering Ivermectin to its population in $0.02 blister packs since June of 2020 and has a Covid mortality rate of 49/1M population. The United States has a covid morality rate of 1300/1M population,26 times higher. We live on a farm and doctors in this country are not allowed to be healers, only legal drug dealers. Anyone whose suffered from autoimmune diseases or Lyme disease understands the nature of our for profit medical system.

I'm 33 years old and had covid for 2 weeks symptomatically. I was positive for 8 weeks on PCR. I have antibodies and T cells confirmed from laboratory testing. I know this disease, I had it. If you're strong and healthy and supplement with D3 daily and take adequate zinc you have little to fear nor should you adulterate your body with experimental messenger rna.

\&gt;Zero COVID

????????

""Zero COVID"" is commendable but it isn't always possible. Sometimes you have to settle for 50 COVID or even 100 COVID. And it's not a zero-sum process either where everything is completely closed until there are no cases, look at places like Taiwan and Iceland, for example, whose COVID strategies really do not get looked at enough in deThe reality is that many people don't actually understand what it takes to reach those kinds of low numbers and the answer isn't being an island or even a strict lockdown, it's MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE. The government, with its pocketbook in hand,  has to be ready to support every closed business, every quarantined employee, every COVID test, and every sort of mitigation that is found to be effective.

""Zero COVID"" was never possible in places like the US simply because the government wasn't willing to foot the bill and they still aren't.",,,1617549457,{},gtcr3oz,False,t3_mjkr9x,False,True,t3_mjkr9x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mjkr9x/canada_is_one_big_pandemic_response_experiment_it/gtcr3oz/,1617549468,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

For a couple of reasons 

For one he lives on Twitter and his tweets often have only nuggets of information that fail to show the whole picture. He could have picked any number of in vitro studies of live virus to show that neutralization of B1.135 and P.1 is adequate, but he instead picked the one outlier using pseudovirus. Stuff like that makes him seem disingenuous

He also lacks the pedigree that a lot of other infectious disease experts and epidemiologists have. People like Fauci, and yes even Osterholm have been working in the field for many, many years and have established reputations and academic prowess. Feigl-Ding doesn’t, and most of his expertise is actually in nutrition. 

He’s disingenuous. Like I said the bit where he tries to make the B.C. P.1 outbreak seem huge is simply misleading because he never states the high level of genomic surveillance that Canada is doing. Another perfect example is the graph and tweet he used as an alarm against P.1. Yes that variant is a problem, but he doesn’t take the time to explain all of the other factors at play in Brazil, like having one of the worst pandemic responses in the world on a national level 

Basically he’s a guy who proved right about his early warnings about coronavirus, and he’s parlayed that into a career as an armchair Twitter analyst of all things covid.

He also lacks the pedigree that a lot of other infectious disease experts and epidemiologists have. People like Fauci, and yes even Osterholm have been working in the field for many, many years and have established reputations and academic prowess. Most of Feigl-Ding’s expertise is actually in nutrition. 

He’s disingenuous. Like I said the bit where he tries to make the B.C. P.1 outbreak seem huge is simply misleading because he never states the high level of genomic surveillance that Canada is doing. Another perfect example is the graph and tweet he used as an alarm against P.1. Yes that variant is a problem, but he doesn’t take the time to explain all of the other factors at play in Brazil, like having one of the worst pandemic responses in the world on a national level

Covid infections have fallen again despite the return of millions of pupils to the classroom, raising hopes for a smooth easing of restrictions.

Confirmed cases discovered through routine testing appeared to have plateaued since the return of all pupils to school on March 8, although a rise in cases in school-age children is partly down to more being picked up through mass testing programmes.

I think invalidating someone’s feelings and emotions is indeed a form of trivialization which is a fundamental to gaslighting. Telling someone they are being dramatic is an easy way to dismiss someone’s opinions and at the same time make them feel conflicted not because of their arguments, but simply having emotions tied to them. It’s manipulative and I have no taste for it.

Their morality tells them they need to wear a mask because they personally feel responsible for infecting others. Mine moral ideology is that I have done the best that I can in protecting others but have reached the point where my quality of life is suffering, and I am ok with returning to normalcy without experiencing mental anguish. 

I agree that restrictions should be in place until all vaccines are available to those that want it. I don’t think me masking is actually accomplishing anything for those that are vaccinated and that it is all theater at this point.

Think of it as akin to genetics. People from one population (A) might have a strong tendency towards immunity that might be causing an ailment in another population (B) that reduces the overall impact on society A to be 1/20th that of society B. In this case, there's a vaccine that can have you convert from a person with the illness potential of society B and suddenly they have the hardiness of a person from society A.

“I find anything that causes temporary inflammation, e.g. cold or flu-like symptoms can cause temporary tinnitus,” said Julian Cowan Hill, an author, therapist and manager of Quieten, an app to help tinnitus.

Stress from the pandemic itself may be at least partly to blame, Cowan Hill said. “I’ve worked with tinnitus sufferers for 20 years and definitely find a very strong link between stress, fear, anxiety, the fight-or-flight response and tinnitus,” he explained.

While there are a variety of potential triggers of the condition — ranging from hearing loss to head trauma to medicine side-effects, “often what keeps it going is fear and anxiety,” Cowan Hill said.

Looks like the inflammation caused by the vaccine could lead to tinnitus temporarily.

There was a TED Talk by Salmon Khan on virtual learning where he discusses the benefits over in person learning. One of them is that kids all learn different things at different speeds and it's impossible to cater to that with in person learning. If a teacher spends ten minutes covering something and 10% of the class doesn't understand it, the teacher doesn't stop and spend longer on that 10% because the other 90% then lose out. Versus virtual learning where students can pause and replay something multiple times, and have the ability to pause for some arbitrary amount of time until they understand a concept and move on.

I felt the same too- kids are wild, they’re all over the place, it can’t possibly work. Other than a month in January, our schools have been open since September, and the kids adapted quickly. What I’ve come to realize is that, for all the talk of kids being uncontrollable, a lot of the rules might even be taking advantage of the fact that kids can be controlled. Imagine telling a grown adult that if they want to take a sip of water, they must go stand in a corner while 20 people stare nervously at their back. Imagine telling a bunch of adults that they are not allowed to talk while they eat. Imagine telling them “ok, it’s 10:15, time to all go wash our hands! Bobby, that seemed a little quick, go to the back of the line so you can do it properly this time.” My friend dropped off her kids one morning, then realized that one of them forgot his water bottle. She couldn’t go back since she’s a teacher herself, so she called the school to ask whether they could give him a plastic bottle or something. Nope, sorry, b/c covid. Imagine telling an adult that they’re shit out of options and will have to manage without any water all day. It doesn’t take much for an adult to feel condescended to and therefore defensive, while the majority of children are used to being told what to do and don’t take it so personally. Workplaces put in all sorts of guidelines, but at the end of the day all you really have is faith that the person working next to you shares your sense of risk aversion, trust that the mask they are wearing is clean, trust that they washed their hands the last time they went to the bathroom, trust that they didn’t pop an Advil Cold and Flu in the morning because they didn’t want to call in sick, trust that they didn’t have the fam over for dinner on the weekend.",,,1617567046,{},gtdp7rg,False,t3_mjyacn,False,True,t1_gtdekvn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mjyacn/b117_variant_spiking_in_many_states_experts/gtdp7rg/,1617567057,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

We don't have the vaccine production here, but our supply is now on track and we've taken what I believe to be a smart approach (though could use some alterations for select groups) basically copying that of the UK to get as many people their first doses as possible by delaying the second.  

We're vaccinating at a good clip now.  No, not matching the US, but we were never going to do that.   We are well on our way to a normal summer.

We’re going to stop wearing masks because we just don’t like them for social reasons, and right now we’re kind of haggling over the acceptable number of deaths we want to allow in exchange for walking around with our faces showing.

From Fauci’s point of view, as soon as he tells vaccinated people to burn their masks, he’s sentencing some number of people to death, particularly because it will discourage continued masking among the unvaccinated. And Fauci’s goal is just different from most voters and the politicians they’ve elected — Fauci’s goal is not 2019-normal, which he views as a public health cesspool with wholly insufficient disease awareness. Fauci’s goal is to use the pandemic to create a post-2021 new normal in which people are generally more aware of disease spread. Fauci et al would have recommended universal mask-wearing during every past flu season if they hadn’t known they’d be laughed out of the room. Now they’re thinking maybe they can get people to wear a mask during every flu season forever. Fauci has said he’d like to permanently get rid of handshakes! That’s where he’s coming from.

Since Fauci does not personally own any nightclubs or concert venues, the economic and social implications of permanent capacity restrictions is of little consequence to him. Which is why we elect politicians to balance public health concerns with other concerns. That’s how we’re going to get rid of masks.

&gt;A month later, in January, the British Medical Journal says 50,000 kids tested positive for the virus, more than any month during the 1st and 2nd wave of the virus.

&gt;In Italy, researchers studied a spike in cases in a small village where 10% of the population caught the virus.

&gt;60% of those individuals were children, who then spread the virus to family members at home.

&gt;But there is some positive news.

&gt;Earlier this week Pfizer reported that its vaccine has a 100% efficacy in kids between the ages of 12 and 15.

&gt;”If all goes as planned, the vaccine for 12 to 15 year olds could be ready as soon as the start of the next school year,” says Dr. Bill Gruber, Pfizer’s Senior Vice President of Vaccine Clinical Research and Development.

&gt;So, kids are possibly just a few months away from being eligible for the vaccine.

&gt;And experts say while kids may be more likely to spread this new variant, they don't know yet if it's causing more serious reactions in children.
Either way, they're encouraging families to keep up with masks and social distancing heading into the summer, so that by next school year, kids can start off in the classroom and hopefully never leave.",,,1617551833,{},gtcvnyi,False,t3_mjyacn,False,True,t3_mjyacn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mjyacn/b117_variant_spiking_in_many_states_experts/gtcvnyi/,1617551844,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

""**The data didn't differentiate between variants, though most instances in Ontario right now are thought to be the B117 variant first identified in southeast England.""**  


Jump to conclusions much.   


You  can have minor changes with viral fitness that will cause one particular variant of the Virus to become dominate.  
Epically with how this spreads.   
 Its thought 20% of cases are responsible for 80% of the spread.  So slightly improved affinity with ace2 would not mean major differences with its effect on us but over the course several generations of virus one variant can out compete another.  It just need to perform better in those those 20% of cases that result in high transmission.   


We seen way lager death rates with the original virus last year.  
We seen it much higher in other countries  including our neighbors  to the south.   
All of their problems was caused by the original SARS-COV-2  


Every one is getting fatigued so that's helping cases creep up. Schools no matter how we wish it, are a major source of transmission and we are not massively testing our schools.   
 Our testing has been plateaued  for 6 months so  we are probably missing way more cases then we think. Part of the point of testing is to isloate and trace to cut transmission early and keep growth down.  We have basically given up on that part of pandemic control.  that's how you keep cases down.

Because no vaccine has ever been 100% effective - between that fact and variants, unrestricted community spread, even just among unvaccinated people, is still a threat when it is still this prevalent and the community spread is this high. 

Because every time the virus is transmitted from one person to another, that is an opportunity for mutation and there is a possibility that a new, vaccine resistant strain will be born - so again unrestricted community spread is a bad thing.

Here's some pretty simple math, and it's obviously more complicated than this, but if person A is 95% less likely to have COVID and person B is 95% less likely to get it, then you are 400x less likely to spread COVID from person A to person B. You can go through all the scenarios like that, and what you find is that risk is incredibly small, but gets larger as groups get way bigger. So don't hold 600 person orgies.

That is also assuming that people who *do* get COVID with the vaccine are just as likely to spread it, which is probably not true. So the numbers go even lower if we believe that preliminary data.

Then, as prevalence goes down, the numbers get even lower.

The point is, as long as you and your friends are getting vaccinated, 600 person orgies will be back on the menu sooner than you think, and dinner parties with fully vaccinated people are 100% okay. If you are judging people for being social in private after vaccination, you're probably stuck in pandemic mode, sort of like recently rich people who still can't bring themselves to shell out for guac at chipotle.

Well, the benefit of a vaccine is that society creates a safe environment. Some at risk people may not be able to take the vaccine safely, or may be ineligible. 

Lemme tell you about my CEV kid, he can only go to school right now because other people around him chose to get vaccinated, when they could have refused. Many of the people he meets are young and at no risk. When we take him out, he is safer if people are vaccinated. It is not a strange concept, I think.

The vaccine is not just about your own personal risk profile. I say that while acknowledging that if you are young, you probably wont see that kind of bigger picture as being relevant or worth it. It is, by definition, selfish. Thinking of the self instead of the societal benefit.

I did also try to qualify this as it not being an insult, so try not to take it as such.

Counterfactuals are unfalsifiable and therefore unscientific statements. So far, the US had at least 30 million cases confirmed. Either way, the solution is losing more liberties. If there were few deaths, that means totalitarianism worked; we need more. If there were many deaths, it means we didn't have authoritarian enough measures; we need more. 
    
The death rate is even lower if you consider the asymptomatic and the fact that some of the deaths were not due to covid. This is especially ridiculous when you compare countries which did have a strict quarantine (like Argentina) to others which didn't (Uruguay, the US, Sweden, Israel, etc.). The result? Argentina is among the top ten cases, and we have a higher death rate than the demonized US in which masks were not mandatory and a significant number of people refused to wear them.

An expat is generally (in common usage) someone who is there temporarily with the intention to eventually return home.",,,1617561059,{},gtddq4d,False,t3_mjxfjh,False,True,t1_gtdbcxp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mjxfjh/these_american_expats_are_willing_to_travel_more/gtddq4d/,1617561070,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;A breakthrough case is when someone develops an illness despite already being fully vaccinated.

&gt;This isn’t a reason to avoid getting vaccinated. There’s no vaccine that can provide 100 percent immunity against any disease.

&gt;Experts say these rare breakthrough COVID-19 cases will give experts a way to determine the extent to which COVID-19 vaccines work and what coronavirus variants may be causing these cases despite vaccination.

&gt;“Most people will mount a strong immunologic response. But individuals who are highly immunocompromised may have a more blunted response, and these individuals need to remain careful even if they are vaccinated,” said Dr. David Hirschwerk, attending physician in the department of infectious diseases at Northwell Health in Manhasset, New York.

&gt;All of this is expected.

You are correct that there were zero hospitalizations in the Pfizer and JnJ test group (there were two hospitalizations in the Moderna test group). However, the confidence intervals on these findings are large because the placebo group hospitalizations ranged from 5-9 incidents each. For the Moderna, the clinical study showed 89% effectiveness with a CI of 80-98% because it did happen to have a couple of hospitalizations (real world efficacy is likely greater than 89%). 

Initial research from Israel's vaccinations in real world populations showed a relatively poor [87% protection](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2101765) from Pfizer, but this has been revised up with subsequent data to around 97-98% with the latest MoH data. However, this data has some challenges due to the challenge of finding demographic pairs: those who got the vaccine are more likely to interact with other people who are vaccinated, whereas those who did not get the vaccine (e.g., ultra-orthodox) are likely to interact with people who did not get it either - resulting in significant confounding effects. 

Regardless of the exact percentage, the vaccines are not 100% protective against hospitalization and death.  Unfortunately no vaccine is that perfect. The vaccines we do have are incredibly effective and we should be thankful for that. But saying they are 100% effective against hospitalization and death when they are not does not help anyone - because, again, it just gives anti-vaxxers an excuse to not get it themselves and potentially prevent the end of endemic spread.",,,1617569656,{},gtdu86v,False,t3_mjstue,False,True,t1_gtdspyb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mjstue/michigan_hospitals_covid19_patients_triple_in_a/gtdu86v/,1617569667,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

So it's reasonable to say that the amount of people who will get a fatal COVID infection from the specific scenario of their children infecting them will likely be lower than the amount of flu deaths from the same cause, as the chance of overall flu infection will be higher if the majority of adults are vaccinated on the whole. I'm saying I consider that likely.   


You initially wrote ""vaccine available to everyone"". That's what I find unnecessary. I don't think that level of risk mitigation would be needed to consider this dealt with.

Herd immunity has the most impact on those who are not vaccinated at all. If only 20% of the adult population is unvaccinated, the specific scenario of their unvaccinated child giving them a fatal COVID infection is quite low.

The limiting factor in Germany is not the infrastructure but the availability of the vaccines and the availability of vaccines is limited by the global supply chain.

That's entirely the teacher's fault then, unless they're using some weird software that doesn't allow break out rooms like Zoom. The software they're using should allow teachers to use individual rooms away from the main session to talk to students as needed, which isn't any different than going over to their desk if they need help. It's not ideal, but it will work in the interim. 

Like I said, I'm not suggesting these things are full replacements. 

&gt; But this is starting to stretch (or already has) into long term territory.

That's just dependent on your outlook of things. I don't believe a year is long-term, especially when a good chunk of that was summer vacation of 2020. We can clearly see that vaccination are having a positive effect on viral spread, so we can see a safer period in sight if things keep  trending the way they have been - assuming this variant doesn't spiral out of control - so the idea that we can't hang on for a little longer is silly to me. Yeah, it's not the same, but to many people, the livelihood of others is more important than someone's preference to hang out with people in person. 

Although that being said, nothing is stopping people from hanging out in person, even unvaccinated, as long as they remain outdoors, masked, and 6 ft. apart. My friends and I have been doing it for the past year without issue. 

&gt; In the past few months we've been doing more informal outside team meetings, and more questions were asked and answered and problems solved during 1 of those than a year of Teams meetings.

This is 100% a problem with your work team.

&gt;  
&gt;“Over the summer we were treated to all this on the television news,  pictures of crowded beaches, and there was an outcry about this,” he  told MPs. “There were no outbreaks linked to public beaches.
