I'd be interested in reading the source for that second paragraph. It's possible that they want to avoid allergic reactions to vaccine ingredients. 


What we do know is the vaccine is effective against the new variants, but I haven't seen (though correct me if I'm wrong) studies on natural immunity against the new variants. For how natural immunity could be worse than vaccine immunity: The way our immune system works isn't always to target the most ""important"" antigen. There are very likely people out there with antibodies against antigens other than the spike protein, and cleared the virus that way. This is less than ideal considering anything that isn't specific for the spike protein is at risk of being outcompeted by a virus that mutated that non-essential antigen. Here's a source showing that these non-spike protein antibodies are not as effective against variants: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-021-00573-0.

There's also a concept called original antigenic sin that could make even natural antibodies against the spike protein less effective than vaccine immunity depending on which part of the spike protein it targets. This can cut both ways, making one individual's immunity stronger than vaccine immunity, but you asked for ways in which natural immunity *could* be worse. The point is, there's plenty of ways natural immunity could be worse than vaccine immunity, and if so why not take the vaccine just in case? There's no mechanism (as far as I know) that could harm you, and it's not like you can override previous immunity.

I mean this whole comment comes with the caveat that I'm not convinced there's a compelling reason to not take the vaccine, but I'd gladly be proven wrong.

The antibodies are slightly different and that’s why when they use blood transfusions to help critical COVID patients, they use the blood of recovered people as they need the antibody produced from natural infection. 

How can one argue that getting a vaccine that emulates the COVID spike protein is somehow more robust than your body actually fighting off the virus. In what world does that really make sense? Aren’t the vaccines actually just meant to help your body recognize the virus, so it can take it out easier? Haven’t I already taken it out on my own? 

If I have the natural antibodies, how are they going to react with a vaccine spike protein? It’s valid to be asking these questions. I’m not anti vax, I’ve taken every vaccine besides this one pretty much. My actual doctor advised I don’t take it. Yet the public seems to scream at me to take it, despite my doctor saying otherwise. Someone actually told me he’s wrong lmao. 

Completely unrelated, though not really, Moderna only profitable quarter was in 2021, makes me think there’s other reasons for this massive push.

There is no single definition of efficacy, there are multiple. The one you talk about is the efficacy against hospitalization. The other commonly used efficacy is against symptomatic infection. 

This is where much of the confusion comes from.

The Oxford-AZ vaccine only has a efficacy of about \~60% at preventing infection (Delta Variant, England and Scotland data) but \~90% against hospitalization.

I want to make sure we’re fair here, though. We learned about the nature of the virus as we went along. I can remember papers in March arguing whether we should term it “airborne” or not. It wasn’t until April that we had a lot of evidence for spread from asymptotic people. And that’s the data point that flipped the advice. Masks are most effective from a public health perspective if worn by infected people. When it became clear that infected people weren’t isolating or wearing masks because they didn’t know they were sick, the need for everyone to mask up became clear. 

Again - and I don’t agree with the decision - wrt policies I can guarantee you there’s a model that predicted vaccination rates would increase if they had a reward of reopening. I think that would have been a fine social experiment for a small community if you could get it past a review board (you couldn’t).

But you can’t just go “Whoops, that didn’t work” with a national policy like that. 

If it were me, I would have recommended 
1.	Tying the mandate relaxation to community vaccination rates and levels
2.	Managed expectations wrt re-introducing mandates based on things like positivity rates


That allows you more room to say that delta is looking bad, so we’re re-introducing masks until we get vaccinations up to 85%.",,,,1626763031,{},h5uivec,False,t3_on224o,False,True,t1_h5tv55d,/r/Coronavirus/comments/on224o/bidens_surgeon_general_backs_localized_mask/h5uivec/,1626922427,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

…

&gt;There have been 67 cases of COVID-19 infections in Japan among those accredited for the Games since July 1, when many athletes and officials started arriving, organizers said Tuesday.

&gt;Japan, with a vaccination program that has lagged that of most other developed nations, has recorded more than 840,000 cases and 15,055 deaths, and Games host city Tokyo is experiencing a fresh surge, with 1,387 cases recorded Tuesday.

&gt;Muto, a former top financial bureaucrat with close ties to Japan's ruling party, is known for his careful choice of words, while officials are facing a domestic public angry about coronavirus restrictions and concerned over a possible spike in cases triggered by Games attendees arriving from abroad.

&gt;Organizers, for whom International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said canceling the event had never been an option, have promised to keep the Games ""safe and secure.""

&gt;But experts see gaps in an Olympic ""bubble"" that mandates frequent testing and has been designed to limit participants' movements.

&gt;Seiko Hashimoto, who sits alongside Muto as organizing committee president, said that safety measures introduced to reassure the Japanese public had not necessarily done so and that she was aware that popular support for the Games had dropped.

&gt;”I really want to apologize from my heart for the accumulation of frustrations and concerns that the public has been feeling towards the Olympics,"" Hashimoto told the same news conference.

Vaccination is the strategy!

Why do journalists or new organisation want to paint countries that succeeded in clamping down on the virus as lacking something?

Is it because they are ashamed of the horrible toll it was allowed to take in their own countries?

It's the most logical and human strategy a country can take. Short lockdown and then quarantines at borders until everyone is vaccinated. Then the quarantines can be lifted.

This is just speculation on my part, but based in the decrease in demand you mention and that from the design perspective, it seems like the dark blue is the ""highest"" color (unless they change the scale or add an extra tier with a different color), I would say that perhaps the gov is counting on the total vaccination rate to end up being low, around 50-65% (100% - 16% - 20?%).

Delta &amp; alpha+beta+gamma virulence: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.05.21260050v2

For Americans, one can extrapolate somewhat from the NYC outbreak, in which [0.32% of the population died within about a month](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm) with [24% seroprevalence](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33836067/).

In all these cases, you have to make the unrealistic assumption that unmitigated COVID spread is even possible.  But each of the above places were entirely unmitigated up until their hospital capacity was overwhelmed (or slightly before in the case of NYC), and then had a ~2-month lockdown.

These places are also all quite urban.  Generally 80% of the population is urban/suburban, so spread in rural areas is basically inconsequential by comparison.  But it's certainly possible that rural areas would have had much lower attack rates.  Urban areas get into problems because the spread is *so* fast on occasion that the delay from infection to hospitalization (2-3 weeks) means once hospitals are overwhelmed and people panic, it's already 2-3 weeks too late and many will not have care.

In all of the above, the age distribution of the infected is the most important factor in the end result.

We've seen headlines confirming it months and months ago. It's nothing new. Regardless, their basis for not wearing masks remains ""there's nothing to be afraid of with a 1% death rate.""

You can then bring up that it can permanently damage you, and they'll come off as assuming that this damage only occurs in people who have been hospitalized. And such a low percentage of people get hospitalized. It's again nothing to worry about.

When you clarify that it can damage you even if you never feel the flu symptoms, they might jump off onto a different argument. Like how masks keep newborns from seeing their mother's face immediately after birth, and how that hurts the babies.

The anti-mask platform is all about how they ""aren't giving in to the Covid fear."" You'd think facts and science would be objective enough, but it hasn't been good enough for anti-maskers from the start. And it never will be. I heard someone point out that despite touting how they aren't afraid of Covid, anti-maskers really seem to come off as people who are *terrified* of wearing a mask. One would even say it's as if they truly believe that wearing a mask carries a higher death rate than not wearing one.

Having another good argument under our belt isn't going to address the existential threat anti-maskers are feeling from being told to wear a mask. Trying to get through to them on Covid is less important than first trying to get through to them on their irrational fear of masks.

Oh, that may very well be, though I still think you underestimate how much contact goes on and how much virus can spread through masks (and gloves don't make much difference one way or the other). There are a lot more people than delivery drivers, supermarket workers and medical workers who have to work to keep society running even during a lockdown, and I think that's one reason lockdowns haven't been as successful as hoped in most of the world.

As I said, I might be in denial, but I find that people have been over-optimistic about how much policy can do to stop a virus, and that China's apparent success gave the world the false idea that almost all deaths were avoidable. A 1918-style ""we can't stop it, let's go on with our lives"" approach would have been better in a country like the U.S., where hard border closures and ""real"" lockdowns were never politically possible.

Anyway, I hope China is able to get through this without a major outbreak and that they are able to lift travel restrictions and quarantines eventually.

The education in California is varied. It’s 37th in the country, which isn’t great, but a large part of the issue is a combination of how large and varied the state is and the massive population. Low income neighborhoods and rural communities especially struggle, and this was made worse by Bush’s “No child left behind” policy. We’re also struggling against the bullshit Devos pulled, which pushed funding into charter schools.

As for equality- yeah, it’s expensive. Everyone and their mother moved here for decades, and the cost of living is out of control. The wealthy actively inhibit new housing being built. I’d still rather be poor in California than most states. We’ve got the best social healthcare options in the country. Better renter rights than most. Great community colleges with lots of low income options.

Due to earlier lockdowns and distancing policies, they are essentially getting hit with two years worth of RSV seasons all at once.   They had one season with pretty much no flu or RSV but the bill on that is coming due right now.  

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/08/new-zealand-children-falling-ill-in-high-numbers-due-to-covid-immunity-debt


&gt;New Zealand hospitals are experiencing the payoff of “immunity debt” created by Covid-19 lockdowns, with wards flooded by babies with a potentially-deadly respiratory virus, doctors have warned.

&gt;Wellington has 46 children currently hospitalised for respiratory illnesses including respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. A number are infants, and many are on oxygen. Other hospitals are also experiencing a rise in cases that are straining their resources – with some delaying surgeries or converting playrooms into clinical space.

&gt;RSV is a common respiratory illness. In adults, it generally only produces very mild symptoms – but it can make young children extremely ill, or even be fatal. The size and seriousness of New Zealand’s outbreak is likely being fed by what some paediatric doctors have called an “immunity debt” – where people don’t develop immunity to other viruses suppressed by Covid lockdowns, causing cases to explode down the line.

...

&gt;Epidemiologist and public health professor Michael Baker used the metaphor of forest brushfires: if a year or two have passed without fire, there is more fuel on the ground to feed the flames. When a fire finally comes, it burns much more fiercely. “What we’re seeing now is we’ve accumulated a whole lot of susceptible children that have missed out on exposure – so now they’re seeing it for the first time,” Baker said.

&gt;The “immunity debt” phenomenon occurs because measures like lockdowns, hand-washing, social distancing and masks are not only effective at controlling Covid-19. They also suppress the spread of other illnesses that transmit in a similar way, including the flu, common cold, and lesser-known respiratory illnesses like RSA. In New Zealand, lockdowns last winter led to a 99.9% reduction in flu cases and a 98% reduction in RSV - and near-eliminated the spike of excess deaths New Zealand usually experiences during winter.",,,,1626746397,{},h5ts0yn,False,t3_onjs4d,False,False,t1_h5tm5ec,/r/Coronavirus/comments/onjs4d/deaths_from_covid_incredibly_rare_among_children/h5ts0yn/,1626906860,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

It's certainly true less kids die from direct covid infection, I've seen my fair share of COVID in both patient populations. That doesn't mean kids are free from complications.  Probably the biggest complication we see in kids is MIS-C which is a multiorgan inflammatory syndrome which can be lethal and comes about after a COVID infection. It's common enough that I see it a few times per month so it's not like it's unheard of, most kids get pretty sick if they get MIS-C. Otherwise under the age of 10 most kids do pretty well, have seen the occasional case of myopericarditis (heart inflammation) but most times it's cold symptoms. 

Honestly I worry most about smaller long haul symptoms that are frequently overlooked, roughly 10% of kids in the age 10-20 years still lose their sense of taste or smell, younger kids seem less affected but I wonder how much of that is inability to report symptoms appropriately.  regardless.... if you permanently or even partially  lose your sense of taste or smell at age 10....well, fuck. Plenty of athletes that I see with lingering shortness of breath on exertion.  There's also less common pathology out there that's been described, heart failure, stroke. Extraordinarily uncommon but out there. I don't know that it's worth dancing with the devil if you don't have to; its like swimming during a thunderstorm. Yeah, your risk of getting struck by lightening isn't high....but why risk it if you can avoid it 🤷🏽‍♂️

Firstly delta infections are lagging behind the UK by about 2-3 months. It is currently building steam but that takes time. 

The US focused heavily on mrna vaccines which offer slightly better protection against symptomatic infection. Which in theory would provide a slight delay on spreading as asymptomatic spread is much lower. Astrazeneca holds it's own for severe infections &amp; death which is what really matters. 


&gt; The UK and Israel's experience 

But the biggest reason bar none is population density. Americans outside major cities will have fewer encounters with covid on a daily basis. The major cities have high uptake as they tend to lean ""liberal"" &amp; vaccination is slightly political. If you have never 
 

&gt;  Was the US that far ahead of the UK... Thoughts?

Yes in some states, no in others. All adults had a right to get the jabs back in April or May 1st at the latest. But absolutely for age brackets as all 12+ have had a right to be vacinated since May 26th. With less age based demograpgic vulnerability things slowed as people tend to group by age groups in social settings. 


Disclosure I am an American that has lived in the UK for the past 10+ years.


ONS data on symptomatic infections.

&gt; Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic cases with the Delta variant is estimated to be 88% after both doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 67% after both doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.

Imagine you had 100 blue sweets and 10 red sweets. You then eat 1 blue sweet and 1 red sweet. The percentage of consumed blue sweets is 1% (1/100), while the percentage of comsumed red sweets is 10% (1/10). But then if someone looked at just the consumed sweets (2 sweets in total), then 50% of the consumed sweets are red and 50% are blue.

So this is what's happening here with the percentages. The 'consumed sweets' are the hospitalisations and it looks like a lot of people who are vaccinated are hospitalised especially in the context of unvaccinated people. **However,** almost 90% of the population have received at least 1 dose (\~70% have received both doses), while only \~10% are unvaccinated. In other words, the population of vaccinated individuals (blue sweets) is a lot greater than the unvaccinated (red sweets). So you can see that the percentage of hospitilations amongst those who are vaccinated is a lot small than the unvaccinated, hence why this '40%' figure on its own is meaningless and does not really provide much context to how effective vaccines are.

Hope this clears things up a bit for you; let me know if you want me to go through anything if it didn't quite make sense to you.",,,,1626769719,{},h5uqlvz,False,t3_onmxmq,False,False,t1_h5tllbg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/onmxmq/60_of_people_being_admitted_to_uk_hospitals_are/h5uqlvz/,1626926826,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Delta seems to have a R0 of at least 5, possibly 8.  A very rough calculation for herd immunity is 1/R0  - so sterilising immunity in 80% of the population (possibly higher), whether acquired by vaccination or infection.

At the moment in Scotland we have 10% unvaccinated adults, a further 17% unvaccinated children and 18% single dose.  Single dose is about 30% effective in preventing illness, two doses 80%.  Those numbers will improve of course, and a fair proportion of the unvaccinated will be immune from already having had Covid.

So we're still going to see a spike as the numbers of people susceptible to infection is well below 1/R0, but given we do seem to be doing better we've a fair chance of better mitigation than England.  I still expect shite hitting fan numbers, but not the absolute disaster that's stalking the English.

Of course because vaccines work and the infection profile will be younger this isn't going to be like the last couple of times, but I still think 20,000 UK dead as a consequence and an awful lot of young people debilitated from post viral syndrome.

Your dad is exactly as safe as we expected he would be when the vaccine programme was rolled out - his risk of death and hospitalisation has not been completely eliminated but has been reduced drastically.

\--

Some quick back of an envelope calculations involving a hypothetical disease:

You invent a vaccine that is 90% effective at preventing death (pretty bloody good efficacy) and persuade 90% of people to take it (ruddy good uptake too).

What proportion of people dying would you expect to have been vaccinated?

Well for every 100 people who would have died in a pre-vaccination wave:

- 10 weren't vaccinated and still die

- 9 of the remaining 90 die

- 81 survive.

So deaths decline 81%, and almost half of those who die are vaccinated people (9/19).

Speaking to her tomorrow. 

She said it was a inflammatory response possibly  due to me previously having covid in Nov 2020 but it's hard to say 

I had my first dose on May 28th and I'm getting my 2nd July 23th 

I've seen people experience a big first reaction and then not much on their 2nd almost the opposite of what most people experience.

My mom had reactions to both the 2nd was worse bit she only had symptoms for 2 days.

  (She had basically asymptomatic covid only lost smell and taste for 2 days that's it) and she may have waited to long to get her 2nd here because there wasn't  doses to go around and they recommended to wait 4 months at the time.

Here it's still 8 weeks but it's I got a text saying I can book for it at 7 weeks.  

My girlfriend had just a sore arm her first dose (also had covid)

The only people in my immediate family not getting it are my dad (believes that his previous infection is good enough)

And younger brother who never caught it when he all had it is hesitant abd doesn't trust it. So he's not anti vax but he thinks his immune system will be fine to fight it despite having an autoimmune condition and recently going on a immuno suppressant drug.

PARIS, July 18 (Reuters) - France reported more than 12,500 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, the third day that the tally has held above 10,000, as the quick spread of the more contagious Delta variant of COVID-19 led to a jump in new infections.

The health ministry, however, said that the 12,532 new cases reported on Sunday, which took the total to 5.87 million, included data not published the day before.

""The daily figure published today (+12,532) should therefore not be interpreted as an exceptional increase in the number of daily cases, in a context nonetheless of strong dynamics in the evolution of the number of cases,"" it said in a note posted on its website.

The ministry had reported 10,949 cases on Saturday and 10,908 on Friday.

France also reported 891 people in intensive care units with the new coronavirus on Sunday, up one from the previous day, while the total number of deaths in hospitals rose by five to 111,472.",,,,1626786327,{},h5vcmxi,False,t3_onz2hl,False,False,t3_onz2hl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/onz2hl/france_reports_over_10000_new_coronavirus_cases/h5vcmxi/,1626938774,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Yep, there are many ways that the virus can mutate in many directions.

In March to May 2021, parents reported symptoms of their children occurring since October 2020 and lasting for at least 4 weeks, as well as whether the symptoms persisted for more than 12 weeks. The questionnaire contained a list of predefined symptoms and a free-text field.

&gt;Between October and November 2020 and March and April 2021, 4 of 109 seropositive children (4%) vs 28 of 1246 seronegative ones (2%) reported at least 1 symptom lasting beyond 12 weeks (see Table for all symptoms lasting beyond 4 and 12 weeks). The most frequently reported symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks among seropositive children were tiredness (3/109, 3%), difficulty concentrating (2/109, 2%), and increased need for sleep (2/109, 2%). None of the seropositive children reported hospitalization after October 2020. Similar proportions of seropositive and seronegative children reported excellent or good health.

&gt; What the threshold for getting rid of it is. People won't comply unless there's a very specific end goal.

I agree 100%, and if I were a politician and in charge of something I'd set a target to get a certain percentage of the population vaccinated, or see case numbers drop to a certain level and tie ""reopening"" to that.  However, pretty much everywhere has been either open the entire pandemic or reopened long ago, so that wouldn't work now.  As a result, I think there should be a clear threshold based on case numbers for any sort of lockdown or mandated preventative measures.

On Monday, US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra signed a renewal of the determination that a “public health emergency” exists due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  
The determination was last renewed in April and was set to expire — as it is up for renewal every 90 days. This latest renewal is effective starting Tuesday and will continue for another 90 days.  
**A public health emergency declaration, which can last for the duration of the emergency or 90 days, allows for the emergency use authorization of vaccines, the access of certain funds to address the emergency, and the deployment of military trauma care providers, among other factors.**  
The White House had signaled for weeks that it planned to extend the public health emergency determination. In June, local health officials told CNN that the White House was expected to extend its declaration of a national public health emergency due to the pandemic.  
“They are committed to ensuring that the emergency order remains in place through the end of the year — even as they recognize that the current order is about to expire in July,” Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of City and County Health Officials, told CNN last month.  
“There are a lot of things tied to that public health emergency order, including it helps states and local jurisdictions with the pandemic response, but it can be impactful to other forms of assistance like Medicaid eligibility coverage provisions that were changed under the declaration of a public health emergency order,” Freeman said. “If an emergency order is lifted, some people could no longer be eligible for some of the health-related coverages that they had gotten under the emergency.”

The HCMC Covid-19 Resuscitation Hospital in Thu Duc City is treating more than 300 patients in its intensive care unit (ICU) just six days since it was established on the premises of the Oncology Hospital 2.

The hospital currently has 1,000 ICU beds and more than 530 medical workers.  
Since the number of critically ill patients has been rising steadily of late, doctors, nurses and their assistants are on their toes doing everything they can to save the patient.  
""There have been times when a patient just stops breathing and another patient needs to be intubated urgently, so all of us have to jump in,"" said doctor Tran Thanh Linh, deputy head of the hospital.

It is planned that more equipment and 400 ICU beds will be added to the hospital.  
To run at full capacity, the hospital will need 340 doctors and 1,200 nurses. The Ministry of Health will arrange human resources for the hospital.

A doctor helps a patient struggling to breathe.

Medical staff working in shifts ensure that patients are closely watched round the clock.  
""There have been cases when the patients are already been too critical when arriving at the hospital, and there was no way we could save them. Though this hurts us very badly, we need to get over it soon because we know there are still many others that need to be saved,"" a 25-year-old nurse said.

Chung, a nurse who has his name written on the protective gown, studies the equipments that constantly track a patient’s status in the ICU.

Chung helps a patient who has just escaped death drink some water.

A nurse takes a rest but is still monitoring patients, watching equipment that track their vital signs.

Aside from operating various equipment and giving medicines to patients, ICU nurses also have to take care of the patients’ personal hygiene and feed them.

""We have to carefully keep close track of all the indicators in order to alert doctors immediately if there is anything abnormal. Patients are on constant dialysis so their heart rate and blood pressure can change easily,"" said Phuong, another ICU nurse.

Doctor Linh checks a patient in order to decide the course of action if the situation gets worse or better.

Linh is among the team that saved the British pilot tagged ""Patient 91"" during the first coronavirus wave in Vietnam last year. He has just returned from the northern province of Bac Giang, the epicenter at the beginning of the ongoing wave before HCMC took over that mantle.

""The pressure was high back there \[Bac Giang\] but it is nothing compared to what is happening now in HCMC.""

Linh explained that Bac Giang had around 5,000 Covid-19 patients in total when reaching its peak, and in most cases, they were workers in industrial parks, who were healthy and did not have many major health issues.

HCMC, meanwhile, has reported more than 37,000 cases and more are expected in the coming days. Many of the patients are elderly people with other chronic illnesses.

Nurses keep daily records of each patient’s condition.

Doctor Huynh Quang Dai said he and other medics in the ICU have been kept so busy with the high number of patients that he could not even recall how many days he had spent at the hospital.

  
""Every medic here is on a race as the number of patients has risen very fast. We cannot even tell how many hours we are able to actually sleep every night.""

An ambulance at the gate to the hospital. Doctor Le Anh Tuan, deputy director of the Oncology Hospital 2, who now occupies the same position at the HCMC Covid-19 Resuscitation Hospital, said a part of the hospital was still operating normally to treat cancer patients. The two areas are completely separate from each other, and it is guaranteed that neither will have an impact on the other.

It sucks I was offered a skating sponsorship but didn’t live close to competitions or parks to be able to be a brand rep. But that was a life choice, partly mine, partly the product of my environment, but I don’t think it’s unfair I didn’t get to do those things. We all have sob stories is the point I’m making. It’s unfortunate for her, but not unfair. It’s the definition of fair. 

We live in a bubble here in America, where we are used to being able to to whatever we want and complain enough to get our way, or at least people to side with us. She is dealing with adult competition in the international world. Her being a child does not matter as far as competition is concerned. Yelling “child” at me saying she should get special treatment makes me want to have an 18+ on the olympics. If you want to play in the big leagues, you have to play by their rules.

Israel is such an extreme outlier in all vaccine efficacy studies that I'm starting to think there is some kind of major structural flaw in their research. I could understand *some* reduction in efficacy, but this is way more than what I'd realistically expect.

And now we have Israel telling us that Pfizer is a completely shit vaccine that barely lasts 4 months, which is less than a normal flu vaccine (and flu mutates far more and far more quickly than covid).

SARS-CoV-2 is the virus. Covid-19 is the disease, the collection of symptoms.  Just like HIV is the virus, and AIDS is the disease. 

""The Coronavirus"" clearly refers to SARS-CoV-2. ""The Covid-19 Virus"" is incorrect. 

""Covid variants"" aren't a thing. There's no variant of the disease, but there are variants of the virus.  It should be ""SARS-CoV-2 variants"".

It's a ""Covid-19 vaccine"", OR a ""SARS-CoV-2 vaccine"", Google gives about the same number of results for both, and reputable organizations use both. It could be argued both ways, but most (right?) other vaccines are named for the disease rather than the virus. I prefer ""Covid vaccine"". 

""The Pfizer"", ""The J&amp;J"", etc., bother me, but ""The Pfizer vaccine"" doesn't.  Just ""Pfizer"" or ""Moderna"" alone is pretty clear. 

And while we're on that topic, it's ""Pfizer"", not any of the following: Pfyzer, Phizer, Pfiser, or Phiser. I've seen all four used in these threads.

The news was a national humiliation and raised questions about the country's standing in medical research.

Sanofi went back to the drawing board, however, and created a reworked vaccine, Vidprevtyn. The candidate is a recombinant protein based vaccine — similar to the technology used by Novavax — that uses an adjuvant from GlaxoSmithKline to boost people's immune response.

The EMA has now begun a rolling review, which allows regulators to assess data as it comes in. Its assessment is based on promising lab studies and early human trials that ""suggest that the vaccine triggers the production of antibodies"" that target the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 ""may help protect against the disease.""

Sanofi, in partnership with GSK, began Phase 3 human trials of its vaccine at the end of May. At the time, the companies predicted the vaccine could be approved by regulators in the fourth quarter of 2021.

The EMA, however, wouldn't provide a timeline today for when it could make a decision. The company will still have to submit a formal conditional marketing authorization application.

Studies out of Israel are showing that while cases are rising among vaccinated folks they are limited and generally don't result in hospitalization. So while case load goes up morbidity remains somewhat constant. One thing that I did find surprising is that prior infection seems to protect better than the vaccine in their initial non-peer reviewed study. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think we need to stop focusing on ""number of cases"" and instead focus on number of hospitalizations and death. All along they told us there would be breakthrough cases so why are we shocked and continuing to scare people? 

This is an utter shit show in the precedent that it sets - whats next? When flu picks back up are we going to shut down when case numbers get high? I thought the whole point of the vaccine was move forward not zig zag. 

Im ranting here. I look at India - it looks like the Delta causes lots of death when it runs through an unvaccinated population living in close quarters but it also appears to hit a peak a couple of weeks after initial infections as it burns through so my though is that UK/US/all these other vaxed nations will see a rise in the next 3-4 weeks and then it will come crashing down.

Let's put these positive case numbers in the context of the vaccines.  You made an assumption in your reply to me, that most people were vaccinated.  I'm guessing you made that assumption based on the news that we hit 90% of folks getting their 1st dose.  Ok, well let's look at the data and see who has had their vaccines.  At the top go to the vaccinations tab.  You will see at the top that 89.3% of people have had 1 dose, but only 67.3% have had 2 doses.  Further down on the page you can see the % coverage by age group for all of Scotland.  Look at the categories below 50 years of age.  We know from the info above you MSUT have both does of the vaccines to have any real chance at not getting sick.  The age groups below 50 are lagging in their 2nd doses (because we started at the oldest and worked our way down).   Specifically, we can add up the % of people still needing their first dose and those still needing their second dose from the age groups we know are testing positive, but you can pretty clearly see these people are not vaccinated yet, and definitely not fully vaccinated yet.    
What does this tell us?   Well we can make some educated guesses here.  We know people 25-44 are testing positive the most.  I'd say, that this is likely because they are not vaccinated at all , or not fully vaccinated.  We can also see that the 45-64 age group which also has high positive testing rates is largely fully vaccinated.  Based on what we know about the delta variant I believe that these are likely the breakthrough infections we are seeing which we know the Delta variant is capable of.    
Why are these age groups testing positive more?  Well it's not a stretch to wonder when you look at the news, pubs, and football matches, but this is speculation none the less  The younger people are more likely to be out partying and enjoying life out of lockdown.  They are also travelling more as are the 45-64s for summer holidays etc...  These 2 groups are having more social interactions and more travel thus putting them at higher risk when they are less protected in the context of a more difficult variant to control.    
Ok so what?  We know vaccinated people can still spread the virus.  We know every time someone spreads it we increase the chances of a mutation that will overcome the vaccines and our treatments or even continue to become more infective and pathogenic.  Not good.    
My understanding and previous looks at UK as a whole data are very similar to Scotland, but England and NI are behind Scotland even further in these problematic age groups.  This is why the entire world is furious with the UK, specifically Boris, with the whole Freedom bullshit.  All we had to do was wait for the grand opening a few more weeks and we could have ensured all the sacrifices we all made would have been protected.  It's a pretty big gamble to make with people's lives.    
Additionally, because of break through infections we will still continue to have deaths from Covid.  I'm sorry, but I disagree with the notion that we have to accept some deaths.   I didn't stay locked up and alone for the last year just to see a bunch of fucking people die.   You will note in the trends and demographic tab that the deaths are still largely in older people.  This is really sad, especially for the people dying in the younger age groups who are so close to getting vaccinated.   
   
Can the hospitals still get overwhelmed?  Yes.  There are 23 Intensive Care Units and 41 High Dependency Units in Scotland. 173 ICU beds total before pandemic, now with an additional 585 ventilators (this does not mean, room, staff, or oxygen supply)   We exceeded baseline capacity in March and April.   There were 47 covid patients in Scotland yesterday and 159 in hospital.  If the virus mutates again in a similar way to the Delta variant here or anywhere else in the world we could see that number go sky high again.  It is unlikely if we continue to with aggressive vaccinations and some restrictions, particularly travel in place.

Hi, I'll do my best to answer your questions or point to you the information.  I'm based in Scotland and am more familiar with the data here, but I will answer as best I can.  Please remember some of these papers are in preprint.  That means they have not passed the peer review process completely.  The ones I am posting here having findings which are generally supported by other scientific knowledge which has been peer reviewed so I feel they aren't a stretch and are relatively safe to consider. Why are we having 50-60k infections in the UK per day?

The current variant most prevalent in UK infections is the Delta variant.  This variant has mutations that make it significantly easier to spread, even when wearing masks.  It has a much higher affinity for our cell receptors and can bind much more easily and replicate itself quickly.  This means a smaller exposure necessary to catch it and a higher viral loads in sick people which means they can get sicker and are also more likely to pass it on (larger viral load = more chances to spread to another person) Here is a scientific paper that discusses the mutations.  It is in preprint which means it has not yet finished the peer review process.  It also looked at the virus in lab animals not humans, however it still applies and gives us an idea of what it will be in human testing.  It also supports what we already know and see with the Delta variant.

See:  SARS-CoV-2 spike P681R mutation, a hallmark of the Delta variant, enhances viral fusogenicity and pathogenicity | bioRxiv  [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.17.448820v2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.17.448820v2)

So we have the virus which is now easier to catch and replicates itself more. Other studies also indicate it has the ability to evade our immunity (from vaccines or being ill).

See:  Mutation-induced Changes in the Receptor-binding Interface of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant B.1.617.2 and Implications for Immune Evasion | bioRxiv

[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.17.452576v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.17.452576v1)

Great, well here we are with a variant that is easier to catch, replicates itself more, makes people more sick, and can also evade you immune system more effectively.  Now lets look at in the current context.  Strict lockdown measures ensuring social distancing with masks have all but disappeared.  In England they are not even requiring masks on the trains and other places where you are literally enclosed in a tight space with others.  Sporting events with mass people all enclosed in tight spaces are already happening too.  Even outdoors if you put enough people close together they can catch it.  Especially when singing and shouting.  This preprint article suggests that singing and shouting cause more virons to be emitted and thus be passed on.

See:  Viral Load of SARS-CoV-2 in Respiratory Aerosols Emitted by COVID-19 Patients while Breathing, Talking, and Singing | medRxiv

[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.15.21260561v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.15.21260561v1)

Oh man.  That's not good.  So we have a virus that is easier to catch and all the rest PLUS we are making it easier for the virus (which was already evading social distancing and masking measures) to infect others but relaxing all the protections. What's even worse is that people can pass the virus quite easily without ever having symptoms, or having non-descript symptoms. This sequence of events is a major part of why there are so many cases.   To put it mildly, we've put the cart before the horse by relaxing the restrictions without 100% or close vaccinated rate.

But there's more.... The Delta variant can escape natural immunity as well as vaccine induced immunity.  There are numerous reports from all over the world supporting this as does the paper listed above.  As matter of fact, someone I know got it and she's double vaccinated.  Not only can you get it when you're vaccinated, you can spread it too.  (see info posted in original comment)  The vaccine is not protection from the virus/spreading it.  It is protection from dying.

&amp;#x200B;

It is difficult to give the nice sweeping round rosy numbers everyone wants for vaccine effectiveness.  It is very nuanced and highly dependent on your definitions of illness, etc... According to the UK gov vaccine surveillance document

[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/1002580/Vaccine\_surveillance\_report\_-\_week\_28.pdf](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1002580/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week_28.pdf)

On page 6:  Against the alpha variant (not as infective or pathogenic as the current delta) we had pretty high confidence the AZ vaccine protected you from symptomatic illness 55-70% of the time with a single dose.  Well the Delta variant has turned that on it's head for the reasons above.  Now on page 7 we see the new figures starting to come together for the Delta.  There is a 14% absolute reduction in vaccine effectiveness with 1 dose.  That means that now 1 dose of the AZ vaccine will only protect you from symptomatic illness less than half the time to about half the time!  That's largely below the threshold to consider it a therapeutic drug. However, the absolute risk is only 10% less after dose number

&amp;#x200B;

This means that 2 doses offers significantly better protection against symptomatic illness with the Delta.  Our effectiveness only drops from 55-70% down to about 40-60%.  The issue is those are rookie numbers against a disease that is getting easier to transmit and making people sicker!   Pfizer is slightly better according to the numbers in their report though.  Remember though, this was for symptomatic infection.  We are still doing pretty well with hospitalizations and deaths.

COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report - week 28 (publishing.service.gov.uk)I believe the combination of these factors is what is causing the high case load, but we need to address your other questions to answer that as well.  We need to understand who is testing positive, who is getting sick, and who is vaccinated with doses 1 and 2.

The current testing figures for Scotland are:   COVID-19 Daily Dashboard | Tableau Public  [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/phs.covid.19/viz/COVID-19DailyDashboard\_15960160643010/Overview](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/phs.covid.19/viz/COVID-19DailyDashboard_15960160643010/Overview)

&amp;#x200B;

Under trends and demographics you can see the following:  For the week of 12 July- on the right hand chart with the bars going out lists cases by sex and age group.  You can clearly see that the vast majority of positive cases are in the 25 to 44 year old group.  Males and Females are close, but there are slightly more males than females.  The next highest group on the list is 45 to 64 with males and females nearly even.  If you switch the drop down menu to view negative cases reported you can see these 2 age groups are also the highest reporting negative tests.  So that tells us the answer to your question, who is getting tested?  Both 25-44 and 45-64 have the highest 2 group rates of testing in both negative test results and positive test results.

I think that's only possible if being less deadly provides a big enough competitive advantage to the spread of the virus.

They very much considered it an enemy of the nation and got everybody on board with stamping it out completely.

Meanwhile over here, we debated for weeks and months on when and how long we should have restrictions or lockdown while it continued to spread, only enacting our highest levels of lockdown (still weaker than China's) when our medical systems were about to collapse.

Perhaps you don't quite understand the difference between China's lockdowns and ours. They even put suspected infected people and their close contacts into monitoring centers rather than letting them roam free and continue the chain of infections. They didn't take any chances with containment, so it was under control within weeks and stamped out completely in like 2 months.

From what I saw, even their airport staff were better equipped with PPE than our medical staff here. You can even look at recent vaccination drives, their personnel are fully equipped with PPE suits while the staff at my vaccination location only had surgical masks on.

Nowadays whenever they detect a local transmission, they do mass testing at levels that are the envy of everyone else. Literally tens of millions of tests within days.

Efficacy is a ratio between vaccinated and unvaccinated. It is NOT a ratio of hospitalizations to total cases for vaccinated people.

Since then I’ve gone on a couple trips (Including during when the CDC mask mandate was lifted, which was wild) and have another one planned for September. Even though I’m vaccinated I’m flying and will and do comply with those mask mandates.

I guess I’ve just mentally prepared myself fairly early on that COVID will be endemic and the consequences that come with that.

You don’t know. At some point, you understand the science enough (or have enough faith in those that understand it better than you do) to know that after you are fully vaccinated, you are as safe as you’re going to get. Yes, there are breakthrough infections, but generally speaking IF you get one and IF you end up symptomatic, you will be fine. Odds of both those things happening are greatly reduced even if you encounter the Delta variant.

If you are immunocompromised, living with an immune compromised person, living with someone who cannot get vaxxed (children)—your risk calculation will differ. But assuming you are reasonably healthy with no comorbidities and are under age 65, two weeks after your second vaccination, you can resume normal activities unless public health authorities in your area say otherwise. Trying to get tested before every social occasion is a waste of time and tests, unless someone in the social group is unvaccinated due to medical issues/age.

If you are still nervous, wear a mask. It simply adds another layer of protection.",,,,1626736817,{},h5t8o1a,False,t3_on8udx,False,False,t1_h5t5xod,/r/Coronavirus/comments/on8udx/daily_discussion_thread_july_19_2021/h5t8o1a/,1626894733,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

&gt;Dr. Natasha Altman, a cardiologist at UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, agreed that it may be too soon to understand the vaccines' effects on long-term Covid-19 symptoms.

&gt;""I think the trends are going to only really going to start bearing out in the next six months,"" she said.

&gt;But because the vaccines have been proven to dramatically cut the risk of Covid-19 infection in general, the shots remain ""one of the best ways to lower your risk of getting post-Covid syndrome,"" Vanichkachorn said.

We have new children of all ages joining all the time, and if they’re new to preschool it’s understandable that they’re not used to wearing a mask yet. So we work with the kids, and like another commenter mentioned - sometimes when it comes from a teacher, the kid reacts differently. Plus peer pressure from seeing the other kids wear masks might help! 

In the meantime, if your kiddo is going out with you, maybe you can practice wearing a mask then? Or if you’re getting him ready to the idea of attending preschool maybe throw in a “and we have to wear our masks when we go to school” and have him try putting on and wearing a mask.

The problem is some what circular hospitalizations are up because of uncontrolled spread. AZ does some what less for controlling the spread compared to MRNA.

The abysmal vaccination rates here in general are absolutely due to entitlement, including a sense of being entitled to yell your opinion just as loud as actual facts with no regard for the fallout. Also why Karen’s were throwing tantrums and protesting in the streets because they couldn’t get their nails done, while people were dying all around them.  But the result of these loud people is also a lot of others that don’t know they are getting wrong info, don’t know their news sources are bullshit propaganda, don’t realize they are in an echo chamber, make decisions for themselves that are based off this nonsense thinking it’s an informed decision. So yes I blame Alex Jones and such for our situation a lot more than I blame somebody’s grandma who would never knowingly hurt a fly and has lived a life where the news is where you get trustworthy info and her news says everybody else is lying and you are going to die if you believe them.

The way it worked at one of the mega vaccination sites in Amsterdam:

1. Person at the door checks that you're wearing a mask, asks you if you have all the right paperwork and an appointment. Directs you into a queue.
2. After a brief wait, you go to a desk where they check that you have your ID and health questionnaire in order and you have an appointment for that day.
3. You're directed into a different queue based on which vaccine you're getting, or if you have a medical indication.
4. At the head of that queue, a staffer directs you to one of about a dozen open desks.
5. The person at this final desk takes your BSN (social security number) and looks you up in the computer. They check your id and confirm your name and date of birth. They review your health questionnaire. If everything is good, they print your vaccination card, stamp your yellow book if you have one, and mark you in the computer has having been vaccinated. Then they direct you to the injection area.
6. You walk up to the first open injection booth and hand your vaccination card to the nurse. They ask you again to confirm your name and date of birth, then give you the injection.
7. You go to an area with a bunch of chairs set up and wait 15 minutes to make sure you don't have an allergic reaction, then you can leave.

If they didn't give the vaccination card until after the injection, then they'd need another queue and another whole other row of staffed desks (or they could do considerably fewer vaccinations per day with the same staff level).

In this configuration, at the first desk, they'd check your id and your eligibility for the vaccine. Then you'd get the vaccine. Then you'd go to the second desk, and they'd have to put your info into the computer again to print your card and register your vaccination. Meanwhile, they'd have to police the new queue to make sure that no one slipped out of it after getting a vaccine but before getting it registered in the computer.

If there were a large number of people who were trying to get vaccine proof without getting the vaccine, it might make sense to use the before-and-after system of checks (in computer science, we call this a ""two-phase commit""). But with this being a pretty rare thing, it makes far more sense, logistically and economically, to just do it the way they've already set it up, keep an eye out for fraudsters, and cancel their vaccine registration after the fact.

Think about how Starbucks does things. They take your order, they start making your drink, and then you get in the queue to pay. When your drink is done, they call your name. What happens if you can't pay? They toss out your drink and you leave thirsty. Why not take payment first and then make your drink? Because it slows things down, and almost no one orders something and then can't/won't pay for it.",,,,1626798143,{},h5w31sd,False,t3_oo2sxl,False,True,t1_h5vmgvb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oo2sxl/netherlands_people_trying_to_sneak_out_of/h5w31sd/,1626952560,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

[They work really darn well](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lsuhzw/singledose_bnt162b2_vaccine_protects_against/), and are really darn [safe](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kcdn0b/natural_immunity_from_covid_is_not_safer_than_a/).

Check out this 
[great article about how unlikely it is for ""long term"" side effects from the vaccines to show up a few months or years later.](https://www.chop.edu/news/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine)

The J&amp;J vaccine manufacturing mixup that you heard about [isn't a problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/mhhf8x/johnson_johnson_statement_on_us_covid19_vaccine/) There are no tainted or flawed doses from J&amp;J being distributed, all our doses of J&amp;J came from a different manufacturer in the Netherlands and are both safe and effective.

Vaccines given EUA are safe even if you hear about [clotting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mh39g4/blood_clots_and_the_az_vaccine_revisited/) or [growing a third arm.](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/04/get-ready-for-false-side-effects)

That the vaccine manufacturers are not liable (you can't sue them, etc.) if you die from their Covid vaccine is a [logical error], that's [true of all vaccines, and really, most medical practices/drugs/etc.]  They just have to warn you about potential risks, [which they actually do a good job of, even though those risks are miniscule.]  Note that this would also be the case (you can't sue them if it hurts you) for any future ""cures"", therapeutics, or other treatments for the disease. 

The vaccine isn't killing anyone. You heard wrong.  Great discussion [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/oc45h0/scientists_quit_journal_board_protesting_grossly/) 

Clotting is so rare from the vaccine and so common from the virus, it's basically not worth talking about.

Should we be excited about a vaccine [that's not 90%+ effective?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lv3h8e/daily_discussion_thread_march_01_2021/gpbwgkf/) Excellent question! [Absolutely, yes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l7mzvn/daily_discussion_thread_january_29_2021/gl8iyj5?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3)  Video version of this discussion [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3odScka55A)

There’s no such thing as vaccine side effects that take [months or years before they start to show up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k96ng0/how_is_it_possible_to_create_a_safe_and_effective/gfldup9/) If there [is](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lxfna2/daily_discussion_thread_march_04_2021/gpoqzl6/) a side effect, [it usually shows up right away.](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2017/0615/p786.html)  Thousands of phase 2 trial participants have had the vaccine for over 12 months, and there are [no worrying, lingering, or delayed side effects.](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/covid-19-vaccine-myths-debunked)

Immunity from infection lasts [*at least 8 months*](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/koxkm1/sarscov2_infection_induces_longlived_bone_marrow/), though [probably a lot longer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/klpvp7/sarscov2specific_t_cell_memory_is_longlasting_in/)  Again, [*at least* 8 months,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ldj06f/immunological_memory_to_sarscov2_assessed_for_up/) though non-antibody immunity may be most important.  It's too soon to say ""lifelong"" but [that is a possibility.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4nkco/the_immune_system_mounts_a_lasting_defense_after/) 

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l9nfu8/stable_neutralizing_antibody_levels_six_months/) probably a lot,[ lot longer,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/)  probably many years. It's looking like it'll be permanent or [semi-permanent in a good portion](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m1xbz4/sarscov2_mrna_vaccines_induce_a_robust_germinal/) of the population.

Vaccine induced immunity may be [comparable to](https://www.verywellhealth.com/antibodies-from-vaccines-and-from-natural-infection-5092564), or [better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l5whhu/increased_resistance_of_sarscov2_variants_b1351/), or a [LOT better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m8m23c/neutralizing_antibodies_against_sarscov2_variants/), immunity from a previous infection. Especially to [Alpha/Beta.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgxpre/vaccineinduced_immunity_provides_more_robust/) Natual immunity from clearing an infection is highly protective of future infections, but you have to risk the disease in order to get it. 

The OG SARS virus (SARS-CoV-1) from 2003 gave detectable immunity [both 6](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/12/7264) and [12 years later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kvbz9y/weekly_question_thread/gizs32j/)   

Vaccination and previous infection [reduce viral load, which reduces spread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s). Updated info [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ocygyp/vast_majority_of_breakthrough_infections_in/)

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) article does a good job of explaining the likelihood of vaccines *at least* reducing spread.  [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lf744r/daily_discussion_thread_february_08_2021/gml0gyi/) may help too. Data from [Scotland](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m3tx1n/covid19_vaccine_linked_to_a_reduction_in/). 

[""Moderna vaccine blocks &gt;90% (87-93%) of infections &amp; 91% (89-94%) of transmission.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmqfk4q/)

 This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a great reduction in ability to spread the virus. [Maybe even with just one dose!](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242) You should [get both doses though.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m2mtnv/immune_response_to_sarscov2_variants_of_concern/)

Reinfections are rare, some studies show [less than 1 in 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kyj0bx/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/) (maybe in the 1 in 10,000 range, you'll have to read the study, it's awesome).  Reinfections tend to be much milder than previous infections, even those new variants. Check the [comments here](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lm0mc2/prior_covid19_significantly_reduces_the_risk_of/) for some really interesting discussion regarding reinfection. Especially the top comment thread.

[Delayed second doses are fine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/layx6g/single_dose_administration_and_the_influence_of/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) At least with [ChAdOx1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), though there is evidence from the mRNA vaccine trials that suggest that up to 6 weeks is better if not at least acceptable. The problem is that you have to wait longer for the second dose, and therefore, full protection. [CDC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbiqne/daily_discussion_thread_february_03_2021/glvp1nl?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) used to say that there is no maximum interval between doses, but has recently changed. [Pfizer says not more than 6 weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/liakcb/covid19_vaccine_doses_shouldnt_be_more_than_six/). 

[Dose intervals might increase efficacy if extended past 3 or 4 weeks,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/mudvjd/questin_about_vaccine_intervals/gv58byt/) CDC says you have up to 42 days between doses (but that may be extended at some point).

Did you accidentally get mixed doses? [All good.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html)

Even if your antibodies fade over time, [you still have immunity.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/npeymo/sarscov2specific_memory_b_cells_can_persist_in/)

[],,nortub,,,[],,,,text,t2_h4mz3,False,False,[],"NEW DELHI — India’s excess deaths during the coronavirus pandemic could be a staggering 10 times the official COVID-19 toll, likely making it modern India’s worst human tragedy, according to the most comprehensive research yet on the ravages of the virus in the South Asian country.  
  
Most experts believe India’s official toll of more than 414,000 dead is a vast undercount, but the government has dismissed those concerns as exaggerated and misleading.  
  
The report released Tuesday estimated excess deaths — the gap between those recorded and those that would have been expected — to be 3.4 million to 4.7 million since the pandemic began through last month. It said an accurate figure may “prove elusive,” but the true death toll “is likely to be an order of magnitude greater than the official count.”  
  
The report was published by Arvind Subramanian, the Indian government’s former chief economic adviser, and two other researchers at the Center for Global Development, a nonprofit think tank based in Washington, and Harvard University.  
  
It said the count could have missed deaths that occurred in overwhelmed hospitals or while health care was disrupted, particularly during the devastating virus surge earlier this year.  
  
“True deaths are likely to be in the several millions not hundreds of thousands, making this arguably India’s worst human tragedy since Partition and independence,” the report said.  
  
The Partition of the British-ruled Indian subcontinent into independent India and Pakistan in 1947 led to the killing of up to 1 million people as gangs of Hindus and Muslims slaughtered each other.  
  
The report on India’s virus toll used three calculation methods: data from the civil registration system that records births and deaths across seven states, blood tests showing the prevalence of the virus in India alongside global COVID-19 fatality rates, and an economic survey of nearly 900,000 people done three times a year.  
  
Researchers cautioned that each method had weaknesses, such as the economic survey omitting the causes of death.  
  
Instead, researchers looked at deaths from all causes and compared that data to mortality in previous years — a method widely considered an accurate metric.  
  
Researchers also cautioned that virus prevalence and COVID-19 deaths in the seven states they studied may not translate to all of India, since the virus could have spread more in urban versus rural states and since health care quality varies greatly around India.  
  
Other nations also are believed to have undercounted deaths in the pandemic. But India is thought to have a greater gap due to having the world’s second-highest population of 1.4 billion and because not all deaths were recorded even before the pandemic.  
  
The health ministry did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment on the report.  
  
Dr. Jacob John, who studies viruses at the Christian Medical College at Vellore in southern India and was not part of the research, reviewed the report for the AP and said it underscores the devastating impact COVID-19 had on the country’s underprepared health system.  
  
“This analysis reiterates the observations of other fearless investigative journalists that have highlighted the massive undercounting of deaths,” Jacob said.  
  
The report also estimated that nearly 2 million Indians died during the first surge in infections last year and said not “grasping the scale of the tragedy in real time” may have “bred collective complacency that led to the horrors” of the surge earlier this year.

[],,Andinator,,,[],,,,text,t2_5jmnw,False,False,[],"Well you have a few sound options in this case. The first is to have your kids mask up and send them to school.  Obviously this is a nerve wracking situation for you and I'm also not aware if they have any health issues or concerns that could make this truly risky.  According to the science though, even if your kids are around other kids that don't wear masks, and you're vaccinated yourself, you will all be fine. Again this is merely assuming your kids don't have any compromises to their immune system I'm not aware of.

Your second option is to find a cyberschool which I will absolutely not recommend. Your kids will not be getting the authentic education and social skills they will need through cyberschool and as someone that went through it for one year, the whole thing is an absolute joke.  Kids need to be in person with each other and the teacher to get a proper education and cyberschool just doesn't provide that.

Your third option is homeschooling them, which may or may not be feasible depending on your work situation. I would also not recommend this since they miss out on actively engaging with other students and building up friendships, but it would be better than cyberschool for sure.

Your fourth option would be to find a private school that mandates masks for all students. Again, not sure how equipped you would be for this kind of transition since private school can be very pricey, but if the first option is something you absolutely want to avoid, then this would be your best shot. 

Those are the choices you currently have. If it was up to me, I'd suggest going for the first option. I've been working in a hybrid school with mandates for a year now and I can tell you firsthand that no matter how much we tell the students to socially distance, how much we recommend wearing masks, exposures will happen. As far as I know, any exposure that has happened has either been a fluke or the student returned to school healthy and fine. No matter what kind of school you send them to an exposure will take place and sending them to a cyberschool will just rob them of the education they need to grow.

My personal advice? Calm down, breathe, and accept that things will be alright. If you didn't get vaccinated, please do so as that would help a lot. Your kids will be fine, even if they end up with students that don't wear masks. Transmission rates among children are very low and we're at a point where school can start up again freely and safely.

Our work also shows that the post COVID19 memory response can be boosted by two doses of BNT162b2, and that a 3-dose instead of a 2-dose strategy may be relevant among the COVID-19 naive older population.`

It also compared ""COVID Recovered"" immunity vs vaccine, and found COVID likely gives better immunity than the vaccine.

&gt;At a briefing today, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, warned that variants are winning the race against vaccines, due to inequitable vaccine distribution—factors that threaten global economic recovery.

&gt;Some countries with high vaccination coverage are planning the rollout of booster vaccine doses and dropping public health measures, as if the pandemic is over, he said. However, he notes that sharp spikes in cases and hospitalizations in other parts of the world is leading to oxygen and treatment shortages and is driving deaths higher in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

i havent gone out or met with friends anyway for the past 16 months because i was scared and i only got my second shot today, but i would like to do so again and try to stay as safe as possible. now what to do? the news i read say delta is even infectious enough to infect someone outdoors with only a slight social contact.

I’m not saying I’m an expert. I’m just pointing out that overall age and health does make a difference regarding mitigating factors. An otherwise healthy, young individual is more likely to have a longer life span, because they’re less likely to die die to other reasons. Many recipients do die due to infections and even other organ failures. But the ultimate life expectancy down to the lungs themselves. Which is also dependent on the donor lungs too.

Only ~80% percent of people even survive a year after transplant. But 32% of patients make it 10 years. The current median survival rate is [5.8 years.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5594127/)

My point was not to say he will assuredly survive for the next 20 years, just that assuming he’s in otherwise good health he’s unlikely to die from other issues and has a better chance at survival than some. Instead, it’s up to a combination of his health going forward and the donor lungs themselves. Given his age, he was likely matched with a younger donor, if available, which does affect his chances. 

His new lungs may still give out tomorrow. Or in six months. Maybe he’ll make it a couple of years. But he absolutely may make it 10 years or more too, and the longer he lives, the more likely his life expectancy will continue to improve. 10 years is a long time when it comes to medical advancements.",,,,1626735381,{},h5t5p4u,False,t3_ongw8v,False,True,t1_h5t2tui,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ongw8v/24yearold_didnt_get_vaccinated_for_covid19_then/h5t5p4u/,1626892883,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Well, no, we aren't.  We're arguing that people turn a blind eye to it while railing against cruises.

And, then you proceeded to double and triple down on that.  Like, I still can't get over that initial comparison where you said this:

&gt;Cruise ships are massive hotels that are constantly polluting for weeks/months on end 24/7 while aircraft polute for hours at a time and then people go on to their destinations with Normal housing/activities

Like, it's just hilarious.  A single flight with months and months of cruises and you thought: ""Yeah, that's a good comparison.""



&gt;People aren't going to stop travelling, but if we can reduce the damage we should.

Which would involve having people not travel by air.  Something you have admitted to doing.  Something I am willing to bet large sums of money you're doing little to curb and are probably only going to increase as you get older and your income grows.

&gt;Air travel still is bad for the environment but its far better then the c02 released by cruise ships just for propulsion

Oh, you've shown me links regarding how much energy cruise ships emit ""just for propulsion?""  Yeah, don't think you've shown me those.  If you did, I missed the analysis where they eliminated the portion used for HVAC in the interior spaces, the energy used for lights, the energy used for cooking food, etc. etc.  Sure, this is a pretty cheeky complaint, but I think it just shows how intellectually dishonest you are (or, worse, you just didn't think about it) with your carbon comparison.

Your links ignored the thing you told me in your very first reply: ""Cruise ships are massive hotels.""

I don't think either of us have the time nor the inclination to do a full analysis comparing the carbon emissions between the two accounting for all sorts of things including that a cruise ship doesn't just have passengers, it also houses crew, but at the end of the day, they're both big carbon emitters and if one wants to dime out cruise ships for their pollution, they really should be avoiding flights as well. 

Bottom line: Don't be a hypocrite and stop flying as well.

It's still taking time for other countries around the world to get vaccinated. And I think there could very well be one more cycle through the fall and winter.

The cycle through fall/winter might not be bad or happen, but I think the surveillance during this period will be one important to watch and remain a little concerned with.

The cycle through the fall and winter will probably take place with children going back to school, also the possibility the colder weather combined with more children getting infected could lead to some spikes. Also the possibility of the double whammy of Flu and Covid variant, though this never happened last year flu infections were way down. Again just something to watch as respiratory illness are historically higher in fall/winter and things are supposed to be going back to normal.

Afterwards in the spring I think there should be enough immunity from vaccines and natural infection. Even with a newer variant, the vaccines seem effective and I think booster shots are possible and wouldn't be too hard to distribute.

Not that I think it will go away, but at some point with vaccines and natural immunity the cases, hospitalizations and deaths should be lower and remain lower.

All that being said I think the contraversy will remain for a while though as kids currently cannot get the vaccine and there is debate whether they need it if so many aren't effected that bad.

The diet thing is actually a really good analogy.  Beef is the cruise.  Lamb or farm raised prawns/shrimp would be the airline and you're telling me ""Well, you can't just get people to stop eating meat, so just make sure they aren't eating beef.""  So, yeah, much better options exist (even on the meat spectrum ignoring the vegan ""staycation"" parallel), but you've made this option a sacred cow that can't be touched or really even criticized without you jumping into defensive mode.

&gt;They aren't flying 24/7 while cruises are flying 24/7

I won't dime you out for telling me that cruises fly.  That's an honest mistake.  But now we're pretending they don't ever dock at port?  No, cruise ships are not moving 24/7.  They sit around at port while passengers have shore excursions or to load/unload people.

Like, come on, man, can you just try to be intellectually honest for a second?

&gt;They literally are comparing Emissions per KM traveled. And then they mention that all the other enviromental damage they do from scrubbing exhaust and dumping it into the ocean, the grey water, the incineration of all garbage and dumping it... so.. Maybe try reading it again.

You ever read an article about car fuel efficiency with the A/C turned on vs. off?  Yeah, they use identical language even though they definitely aren't talking about propulsion.  Like, at this point I'm really wondering where exactly do you think they get all the electricity to power everything that uses electricity on board.  The scrubbers, the incinerators, the sewage, all that stuff, that's not powering the lights and the A/C.  It's the same engines utilized for propulsion.  **If you only respond to one thing, respond to this:** Show me exactly in your articles where you think they are confirming that only propulsion is accounted for.  Because do you really think a blog that very obviously hates cruises and a quick blurp about cruises in a NYT article that is really more about air travel is going to go through the trouble to sort out the power used for electricty versus the power used for propulsion?  Of course not.  All they're doing here is taking total carbon emissions of a cruise and dividing it by miles travelled.  All the electricity used to make this thing be a hotel rather than just a means of transportation is included in the numerator here.  They aren't pulling out that number and just calculating energy for propulsion, they're discussing all carbon emissions here.

&gt;&gt;People aren't going to stop travelling, but if we can reduce the damage we should.

&gt;yah... and flying is far cleaner then taking a cruise.. Sorry .. but i can't drive to maui or anywhere outside of North America.. so.. Thanks for proving my point?

Did you just quote me quoting you and treat it like it was something I said? I don't even know what to say.

&gt;No.. .again... people will travel as a part of life. Choosing the most efficent is the best options and planes are those vs cruise ship and most option when you include the time it takes to travel those distance.

And once again, the blind eye/sacred cow thing rears it's head: ""Nah, we couldn't possibly travel by car to a beach in California or Florida, that would take like 2 days, we couldn't possibly take a little longer that would be the end of the world, we gotta fly.""",,,,1626786622,{},h5vd6ts,False,t3_omu9n2,False,True,t1_h5u49yw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/omu9n2/florida_court_sides_with_cdc_on_covid19_cruise/h5vd6ts/,1626939065,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

But I'm seeing something slightly worrying in those numbers.

&gt; The Bay Area is rapidly backpedaling on indoor masking, with most of the region’s counties now recommending that even vaccinated people don face coverings indoors because of concerns about the highly contagious delta coronavirus variant.

&gt; Most COVID-19 vaccines are proving very effective at protecting against severe illness and hospitalization from the delta variant, but breakthrough cases do occur — and some experts have said that the potential for lingering health problems known as “long COVID” gives them pause.

&gt; Bob Wachter, chair of the Department of Medicine at UCSF, said that while he is fully vaccinated, the possible risk of long COVID has led him to take stricter precautions again.

&gt; “I personally do factor the possibility of getting a mild case of COVID that leads to persistent symptoms ... into my own personal calculus that guides my behavior,” Wachter said in an email. “I still don’t want to get it, both because of this unknown risk of long COVID, as well as the small but non-zero risk that I could get a mild case and transmit it to a vulnerable person.”

&gt; Here's what we know about the delta variant and the risk of long COVID.

&gt; **What is long COVID?**

&gt; According to the CDC, the post-COVID conditions known collectively as post-acute sequelae SARS-CoV-2 infection, or PASC, are ongoing, returning or new health problems that occur more than four weeks after initial infection. These symptoms can occur in anyone who has had COVID-19. Patients report different combinations of a number of symptoms, which include difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, fatigue, brain fog, coughing, headache, and change in smell or taste.

&gt; **How many people have developed long COVID symptoms?**

&gt; The number of patients with long COVID is unclear, since most people who develop COVID-19 are not hospitalized and therefore not tracked by the CDC. An article published in Nature last month cited data from the U.K. Office of National Statistics, which tracked more than 20,000 individuals who tested positive since April 2020 and found that 13.7% had symptoms after at least 12 weeks. The agency defines long COVID as symptoms lasting more than four weeks.

&gt; **I’ve been fully vaccinated. What is my risk of developing long COVID if I get infected?**

&gt; The short answer is we do not know for certain yet. John Swartzberg, a UC Berkeley infectious disease expert, said no robust studies have been conducted so far to answer this question. Even anecdotal reports have been few.

&gt; However, Swartzberg said his conjecture is that long COVID will be unlikely in fully vaccinated people. “The vaccines considerably suppress viral replication in those individuals that have breakthrough infections,” he said in an email. “Our bodies will have less to contend with during the breakthrough infection and this should make long COVID less likely.”

&gt; He said more will be known in the next several months as COVID infections increase due to the delta variant.

&gt; Wachter also said some experts believe long COVID is unlikely to develop in fully vaccinated people because of limited viral replication, and added that long COVID clinics have not reported seeing many breakthrough cases. However, he said evidence to support this theory is still lacking.

&gt; **What happens to those who are infected with the delta variant, whether they are vaccinated or not?**

&gt; Studies so far suggest the delta variant is 50% more transmissible than the alpha variant, which was 50% more infectious than the original strain. But what about the severity of the variant?

&gt; “There is no compelling evidence that the delta variant makes people more ill,” Swartzberg said. “If you are fully vaccinated, it’s unlikely you will get ill if you get infected with the delta variant. If you do get ill, it is very likely going to be a mild disease. It is highly unlikely you will get sick enough to be hospitalized or die.”

&gt; He said nationally, unvaccinated people account for 97% of COVID hospitalizations, while in Los Angeles County, that number is 99%.

&gt; “The people who are getting long COVID are almost always those that are unvaccinated and get infected,” Swartzberg said.

&gt; Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease expert with UCSF, said according to data from the CDC, severe illness from breakthrough cases is rare, accounting for only about 0.002% of those cases.

&gt; “With adaptive immunity to fight the breakthrough in most vaccinated cases, we are hopeful long COVID will not occur,” she said.",,,,1626797592,{},h5w1pu7,True,t3_oo53tp,False,False,t3_oo53tp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oo53tp/if_youre_fully_vaccinated_whats_your_risk_of_long/h5w1pu7/,1626951838,21,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I think if public schools get on board and make it part of their existing vaccine requirements it'd also help a lot toward vaccination rates.  Unvaccinated parents would be more likely to get it alongside their kids. 

My 13 year old has her vaccine (2nd shot of Pfizer yesterday) and I'd feel a lot better if all her friends did as well.  Only one of her friends has his second dose too, but they've already scheduled their first post vaccine sleepover.
