Also, I want to point this out specifically:

&gt;the fact that they changed counting methods multiple times and revised the death toll doesn’t give me high hopes

Now I was around on this sub when this happened and I have been explaining this since that day, and people still don't seem to get it. Here we go again.

When the new mayor of Wuhan came on-board he saw that there were lots of suspected cases waiting in queue for PCR test, the policy at the time was that you need positive PCR test result to be a confirmed case to be hospitalised, and PCR test was the bottleneck at that time. Also at that time the doctors have already seen so many lung CT scans that they can almost 100% tell who has COVID-19 just by looking for the ""crushed glass"" foggy parts on the CT image. So being new on the job and wanting to get the bad news out of the way first to put the blame it on the previous guy, the new mayor allowed for about a week a new category of patients called ""clinically diagnosed"" to be admitted into hospital as if they are confirmed cases based on their CT image.

Many of those already have CT done so you first see a huge spike in reported cases, with gradual decrease as the CT image back log is worked through. After about a week a new PCR test lab called ""Fire Eyes"" that could run 10,000 PCR test a day came online and was able to both handle the new suspected cases that show up each day as well as begin to work through the PCR test back log, so the mayor then stopped allowing ""clinically diagnosed"" and went back to requiring positive PCR test result to count as a confirmed case.

A few more days pass and Fire Eyes have worked through all the PCR test back log, including the test results for the previously hospitalised ""clinically diagnosed"" patients, and it turned out a handful of them were false positive from CT image because they actually garden variety pneumonia, so then there was a day of correcting the records where these patients were removed from clinically diagnosed because they were false positive.

Then a few month pass and COVID-19 was dying down in Wuhan, so the medical staff went back to double check all the records to remove all the data issues like double counting patents from hospital transfer, or not being counted due to procedure corner cutting at the time of the outbreak and so on, and added a bunch of new cases to the case count retrospectively.

**In all examples above all such corrections actually increased the case count in Wuhan, not decrease.** So I fail to see how anyone can accuse the government of cooking the books to make themselves look better despite the fact that the change in number was the exact opposite.",,,1602404446,{},g8ge1wd,True,t3_j8bs6r,False,True,t1_g8gajly,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8bs6r/china_update_on_covid19_pandemic_situation_as_of/g8ge1wd/,1602409261,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

The Swedish Public Health agency is not responsible for the economy, they dont care about the economy. They are however responsible for public health in a broad sense, they can not only focus on the coronavirus. They thought it would cause more suffering to lockdown than to not lock down. For example the reason they didnt shut down schools are because lack of education will have serious consequences in the long run on both society and individual children. Increasing inequalities, child abuse, asocial behavior, decreased mental health, increased wealth gap etc.

This might have been the wrong decision but it was the reason, not to save the economy, because of some conspiracy, to reach heard immunity or some other insane reason. 

Regarding demonstrations, there was a blanket ban on all gatherings with more than 50 people but the police allowed all demonstrations that took place. Its complex but the police wont endorse the demos they however are not allowed to break up spontanious demos. There were several BLM protests for example.

Typically we look at GDP, the gross domestic product, the measure of all products and services bought and sold during a specific period. It’s really intended to measure the state an economy is in. 

That works ok’ish if you just compare two similar periods in time. It doesn’t work **at all** during these circumstances. 

What is happening right now, is governments taking on **huge amounts of debt** and distributing that to small and big companies that would otherwise go bust, to individuals that have lost their jobs and to other subsidies such as paid sick leave, cash payments to stimulate the economy etc. etc. Subsidies packages like we’ve never seen before. 

Taking on this debt can work for some time to help with a temporary downturn, but will eventually need to stop and **is not sustainable long term**. The debt also need to be repaid at some point in time. 

All GDP numbers are thus inflated by the huge debt numbers. It’s financial artificial breathing or subsidies CPR that we are seeing right now. Some countries are doing more of it. Some are doing less. 

So just saying that country X detracted with X% in Q2 2020 and comparing that with country Y, misses the whole debt and subsidy variable.

It makes no sense comparing without looking at debt created and the overall debt rate.

(In a double-blind study, doctors and patients don't know who is being given the treatment and who is being given a placebo; only the researchers know.) It's not such a good standard to observe and determine the progress of a disease and what complications and symptoms one will observe in those who have it and who have recovered from it.

For studies that do not deal with drugs but with the progression of an illness, the double-blind study does not work. For example, if we were trying to determine what someone with severe smallpox could experience after recovering from the illness, how could that be made double-blind placebo-based? For that to be a ""double-blind placebo-based study"" that you insist is the only proof you will accept, then the doctors and the patients would have to be unaware of who has smallpox. How would that be set up? How could you give the smallpox virus to people in such a way that neither doctors nor patients would know who has it? It's simply impossible. Yet we know with a great degree of certainty what happens to someone when they have smallpox. How do we know that? Because we observed patients and then collected and analyzed those observations.

An example of this is the factual knowledge that one common side effect of measles is an elimination and ""resetting"" of the body's antibody ""memory,"" making one susceptible to diseases that previously had immunity. No double-blind study ever determined this, nor could be used to determine this: it was determined by observing measles patients over the course of time.

The current studies following COVID-19 patients and collecting data seem to indicate mental, cardiac, and/or respiratory problems in a significant number of patients who, after once testing positive and having symptoms of the illness ranging from mild to serious, now test negative for the illness and positive for antibodies. 

I'm aware that Fauci considers drug studies that are not double-blind to be flawed in various ways from the gold standard, as would all scientists. But not every scientific medical study is a drug trial, and I believe that is what you are demanding: you are demanding that observations of illness be exclusively tied to double-blind drug studies, and no other observations can ever be used or considered valid. Have I summarized your position correctly?

Certainly, in the aggregate data for post-COVID-19 patients, the treatments used will provide invaluable data to help determine what will minimize adverse health conditions following recovery. But they can't be double-blind, as we would have to have patients who are healthy and patients who have COVID-19, and neither patient nor doctor could know who was which. This is plainly impossible, so other means of studying the data are used. 

We'll use the double-blind placebo-based randomized trials for drugs, but to observe what happens to patients with COVID-19, we must use measurements and observations to see how someone who had COVID-19 is now different from someone who has never had COVID-19.",,,1602378676,{},g8en8fk,False,t3_j8m9qg,False,True,t1_g8e2m4e,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8m9qg/former_nj_governor_chris_christie_released_from/g8en8fk/,1602385232,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

And I decided to look into your claim that he backtracked on his anti-mask views and thinks they are complementary. I could have sworn I kept seeing interviews from him denouncing them.

And sure enough there it is.

He also recommends reactive rather than proactive measures.

Also it trained me to get used to wearing it as I had to fly cross country recently (no issues).

Just wear a mask when you're indoor around people not in your pod, outdoors when you're close to strangers and wash your hands and you'll generally be OK.

Think of it this way:  Health care workers spend entire shifts around very sick people and as long as they have proper PPE and are careful they can avoid contracting it.  Furthermore healthcare workers consider an exposure to be when you are in close (under 6ft) contact for 15 minutes or more WITHOUT masks with someone who has the disease.   So for all intents and purposes if you can avoid any (preferably all) of those conditions you can ""relax"".

Do you genuinely think a mostly vaccinated population is going to wear masks and social distance until years from now when a 100% effective vaccine is available?

Fauci is an MD, he makes recommendations that are trying to get the best healthcare based effect but fail to consider the economic and social needs of the population. I’m not American só Im at liberty of having a population where vaccine uptake is pretty high and even 70% of people took a rushed vaccine for H1N1 (that had nowhere near the societal impact of COVID), but you have to have your head in the sand to not see that vaccinated people will not comply with those orders anymore. This isn’t medical science based anymore, this is social sciences and human psychology. You already have massive parts of the US and the EU where pandemic fatigue has brought on a second wave. Tell me how by next spring pandemic fatigue won’t be even more prevalent? Even Fauci knows social distancing won’t stand in a vaccinated population, the incentive just isn’t there anymore when COVID susceptibility is much lower than the current level of susceptibility. 

Im fortunate enough to work from home, and in a sector unaffected by the current economic crisis. But I still have a heart and concern for those who aren’t that fortunate, and understand that there’s an acceptable level of risk for engaging in normalcy again.

I went all the way down the rabbit hole and fell hard on my own sword, so if you want to hate me or blame me, that’s fine. I’m doing plenty of that myself. 

... 

I told myself it wouldn’t be that bad. “It’s the flu. It’s basically just the flu.” I didn’t have the horrible cough you keep hearing about. My breathing never got too terrible. My fever peaked for like one day at 100.5, which is nothing — barely worth mentioning. “All right. I got this. See? It was nothing.” But then some of the other symptoms started to get wild. I was sweating profusely. I would wake up in a pool of sweat. I had this tingling feeling all over my body, this radiating kind of pain. Do you remember those old space heaters that you’d plug in, and the red lines would light up and glow? I felt like that was happening inside my bones. I was burning from the inside out. I was buzzing. I was dizzy. I couldn’t even turn my head around to look at the TV. I felt like my eyeballs were in a fishbowl, just bopping around. I rubbed Icy Hot all over my head. It was nonstop headaches and sweating for probably about a week — and then it just went away. I got some of my energy back. I had a few really good days. I started working on projects around the house. I was thinking: “Okay. That’s it. Pretty bad, but not so terrible. I beat it. I managed it. Nothing worth shutting down the entire world over.” Then one day I was walking up the stairs, and all of the sudden, I couldn’t breathe. I screamed and fell flat on my face. I blacked out. I woke up a while later in the ER, and 10 doctors were standing around me in a circle. I was lying on the table after going through a CT scan. The doctors told me the virus had attacked my nervous system. They’d given me some medications that stopped me from having a massive stroke. They said I was minutes away.

I stayed in the hospital for three days, trying to get my mind around it. It was guilt, embarrassment, shame. I thought: “Okay. Maybe now I’ve paid for my mistake.” But it kept getting worse.

Six infections turned into nine. Nine went up to 14. It spread from one family member to the next, and it was like each person caught a different strain. My mother-in-law got it and never had any real symptoms. My father is 78, and he went to get checked out at the hospital, but for whatever reasons, he seemed to recover really fast. My father-in-law nearly died in his living room and then ended up in the same hospital as me on the exact same day. His mother was in the room right next to him because she was having trouble breathing. They were lying there on both sides of the wall, fighting the same virus, and neither of them ever knew the other one was there. She died after a few weeks.

Lockdowns are a measure to pause or break uncontrolled community spreading, in order to buy time to put in contact tracing processes, implementing mass testing and rapid turnarounds, fine tune isolation processes, prepare current healthcare infrastructure and build up treatment facilities, prepare dedicated quarantine centres, train up healthcare workers in disease prevention, secure PPE / build up PPE production etc.

They are not, according to the dumbfuckistanis here, for the sole purpose of ""buying time for vaccines"", eradicating the virus by thoughts and prayers or just put in for no reason. They are NOT a magic bullet that will stop covid (just like masks alone aren't the be all end all).

How is it October already and people in countries with free media, freedom of information, human rights, and all that money, are **still** unable to realise this? Wtf are your media and health officials doing? How is this messaging still not being delivered?

You’re right. 

&gt; If there were long lasting protective immunity, you wouldn't expect serious illness to occur upon re-exposure (or increased symptoms as have occurred in 50% of secondary exposure cases with known outcomes).

That’s incorrect. You definitely would because the immune system isn’t perfect. People die from the common cold despite people typically having protective immunity.  

&gt; Seems like you're trying to make up a reality rather than acknowledge what's actually going on with these patients.  Where is the so-called ""protective immunity"" if 50% of reinfections (with known outcomes) result in more severe symptoms than the first exposure?

Well first of all .00005% of all cases is really nothing to draw any conclusions from. That number alone suggests there *is* sterilizing immunity that lasts at least as long as the virus has been around. Secondly if 50% worse symptoms means there is no protective immunity what does the other 50% mean?  Thirdly it isn’t 50%, it’s 36%. 8 out of 22. 

Same symptoms: 11 (50%) (72% of which are no symptoms)
Worse symptoms:  8 (36%)
Less symptoms: 3 (13%)

Even if you converted all hospital beds in the US to ICU beds there still wouldn't be enough beds to go around. People would die. This is completely ignoring the lack of trained health care workers and equipment which would render those hospital beds otherwise useless and turn them into just beds. 

This means that the lack of medical care will double triple, perhaps exponentially increase the death rate as people die from lack of medical care. So the death rate inches from 0.013% or whatever theoretical lower limit of the IFR you believe to be true, to be closer to 7% which would be a disaster and this death rate would include younger people who would have otherwise survived.

Those aren’t mutually exclusive. People use airborne as a boogie man. It’s not so airborne that the measures being recommended don’t work. That’s what should be important about how it spreads to anyone in the public.

The evidence says otherwise as does the history of coronaviruses. Reinfection will be mild. It will become a cold.

I also look away if we are passing and try not to inhale or exhale for that second we pass.

Also since im by the water its always windy.

But the reality is exactly the opposite:  China acted extremely quickly to stop the virus, among the best public health responses to an emergent disease the world has ever seen.

People don't understand how *extremely quickly* China locked down.  When Hubei Province was locked down, there were only about ten deaths a day.  China locked down 20 provinces days later.  And these lockdowns were dramatically more stringent than the lockdowns in the US.

The lockdowns in the US didn't start until Mar 18, when SF Bay Area counties shutdown, and didn't complete until April.  By that point, there were over 1,000 deaths/day in the US.

The US locked down when there were 100x as many deaths occurring in a population 1/5th as large as China.  On a per capita basis, there were 500x as many daily deaths in the US as there were when China locked down.

And that was the original sin.  Despite all the knowledge of what was happening in China, the United States did not complete a single test for Covid of anyone without travel history to China until *February 27th*, when the Seattle Flu Study broke Federal law, ignored the FDA and CDC, and began conducting their own testing.

The virus spread unchecked in the US from at least Jan 15 until mid-March without any appreciable testing, or even understanding of what was happening.

At the time, we all thought the outbreak was just beginning, but the reality is that period was the peak of the outbreak.  The peak daily deaths in the US was recorded on April 21st, and given an 18 day lag from symptom onset to death, it's safe to say the peak of the outbreak was right around April 3rd.

This is why China was able to control the outbreak.  They implemented draconian lockdowns extremely early, trained hundreds of thousands of contact tracers, and stopped the disease in its tracks.  It's not impossible, they just acted comparatively very quickly.",,,1602393294,{},g8fqgc3,False,t3_j8n1jp,False,False,t1_g8f6k2b,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8n1jp/383359_new_cases_of_coronavirus_worldwide_the/g8fqgc3/,1602400466,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Excess cases after 6 weeks could have been reduced by 90% from 576,371 to 63,062 and excess deaths reduced by 80% from 22,851 to 4858 had states implemented mask mandates prior to reopening. Over 50,000 excess deaths were prevented within 6 weeks in 13 states that implemented mask mandates prior to reopening.

Conclusions

Additional mitigation measures such as mask use counteract the potential growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths due to reopening businesses. This study contributes to the growing evidence that mask usage is essential for mitigating community transmission of COVID-19. States should delay further reopening until mask mandates are fully implemented, and enforcement by local businesses will be critical for preventing potential future closures.",,,1602392686,{},g8fov5b,False,t3_j8na1y,False,True,t3_j8na1y,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8na1y/coronavirus_cases_in_arizona_dropped_75_after/g8fov5b/,1602399832,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

We actually have a higher number of deaths per 100k than Italy. 

Guess what? Population density matters. Italy got slammed super hard in March/April because it is very dense. The density, combined with a deadly novel virus that spread quickly, is why they got hit super hard. It overwhelmed their healthcare system. The same thing happened to NY/New Jersey. Their death toll was arguably worse than Italy's, but partially because the City of New York is super dense. 

Now, at some point over the summer, the U.S. overtook Italy. That is embarrassing because we are a big country and much less dense than Italy in a lot of parts. Florida and Texas having as many deaths as they do is embarrassing. Same goes for other states. There was no effort to contain the virus. Combine that with our shitty healthcare system and cavalier attitudes and you end up with bad results.  

Just look at the difference below between the two countries. They contained the virus, we did not. Now they are seeing a rise again because A) it is going into the winter months B) they likely let their guard down a bit.

&gt;This study has some limitations. First, all observational cohort studies are prone to bias by confounding. We used weighted propensity scores to adjust optimally for differences between treated patients and controls. However, randomized studies are needed to confirm our data. Another limitation of this study is a lack of data on adverse effects of (H)CQ. There is ongoing global discussion about possible drug toxicity in COVID-19 patients and increased mortality associated with HCQ treatment 31,32 . Since HCQ and CQ are FDA and EMA approved drugs, the adverse effects are well documented 24 . Yet, these adverse effects are Journal Pre-proof similar to the commonly reported COVID-19 symptoms (fever, fatigue, dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia) and also nausea and diarrhea are frequently observed 33,34 .

&gt; 
&gt; ## Abstract
&gt; 
&gt; **Background:** The beneficial effects of vitamin D, together with the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, have led to an expanding use of vitamin D analogues. While inappropriate consumption is a recognized cause of harm, definition of doses at which vitamin D becomes toxic remain elusive.
&gt; 
&gt; **Case presentation:** A 56-year woman was admitted to our Hospital following a 3-week history of nausea, vomiting and muscle weakness. **The patient had been assuming very high dose of cholecalciferol since 20 months (cumulative 78,000,000UI, mean daily 130,000UI)**, as indicated by a non-conventional protocol for multiple sclerosis. Before starting vitamin D integration, serum calcium and phosphorus levels were normal, while 25OH-vitamin D levels were very low (12.25 nmol/L). On admission, hypercalcemia (3.23 mmol/L) and acute kidney injury (eGFR 20 mL/min) were detected, associated with high concentrations of 25OH-vitamin D (920 nmol/L), confirming the suspicion of vitamin D intoxication. Vitamin D integration was stopped and, in a week, hypercalcemia normalized. It took about 6 months for renal function and 18 months for vitamin D values to go back to normal.
&gt; 
&gt; **Conclusions:** This case confirms that vitamin D intoxication is possible albeit with a really high dose. The doses used in clinical practice are far lower than these and, therefore, intoxication rarely occurs even in those individuals whose baseline vitamin D serum levels have never been assessed. Repeated measurements of vitamin D are not necessary in patients under standard integrative therapy. However, patients and clinicians should be aware of the potential dangers of vitamin D overdose.
&gt; 
&gt; **Keywords:** Vitamin D; cholecalciferol; hypercalcemia.; intoxication; overdose; toxicity.

But yes there are too many factors in demographics and response to compare like that.

I'd say let's look to the evidence of specific situations such as the Swiss one I posted. Hence, masks work and should be a policy everywhere.

And no, Swedish officials have not recommended them as complementary tools.

Anyway, Its from a study done by Scandinavian scientists from Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland comparing effects of different measures.

This article goes into more detail about why especially it cost Norway. The study is done with the assumption that everyone can work from home. So the cost is probably higher.

In Norway, it costs society at least 1.7 billion Norwegian kroner to keep schools closed - every day. It has the Norwegian Bureau of Statistics, Statistics Norway,

Basically - 

The younger the child are and the worse of they are in the beginning the more they will suffer economically. 


The main part, just over 1.4 billion per lost school day, is the total, expected reduction in life income for those who are now missing out on education. If you learn less, you will also, on average, earn less money during your working life, is the simple assumption.

The rest is less productivity from the parents.

&gt; # ""Effect of Calcifediol Treatment and best Available Therapy versus best Available Therapy on Intensive Care Unit Admission and Mortality Among Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19: A Pilot Randomized Clinical study""
&gt; 
&gt; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsbmb.2020.105751
&gt; 
&gt; ## Highlights
&gt; 
&gt; - The vitamin D endocrine system may have a variety of actions on cells and tissues involved in COVID-19 progression.
&gt; - Administration of calcifediol or 25-hydroxyvitamin D to hospitalized COVID-19 patients significantly reduced their need for Intensive Care United admission.
&gt; - Calcifediol seems to be able to reduce severity of the disease.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Abstract
&gt; 
&gt; ### Objective
&gt; 
&gt; The vitamin D endocrine system may have a variety of actions on cells and tissues involved in COVID-19 progression especially by decreasing the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Calcifediol can rapidly increase serum 25OHD concentration. We therefore evaluated the effect of calcifediol treatment, on Intensive Care Unit Admission and Mortality rate among Spanish patients hospitalized for COVID-19.
&gt; 
&gt; ### Design
&gt; 
&gt; parallel pilot randomized open label, double-masked clinical trial.
&gt; 
&gt; ### Setting
&gt; 
&gt; university hospital setting (Reina Sofia University Hospital, Córdoba Spain.)
&gt; 
&gt; ### Participants
&gt; 
&gt; 76 consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, clinical picture of acute respiratory infection, confirmed by a radiographic pattern of viral pneumonia and by a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR with CURB65 severity scale (recommending hospital admission in case of total score &gt; 1).
&gt; 
&gt; ### Procedures
&gt; 
&gt; All hospitalized patients received as best available therapy the same standard care, (per hospital protocol), of a combination of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg every 12 hours on the first day, and 200 mg every 12 hours for the following 5 days), azithromycin (500 mg orally for 5 days. Eligible patients were allocated at a 2 calcifediol:1 no calcifediol ratio through electronic randomization on the day of admission to take oral calcifediol (0.532 mg), or not. Patients in the calcifediol treatment group continued with oral calcifediol (0.266 mg) on day 3 and 7, and then weekly until discharge or ICU admission. Outcomes of effectiveness included rate of ICU admission and deaths.
&gt; 
&gt; ### Results
&gt; 
&gt; **Of 50 patients treated with calcifediol, one required admission to the ICU (2%), while of 26 untreated patients, 13 required admission (50%)** p value X2 Fischer test p &lt; 0.001. Univariate Risk Estimate Odds Ratio for ICU in patients with Calcifediol treatment versus without Calcifediol treatment: 0.02 (95%CI 0.002-0.17). Multivariate Risk Estimate Odds Ratio for ICU in patients with Calcifediol treatment vs Without Calcifediol treatment ICU (adjusting by Hypertension and T2DM): 0.03 (95%CI: 0.003-0.25). Of the patients treated with calcifediol, none died, and all were discharged, without complications. The 13 patients not treated with calcifediol, who were not admitted to the ICU, were discharged. Of the 13 patients admitted to the ICU, two died and the remaining 11 were discharged.
&gt; 
&gt; ### Conclusion
&gt; 
&gt; Our pilot study demonstrated that administration of a high dose of Calcifediol or 25-hydroxyvitamin D, a main metabolite of vitamin D endocrine system, significantly reduced the need for ICU treatment of patients requiring hospitalization due to proven COVID-19. Calcifediol seems to be able to reduce severity of the disease, but larger trials with groups properly matched will be required to show a definitive answer.
&gt;

TLDR: 

Study with 76 patients used high dose Vitamin-D (21280IU) it massively reduced the risk of needing ICU care (97%) and dying (100%) if admitted to hospital for Covid-19.  ICU reduction was statistical significant reduction in death was not.

Vitamin-D group (N:50)

- 2% (1 patient) needed ICU care.
- 0% (0 patients) died. 

Control Group (N:26)

- 50% (13 patients) needed ICU care
- 7.8% (2 patients) died

Statistics. 

- Need for ICU was reduced by 97% and was highly statistically significant, P&lt;000.1
 - Can also be expressed as 25x reduction
- Death was reduced by 100% but not statistically significant due to insufficient dead people, P=0.11. 
- Numbers Needed to treat was 2.

calcifediol is about 3-5 times more powerful than the more common form of vitamin-D, [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6566727/). It also much more quickly increases the blood levels which is the reason it was used.",,,1602413606,{},g8gvegq,True,t3_j92b75,False,True,t1_g8gtdk7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j92b75/coronavirus_ways_vitamin_d_can_prevent_multiple/g8gvegq/,1602414906,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

&gt; The role of vitamin D in innate and adaptive immunity is critical. A statistical error in the estimation of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D was recently discovered; in a correct analysis of the data used by the Institute of Medicine, it was found that 8895 IU/d was needed for 97.5% of individuals to achieve values ≥50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed that 6201 IU/d was needed to achieve 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/d was needed to reach 100 nmol/L.

Another reason they were anxious to advise masks is that people with masks tend to ignore the social distance rule more because they feel protected, while social distance probably has more impact on spread than masks.

The reason we have such high survivability numbers right now is because we have some fairly stringent measures to contain it and we are able to provide adequate care to the patients that need it.

Unlike most other viruses we vaccinate for, this virus is incredibly resilient in terms of how long it can survive outside of a host. The last report had it at up to 9 hours. Additionally it's possible to be an asymptomatic (not show any symptoms) carrier. This is how in places like S. Korea a single infected person was able to infect hundreds of households in one day.

When multiple of these events occur local hospitals can easily be overwhelmed. Recovery time can be weeks, particularly if you spend it on a ventilator, which have been in short supply.

Communication from the top in the US sucked at the federal level and in most states (all but a handful). But even the WHO and CDC have waffled on the nature of the virus (airborne or not) and whether masks are effective or not. 

But I’m truly disappointed with how people in general have acted (Karens and whatnot). We should have rallied around defeating this thing socially (or anti-socially as the case may be) and not just in terms of mobilizing industry to find a vaccine and manufacture masks.

If you mandate, now you need to enforce.  There happens to be quite a kerfuffle at the moment around defunding enforcement agencies as a result of poor enforcement techniques.

Boris is in support of Brexit, so unsurprisingly he didn't talk about it in a negative light in his speech. In fact most of the Brexit talk was painting a rosy picture of the future and ragging on Labour for 'stopping them delivering Brexit'. 

The not going back to normal bit seems to be contradicted by ""we are working for the day when life will be back to normal"" and ""we will ensure that next time we meet it will be face to face and cheek by jowl"" (referring to the next conservative party conference). However I can see where you got confused as ""it isn’t enough just to go back to normal"" is referring to the chronic problems you refer to in your next sentence.

Your third paragraph is just basically bollocks. He makes no mention of testing/contact tracing anywhere, and he in fact accuses Labour of supporting extending furlough (""there are many who regard this state expansion as progress, who want to keep the state supporting furlough forever, keep people in suspended animation""). Boris doesn't really say much about the short term future at all in his speech (which was the main criticism of it), and no mention of future covid cases/deaths from opening up. And again, the 2019 thing is more doing better in regards to infrastructure and economic opportunities.

For someone who you think wants to encourage a 'new normal', he seems quite disparaging of it, calling elbow touching ""some giant national version of the Birdie dance"" and hairdressers wearing face shields as looking ""as though they are handling radioactive isotopes"". Also Build Back Better is the three word slogan, and he's the Prime Minister of the UK, not just England (at least for now). You also forgot promises on more nurses and hospitals, involving the private sector over state spending and fixed rate mortgages to help young people own homes.

The worries that Tegnell mentioned to the ECDC were also mirrored in other countries and experts - Netherlands at the [end of July](https://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-info/dutch-expat-news/rivm-says-there-no-evidence-prove-effectiveness-face-masks):

&gt;“There is not yet sufficient scientific evidence to encourage the use of face masks in public spaces. In exceptional situations, consideration could be given to using non-medical masks when it is not possible to follow general measures, such as in public transport.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Andreas Voss, member of the World Health Organisation expert team and head of microbiology at a hospital in Nijmegen, said he didn’t personally believe masks should be made mandatory, stating that because in many of the countries where a face mask rule has been implemented, there are several other measures also in place, so it is impossible to determine the impact of masks specifically.

So trying to single him out as incompetent because of this opinion, when experts in other countries have said almost exact quote as the words used in FHM briefings, is just ... petty? 

And yes, I understand that asian countries have fared much better - on one side because the initial spring outbreak turns out had a milder strain in Asia, which developed into more transmissive one in Europe; on another side because they have had more than a decade of experience with keeping distance and masks wearing norm in society because of the previous SARS epidemic and other more localized severe flu epidemics. But they are also seeing bumps in infection rates now. Which is what I am trying to point out - masks don't remove the transmission even in high compliance experienced countries like South Korea or Japan. More effective and efficient measures as continual social and physical distance, better hygiene, avoiding large gatherings, self-isolating at smallest symptoms or suspicion that you are getting ill or were in contact with someone that is now ill - these should be the ones that get more attention in my opinion.",,,1602420826,{},g8hb6kf,False,t3_j8p0r7,False,True,t1_g8h9e1r,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8p0r7/infection_in_sweden_is_picking_up_speed_positive/g8hb6kf/,1602420838,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

China did a 3 month hard lockdown. No one whined. No one protested about their precious freedoms. The virus is gone. They're back to economic growth. We'll be stuck in this for another year, then face a great depression. Because ZOMG MY SPORTS.

&gt; Nearly 80 pages of the emails were obtained via public records requests and published in full by The New York Times.

&gt; The correspondence was initially started by the Department of Homeland Security's top medical officer Duane Caneva eventually expanded to include top officials from the Department of Homeland Security, Health &amp; Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Trump's former Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert, and a number of top academics and infectious disease specialists.
In addition to the ""Red Dawn"" emails, The Times also published a lengthy, investigative review of all the instances Trump brushed aside warnings of the severity of the coronavirus crisis, failed to act, and was belabored by significant infighting and mixed messages from the White House over what action to take and when.",,,1602446825,{},g8irhby,False,t3_j93o71,False,True,t1_g8iqn7y,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j93o71/greeley_nursing_home_residents_protest_pandemic/g8irhby/,1602448855,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1602447142.0,,

[],,imeanwhyevenbother,,,[],,,,text,t2_2ldxevr6,False,False,[],"The ""Endocrine Society"" increased recommended levels of Vitamin D due to the influence of Dr. Holick, who may have monetary conflicts of interest.

&gt;Dr. Holick’s role in drafting national vitamin D guidelines, and the embrace of his message by mainstream doctors and wellness gurus alike, have helped push supplement sales to $936 million in 2017. That’s a ninefold increase over the previous decade. Lab tests for vitamin D deficiency have spiked, too: Doctors ordered more than 10 million for Medicare patients in 2016, up 547 percent since 2007, at a cost of $365 million.

These guidelines also recommend levels of Vitamin D that may be unsafe.

&gt;Although the amount of vitamin D in a typical daily supplement is generally considered safe, it is possible to take too much. In 2015, an article in the American Journal of Medicine linked blood levels as low as 50 nanograms per milliliter with an increased risk of death. That’s within the level considered healthy by the Endocrine Society, which defined vitamin D “sufficiency” as between 30 and 100 nanograms, Rosen said.

I am especially curious why the Institute of Medicine is wrong...

&gt;the prestigious National Academy of Medicine (then known as the Institute of Medicine), a group of independent scientific experts, issued a comprehensive, 1,132-page report on vitamin D deficiency. It concluded that the vast majority of Americans get plenty of the hormone naturally, and advised doctors to test only patients at high risk of certain disorders, such as osteoporosis.

But Dr Holick's paper is correct...

&gt;A few months later, in June 2011, Dr. Holick oversaw the publication of a report that took a starkly different view. The paper, in the peer-reviewed Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism, was on behalf of the Endocrine Society, the field’s foremost professional group, whose guidelines are widely used by hospitals, physicians and commercial labs nationwide, including Quest. The society adopted Dr. Holick’s position that “vitamin D deficiency is very common in all age groups” and advocated a huge expansion of vitamin D testing, targeting more than half the United States population, including those who are black, Hispanic or obese — groups that tend to have lower vitamin D levels than others.

Shouldn't others have the ""freedom"" to not worry about dying because some dipshit can't wear a tiny mask for the thirty minutes he's in the grocery store? It goes right back to the ""me vs them"" mentality - people view others, especially others that disagree with them or think/believe differently - as genuinely lesser than them.

There is no thought process of, ""am I causing harm to others?"" because the ""others"" do not matter. If they did matter, they'd feel the same as me. If they mattered, they'd believe what I do - because anybody that doesn't is the enemy. People that don't think the way I think aren't living, breathing people that just have different views - they're the enemy, they're actively attacking my way of life, they are actively taking away my freedoms, and this is just another example of that.

It was such a foreign and ancient concept to me to hate somebody just based on how they look or feel or think. I didn't consider myself to be"" not racist"" or ""very accepting"" or anything, it was just normal, people are people and people can be different and that's okay.

So you think Fauci thinks he himself is at a risk high enough to completely avoid trains, planes, etc, despite masks and social distancing, but not Trump?  That would be very inconsistent of him.  If he is that afraid of getting Covid, clearly he thinks it's because he could die or get very ill.  He wouldn't act that way if he thought he would just have the sniffles for a couple of days like most do.  

If you want me to provide a quote from Fauci saying ""TRUMP SHOULD BE DEAD"" then you don't know how Fauci works.  He is a master at implication without actually saying something definitive that he can be held to account to.  But obviously Fauci sees Trump as having the same or even higher risk than himself, due to Trump's excessive weight, exposure, etc.  So the reality is far from what Fauci thought it would be in regards to Trump's illness.  According to Fauci's reasoning, Trump should be very ill at this point. 

&gt;Just one more question so I can understand your position. Is having COVID or being sick binary to you- someone either dies or they are fine- with no in between?

The thing that sticks harder in my mind with each passing month is the idea that pandemics happen as a result of economic, social and cultural situations. The Spanish Flu would not have happened without the end of WWI and the diaspora of servicemen to their homes all over the world, taking the disease with them.

Coronavirus would not have happened without the constant underfunding of the education system for the last 40 years, distrust of science and scientists, politicians using wedge politics to gain and maintain power, and a constant tilt politically towards rampant individualism. 

You end up with a situation in which people aren't educated enough to decide what is true and what are lies; or even what is probably or improbable. A refusal to listen to experts who have spent their whole lives working in this field. A complete lack of empathy with others, and thinking that any money given to help those others will be coming directly out of your pocket. A refusal to do what's best for others, even if it inconveniences you extremely mildly ie: wearing a mask.

That's why this will drag on and on and on. You can't undo society-wide attitudes that have been built up over decades in a matter of months, or even years.

Fauci said he's being ""practical"" when he says, ""I think if we can get 75 to 80% of the population vaccinated, I think that would be a really good accomplishment.""

Are all of these RCT studies specifically for HCQ and not HCQ and CQ? And did any of these answer the specific question that is supposedly answered by this study?

But were these RCT's inconclusive or did they prove that there are no benefits to treating with HCQ with statistical significance?

Some of these RCT's have a absurdly high dosage and cumulative dosage of HCQ. This study has a mean cumulative dosage of 1823.5 mg, which is relatively low (the UK Recovery Study had a mean cumulative dosage of 9200 mg). So what are the RCT's with the same range of doses as in this study.

Another problem with \*SOME\* of these RCT studies is when the drug is administered. Some were administered really late into hospital admission, and some were only used in the ICU. 

I know there are RCT's that also looked into giving it before hospital admission. My question about those, did these studies look at anything else than preventing illness. Maybe HCQ is just not capable of preventing illness. And if they looked at other things, like hospitalization rate, ICU hosp. rate and mortality, were these numbers significant enough to prove HCQ doesn't work?

Going on about the statistical significance. Do these RCT's have enough participants to really make a conclusive and definitive judgement of what HCQ is capable of. So did they look at enough patients that were ill enough to be hospitalized to see how effective this treatment is among this group.

Also there were also RCT's that showed benefits for HCQ treatment, but not with enough statistical significance. What does that say?

And what were these RCT's looking at? Mortality? The study said it doesn't reduce mortality. Hospitalization rate? The patients were already hospitalized for this study. Preventing illness? I hope I don't have to clarify this one. Severity of symptoms? This study didn't answer that question.

It seems more like these RCT's do a great job at questioning this drug for certain uses, and that's a good thing. That's part of the science. But they don't seem to do a great job at definitively ruling out HCQ conclusively. Keep in mind were not searching for a wonder drug. Any benefit is good. It doesn't matter if it prevents illness, reduces severity, mortality, hospitalization length. Anything goes. There are enough questions unanswered about the treatment with this drug and a lot of compensation needed for the lack of good RCT's. We basically need more and especially better RCT when it comes to using HCQ in a hospital setting. So for this study we need the following answer:

*Where is the RCT study that has enough participants to give statistical significance that prove that hydroxychloroquine* ***but not Chloroquine*** *doesn't work under* ***\*HOSPITALIZED\**** *patients to reduce the* ***\*ICU HOSPITALIZATION RATE\**** *with patients that received HCQ* ***very early*** *into hospital admission (like &lt;1 day) with lower dosages (read: no absurdly high dosages).*

Here a meta analysis on the RCT's performed on HCQ: [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.29.20203869v2?versioned=true](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.29.20203869v2?versioned=true)

&gt; A pooled analysis of these randomized trials cannot rule out a moderate reduction of COVID-19 risk after assignment to HCQ. Yet the findings from the randomized trials were widely interpreted as definite evidence of lack of effectiveness of HCQ, simply because they were not statistically significant. Completion of the ongoing trials is needed to generate more precise estimates of the effectiveness of HCQ to prevent COVID-19.",,,1602373073,{},g8e69ok,True,t3_j8re2e,False,True,t1_g8dkabq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8re2e/new_peerreviewed_and_accepted_for_publication/g8e69ok/,1602378979,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

&gt;Aside from questions of safety that attend any vaccine, **there are good reasons to be especially cautious for COVID-19**. Some vaccines worsen the consequences of infection rather than protect, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). **ADE has been observed in previous attempts to develop coronavirus vaccines.** To add to the concern, antibodies typical of ADE are present in the blood of some COVID-19 patients. **Such concerns are real.** As recently as 2016, Dengavxia, intended to protect children from the dengue virus, increased hospitalizations for children who received the vaccine.

Sweden is probably the most left wing democratic country in the world with the most left wing response to the pandemic. (left as in distribution of wealth) 

Lots of people think that Swedens restrictions are to loose, but swedes have a really high trust in the government so a recomendation in Sweden might be as effective as a police/military enforced ""law"" in other countries. They really believe that the government is doing the best they can to help the citizens. The government is not out to get you if you understand what I mean. 

The fact that politicians dont interfere in the pandemic response is also a factor. There has been no polics involved, even the semi racist anti establishment party Swedish Democrats have been largely quit. There is sort of a concensus that you stick together during this and when its finished you start the political fight again. Sort of as if it was a war. 

When the Public Health Agency says ""stay home"" Swedes consideres it with the same trust they would if a doctor told them personally to stay home. They believe that the Public Health Agency are the experts and that you should do what they say. 

There is statistics supporting the fact that they trust the government more than most. 65% of Swedes trust their government. The average in OECD is 37 %. 

They also trust eachother more than most, placing third in the world. 

98% of the children are vaccinated even though its mandatory, also one of the highest levels in the world. 

Sweden is the 3rd most democratic and the 4th least corrupt country in the world. 

If you look at mobility data Sweden managed almost aswell with recomendations than countries like spain, UK etc did with police force.

1. the WHO does not 'condemn' lockdowns. what is being said here is that lockdowns alone are ineffective and possible deleterious if you don't follow them up with other measures. you merely end up in a yo-yo cycle.

2. nabarro does not speak for the entirety of the WHO. this should be obvious from his position, which is a special envoy to the WHO. you can also find that the WHO has not made any general proclamations in line with this and in fact has consistently said that their goal is avoid lockdowns if possible. the implication here being that they may be necessary to get things under control in some areas.

the supposedly great barrington declration says this:

&gt;The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk.

this is most assuredly NOT the position of the WHO. this much is obvious to anyone who has read the things the WHO puts out.

and further:

&gt;Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal. Simple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold. Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume. People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity.

For example, there are [flu vaccines that are intranasal and live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_attenuated_influenza_vaccine).

There are a bunch of different COVID-19 vaccine efforts underway at once right now, and the article does mention some that are not live vaccines, but I think the article is trying to address the general idea of intranasal vaccines for COVID-19.

They had a 2 month lockdown, but the trade off is that their initial surge resulted in less cases/deaths per capita. Moreover, unlike Sweden, those two countries did not have to place their elderly in care homes on extended lockdown till mid-Sep.

Post-lockdown, the people in those countries have had similar restrictions (namely social distancing and group size limits) and their economies were all hit similarly.

&gt;Sweden's GDP fell 8.6% during the second quarter of the year, according to its statistics body.

&gt;The fall is sharper than its neighbors — Denmark registered a 7.4% fall, and Finland a 3.2% fall. Statistics suggest Norway also fared better than Sweden.

Also, plenty of post-lockdown countries are using similar measures as Sweden. Namely, enforcing social distancing, recommending working from home and additionally mask mandates. Again, the difference is that a lockdown afforded those countries the ability to flatten their curves sooner and mitigate the impact of the initial surge.

Sweden's case rates are increasing now quite steadily so we will see what the death rates look like in a few weeks from now. I was told a few weeks ago that Sweden's lack of case increases was proof that their policies work. Well look at where we are now as their cases are increasing too. Turns out not every country is in the same stage of the pandemic. Yes Sweden's death rates are lower now as well. this is a trend across the world due to improved treatment. the magnitude of difference with Spain is much larger though. There's never one factor in public health or medicine. That should be simple enough to understand.

[],,jlking3,,,[],,,,text,t2_4i4jc,False,True,[],"Oh, you're speaking specifically about hydroxychloroquinine, and not what symptoms someone can expect to have after they recover from COVID-19!! I misunderstood you!

[When hydroxychloroquinine was double-blind placebo tested for efficacy in COVID by the University of Minnesota medical school, it showed no benefit as compared to a placebo](https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/hydroxychloroquine-mild-covid-19/), and no one to date has been able to reproduce the Henry Ford Health System's study which was not double-blind nor placebo--doctors selected patients and rejected others for reasons unknown, and in fact, some patients were taking other drugs such as steroids at the same time, and that would potentially corrupt the results.

You want all patients receiving the exact same treatment with the exception of one group getting nothing for Covid (the control group), one group getting hydroxychloroquinine, and one group getting a sugar pill. Only the researchers would know who, outside the control group, would be receiving the drug. The patients and doctors would not know.

It should be noted that the double-blind placebo study from Minnesota came out before Henry Ford Health's study. The Henry Ford story was only in the news because Trump made a big deal early on about the study saying it vindicated him on the topic of hydroxychloroquinine.

Trump seemed to agree with Fauci as he wasn't given Hydroxycholoroquinine at Walter Reed once he was diagnosed with COVID-19.

But I've been talking about what happens to a COVID-19 patient, and what symptoms they experience when they recover, what happens post-recovery. Patients have been observed to have continued difficulty breathing, elevated cardiac problems and have reduced mental capacities even after recovering from the virus.

Studies that aggregate patient responses after they have experienced COVID-19 aren't and can't ever be placebo controlled, because they aren't testing any particular drug for which a placebo would be made: they're recording what patients are experiencing post-recovery. 

Again, the studies that aggregate patient recovery experiences can't be double-blind placebo, because they aren't testing any specific drug. They are tabulating the statistics as they are received, and you previously asked about ""long-term statistics"" before gish-galloping into your ""double-blind"" argument, which doesn't apply to general patient outcome post-COVID statistics, unless they were specifically studying a specific drug, which they weren't.

The current aggregated statistical evidence shows that people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and recover show reduced respiratory, cardiac and mental abilities. Whether specific treatments can improve patient outcome remains to be seen, as drug testing does take time.

Now, if you can explain to me how they can placebo the COVID virus itself so that neither patient nor doctor knows if the symptomatic patient has COVID and then aggregates recovery responses, I'd be interested to hear it. In fact, if you published a paper about how to do that, you'd likely win a Nobel prize in medicine because that would be truly amazing to set up an experiment where you would test patients after they experienced the symptoms of moderate to severe COVID, but neither the patient nor the doctor would be allowed to know if the patient had ever had COVID. Would you be willing to volunteer for a study where you might get the COVID virus or you might get a placebo ""virus"" that would make you as sick as COVID (including loss of smell and taste) but wouldn't give you the COVID antibodies? Such a placebo virus would have to be created for the experiment you suggest. Otherwise it would be trivial to determine who had symptomatic COVID and who had the placebo, negating a double-blind study.

Since COVID is a part of the SARS family of viruses that rely on airborne droplets to be transmitted, most masks will reduce the spread of droplets. Some masks will reduce the spread more. There was a very powerful experiment done to show how much less spread there is with a mask. It was not double-blind placebo, because the subjects knew they were wearing or not wearing masks. I'm sure you'll agree that it would be impossible to make that double-blind where neither patient nor doctor would know if the patient were wearing a mask.

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2007800

In particular, watch the 42 second video. It demonstrates droplet spread with and without a mask.

When Fauci is talking about ""flawed,"" he was specifically talking about the Henry Ford Health hydroxychloroquinine study, and if you read his remarks, he says that double-blind randomized placebo studies are the gold standard for determining *if a drug is effective.* 

To extrapolate that Fauci claimed that every single scientific study ever has to be randomized double-blind placebo would be an incorrect extrapolation, and quite possibly could be deliberately done in an attempt to obfuscate and confuse, and to attempt to call him a liar.

[],,Rick91981,,,[],,,,text,t2_ssyl3,False,True,[],"&gt;Josiah Zayner’s plan was simple: replicate a Covid-19 vaccine that had worked in monkeys, test it on himself and then livestream the experiment online over a period of months. Now, that improbable bid is over.

&gt;Around the world, dozens of Covid-19 vaccines are in human clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people. While vaccines typically take years to develop, U.S. scientists are racing to produce one in months through Operation Warp Speed. But Zayner, a one-time NASA researcher who left the scientific establishment in favor of engaging in do-it-yourself experiments, bet that by working outside regulatory structures, he could test a vaccine even more quickly and certainly more cheaply by giving it to himself.

&gt;Instead, Zayner discovered, testing a vaccine is far more complicated than he had imagined. 

&gt;Even though his experiment yielded a promising result, Zayner found too many unanswered questions to say that it worked. For one, it wasn’t clear whether antibodies he found in his own body in extremely tiny measures before the experiment began made a difference. Zayner has long-believed that biohackers such as himself have the potential to make science move faster. In June, he told Bloomberg News that Covid-19 presented ""the perfect opportunity"" to show just what biohackers can do. 

&gt;Now, his message is decidedly different: “Human beings — their biology is so complex,” he said in a recent interview. “The results are going to be messy. The experiments are going to be messy. So you test 30,000 people so that the messiness kind of averages out.”

&gt;As the U.S. rushes to bring a vaccine to market far faster than has ever been done, Zayner said he has discovered why the long, slow process of clinical trials shouldn’t be rushed. A promising early stage result is just that: promising. It’s a message that’s resonating nationwide in the U.S. as the timeline for a development of a safe and effective vaccine has become a touchpoint in the presidential election, with President Donald Trump saying we could see an outcome before the Nov. 3 vote, Democrats worrying that he is putting a thumb on the scale,  and scientists saying it will probably arrive close to the end of the year, even in January.

&gt;Zayner is infamous for attention-grabbing experiments in which he uses himself as a guinea pig. He self- injected the gene-editing tool Crispr while giving a talk at a San Francisco biotech conference, and performed his own fecal matter transplant. Such stunts have made him an informal figurehead for a growing movement of do-it-yourself scientists emboldened by advancements in technology that have made such feats as engineering biology increasingly simple. Zayner believes such cutting-edge science should be accessible to anyone, and that democratizing science could help curb exorbitant drug prices and speed science along.

&gt;Initially, Zayner assumed that the experiment he named Project McAfee, after the antiviral software, would be relatively straightforward. The vaccine selected had  triggered protective immunity against the virus in rhesus macaque monkeys in a paper published in May. Zayner was able to order the same spike protein sequence from the DNA-synthesis company the researchers had used. The plan: He and two fellow biohackers — Daria Dantseva in Ukraine and David Ishee in Mississippi — would themselves test the concoction they ordered online. They would then livestream the entire process online over several months, with the first showing to occur in June.

&gt;But early on in the experiment, complications arose. Before starting, Zayner took a test at Lab Corp Inc. that told him he didn’t already have antibodies to the virus. But when he performed a similar test on himself shortly afterward, he found that he did have some antibodies, just not enough to produce a positive result on Lab Corp’s test. While those antibodies didn’t appear to be the neutralizing type, he wondered whether the result came because the vaccine was picking up signals from antibodies to a different virus — or how this faint antibody signal might affect things. 

&gt;“I’m very suspicious of my own data,” he said.

&gt;He’s not alone. Hank Greely, a bioethicist at Stanford University, said Zayner’s experiment pointed out an underappreciated reality of vaccine development. “Actually making the vaccine isn’t that hard,” he said. “It’s testing it and knowing that it’s safe — and knowing that it’s effective.”

&gt;Greely said that while Zayner’s DIY experiment probably presented more risks than potential benefits, there  is value in demonstrating to people that vaccine development isn’t “magic.”

&gt;For his part, Zayner said his turn at vaccine testing has tempered his appetite for DIY human experimentation. He still believes such experiments have a role to play, especially for those with fatal illnesses that lack approved treatments. But for now, he's taking a break from experimenting on himself.  His next project will focus on showing people how to grow chicken cells to make their own fake meat. 

&gt;With &gt;vaccines, Zayner concluded, “Large scale clinical trials are probably required, because it is so messy.”",,,1602391378,{},g8fliio,False,t3_j8xqj6,False,False,t1_g8fks4x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8xqj6/homemade_covid_vaccine_appeared_to_work_but/g8fliio/,1602398499,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

&gt;Humoral responses in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are often of limited durability, as seen with other human coronavirus epidemics. To address the underlying etiology, we examined post mortem thoracic lymph nodes and spleens in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and observed the absence of germinal centers and a striking reduction in Bcl-6+ germinal center B cells but preservation of AID+ B cells. Absence of germinal centers correlated with an early specific block in Bcl-6+ TFH cell differentiation together with an increase in T-bet+ TH1 cells and aberrant extra-follicular TNF-α accumulation. Parallel peripheral blood studies revealed loss of transitional and follicular B cells in severe disease and accumulation of SARS-CoV-2-specific “disease-related” B cell populations. These data identify defective Bcl-6+ TFH cell generation and dysregulated humoral immune induction early in COVID-19 disease, providing a mechanistic explanation for the limited durability of antibody responses in coronavirus infections, and suggest that achieving herd immunity through natural infection may be difficult.",,,1602391293,{},g8flb2n,False,t3_j8eznw,False,True,t1_g8f85b3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8eznw/an_uncommon_cold_how_a_coronavirus_that_causes/g8flb2n/,1602398416,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Anyway, the ways we have of determining IFR are inherently flawed and messy.  They generally rely on trying to figure out how much of the population that has been infected, of course. There are two problems with this:

1) large-scale studies have significant sampling bias issues. You can't just rely on something were people are asked ""do you want to give blood to see if you ever had the virus"" because you will oversample people who think that they had the virus and want to verify it.  A lot of the studies showing low IFR's have this big issue. 

2) for situations where EVERYBODY has been tested to see if they had the virus (cruise ship, a specific small town, etc), they are not necessarily representative of society as a whole.  We cannot necessarily extrapolate from those to much, much larger sets of people overall.

Now, sure: hospitalized patients are a subset of patients; hearing issues and tinnitus aren't quite the same as sudden and complete hearing loss (although I can personally testify that tinnitus is quite unpleasant); and some of it might be caused by the care they received in hospital rather than by COVID-19 itself (but that likely doesn't make a difference to patients).

Even with those things said, I think that study alone is enough to warn against brushing off hearing issues as ""a few hundreds or less cases"" when we still know so little about COVID, especially as the study itself states

&gt; Most of these patients are currently waiting for audiological assessment, delayed because of the ongoing pandemic.

This probably means that different countries should use different approaches, based in their situation ,but unfortunately currently its not the case - you have some high risk countries neglecting it while some low risk countries (due to young population) which aren't rich enough are taking too drastic measures which push significant part of their population into poverty.
Not to mention that I'm not 100% sure that lockdowns are the best answer - you have countries like Sweden or Japan that did not lock down and which currently have situation under control (yes I know Sweden had more deaths than Norway, but contrary to many predictions they peaked around same time as other European countries that locked down) and you have Perú which is under strict lockdown since march and which has highest death rate in the world regardless and cannot control it yet.

To clarify, I'm not anti-lockdown per se, I just believe this is very extreme measure that should be used carefully (we have marathon to run and early lockdowns that we had in Europe was like running a sprint, we ran off the steam quickly and now when situation is getting worse than in spring lockdown is no longer realistically an option) and we still need more research what really works and what not, and how to balance saving lives with not collapsing our counties and pushing millions into extreme poverty",,,1602377337,{},g8ejdwa,False,t3_j8j0ur,False,True,t1_g8efqzl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8j0ur/global_study_of_hospitalized_patients_confirms/g8ejdwa/,1602383789,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

The WHO statement was that AT MOST 10% of the world is infected. This was based on a rough review of the seroprevalence studies. 

The commonly-cited 0.1% flu IFR is an IFR-S, or IFR for symptomatic individuals. True IFR is lower, but it's hard to calculate because so few people die of influenza.

The WHO has put out a consensus IFR: [0.5-1%](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/estimating-mortality-from-covid-19). Unlike with Swine flu, this was not overestimated early on: WHO reported an IFR of [0.3-1%](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200219-sitrep-30-covid-19.pdf) in China on February 19th. This was the scientific consensus upon which policy was based in February and March. WHO got stuff wrong, but IFR is not one of those things.

CAVEAT: This applies only to the first wave, perhaps through May. There is nearly zero data on how fatality rates may have changed. I am hopeful that they have decreased, but beware of loud claims that this has already happening.

CAVEAT 2: Risk is **highly age dependent**. Success in shielding the at-risk can hugely influence this burden. For people under the age of 18, it seems likely that COVID risk is indeed smaller than flu risk, although the pressure of comparing the two has led scientists to reexamine flu risk and there is some chatter that vaccination pressure has caused us to be overinclusive wrt flu deaths. Nevertheless, COVID mortality risk is extraordinarily low among the young - and extraordinarily high among the old. People making decisions based on their risk should be aware that the relative risk (compared to one's yearly risk of dying) is essentially the same from 40 on up; it's like living another year in two weeks. I like this way of thinking about things - it neither exaggerates nor minimizes. Nobody should think it's a death sentence to add an extra year's death chance over the course of a few weeks. But that chance really gets daunting once you get into late middle age. Age-dependence also means that younger developing countries have been spared a lot of burden and that older countries like in Europe typically see ~~1% IFRs, as in England and Spain.",,,1602376858,{},g8ehy40,False,t3_j8j0ur,False,True,t1_g8bymt5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8j0ur/global_study_of_hospitalized_patients_confirms/g8ehy40/,1602383270,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1602377780.0,,

the doctor's name is nabarro, not navarro, although i suspect you didn't even read the article.

i'm frankly disgusted by the deliberate pushing of misinformation on this subreddit and, unfortunately, all over the internet. people like you and whoever wrote this headline are not just enemies of truth, but of humanity itself. you are the worst of us.

the WHO does not 'condemn' lockdowns. what is being said here is that lockdowns alone are ineffective and possibly deleterious if you don't follow them up with other measures. you merely end up in a yo-yo cycle.

nabarro does not speak for the entirety of the WHO. this should be obvious from his position, which is a special envoy to the WHO. you can also find that the WHO has not made any general proclamations in line with this and in fact has consistently said that their goal is avoid lockdowns if possible. the implication here being that they may be necessary to get things under control in some areas.

the supposedly great barrington declration says this:

&gt;The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk.

this is most assuredly NOT the position of the WHO. this much is obvious to anyone who has read the things the WHO puts out.

and further:

&gt;Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal. Simple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold. Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume. People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity.

you are lying. you are plainly deceiving people and i hope the mods ban you from ever posting here again.

Moderna develops vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA) to produce viral proteins in the body. They have yet to bring one to the market. In January, they began developing a vaccine for the coronavirus and since then the government has bankrolled Moderna’s efforts, providing nearly $1 billion. In partnership with National Institutes of Health, they found that the vaccine protects monkeys from the coronavirus. In March, the company put the first Covid-19 vaccine into human trials, which yielded promising results. The vaccine has progressed into Phase 3 testing, which began on July 27. The final trial is enrolling 30,000 healthy people at about 89 sites around the United States. On Aug. 11, the government awarded the company an additional $1.5 billion in exchange for 100 million doses if the vaccine proves safe and effective. Canada agreed in September to acquire 20 million doses.

In July, Moderna lost a patent dispute over some of their vaccine technology. The following month, the company stated that it could not be certain it was the first to make the inventions claimed in their patents, including its coronavirus vaccine.

On Sept. 17, Moderna shared their protocol for determining if their vaccine was safe and effective. They planned to wait until a significant number of volunteers became sick with Covid-19 and then see how many had been vaccinated. It may take till the end of 2020 or early 2021 to reach the necessary numbers.

PHASE 2 PHASE 3 COMBINED PHASES
BioNTech logoPfizer logoFosun Pharma logo
The German company BioNTech entered into collaborations with Pfizer, based in New York, and the Chinese drug maker Fosun Pharma to develop an mRNA vaccine to be given in two doses. In May they launched a Phase 1/2 trial on two versions of the vaccine. They found that both versions caused volunteers to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, as well as immune cells called T cells that respond to the virus. They found that one version, called BNT162b2, produced significantly fewer side effects, such as fevers and fatigue, and so they chose it to move into Phase 2/3 trials. On July 27, the companies announced the launch of a Phase 2/3 trial with 30,000 volunteers in the United States and other countries including Argentina, Brazil, and Germany. In an interim study, the companies reported that after getting the first dose, volunteers experience mostly mild to moderate side effects. On Sept. 12, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that they would seek to expand their U.S. trial to 43,000 participants.

In that same month, the Trump administration awarded a $1.9 billion contract for 100 million doses to be delivered by December and the option to acquire 500 million more doses. Meanwhile, Japan made a deal for 120 million doses, and the European Union arranged to purchase 200 million doses.

In September, the chief executive of Pfizer said they would know if the vaccine works as soon as October 2020. If approved, Pfizer has said they expect to manufacture over 1.3 billion doses of their vaccine worldwide by the end of 2021.

PHASE 3 APPROVED FOR LIMITED USE
CanSino Biologics logoAcademy of Military Medical Sciences logo
The Chinese company CanSino Biologics developed a vaccine based on an adenovirus called Ad5, in partnership with the Institute of Biology at the country’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences. In May, they published promising results from a Phase 1 safety trial, and in July they reported that their Phase 2 trials demonstrated the vaccine produced a strong immune response. In an unprecedented move, the Chinese military approved the vaccine on June 25 for a year as a “specially needed drug.” CanSino would not say whether vaccination would be mandatory or optional for soldiers. Starting in August, CanSino began running Phase 3 trials in a number of countries, including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Russia.
Updated Sept. 24

PHASE 3 APPROVED FOR EARLY USE
Gamaleya Research Institute logo
The Gamaleya Research Institute, part of Russia’s Ministry of Health, launched clinical trials in June of a vaccine they called Gam-Covid-Vac. It is a combination of two adenoviruses, Ad5 and Ad26, both engineered with a coronavirus gene.

On Aug. 11, President Vladimir V. Putin announced that a Russian health care regulator had approved the vaccine, renamed Sputnik V, before Phase 3 trials had even begun. Vaccine experts decried the move as risky, and Russia later walked back the announcement, saying that the approval was a “conditional registration certificate,” which would depend on positive results from Phase 3 trials. Those trials, initially planned for just 2,000 volunteers, were expanded to 40,000. On Sept. 4, three weeks after Putin’s announcement, Gamaleya researchers published the results of their Phase 1/2 trial. In a small study, they found that Sputnik yielded antibodies to the coronavirus and mild side effects. Meanwhile, Russia negotiated agreements to supply the vaccine to countries including Brazil, Mexico and India.

PHASE 3
Johnson &amp; Johnson logoBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center logo
A decade ago, researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston developed a method for making vaccines out of a virus called Adenovirus 26, or Ad26 for short. Johnson &amp; Johnson developed vaccines for Ebola and other diseases with Ad26 and have now made one for the coronavirus. In March they received $456 million from the United States government to support their move towards production. The vaccine has provided protection in experiments on monkeys. Johnson &amp; Johnson began Phase 1/2 trials in July and launched a Phase 3 trial with up to 60,000 participants in September.

In August, the federal government agreed to pay $1 billion for 100 million doses if the vaccine is approved. The company is aiming for production of at least a billion doses in 2021.
Updated Sept. 28

PHASE 2 PHASE 3 COMBINED PHASES
AstraZeneca logoUniversity of Oxford logo
A vaccine in development by the British-Swedish company AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford is based on a chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1. A study on monkeys found that the vaccine provided them protection. In May, the United States awarded the project $1.2 billion in support. In their Phase 1/2 trial, the vaccine developers did not detect any severe side effects. They found that the vaccine raised antibodies against the coronavirus as well as other immune defenses. The vaccine began Phase 2/3 trials in England and India, as well as Phase 3 trials in Brazil, South Africa, and the United States.

In August the European Union reached an agreement for AstraZeneca to deliver 400 million doses if the trials yield positive results. The company has said their total manufacturing capacity for the vaccine, if approved, stands at two billion doses. India’s Serum Institute has already produced millions of doses to be used in trials.

On Sept. 6, AstraZeneca halted global trials of the vaccine to investigate one volunteer, who developed a form of inflammation called transverse myelitis. Within a week, the trials began resuming. As of now, however, the United States is still keeping its trial on pause as the F.D.A. investigates.
Updated Oct. 7

PHASE 3
Novavax logo
Maryland-based Novavax makes vaccines by sticking proteins onto microscopic particles. They’ve taken on a number of different diseases this way; their flu vaccine finished Phase 3 trials in March. The company launched trials for a Covid-19 vaccine in May, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations has invested $384 million in the vaccine. In July the U.S. government awarded $1.6 billion to support the vaccine’s clinical trials and manufacturing.

After getting promising results from preliminary studies in monkeys and humans, Novavax launched a Phase 2 trial in South Africa in August. The blinded, placebo-controlled trial on 2,900 people will measure not just the safety of the vaccine but its efficacy. The following month, Novavax launched a Phase 3 trial enrolling up to 10,000 volunteers in the United Kingdom. It could potentially deliver results by the start of 2021. A larger Phase 3 trial is in development to launch in the United States in October.

If the trials succeed, Novavax expects to deliver 100 million doses for use in the United States by the first quarter of 2021. In September Novavax reached an agreement with the Serum Institute of India, a major vaccine manufacturer, that they said would enable them to produce as many as 2 billion doses a year.

If you’re a healthy adult without medical history then the nasal admin of the flu vaccine has no increased risk when compared to the typical intramuscular injection. 

If you are currently being treated for something that causes you to be/and/or are diagnosed to be immunosuppressed then you should get the IM injection. 

Flu stuff:

If you have an allergy to eggs, get a flu shot. 

If you have allergies to mercury, stop eating mercury if you haven’t already then go get a flu shot. (Or get your flu shot then quit the mercury eating). 

Immunosuppressed? Talk to your specialist over the phone quick then go get your flu shot. 

Are you aged 6? Get your flu shot. Are you older than a 6 year old? Get your flu shot? Are you ages 1-6? Talk to your pediatrician on the phone quick then go get your flu shot.

You may have noticed a trend here. If you’re over the age of 6 do not pass go, proceed to nearest flu clinic! 

If you’re concerned at all, call your local health advise line and then take their advise (spoiler: it’s go get a flu shot). 

If you or your child is under 6 then you or your child can likely still get the flu shot but just ask to be sure.

nabarro does not speak for the entirety of the WHO. this should be obvious from his position, which is a special envoy to the WHO. you can also find that the WHO has not made any general proclamations in line with this and in fact has consistently said that their goal is to avoid lockdowns if possible. the implication here being that they may be necessary to get things under control in some areas.

the supposedly great barrington declration says this:

&gt;The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk.

this is most assuredly NOT the position of the WHO. this much is obvious to anyone who has read the things the WHO puts out.

and further:

&gt;Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal. Simple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold. Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume. People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity.

If you don't know the case outcome of 6 of them, they are excluded.  They could very well have more severe symptoms or they could very well have lesser symptoms.  Read what I wrote originally.  ""50% of secondary exposure cases **with known outcomes**"".  You don't know what the outcomes are and to include unknown outcomes is completely and totally dishonest.

&gt;Those cases didn’t change, that was the number I was commenting on. According to you they don’t count but then why’d you say where were 22 cases?

There is no indication one way or the other as to whether they changed or not as THERE IS NO INFORMATION GIVEN.  Again, you're being completely and totally dishonest here.  And I said there are 22 known cases of reinfection.  This is true.  To gauge severity of reinfection, the only information we have to go on is the cases with known outcomes.  Not try to make some completely dishonest argument like you're trying to make.

&gt;I removed the term protective immunity because you were uselessly debating the semantics of it. It seems you can not be deterred from that.

Because they are the same thing in terms of how the immune system responds to challenge.  

&gt;No actually. My argument is that there’s no reason to think reinfection will present a dire problem.

So, reinfection with other known coronaviruses is a possibility due to short term protective immune responses as demonstrated in the Nature Medicine article, but for this one is somehow special?

The Executive, elected by the Board, can all be overthrown should they prove wasteful or compromising in achieving returns for the shareholders that the Board represents.

Most people.  I was making 6 figures before this and I saved most of my money instead of spending it lavishly, which I see a lot of people around me doing constantly.

&gt;Who’s asking YOU to give up anything?

Anyone who says ""going back to work instead of demanding government aid is a solution to a viral epidemic"" is telling every member of society to go back to work.

So you did.

Poor people should be demanding aid, not work.

&gt;No one cares if you stay home. But continual and rolling lockdowns, as is happening and continues to be threatened all across the world will cause hunger and deep poverty.

No, a government refusing to aid you is causing that.  If you open businesses, those businesses are going to be sued out of existence within a few years because you can't just wish away the deadly virus you're telling poor people to infect themselves with.

We have enough food to feed everyone.  The issue isn't a lack of labor force, it's a lack of will from the government to get it to the people who need it.

&gt;You can call people lazy, stupid, or stubborn, because they don’t have the options you may have.

Most people in the US have (or had) the option to save, they just choose not to.

&gt;That’s fine, that’s your opinion and you’re welcome to have it from the comfort of your home.

The brain fog makes my attention span super short.

I used to be a big stickler about there/they’re/their, to/too/two, etc. I would’ve *never* gotten that wrong before, but now I’ve caught myself doing it more and more. 

Being “smart” was a big part of who I was, not only to myself, but to other people. Now I feel dumb in front of them. It’s frustrating for my husband too because I forget things he asks me to do, I can’t follow shows/movies he wants to watch together, and we can’t really have conversations about complex topics as easily as we used to.

People are now Republicans before Americans, or Democrats, or whatever other party/word. There's too much ""us vs them"" or ""insert other group is taking from me"" or whatever. There used to be a sense of solidarity (history of horrific racism, sexism, and the like aside) that has completely gone out the window. People no longer care about what is best for America or Americans, their community as a whole, or people as a whole - they care about people like them, that think the way they do, that believe the things they believe. It's a dangerous precedent and is sending us down a dark road. If you think things are bad now - and they are - wait and see where we're at ten years from now if nothing significant changes.

I desperately hope that Biden wins and makes sweeping changes, but half of his job (if not more) is going to be undoing damage rather than making any actual progress based on where we were before this, and another part of me is terrified that it's just going to radicalize the other side even more. The things that have become normal - government bodies outright scheming against eachother, willingly hurting the population to strike a blow to the opposition party, and everything else is just another example of what I said - affiliation now comes first. Being an American is now in the back seat to being a member of a certain party, group, belief, religion, or whatever else.

What makes it worse is the blind belief that were the best country in the world just by default. That it doesn't take continuous effort and hard work, that we just are and always will be and because of that we can do no wrong and everything is justified. The delusion that the rest of the world still looks at us as some shining light of leadership and democracy is beyond me.

At the end of the day I still wonder if some of these people genuinely believe the things they tout or if they know it's ridiculous insanity but stick to it because it personally benefits them somehow. It's hard to believe that people can be so absurdly stupid, hateful, xenophobic, racist, or any other of the thousand terms that describes shit going down.

To the people that disagree - that's totally cool, you're entitled to your opinion.

&gt;But not every scientific medical study is a drug trial, and I believe that is what you are demanding: you are demanding that observations of illness be exclusively tied to double-blind drug studies, and no other observations can ever be used or considered valid.

I'm certainly not, Fauci is.  See above.  An RCT for Covid long term sequela would use two groups randomly chosen to receive either a placebo or the virus, then followed over time tracking symptoms.  That kind of study Fauci thinks wouldn't be flawed as it's randomized, placebo-controlled and blinded.  Anything short of that, according to Fauci, is flawed and so might as well be ignored, even if peer-reviewed.

Hilariously though, Fauci says masks work and demands we all wear them, and laws are passed to enforce this, even though no placebo-controlled randomized trial showing they are effective for the prevention of Covid-19 exist, nor for 6 feet of social distancing.

Maybe? At least in the US, some large corporations got on the social distancing / masks bandwagon before the governments did, while others tried to keep the status quo. (By your mention of visiting castles I'm going to guess you might be elsewhere?)

Examples I'd give for the former include Microsoft and Google (they had their employees in Seattle working from home around a week before the Seattle mayor or Washington state governor announced stay-at-home orders) and Wal-mart and Costco (they had nationwide distancing / mask policies in their stores before the US federal government said anything official).

For an example of the latter, Boeing tried to keep their airplane factories running at full speed as long as possible even with massive outcry from employees.

Because 20% of retail every year happens in the Christmas season.  
Lots of shops are going do go down if they don't sell anything.  
And if it's all online, I'm not sure DHL and UPS can manage to deliver all of that.

Will families be able to meet?  
Because lockdowns don't allow meetings. And there are travel restrictions inside Germany already.

What about Christmas season?  
Usually before Christmas, all the schools, clubs and workplaces do social events, with Secret Santa games and nativity plays galore.

What about church services?  
I know churches had planned to hold their Christmas services in stadiums, but even that looks too dangerous now.

I am someone who suffers from OCD and as a result am very, very careful in every area of my life to avoid contracting the virus. However, I'm in the US visiting my husband for a few weeks and quickly used a public water fountain yesterday when we were in a park. The water pressure was low, I let it run for a few seconds, and I put my mouth near the stream and sucked it up without letting my mouth touch the faucet.

However, I'm now of course scared that I contracted something from that interaction. The anxiety over it is consuming me despite the fact that it seems unlikely - my mouth didn't touch the faucet, there was nobody around when we were there, and surface contact is an unlikely way of catching it. I went today to get a free test just to be safe in general and was told that it seemed unlikely, unless I was near someone who is confirmed to have it and they were breathing in my vicinity.

However, I still worry. Is my worry justified? I understand all I can do is wait, but as someone with OCD I often waste time blowing things out of proportion.

Abstract
Abstract Background Convalescent plasma, widely utilized in viral infections that induce neutralizing antibodies, has been proposed for COVID-19, and preliminary evidence shows that it might have beneficial effect. Our objective was to compare epidemiological characteristics and outcomes between patients who received convalescent plasma for COVID-19 and those who did not, admitted to hospitals in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, throughout the pandemic. Methods This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 2-month duration beginning on June 1, 2020, including unselected, consecutive adult patients with diagnosed COVID-19, admitted to 215 hospitals with pneumonia. Epidemiological and clinical variables were registered in the Provincial Hospital Bed Management System. Convalescent plasma was supplied as part of a centralized, expanded access program. Results We analyzed 3,529 patients with pneumonia, predominantly male, aged 62±17, with arterial hypertension and diabetes as main comorbidities; 51.4% were admitted to the ward, 27.1% to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and 21.7% to the ICU with mechanical ventilation requirement (ICU-MV). 28-day mortality was 34.9%; and was 26.3%, 30.1% and 61.4% for ward, ICU and ICU-MV patients. **Convalescent plasma was administered to 868 patients (24.6%); their 28-day mortality was significantly lower (25.5% vs. 38.0%, p&lt;0.001).** No major adverse effects occurred. Logistic regression analysis identified age, ICU admission with and without MV requirement, diabetes and preexistent cardiovascular disease as independent predictors of 28-day mortality, whereas convalescent plasma administration acted as a protective factor. Conclusions Our study suggests that the administration of convalescent plasma in CO",,,1602385299,{},g8f5lvn,True,t3_j8xt75,False,True,t3_j8xt75,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8xt75/effect_of_convalescent_plasma_on_mortality_in/g8f5lvn/,1602392140,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

At home?  No, though if I had cold symptoms during a pandemic?  Yes, I would isolate and wear one.

Right now, except for one in store TJ (which enforces mask wearing) shopping trip every six weeks or so, we don't go in stores or anyplace inside that has other people.  Contractkess pick up for anything that is some version of Amazon or Instacsrt, and mostly amazon cause instacart charges fees.

I used to do more local shopping st the start, too many dick noses or small children without masks at even the stores that try to enforce.

Last trip to TJ, there was one child under 2 without a mask. And that was it.  And the mom had the kid in a cart and was trying to social distance instead of letting the child run rampant.

For me?  I have had pneumonia, twice, I have damaged lungs, so, masks and avoiding those who don't care about others is my only choice.

But I used to shop locally, we used to do takeout, we used to care about the survival of local businesses.  I don't anymore - if my life isn't worth enforcing wearing a mask, then going out if my way to spend my money there isn't worth it.

Teachers don't know what to do and we students are worried, especially since after our finals in december most of us will have to come home to our family, so right after spending two weeks in packed rooms.

It's even worse in other school. There is no distancing for younger students, and in a lot of schools you can barely open the windows. 
There are a lot of sick teachers from what I heard. Kids under 11 aren't required to wear masks. 

In my field at uni, we know 6 teachers got sick this week. We have yet to know if it is the covid or not. There is no communication around cases. You don't even have to report that you're sick if you're a student. Presence is mandatory, especially if you have a scholarship fund and don't want to lose it.

""Visit indoors and outdoors, respectively If possible, visits should primarily be received outdoors. If one visits need to be received indoors, it should be especially considered that it can set higher demands on what measures need to be taken for the visit must be able to be carried out in a safe manner.""

Go to the end of this long post for more context and translation. 

Regarding GDP and economy I think its very complicated. Swedens economy is probably more similar to Germanys then its neighbours since it is a export nation. The simple fact is that the Swedish is economy is doing about 50% better then eu average. (but like you say its more complicated than that) some countries took on a huge dept to boast their GDP aswell. 

I believe that the best comparison when you discuss economy is to compare with yourself. And what you could do with they resources saved. For example
Sweden is expected to have saved several billions - per day - by not shutting down schools, at the same time they have promised to do the largest investment ever in elderlycare. According to the UN Sweden already have the best elderlycare in the world. So you could argue that not shutting down schools might actually also save elderly people in the long run. 

I appriciate that Germany took childrens health into conaideration, some countries didnt do this. Thats one of the reasons why i think Germany had a really good and humane response. 

Regarding the consumer spending thing its actually seen as a argument that Swedens volontarely recomendations was as effective as locking people up using police/military force. 

Here is a google translate of parts of the recomendations regarding ban on elderlycare visits. 

Regarding demonstrations I agree with you. like I said its complicated, when someone wants to demonstrate they tell the police and they might say to you: "" Yes you can do it or yes you can do it but not at that time etc"" . Usually organisers follow the police suggestions. But if they dont they are still allowed to hold the demo. The difference between holding a demo endorsed by the police and not endorsed is very complicated. 

The BLM protests diring the blanket 50 person ban for example has not been endorsed by the police but they have also not been forbidden. 

Now there have been no demonstrations against (or for) corona restrictions like there have been in other countries (including germany i think? ). So there have been no reason for them to try to shut them down. 

 ""Visit indoors and outdoors, respectively If possible, visits should primarily be received outdoors. If one visits need to be received indoors, it should be especially considered that it can set higher demands on what measures need to be taken for the visit must be able to be carried out in a safe manner. Support contact with relatives The staff in the accommodation should, if necessary, provide support and assistance to the residents and relatives who wish to have contact through visits. If it is not possible to receive visits securely, it should housing as far as possible get support and help for contact in other ways than through visits, e.g. by phone or video link. Circumstances for granting exemptions from restraining orders Indoor Circumstances that may justify exemption from the ban on visits which need to be done indoors can e.g. be - need for visits in connection with end-of-life care, Need for a visit from a visitor who has an incurable non-communicable disease and self is in the final stages of life, and - in case of strong anxiety in the resident who is not judged to be relieved other than through the visit. A resident's strong concerns may need special consideration in connection with moving into the accommodation, after discharge from inpatient care or when it residents have a dementia disease with strong anxiety as a symptom""",,,1602408622,{},g8gl9hi,False,t3_j8z70g,False,True,t1_g8gjcv2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8z70g/swedens_gamble_science/g8gl9hi/,1602411700,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1602411606.0,,

[],,Alien_Illegal,,,[],,,,text,t2_15v0g2,False,False,[],"&gt; That’s incorrect. You definitely would because the immune system isn’t perfect. People die from the common cold despite people typically having protective immunity.

It is correct.  I really don't know why you think that people have long lasting protective immunity against coronaviruses.  That isn't the case.  

&gt;Well first of all .00005% of all cases is really nothing to draw any conclusions from. That number alone suggests there is sterilizing immunity that lasts at least as long as the virus has been around.

As I've stated before, 

&gt;The bar to confirm reinfection is very high. There needs to be a stored sample from the first infection and the second infection. Both of these samples need to be sequenced and the viral genomes need to be sufficiently different. There's the possibility a person can be reinfected with the same virus. However, there's no way to tell if the genomes aren't different. Additionally, not a whole heck of a lot of people are having their samples stored (which is why we see reinfections often in health care workers whose samples are more likely to be stored if they are doing internal testing).

&gt;Secondly if 50% worse symptoms means there is no protective immunity what does the other 50% mean?

The 50% were the cases that were worse upon reinfection.  81% were symptomatic both times.  

&gt;Thirdly it isn’t 50%, it’s 36%. 8 out of 22.  Same symptoms: 11 (50%) (72% of which are no symptoms) Worse symptoms: 8 (36%) Less symptoms: 3 (13%)

Math...and case history...learn it.  There are 16 cases with known outcomes.   You don't get to count the ones that say N/A as having ""no symptoms.""  The N/A means not available, as in not known.  8 worse, 3 less, 5 the same.  That's 50% with worse symptoms.  18.7% with milder symptoms.  31% with the same symptoms.  

&gt;You’re the one drawing conclusions from nothing. The history of coronaviruses is one of essentially permanent protective immunity. With no evidence to contradict this there is no reason to assume this will be any different.

Literally all evidence points to no permanent protective immunity against coronaviruses.  https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1083-1  

&gt; In our study, we monitored reinfections, which can occur only when protective immunity (cellular and/or humoral) is insufficient. We show that reinfections by natural infection occur for all four seasonal coronaviruses, suggesting that it is a common feature for all human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Reinfections occurred most frequently at 12 months after infection, indicating that protective immunity is only short-lived.

Perhaps you don't know enough about the immune system and are confusing protective immunity and cellular immunity?  Protective immunity tends to be mediated by B cells and the antibody response.  Cellular immunity is mediated by the T cell response.  However, cellular immunity, by the very nature of the T cell response, indicates that reinfection is possible as the T cell response requires already infected cells for activation.  From the time of re-infection, it's a race as to whether or not immune clearance is fast enough before symptoms appear.",,,1602425753,{},g8hm7br,False,t3_j8j0ur,False,True,t1_g8g7fsw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8j0ur/global_study_of_hospitalized_patients_confirms/g8hm7br/,1602425890,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

This confirms all that I have been saying, and all that the experts have been saying - Offit, Fauci, Redfield, etc. **It's not over when the vaccine arrives**. 

For starters, the vaccine won't even come to the public until summer 2021, or maybe spring if we're *really* lucky. Until then, we're *definitely* not lifting any restrictions. Think about it: the virus doesn't know whether it's 2020 or 2021, does it? It doesn't magically decide to give you all a break when you've had a year of pandemic fatigue, right? But that's another story.

Even after the rollout of a vaccine (and by that, I mean *to the general public* in summer, NOT the emergency use authorization in winter or spring), however, we *ought to* continue what we are doing, with mask usage and spaced out social distancing and whatnot, so that our society is constantly reminded - as it is now, at least in most parts - that **we are still in the middle of a pandemic**, and - perhaps this is the ***most important takeaway*** - that ***we are NEVER returning to ""old normal""***.

Of course it’s the case. 

&gt; As I've stated before,
 
&gt; The bar to confirm reinfection is very high. There needs to be a stored sample from the first infection and the second infection. 

The facts are what we know, not what they could possibly be. 

&gt; The 50% were the cases that were worse upon reinfection.  81% were symptomatic both times.

8 is not 50% of 22. 

&gt; Math...and case history...learn it.  There are 16 cases with known outcomes.   You don't get to count the ones that say N/A as having ""no symptoms”.

Sure I can. I can’t say they’re asymptomatic but I can say there are no symptoms.

&gt; Literally all evidence points to no permanent protective immunity against coronaviruses.  https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1083-1

Beyond the title the article doesn’t seem relevant. It discusses immunity from reinfection, not protection from the disease. 

&gt; Perhaps you don't know enough about the immune system and are confusing protective immunity and cellular immunity?  

Maybe. Nothing I’m saying is really dependent on it though. What I’m talking about is whether or not there’s any reason to think covid will be as severe in the future as it is now.

Sometimes vaccines are ""protective"", in which case they only prevent some infections, but can reduce symptom severity in the infections they failed to prevent, for example flu and chickenpox vaccines. The seasonal flu vaccine is estimated to reduce symptom severity in about 80% of the cases that it could not prevent.

The phase 1/2 data for the current COVID vaccine candidates have ranged from very good to spectacular. Most of them produced sterilizing antibodies nearly 100% of the time (the lowest was 92%), so I am very hopeful that the COVID vaccines will be more sterilizing than protective. However, only phase 3 data can say for sure whether the antibody results translate into real-world effectiveness.

In the case that the vaccines cannot achieve sterilizing effect, it should still be protective, and people who are infected after vaccination should have less symptoms than non-vaccinated people, and therefore be less infectious We know from the large Chinese contact tracing study that infectiousness is directly correlated to symptom severity. /r/COVID19/comments/iccj85/contact_settings_and_risk_for_transmission_in/ The probability that a patient infected their close contact was 0.3%, for asymptomatic, 3.3% for mild, 5.6% for moderate, and 6.2%for severe or critical cases.

&gt; October 7, 2020
&gt; 
&gt; Dear USA Hockey Family:
&gt; 
&gt; We hope this finds you and your loved ones well and enjoying the Fall. It’s been a challenging time for all of us navigating our way through the pandemic, but the positive attitude of the hockey community has certainly been inspiring.
&gt; 
&gt; PROTECTING EACH OTHER
&gt; With the 2020-21 season getting up and running in many places across the country, we wanted to take the chance to reinforce the importance of following local and state guidelines related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a whole, our hockey community has done a terrific job in this regard, but we do get some reports of people not following guidelines. It’s important we all do our part and continue to make sure we wash our hands regularly, sanitize equipment, social distance and wear masks (and wear them properly) according to the guidelines.
&gt; 
&gt; To help ensure everyone has access to the benefits our sport provides – including physical, social and mental – we must remain vigilant in our efforts to minimize the opportunity for the spread of the virus in our hockey family. We understand that conditions and regulations vary across the country, and while we know frustrations exist, let’s continue to work together for the good of all.
&gt; 
&gt; TO OUR ADVANTAGE
&gt; While we know that there are no activities that are risk free as we navigate this pandemic, there are some key factors within our sport that contribute to safety. Consider - 
&gt;     Hockey players are covered in equipment head to toe (unlike most other sports).
&gt;     Ice rinks have significant HVAC systems to regularly circulate fresh air into the facility.
&gt;     USA Hockey provides a controlled environment with players having to register and those players rostered on a team.  It is known exactly who is on the ice; groups are together for the season; and there is no co-mingling.
&gt;     Studies show players are within a six-foot radius of another player for less than three minutes per game. Players are on average on “immediate proximity” (actual contact with another player) for under two seconds per incident.
&gt;     With the significant size of the playing surface and facilities, there are responsible ways forward to conduct the sport keeping social distancing and hygiene at the forefront.
&gt; 
&gt; MATERIALS TO HELP
&gt; In conjunction with input from a wide group of stakeholders, including medical professionals, affiliates, and our rinks partners, among others, USA Hockey has published Return to the Rinks Guidelines and Mitigating Risks Recommendations, along with other resources, to assist programs across the country in safely returning to the sport in relation to COVID-19.

Streets were packed with people most with no masks on, restaurants and bars, even concert halls.  To quote the journalist it’s like covid never even happened there.  Now, they have a population much bigger than the US with huge cities and metropolises.  So how did they beat the virus so effectively?  Through “draconian measures?”  But those only lasted 2 months, and they’re home free now.  Instead we’ve gone 7 months with partial shut downs.  And what did it get us?  We still have tons of new cases daily, and highest in the world deaths per day.  I’m afraid this will never go away until we finally take the kids gloves off and decide to do a very strict lockdown.  In fact it’s very important to lock down to make the vaccine work.

It’s not too late to get this done.  We can start the lockdown after the vaccine is released and introduce vaccine badges.  In order to be outside of your home you either have to present a vaccine badge, or an appointment that you’re on your way to get vaccinated.  To buy airline tickets, make hotel reservations, order online any goods etc, attend school, etc you have to present the vaccine badge.  To enforce this we need to use drones and AI.  Each badge has a tracker so if the drone detects movement and no tracker, police are automatically dispatched to quarantine the movement.

# Known Issues

While we believe our model is very strong, all models have limitations because they reduce a complex reality into a simple system. You should be aware of the following limitations of this model when interpreting the results:

* Our model relies upon valid data from COVIDTracking.com, and they in turn rely on states to provide timely and accurate data as well. Unfortunately, data can be noisy, incorrect, delayed, and otherwise wrong. While on average, we believe the data to be correct, there are times when an errant datapoint throws the model off. Please let us know if you see an instance of this.
* Our model attempts to correct for testing by looking at what is essentially the positivity rate. This positivity rate changes over time because the group of people tested changes. If anything, our model may understate Rt currently because far more people without symptoms are tested, thus driving the positive percentage down and overstating a downward trend in cases.
* Our model relies upon a distribution for the delay between infection and reported positive test. Most of the data used to generate this distribution is from Germany and a handful of other countries – it is quite possible this delay distribution may look very different in the US and state by state.",,,1602427498,{},g8hp4n3,False,t3_j95kqs,False,True,t3_j95kqs,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j95kqs/anyone_know_why_rtlive_hasnt_updated_since_108_at/g8hp4n3/,1602427509,1,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

&gt;Mr Tegnell himself is keeping an open mind. “Face masks can be a complement to other things when other things are safely in place. But to start with having face masks and then think you can crowd your buses or your shopping malls — that’s definitely a mistake,” he said, adding that countries such as Belgium and Spain with widespread mask use still had rising infection rates

&gt;""As the ECDC \[European Centre for Disease Control\] and WHO \[World Health Organisation\] and others write, there might be situations where face masks might be a good addition to other things; when you see an outbreak starting up, if you have places where you can't avoid crowding and so on, there might be a need for face masks if you see your epidemiology moving in a direction that is unfavourable.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Right now in Sweden we have a fairly sharp decrease of cases. Adding a face mask in this situation is maybe not the right move. If we see problems again, of course we will look at face masks as we will look at other measures and see if there are situations where they might make a difference. Once again we need to remember that face masks to protect you from getting ill if you belong to a risk group, is not a very safe way of looking at it.""

===

You are again using Norway as example. But the difference in the death rates between Norway and Sweden is not indicative of the effectiveness (or not) of masks to prevent deaths, since from the time when this difference in death rates was accumulated neither country used masks. 

Also, you will find that Tegnell has spoken at what other countries are doing only when asked by the media or that country's officials. In fact, it has been repeatedly said that measures implemented in a certain country might not be applicable to another or even in the regions in the same country.

Which had a medical professional apply a mask to one of nine patients and have them cough in the direction of a 3.5 inch dish.  First they coughed without a mask, then with an N95, then with surgical, then again without.  They then tested the dishes with a cycle threshold of up to 40.

Patients had their flu diagnosis confirmed by achieving a positive PCR with a threshold between 22 and 31, based on a nasal swab. 
 They were generally able to infect the petri dish 8inches in front of them, one sixth of the time with a cycle threshold between 25 and 30, one third of the time at a cycle threshold between 31 and 37, and half the time at the cycle threshold of 38 and above.

Is coughing on a small dish, and then throwing away that mask, a good way to judge the total ability for a person to be infectious, in the context of the real world?

Can you imagine someone breathing on the mask, touching it and then touching other things without washing their hands?  Can you imagine the particles going in other directions, and accumulating to such a degree that the virus continues to spread?

First the reason for the pandemic spreading worldwide is because of Chinese authoritarianism and incompetence. They initially tried to suppress the pandemic and cover it up. They jailed doctors and whistleblowers and lost vital time while trying to save face. Furthermore they stopped flights from Wuhan internally but allowed the virus to spread across the world. It’s possible that with clear and transparent governance there would be no pandemic. 

After the SARS epidemic in 2003 the World Health Organization drew up a list of guidelines for handling such problems. China is supposed to notify them of new diseases within 24 hours. Instead they failed to blow the whistle and just covered up the pandemic.

Another problem is China has sealed itself off from the world for the time being. Are they going to remain closed forever with strict entry requirements. The pandemic is just beginning.

The worst part of studies is they are looking backward - and with something as dynamic as COVID that's especially poor.

Truth is, to many populations COVID can be compared to other diseases. In my state 14 people die each day from respiratory disease - before COVID. The regular population (those without serious existing health problems) are dying at about 1 a week from COVID.

If course it is different - but at the same time can be discussed as largely a respiratory disease that is especially danger (at like 100X or 1000X the rate) for the very elderly and people with serious underlying conditions.

For a slight take on this - here in MA where our public health system is tops in the nation (maybe one or the best in the world), only 1.8% of deaths are of people without underlying conditions - AND, those people are probably elderly (avg age 82).

On one hand it is a novel virus. On the other hand, I see more people who are wrong on the other side of the equation - that is, acting or speaking as if it is more dangerous to the general healthy population than it is. 

1.8% of the approx 10K deaths in MA would be180 dead over a 6 month period. 

160 die in MA every day from other causes - and 14 from respiratory.

In general, phobia will invoke fight or flight responses, spiking your blood pressure to be able to do those things more effectively.  Blood/needle injury phobia are different.  Your body overreacts to a blood loss event (or the thought of one); in the case of an actual major blood loss event, your BP will plummet, attempting to slow your body from bleeding out.  You can keep your BP elevated artificially by flexing large muscle groups in your body while you're getting the blood draw.  Thighs, core, biceps: keep 'em clenched.

Again, a line meant to scare the public. These experts should be more clear if they want to be taken seriously. Give examples, and let the public decide if we are going to agree with moving forward in this direction or not.

Someone in another comment said it, and I agree. At this point it’s just the news outlets trying to scare the public with click bait articles.

I don't think you agree with even your premise that the numeric alone stand as a valid complete layer of policy making analysis. Compared to cardiovascular diseases, far fewer people die from murder. Or fires. Or divorce disputes. Or organised crime. Or robbery. Or terrorism. Or war. Or natural disasters. None of that stops us from pouring in huge amounts of money and other resources and building extensive societal structures around these issues, often inconveniencing people by quite a bit. And surely you disagree that murdering an 85-year old or a prisoner to be legally executed in the next hour isn't murder.

Also, neither red meat nor sugar is infectious and capable of uncontrolled contagion. Nor have I heard such a thing as superspreaders for these.

You are partly right. These are the new things: 

•	⁠A strong reminder of the recommendation to work from home if possible. And enforcing this in the whole public sector. (This recommendation was always there, but went out of fashion pretty quickly when we opened up in may).

•	⁠Not allowing bars and restaurants to be open late.

•	⁠No public gatherings of more than 50 people. (Down from 500 I believe). 

•	⁠Mask use in bars and restaurants when not seated.

And then the whole test strategy is something that is scaled up or down or reinforced in specific regions according to current needs. 

Personally I wouldn’t have minded a slightly tougher hammer to beat it down rather than just stabilising it. But I think they hope to achieve this through even more and better testing and contact tracing: 

A new test strategy was announced a few days ago to prepare us for winter. The main change is that capacity is enlarged to 70-80.000 tests per day (now it’s 50.000) and 100.000 tests per day when really needed. It also should be more proactive and mobile, more easily and quickly available and with quicker answers and a better fast track for special groups that needs it.

“We are at the beginning of a second wave and only the politicians’ and the population’s determination will decide whether or not we can avoid it, or slow it down,” he added.

------

Merkel and mayors from Germany’s 11 largest cities agreed on Friday to adopt stricter measures if infections exceed a threshold of 50 cases per 100,000 population in a week.

More than 20 cities are now above that level, which has caused a patchwork of internal travel restrictions.

Braun, a medical doctor, said test centres should prioritise health sector workers and people showing symptoms over tourists.

Holidaymakers can circumvent the local travel curbs if they produce negative test results.


Bavaria’s prime minister, Markus Soeder, at the weekend proposed steeper fines for people not wearing masks where mandated in places such as public transport and shops -- of 250 euros ($295.60) compared with the current 50 euros, and 500 euros for repeat offenders.",,,1602445545,{},g8iofpz,True,t3_j9bzwr,False,True,t3_j9bzwr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j9bzwr/germans_must_reduce_travel_partying_to_fight/g8iofpz/,1602447284,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

My mother talks like this now.  She got COVID back in June and was sick enough to have to be hospitalized for a week.  She managed to bounce back by August and she seems to be in good spirits now.  But whenever I talk to her, she will say stuff exactly like the quote above and not even skip a beat.  I help her find her words without making a big deal over it, because I don't want to make her feel bad.  But it concerns me a whole lot.  A year ago I could go weeks without talking to my mother.  But now I call her multiple times a week just to make sure she gets some intellectual stimulation and to see if her brain has gotten any worse from the last time we talked.  She doesn't know that I'm doing this.  She just thinks I'm calling to say hey.

And this why I'm terrified of getting COVID. I'm a scientist.  I'm in the prime of my career.  I don't have another income to depend on if I should lose my marbles.  I already have a brain that challenges me, being someone who suffers from Tourette's syndrome and dyspraxia.

&gt; Let’s say Donald Trump’s right and we get a vaccine before Election Day. The pandemic will magically go away and we can get back to normal, right?

&gt; Well, not really. In fact, according to a panel of experts at the Cap Times Idea Fest, we’ll be masking and social distancing for some time to come. And when things get back to normal, it won’t be the same normal we’re used to.

&gt; “**It’s not going to be like somebody switches a switch and all of a sudden everything’s back to normal**,” said James Conway, medical director for immunization programs at UW Health. “I think it’s going to be a gradual process as we march through this.”

&gt; ...

&gt; All three experts dispelled the notion that a vaccine will take us back to pre-COVID times. It will take some time, possibly years, to get enough people vaccinated to eradicate the virus.

&gt; ...

&gt; ***But even if the vaccine puts the brakes on COVID, the old normal isn’t likely to be the new normal.***

&gt; “It may be the case that even in the presence of a vaccine you still wouldn’t want to pack conference rooms with people like we used to do before for medical conferences or shake hands,” Safdar said. “I think some of those behaviors are likely going to go away for the long term.”

&gt; **There could be substantial public health benefits with building social distancing into business as usual.** For instance, in Australia, where the flu season is ending, cases of the flu — which kills tens of thousands of Americans each year — hit record lows because of measures put in place to combat COVID.

&gt; ...

&gt; “Ultimately, the best vaccine may be years out and take the more traditional timeline to be developed,” said Conway. “I think people should kind of look at this as phases.”

&gt; Then there are a significant number of people who will resist the vaccine, either because of skepticism of the fast-tracked approval process or because of a general anti-vaccine mindset. Polling in August showed that 35% of Americans would not be willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19, while many scientists say that 60% to 70% of the population needs to be immune to achieve “herd immunity,” the point at which the virus can’t find enough hosts to survive.

Oh, so maybe the reinfection rate is even lower. Somehow that doesn’t occur to you.  The facts we know are that there are *22* cases now. Of course there are probably more but there are also probably more non-reinfectiom cases too. We only know the numbers we know and it doesn’t matter why. 

&gt; But you've already had this pointed out to you twice and it was in the article.  You are aware and are misrepresenting things anyways so you can support your preconceived ideas that you started with instead of learning and growing when things are presented to you.

I have not misrepresented anything. All I’ve said is that based on the facts as we know them we can conclude nothing other than reinfection is possible, which is not unexpected nor concerning in itself.  The only preconception I’ve made is that this is likely to act as other coronaviruses have.

The future is not all white and rosy. Lots of people lost their jobs due to COVID-19 (i.e. not the lockdowns), and the Brexit decision. We need to cooperate if we want to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and build a better society. 

*When the pandemic is over, we are not going back to normal.** The release of a vaccine for COVID-19 will not transport us back to 2019; that's the *last* thing we want, actually. This pandemic is the perfect opportunity to launch widespread social and economic change, so that we can fix all the previous underlying chronic ills and disgraces with society. We can rethink how we get our energy; with this goal in mind, we will invest 160 million pounds in wind turbine manufacturing, so that we can successfully run on wind power by 2030. 

We shall improve testing and contact tracing for *the next few years*, and extend the furlough scheme. Doing so will help solve the unemployment crisis. Just opening up will not. The reason for this is because all that would do is cause COVID-19 cases and deaths counts to surge and overwhelm our country again. The people who think like that are too short-sighted. The sooner we accept that the status quo ante of 2019 is not returning, the more progress we can make in the long run.

Going back to normal is not enough. What we lost during the pandemic has been too much. There is too much hardship for us to even *think* about going back to normal. Think of this as a lesson for everyone to learn, not as a repair effort. Again, if we want to make this world a better place for future generations of English people, *we need to cooperate* to Build Back Britain.

[],,Sport_is_life,,,[],,,,text,t2_4mi21fds,False,False,[],"I have made this assumption a few months ago but I feel as it’s worth of repeating it again.  There is a recent case of teenage COVID death in North Dakota - it was a 17 year old girl (VERY YOUNG). I glanced at the article picture and I don’t mean to be rude but this girl was severly obese. I think it is not a coincidence that severly overweight or obese people are more prone to general diseases like diabetes or hypertension and it seems like it can give you a hard time if you catch Covid or even kill you (knock on wood). I’m medical school student and my proffesor of Internal medicine compares being obese to having a mild but constant general inflammation of the whole body (yes whole body that means your eyes, brain, heart, lungs, liver,kidneys and so on). This is a generalization but it also has a practical meaning - if you get a systemic or infectious disease then the fact of being obese makes matters worse for you because obesity to put it in layman’s terms worsens one’s ability to fight off the disease and the consequences can be quite dramatic. The obesity problem is not only exclusive to America but it has become a global problem in the last few decades. Here in Europe every 1 in 2 adults on average is overweight or obese, that’s fucking 50% that’s a humongous amount of fat people, this means a larger amount of deaths from cardiovascular, oncologic and other diseases, this means a larger strain on health service which has a limited supplies, this means a larger strain on your country’s budget which is also limited... You can see where I’m going. Nowadays you can’t say to anyone that he’s fat because you will get jumped by milions of snowflakes who will slaughter you for fat shaming. This and the whole idea of „plus size models” has dramatic consequences because it sends a false message to already obese or fat people that it’s okay to be a fatass so what they do is stop thinking about their diet habits and they don’t even try to fix it. This results in ever growing number of fat fucks and worsening of general health of the society. I have watched a documentary about my country dating 50 years ago.  What I noticed is the fact that back then seeing obese people was really rare, like 95% people were in healthy weight range and slim.  Nowadays medicine is more advanced than 50 years ago and will still continue to get more advanced in the future but just think of it HOW MUCH HEALTHIER the general society would be if 95% people would be in the right weight range. Fifty years ago it was possible so why wouldn’t it be today? We should talk more about this problem and raise the peoples’ awareness that being a fat fuck is not only a matter of individuals will but also has and indirect effect on country’s health care and finances. We should tell this people: „Hey you are a fat fuck but it is not too late to change your life, you don’t have to go to the gym to lose weight, hell you don’t even have to go for a walk few times a week (although recommended) all you must do is fix your shitty diet habits and put the fork down and you will go back to healthy weight range”. Lastly we should realise how much of disservice is served by this retarded people who tell the general public that being obese/overweight, well it is not you mongs it is labeled as medical condition/illness and has dramatic consequences in many matter on which I elaborated above.",,,1602428919,{},g8hrgz0,False,t3_j95qws,False,True,t3_j95qws,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j95qws/daily_discussion_post_october_11_questions_images/g8hrgz0/,1602428930,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Abstract  
-
It is increasingly recognized that SARS-CoV-2 can produce long-term complications after recovery from the acute effects of infection. Here, we report the analysis of 32 self-reported short and long-term symptoms in a general adult population cohort comprised of 233 COVID-19+ cases, 3,652 SARS-CoV-2-negative controls, and 17,474 non-tested individuals. The majority of our COVID-19+ cases are mild, with only 8 of the 233 COVID-19+ cases having been hospitalized. **Our results show that 43.4% of COVID-19+ cases have symptoms lasting longer than 30 days, and 24.1% still have at least one symptom after 90 days. These numbers are higher for COVID-19+ cases who were initially more ill, 59.4% at 30 days and 40.6% at 90 days, but even for very mild and initially asymptomatic cases, 14.3% have complications persist for 30 days or longer.** In contrast, only 8.6% of participants from the general untested population develop new symptoms lasting longer than 30 days due to any illness during the same study period. **The long-term symptoms most enriched in those with COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, difficulty concentrating, dyspnea, memory loss, confusion, headache, heart palpitations, chest pain, pain with deep breaths, dizziness, and tachycardia. We additionally observe that individuals who had an initial symptom of dyspnea are significantly more likely to develop long-term symptoms.** Importantly, our study finds that the overall level of illness is an important variable to account for when assessing the statistical significance of symptoms that are associated with COVID-19. Our study provides a baseline from which to understand the frequency of COVID-19 long-term symptoms at the population level and demonstrates that, although those most likely to develop long-term COVID-19 complications are those who initially have more severe illness, even those with mild or asymptomatic courses of infection are at increased risk of long-term complications.",,,1602428352,{},g8hqiqo,True,t3_j96tv5,False,True,t3_j96tv5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j96tv5/longterm_covid19_symptoms_in_a_large_unselected/g8hqiqo/,1602428362,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Except, again, it's not the case.

&gt;The facts are what we know, not what they could possibly be.

The fact is that we have numerous people that have claimed to be reinfected with the virus but no way of confirming reinfection with the same strain.  The only cases that we can definitively confirm are those where the genomic sequences is significantly different and have stored samples.  This does not apply to nearly all of the cases in the world.

&gt;8 is not 50% of 22.

Again, it's 8 of 16.  Not 8 of 22.

&gt;Sure I can. I can’t say they’re asymptomatic but I can say there are no symptoms.

No, you can't.  There is no information given.  That does not mean ""no symptoms.""  It's completely and totally dishonest to say that N/A means no symptoms.  https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/09/qatar-confirms-4-coronavirus-reinfection-cases-in-largest-study-to-date/  3 of the 4 were diagnosed at health care facilities indicating seeking treatment.  

&gt;Beyond the title the article doesn’t seem relevant. It discusses immunity from reinfection, not protection from the disease.

You really don't understand the immune system.  Immunity from reinfection is protection from disease.  That ""protective immunity"" that you talk about is protection from reinfection and protection from disease.  That's how the immune memory works.  

&gt;Maybe. Nothing I’m saying is really dependent on it though.

Sure it is.  It's the basis of your entire rehashed argument.  You read somewhere that there was long lasting cellular immunity against coronaviruses and assumed that this was protective immunity.  It's not.  Humoral immunity would be protective immunity as it does not require infection for immune clearance.  It's the same for virtually all other diseases that the immune system encounters and is the basis of vaccination.  If humoral immunity is short lived, then protective immunity is going to be short lived and reinfection remains a very real possibility.",,,1602431315,{},g8hvmgx,False,t3_j8j0ur,False,True,t1_g8hsoam,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8j0ur/global_study_of_hospitalized_patients_confirms/g8hvmgx/,1602431331,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Scientists have been flying by the seat of their pants. And to a point, I understand that. This is an exceptional time to be an epidemiologist. But there needs to be some common sense amid all the panic. Panic that is spread on here and in the media. 

We all knew that sitting in your house for months, or who knows even years, on end would be bad physically and mentally. The general population, myself included, was willing to take that advise at first because it was a scary time. But now that we facts and numbers, it’s really hard to support shutting everything down and staying prisoner in your house until God knows how long. 

With survival rates so incredibly high for the vast, overwhelming number of people who contract C19 (over 99.9 percent), it makes perfect sense to me to protect those who need protecting and letting healthy people get back to their regular lives. 

I’m not going to type out a manifesto of what that means because I’m not a doctor or scientist but they need to figure out what that looks like and implement it. It will take common sense and a little bit of what we have already learned (social distancing, even masks in crowded or indoor places I’m fine with) to do correctly.

People aren't taking vacations because they don't want to be exposed to a virus that can either severely impact their health or lead to their death. Furthermore, people can't really travel to begin with because of travel restrictions due to there BEING A PANDEMIC. 

And what lockdowns is this guy talking about? I live in Los Angeles and we have some very strict measures in place currently; and life is normal per say, sans the typical nightlife and tourists spots being shut down. It's not like we are stuck at home and aren't allowed to go to the beach, parks, etc. There is restaurants open without door seating and whatnot.

&gt;I have no idea which one of us brought the virus into the house, but all six of us left with it. It kept spreading from there.

He was sick and thought he was better:


&gt;I got some of my energy back. I had a few really good days. I started working on projects around the house. I was thinking: ""OK. That's it. Pretty bad, but not so terrible. I beat it. I managed it. Nothing worth shutting down the entire world over."" Then one day I was walking up the stairs, and all of the sudden, I couldn't breathe. I screamed and fell flat on my face. I blacked out. I woke up a while later in the ER, and 10 doctors were standing around me in a circle. I was lying on the table after going through a CT scan. The doctors told me the virus had attacked my nervous system. They'd given me some medications that stopped me from having a massive stroke. They said I was minutes away.

....

&gt;Six infections turned into nine. Nine went up to 14. It spread from one family member to the next, and it was like each person caught a different strain. My mother-in-law got it and never had any real symptoms. My father is 78, and he went to get checked out at the hospital, but for whatever reasons, he seemed to recover really fast. My father-in-law nearly died in his living room and then ended up in the same hospital as me on the exact same day. His mother was in the room right next to him because she was having trouble breathing. They were lying there on both sides of the wall, fighting the same virus, and neither of them ever knew the other one was there. She died after a few weeks. On the day of her funeral, five more family members tested positive.

About his father in law who was in the hospital with him:

&gt;I got sent home, and I had a lot of guilt about leaving him there. I called him at the hospital, and I was like: ""I'm going to come bust you out Mission Impossible style."" He said he preferred El Chapo style. We were laughing so hard. I hung up, and a few hours later I got a call from my mother-in-law. She was hysterical. She could barely speak. She said one of his lungs had collapsed and the other was filling with fluid. They put him on a ventilator, and he lay there on life support for six or seven weeks. There was never any goodbye. He was just gone. It's like the world swallowed him up.

Maybe not the full math of SIR epidemiology models, but offering a familiarity with basic reproduction numbers (R0) and effective reproduction numbers (Rt), so that those who had any interest could explain the importance of mitigation measures to their friends and relatives.

I think there was a middle ground between Hubei and Sweden. A focus on education and encouraging residents to think of their civic duty, with financial subsidies for non-essential businesses like restaurants and theaters so they could continue business at a smaller scale and outside in well ventilated areas. Government purchases (and mandated production) of N95 masks, and distribution to the public, so that everyone could conduct essential errands in high safety.

In short, they have to wear the mask only in communal corridors; inside classrooms, offices, and meetings rooms, they do not have to if they do not want to, because in there they can keep a 1,5m distance... which apparently still seems the solution to everything in the Netherlands.

As a result, my friend, who is a teacher, has to meet dozens of students not wearing any mask. He is relatively young, but still somewhat at risk.

The main problem is that our populist government is awfully inept in controlling the pandemic (they basically do only what is beneficial for the ruling party and with a very short-term vision) and many people who dislike the government (and it deserves to be disliked) hate and ignore everything the government decrees, including (late and half-assed) attempts to do someting with the pandemic. 

Add to the mix lots of popular TV experts claiming that it us ""just a flu"", internet propaganda (we have popular facebook groups like ""With humor against face masks"") and general denialism and being tired of the whole pandemic media coverage. This is probably going to break soon as we are on an awful trajectory, but damage has been done.

By the way, we also have another word - ""pohoda"". It is a state of things where everything is sort of cozy, easy and okay-ish, without need to exert oneself. A state of mind not very well suited to deal with serious problems. If someone interferes with our pohoda it can be called ""buzerace"" (faggoting), whether it is the government, the EU, attempts to mitigate global warming or road speed limits.
