&gt;*Variants observed in an ongoing analysis in the ENSEMBLE study included the B.1.351 (20H/501Y.V2) variant, which was identified in 95 percent of the COVID-19 cases in South Africa, and the variant from the P2 lineage, which was identified in 69 percent of COVID-19 cases in Brazil. In South Africa, vaccine efficacy was maintained with 64 percent efficacy against moderate to severe/critical disease, and 81.7 percent against severe/critical disease as of Day 28 post-vaccination. Efficacy was also maintained in participants in Brazil, with 68.1 percent efficacy against moderate to severe/critical disease, and 87.6 percent against severe/critical disease.*

Pfizer and AZ both found to be effective against B.1.617.2 although the 2nd dose was required to ensure strong protection.

&gt;*The study said the Pfizer vaccine was 88% effective against the B.1.617.2 variant, first found in India, 2 weeks after the second dose. The Pfizer vaccine was 93% effective against the variant found in the U.K., known as B.1.1.7, two weeks after the second dose.*

&gt;*Two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were 60% effective against the B.1.617.2 variant and 66% effective against B.1.1.7, the study said.*

&gt;*But one dose didn‚Äôt work nearly as well, the study said. Three weeks after the first dose, both vaccines provided only 33% effectiveness against B.1.617.2 and 50% effectiveness against B.1.1.7.*

B.1.617.2 is rapidly becoming dominant in the UK yet their cases are still declining. Almost like the vaccines + natural immunity are still holding up.

This also seems to support Pfizer and Moderna who are studying if a third dose of the current vaccines may be enough to boost immunity against variants (alongside a variant tailored version)

Taiwan already signed contract for 30 million ish dose vaccines: 10 million doses AZ, 5 million doses Moderna, 10 million doses from 2 Taiwan local pharma companies and 5 million from Covax? (not 100% sure about this one). However only 400K AZ vaccines have been delivered so far and 150K Moderna will be delivered next week as the first batch. So 30 m contracted and only 550K will be delivered by next week. Very low delivery rate is the bigger issuer here.

I know that Taiwan authorities claim that China get in their way in their negotiation of 5m doses contract of BNT/Pfizer vaccine. I can elaborate more on this if u interested, but in short, Shanghai Fosun has distribution rights and Taiwan has certain laws against it. But 35 m contract vs 30 m contract will probably not make that 550K delivery much larger anyway. And Shanghai Fosun's involvement, I think, is more of a business issue instead of a political one. I think they want their cut of the revenue. 

The root causes are, only my personal opinion:

* Because Taiwan was doing really well, no locally transmission for like 200+ days. Government did not see the urgency need to purchase/acquire vaccines. Even the 2nd highest rank government official publicly said in February that Taiwan does not have a urgent need to acquire vaccines. This take looks really bad now when the case skyrocketed this month. And it's government's responsibility to plan ahead.
* Taiwan government betted big on their own vaccines (developed by Taiwan companies), as the 10m contract indicates. However they are still in Phase II trial. I think because of this bet, they did not want to buy too much foreign vaccines. Most countries want to buy 2 times or 3 times of their population's doses. But they only wanted to buy 5m Moderna, 5m BNT, 10m AZ. Maybe if they bought 20 m Moderna or 20 m AZ, things could be different now.
* Taiwan's ruling party would look like genius if this outbreak happens in August. As by that time they would have received much more vaccines (foreign or internal). But as this outbreak is happening now and they are not prepared for it. 

I would say they need to blame themselves for the reasons I mentioned. However, it was hard anyway. When the first batch of AZ arrived in Taiwan in March, most people don't want to take it as the concern on blood clot was being reported and there was no local transmission of the virus. A lot political talk shows were discussing the waste of vaccine as the expiration date was the end of May.

&gt;	When you treat someone different for the simple fact they dont follow the crowd, or make the same choices, thats wrong.

&gt;	Yes that is the the same principle in which the holocaust was built on. Obviously this isnt the holocaust, but it is the same principle.

Do you think it‚Äôs wrong to treat people differently for making different choices about crime? Is it wrong to put serial killers in prison, for example?

Now, I know what you‚Äôre thinking. Those people are acting in a dangerous and anti-social way. It‚Äôs insane to compare this to a genocide based on ethnicity (among other things). And you are absolutely correct. This is because your core argument is **bad**. Some choices should be discouraged. 

Prison for anti-vaxxers is wildly excessive, by the way. Don‚Äôt imply I support that. The point is your ‚Äúthey‚Äôre just making different choices!‚Äù bit is meaningless.

[],,RedEagleWhiskey,,,[],,,,text,t2_opcla,False,False,[],"HIPAA does not consider geographic or legal/business entity. Specifically talks about the transfer of information from one entity to another, Portability and Accountability. For an example HIPAA applies to EMT's regardless of where they are. Somebody walks up to the back of the ambulance while the EMT is buttoning up the bus. The EMT can't get into the specifics about the information related to the call related to HIPAA. 

Now, the venue. Is this venue in compliance after they have collected my medical information? The venue, at the very least, will to want to know how many customers were card recipient verses how many were not.

Let's get hypothetical and think about what role HIPAA compliance plays in non medical services asking for you medical information. 

I own an automotive shop or a restaurant. You walk in as a customer, I say, ""welcome to RedEagle's Automotive and Grill. Unfortunately I need to see a note from your doctor stating you do not have HIV/AIDS or Hep A/B/C, before we provide any services."" 

Now of course you have an ADA issue, but I want to exclude that as the venue didn't say you can't just that is cost more without the notation. so for this example, let's exclude the ADA violation. 

Now you, as a customer, have the right to tell me off and speak with your money or lack there of. I as a business owner (in some states) have the right to refuse service for any/no reason. My concern is that this will set a very dangerous precedent and will become a HIPAA issue. The only grounds I would be that technically incorrect is as follows. As the customer, if I show the notation, then I myself authorized the transfer of that information.

Now, let's look at the precedent that could set as a standard. I, as a customer, will have to show my information to be granted access to every service, gas stations, grocery stores, any other public access retail space or service, prior to being able to partake in those services. If they are HIV/AIDS positive or Hep A/B/C positive, I guess, they don't get to shop much.

Also: 

&gt;However, Argentina, with more than 30,000 daily cases and an average of around 400 deaths, is on a par with neighbouring Uruguay as the worst-hit country in the world right now and politicians are divided evenly among the ruling Peronist coalition led by President Alberto Fernandez on whether to host the Copa.

&gt;‚ÄùSometimes big organisations [such as CONMEBOL] impose one rule for everybody and that can be a problem if we don't understand what we are going through,‚Äù Nicolas Kreplak, deputy health minister in Buenos Aires province (the location of two of the prospective new venues should Argentina take on sole hosting duties) warned El Destape. 

&gt;‚ÄùFrom my point of view, it would be better if [the Copa] were postponed a couple of months.‚Äù National health minister Carla Vizzotti told TN: ‚ÄúWelcoming 2,000 people with protocols at the Copa America poses no risk.‚Äù

&gt;The uncertainty hanging over Argentina at the moment casts a shadow over the upcoming Copa.

&gt;The country is currently in strict lockdown with most non-essential travel and activities, including football, banned, although its participants in the Libertadores and Sudamericana were allowed (or obliged) to play out their home games this week due to CONMEBOL's insistence.

&gt;Most troubling of all from the governing body's point of view is that there is no prospect of Argentina bending on its refusal to allow fans into the stadiums, even for the final, a point on which Colombia was prepared to be more flexible.

We found that the vaccine, in addition to the adenovirus vector, contains substantial amounts of both human and non-structural viral proteins. Among the human proteins, heat-shock proteins and cytoskeletal proteins were particularly abundant. The often-observed strong clinical reaction one or two days after vaccination is likely associated with the detected protein impurities. A linkage to later immune-related adverse events is also conceivable.

I don't think language is a good analogy here as reddit is an english medium. I agree with your point about clarity *if* the purpose of the communication is to persuade people. in this case the purpose isn't really to persuade, so they can say whatever the hell they want, and you have the choice to look it up or not. I'd also caution against attributing motives like ""trying to appear smart"" - this is definitely a thing people do but I don't really see evidence of it here. 

it's also not overly technical language. in this case the word is actually a shortform for a really fascinating sociopolitical idea created by Jeremy Bentham (a dead guy to whom we owe large portions of not one but TWO fields of human endeavour, specifically economic theory and the legal system). it's not some hyper technical thing that only experts should know about. it's something we should *all* know about because it enriches our understanding of the world, and power structures, which is extremely relevant to the topic at hand (i.e. corporations wanting wage slaves back in the office)

Taipei, May 29 (CNA) Taiwan on Saturday reported 493 new cases of COVID-19, including 486 domestic infections and seven imported ones, as well as 21 deaths, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).

Of the domestic cases, 320 were newly confirmed cases and 166 were from a backlog of test results confirmed over the past few days, the CECC said.
The new domestic cases included 224 in New Taipei and 168 in Taipei. Taichung reported 33 cases, Taoyuan 19, and Keelung 14, while Taitung and Yilan each reported five.

Hualien and Chiayi each confirmed four cases, Miaoli reported three, Hsinchu County and Changhua each reported two cases, and Yunlin, Hsinchu City and Kaohsiung each reported one, the CECC said.

Based on Saturday's case distribution, ""we can see that infections are rising outside of (the virus hotspots) Taipei and New Taipei cities, while the range of areas affected is also growing,"" Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (Èô≥ÊôÇ‰∏≠) said.

The CECC said only two of the cases were immediately linked to a cluster involving hostess teahouses in Taipei's Wanhua District, while 36 of the new patients had recently visited the Wanhua area.
In another 158 cases, there was a known source of infection, while 49 had ""unclear links"" to other cases, and 241 were under investigation, the CECC said.



Meanwhile, a backlog of 166 cases reported Saturday brought the number of domestic cases the CECC has retroactively added to its daily totals since last Saturday to more than 2,000.

With the adjustments, Taiwan's daily totals have remained largely ""flat"" this week, despite the Level 3 COVID-19 alert that was imposed nationwide on May 19, Chen said.

He said wet markets are being examined as possible sites of transmission, as visits to such markets have been a common factor in a number of recent cases.

Apart from the domestic infections, the CECC also reported seven imported COVID-19 cases, from the Philippines, Indonesia and India.
The 21 fatalities reported Saturday were 13 men and eight women, ranging in age from their 30s to 90s, who passed away between May 23 and May 28, the CECC said.

To date, Taiwan has reported 99 deaths from COVID-19, including 82 in the last week.


The new cases on Saturday bring the total number in the country to 7,806, of which over 6,000 have been locally transmitted infections reported since May 15, when the daily case total topped 100 for the first time.

That said, I have to agree, if left to its own devices, the free market probably wouldn't have fixed the situation fast enough.

Canada is at 59.21 doses per hundred people; that's what the US was at 1.5 months ago, but we're also administering 1.8x the doses per capita per day over the past 2 weeks. Shipments are increasing in coming weeks, as well, so this gap will continue to shrink.

Our two countries are in different situations with regards to projected uptake; delayed dosing gives twice the people 80% protection instead of half the people 90% protection, so it's a better strategy if you can swing it (note: only after you've given both doses to the most vulnerable populations). I don't think it'd work in the US; people wouldn't be as likely to return for the second dose as they are in Canada. In the next couple months we can expect to see Canada pass the US in total vaccinations

For Americans who don't know about Canada's dose delay strategy, folks getting vaccinated today will have to wait around 7-9 weeks instead of 3-4 weeks. The manufacturers selected 3-4 weeks because they wanted to get the trials done ASAP and it was the shortest time they could use while still expecting a solid increase in immune response. But trials with Pfizer and AstraZeneca have shown that 12 weeks produces a better immune response in older populations (so predictably as good or better in young people, as well).

The logistics of putting on the Olympics are incredibly complex. What you see on TV over the course of 2 weeks does not just happen by magic. Take the following things into account:

1) You have to re-plan all of the events. There are a lot of events in the Olympics. 

2) You have to get a whole new team of volunteers, which number in the tens of thousands. Tokyo was supposed to have OVER 110K in 2020. They come from all over the world because of the international nature of the games. I could be an Olympic volunteer for the games, and if they say ""sorry, not happening, but can you come back in a year?"" I might not be able to make that commitment.

3) Ditto for full time staff.

4) You have to renegotiate a huge amount of contracts. Contracts to use the housing in the Olympic Village (these apartments are owned by people who were supposed to be able to move in after the games were complete). Contracts to use the venues, which may be privately or publicly owned.

This is not the same as say, running a college graduation a year later for the class of 2020. That can be done.

I was just telling my husband the other day the cruise ships likely can find a way around Florida's stupidity legally. Aside from doing something similar with ticket prices I was saying they likely could say in FL they DO NOT require a vaccine passport to enter their ship, however once they are in international waters they DO require them so they need to make sure you have them before boarding to save you the costly mistake of having to pay for tender to take your ass back to mainland.

It's not that the vaccine doesn't rely on the immune system . . . it relies entirely on the immune system. Again, the technical reasons some of the vaccines appear to be more effective against the variants are not necessarily agreed upon. I have read speculation that the spike protein that the mRNA vaccines expose the body to are a very ""pure"" spike protein from the wild type virus from back in early 2020; literally this ""pure"" spike protein was developed in a lab. 

It's possible that immune systems exposed to this ""pure"" spike protein are more likely to recognize the variants than immune systems exposed to the virus previously. Again, there are only theories right now, but there is definitely enough data that we know that natural immunity isn't as protective against certain variants like South African and P1 (Brazil).",,,1622275975,{},gzupb2a,False,t3_nmwajk,False,False,t1_gzunw0u,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nmwajk/had_covid_youll_probably_make_antibodies_for_a/gzupb2a/,1622380776,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The detection of the new variant pushed the total number of variants in Vietnam to eight.

The health minister emphasised that recent outbreaks have seen the virus spreading quickly and strongly in the air with high contagious level in narrow, unventilated spaces.  
  
Symptoms of the disease have worsen, so intensive treatment in localities must be leveled up, he noted.  
  
Vietnam reported 56 new COVID-19 cases in the past 6 hours to 12:00 on May 29, according to the Ministry of Health. Of the new cases, seven are imported and 49 are locally transmitted, including 46 in Bac Giang, one in Tay Ninh, one in Dien Bien, and one in the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases No. 2 in Hanoi‚Äôs Dong Anh district.  
  
With the new cases, the country documented a total of 5,213 domestic infections, including 3,643 confirmed since April 27./.",,,1622281753,{},gzuuzbw,True,t3_nnk2d3,False,True,t3_nnk2d3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nnk2d3/vietnam_detects_new_variant_of_sarscov2_health/gzuuzbw/,1622384279,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

And the current capacity rules still seem to exist. So that means either max 50 in smaller halls or 250 in halls with capacity over 250. But with ""testing for entrance"" programme, the max capacity is unlimited if 1,5 meters distance is kept between the seats (of course people form the same households can be grouped together). It seems like there is no distinction between outdoors and indoors activities.

It seems like only in step 4 (June 30th) that regular ""walk-through"" festivals will be allowed to be held. This is a regular festival where you are standing (both indoors and outdoors). Exact allowed numbers are not known yet I think, but assuming the result from the fieldlabs will be used, these festivals should be able to go back to 100% capacity with entrance testing.

Of course, proof of vaccination (I think first dose should be enough, not sure above that) can be used as a replacement of the entrance testing. Also, each sector is allowed to use the entrance testing (like Museum and Restaurants) as a tool to increase their maximum capacity if they would like to. The fieldlabs discussed above were experiments in holding multiple large-scale events with COVID-19 with COVID-19 testing (ranging up to 10,000 people in size), and the conclusion was that it could be done with relative safety. In June, the second stage of the fieldlabs experiments with larger and more events should start, and then in July (or June 30th, step 4) it should start for real. There was also a program called ""pilot testing for entrance"", which is not really needed anymore, because it was mostly meant to help set up the infrastructure for the large free entrance testing streets across the country, which is mostly set up now. Also, the events used for the pilot are mostly either allowed without entrance testing now or they are just part of the regular rules (thus out of pilot).",,,1622286079,{},gzuzfpk,True,t3_nn5xra,False,True,t1_gzuwk7l,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nn5xra/concerts_festivals_can_start_from_june_5_as/gzuzfpk/,1622387100,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

1) I have taken the vaccine because the rewards outweighs the risks.

2) This vaccine has not gone under the same level of scrutiny that all the other vaccines we have taken have.  There are good reasons for this, but to state that it is perfectly safe is a lie because it is UNKNOWN. We haven't had time to see the outcomes.

3)  Because of Point 2, there are reasons for well meaning people to be concerned about taking the shot.  Concerned.  

In no way did I say people shouldn't take the vaccine.  In no way did I say that the vaccine is harming people.  But, people don't respond to what is written, only what they've made up in their head.  And that's fine, I don't really expect much from an online forum.

You are confusing SinoVac with AstraZeneca. The majority of people still want a vaccine for personal reasons, but there is a very strong desire from the vietnamese public to do their bit in epidemic response. It's become a sort of national pride.

&gt;It costs about 60USD which is a lot in Vietnam

Do you have a source for that? That's unusually expensive for Astra Zeneca. Neighbouring countries have it at 12usd. Even then, the majority of shots being used right now are **donated** doses from COVAX.

&gt;also Vietnam doesn't vaccinste for free

Source?

I highly doubt that the people they've vaccinated had to pay to get a vaccine. Bearing in mind that the government has been very selective in who gets it, mostly been given to medical workers, people in hospitals, factory workers, border patrol officers, airport workers and maybe some of the elderly.

I'm a Christian myself and I am *so* incredibly appalled. It is shameful to use this religion as an excuse not to vaccinate. Protecting others, but especially those who are vulnerable, is a good act. And per James 4:17--""Anyone, then, who knows the right thing to do, yet fails to do it, is guilty of sin.""

Thus, from my understanding of Christian ethics, not vaccinating when one can should be regarded as outright sinful.

All supposedly Biblical arguments against vaccination I've seen (it's ""unnatural"" or ""I have to trust in God first"") are either:   
1) Weak stretches (define """"natural"""" because mRNA exists naturally in the body, so how is an injection of that any more unnatural than eating foods with artificial food coloring and allowing their absorption into the body? I somehow doubt most of them avoid eating all those.)  
2) Otherwise refutable by well-known Biblical points (i.e., the temptation of Jesus, where Jesus asserted that one should not test God's protection just because it exists. If you know a way you can act to protect yourself or others, you should do so.)",,,1622318735,{},gzwkht5,False,t3_nniy3y,False,True,t1_gzvzjgl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nniy3y/us_agency_says_employers_can_mandate_covid19/gzwkht5/,1622421960,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Note: I'm fully vaccinated.

Barbershop: had a sign on the door indicating masks were required for all, so I wore mine into the store.  My barber said I could take it off when he was about to shave my neck, and I was like, ""Is that OK?"" given the sign on the door.  He said yup, and I gladly complied.  First maskless haircut in over a year!  The owner told me everyone working there was vaccinated, but they all wore masks for the sake of people who were uncomfortable.  I mentioned the sign on the door, and she said, ""Oh, maybe I'll take that down.""

Target: Had my mask ready at the store entrance, saw the sign saying masks were mandatory for unvaccinated people.  Went in with my mask.  Was met by the greeter, who said I didn't have to wear a mask, so I stuffed it back into my pocket.

It felt slightly odd but *very good* to not be wearing my mask as I walked around.  I saw a couple of people who were maskless and felt like just going up to them and saying, ""Isn't this great?  Finally!""  I resisted the impulse (big thing for me, I have impulse control issues).

Walking all around the store, which was not super busy, I'd say maybe 85-90% of the people were wearing masks.  I got glanced at a couple of times, but nobody gave me the stink-eye or anything.

Stopped by Starbucks afterwards.  All of the employees were masked, as well as most of the people in the store (once again, not very busy).

I understand the social aspect of ""being in the office"", but I gladly give it up  in exchange for 6-10 hours of my time per week, that I can invest in however I want. I can even use some of those hours to hang out with friends more.

I have nothing against people going into the office because of their kids or because they are lonely, but I shouldn't have to waste hours of my life just because somebody else is lonely.

Luckily my company's new policy is that every team can decide the ratio of wfh days vs wfo days, with a minumum of 4 days per month in the office (when everybody is there at the same time). Also luckily it seems that most of my colleagues are happy with the 4 days. And the offices will be available to anyone who wants to go in anyway.

Re the last several points I can already tell you have confirmation bias. Again, another common problem with those who don't really know what's going on but have formed a conclusion.

Let's go through it. Daszak was involved with the lab but the vast majority of the rest of the dozen or so other members weren't and some have given public statements refuting the lab leak theory including Fisher. They all have put their names on the report deeming it the least likely possibility. The 3 lab members ill with cold/flu symptoms in fall 2019 is not exactly strange. The same report indicated there was nothing strange about that. People get sick during flu season. People in China (and other parts of Asia) go to the hospital for anything... Even colds. Your first two points are massive assumptions since we don't even know where patient zero was. So how could you say that the origin was a mile from the lab? What exactly is the origin according to you because I'm not sure what's one mile from the lab in the first place. The SCMP had reported the first patient in November or whatnot (that they knew of) wasn't even from Wuhan. That leads to my second point that we don't know exactly when patient zero was infected so how could you know the virus was fully adapted from the beginning especially with a virus that's asymptomatic so often, resembles the flu so often and wasn't even detected by European countries for months after their first case?

An example of a microbe that is typically worked with at a **BSL-1** is a nonpathogenic strain of E. coli.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples of agents typically worked with in a **BSL-2** include equine encephalitis viruses and HIV, as well as Staphylococcus aureus (staph infections).

&amp;#x200B;

Examples of microbes worked with in a **BSL-3** includes; yellow fever, West Nile virus, and the bacteria that causes tuberculosis.

&amp;#x200B;

**BSL-4** lab consists of work with highly dangerous and exotic microbes. Infections caused by these types of microbes are frequently fatal, and come without treatment or vaccines. Two examples of such microbes include Ebola and Marburg viruses.

**Current Guidance**  
The CDC has recently outlined biosafety guidelines specific to SARS-CoV-2 isolates or cultures, ***recommending that virus isolation and characterization of viral agents from SAR-CoV-2 specimens must be processed within a BSL-3 laboratory space using BSL-3 procedures.*** ***However, they have also recommended that a BSL-2 laboratory may perform routine diagnostic testing (refer to CDC for list of tests) of specimens using Standard Precautions.*** Further, CDC recommends procedures like virus concentration, precipitation or filtration may be performed in a unidirectional air-flow BSL-2 provided certain BSL-3 precautions and procedures are followed.

&amp;#x200B;

Laboratory employees working with suspected coronavirus samples within BSL-2 environments should adhere to strict aerosol transmission prevention measures, such as:  
Tyvek full body suit and gloves, HEPA filtered powered air-purifying respirator  
Perform all sorting and diagnostics within operational HEPA filtered aerosol management system  
Wipe down all surfaces before and after sorting and diagnostic procedures with 70% ethanol or 10% hypochlorite  
Operate only within a facility with negative relative air pressure with respect to surrounding spaces with exhaust air vented directly to the outside rather than recirculating to other spaces  
Written record of containment measurement and safety checklist

Ok so RedEagle's Auto and Grill has a 98% discount on services if customers provide documentation that they are not HIV/AIDS OR Hep ABC positive. Please keep in mind in referring to an extreme example to as to the precedent. 

Also pedantic but, $1,000 ticket doesn't seem to fit market rate for a venue based concert.

&gt;Private venue private show. This does not offer a public service. I would have a problem if local Metro refused service.

The gas station, grocery store, and other public access retail locations are all private as well. The only difference would be that it's one venue verse the entire market place. Again done to paint why said example is dangerous and how HIPAA would get involved. 

&gt;You're taking this to such an extreme. 

Correct, this is a point to illustrate my concerns using a currently protected class, HIV/AIDS, that had these very issues, both in the work place and in the market place in the past to show how dangerous that standard could be.

&gt;HIPAA is still not relevant because you are not transferring information. At no point do they have to link your identity to your vaccination record. 

With the patient number, vaccine lot and clinic used to receive. This is medical information with my name, first and last, with my birth date at the top. 

Let's take it a step further, if they also need to see my government issued ID/DL/Passport to verify authenticity to deal with fraudulent cards. They would in fact be linking the identity. 

Again the HIPAA concern would be how they handle that information after that. While I'm sure the ticket counter at the door was trained to spot fakes. How much training did they receive in maintaining HIPAA compliance? Non-disclosure? Any kind of vetting as they are verifying this information?

Do you better understand the point I was trying to make?

&gt;Even your point about counting vaccinated vs not does not require the release or transfer of any personal information.

The counted information is a bare minimum example of how verification becomes collected information. My issue is the level of marketing information that is collected at the time of verification. 

The privacy rule is specific about what marketing information can be used during collection and how authorization would be advised outside of that scope of practice, both in house and third party for marketing.",,,1622301403,{},gzvmcqt,False,t3_nmyxt1,False,True,t1_gzuky8c,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nmyxt1/these_florida_concert_tickets_are_18_if_youre/gzvmcqt/,1622401512,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Real Life Example: 
Massachusetts Mandates A Vaccine
In 
Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905)




Mr. Jacobsen refused to obey a law requiring that everyone in Cambridge receive a smallpox vaccination. At the time, a smallpox epidemic was raging. Jacobson faced a fine or imprisonment if he failed to take the vaccine. Jacobsen argued that forcing him to get the vaccine violated his fundamental liberty, which included freedom to control his own body. The State argued that the health risk was urgent, that widespread vaccination was needed to protect everyone against smallpox, and that any harm to individual liberty was a price worth paying given the severe threat of smallpox.

The Supreme Court acknowledged that both sides had a point. On one hand the Court noted that ‚Äúwhen faced with a society-threatening epidemic, a state may implement emergency measures that curtail constitutional rights so long as the measures have at least some ‚Äúreal or substantial relation‚Äù to the public health crisis ‚Ä¶‚ÄùOn the other hand, the Court recognized Jacobsen‚Äôs argument, and agreed that the vaccine order did impact liberty and personal freedom.

People are looking very close at what's happening right now. There are cohorts being followed and checked on. It won't take 2-3yrs to discover issues.

The circumstances for the MRNA vaccine to alter your DNA are so specific, it's correct to say it's impossible. It would take a bunch of random events for it to happen. It's not impossible but it's about as a lose as you can get.

Random incorporation of foreign RNA or DNA is technically possible. For that random incorporation to have effect it would need to replicate. Cells have a way to repair DNA. So...

A) the repair would need to not flag that portion of DNA as alien.

B) the change would have to not alter the cells ability to replicate.

C) the change would need to not initiate an immune response.

The vaccines work by coding for a protein, which initiates an immune response. Cells containing that protein would be attacked. This is partially what's responsible for the symptoms post vaccination. It's proof it's working as intended. Same thing happens if you had Covid and get the vaccine. Covid leaves protein spikes in cells and when the immune system is bolstered, those cells are attacked.

This tax credit will apply to nearly half of all private sector employees in America.*",,,1622294006,{},gzv9o3j,False,t3_nnmqdl,False,False,t1_gzv8gi7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nnmqdl/washington_post_nearly_half_of_all_american/gzv9o3j/,1622393576,35,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; A vaccine goes through largely the same developmental process regardless of whether the manufacturer applies for full approval or emergency use authorization.

&gt; The main difference between the types of approval is that the manufacturing and administrative processes are streamlined during the emergency use authorization process, UNC Health says.

&gt; When the FDA fully approves a vaccine, it‚Äôs developed first and then tested in three trials ‚Äî phase one on a small number of generally healthy people, phase two on a more diverse group of hundreds people, and phase three on thousands of people who vary in demographics and overall health.

&gt; After those trials are complete, the drug maker applies for what‚Äôs known as a biologics license application with the FDA. If the FDA determines the drug is safe, it grants the license and the drug may be produced and distributed on a wide scale.

&gt; A vaccine follows the same research process before a company applies for an emergency use authorization. The only difference is that the production phase begins at the same time the drug is being tested, so it can be distributed as soon as the FDA allows it.

&gt; The scientific and research processes are not sacrificed during the emergency approval process, the FDA says.

&gt; Before a vaccine developer can apply for an emergency use authorization, it must submit detailed information on the manufacturing technology and the results of animal testing. After written authorization from the FDA, the developer can begin clinical trials in humans.
&gt;In a submission for emergency use authorization, companies are also required to include safety data from trial phases one and two, as well as a final or interim analysis of phase three results, the FDA says.",,,1622293977,{},gzv9ml7,False,t3_nniy3y,False,False,t1_gzv8rg7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nniy3y/us_agency_says_employers_can_mandate_covid19/gzv9ml7/,1622393550,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Not to mention, aren‚Äôt most religious authorities (ex, the Pope,  [source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55409693)) pretty clear that people have a moral obligation to get vaccinated because the harm caused by not doing so is far greater than any harm caused by the development of the vaccine?

That seems like an atrocity to me - far more than a single abortion in 1973 or using the tissue from that abortion to save millions of lives.

By getting the vaccine the commenter was in no way contributing to abortions or even the use of a stem cell line resulting from an abortion. The fetal stem cell line was 1) only used during development of the vaccine which has already been completed (and therefore whether someone gets the vaccine or not has no bearing on whether the stem cell line is used more or not - that work is done) and 2) was created in 1973 and has no bearing on any abortions performed today.

I‚Äôm mystified as to how anyone cam morally justify their decision in the face of these facts. If they get Covid and infect a single person who then dies they will have killed someone with family and friends and a life and that surely is at least equally repulsive to them as a single abortion that happened in 1973.",,,1622304033,{},gzvrfuk,False,t3_nniy3y,False,False,t1_gzvnucr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nniy3y/us_agency_says_employers_can_mandate_covid19/gzvrfuk/,1622404710,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

A very tricky one, ""no one knows the long term effect on ferltility.""  No one knows the long term of COVID on fertility either which is a far more likely problem.

You have to take into account the professionals that understand risk assessment and stats make up a minority of professionals, at least that have that as a job requirement.
