Firstly you can have it the other way around. Enough cases overwhelms hospital capacity as you don't have space for more patients. The hospitals are in a diabolical state because of how full they are. If you run out of ICU beds you can't treat covid cases or any other condition that requires emergency care. What I'm saying isn't controversial, it's a well established fact. Brazil's hospitals are pretty much full and with limited restrictions this isn't going to change. Currently Brazil has the highest number of covid deaths per day globally. 

https://agencia.fiocruz.br/observatorio-covid-19-aponta-maior-colapso-sanitario-e-hospitalar-da-historia-do-brasil 

Cases in Mexico have started to decline, in Brazil they are sky rocketing. Deaths are also skyrocketing in Brazil compared to other countries, including Easteen Europe. 

https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/mexico 

https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths 

The more infectious P1 strain is now expected to be dominant in Brazil and has been circulating for a long time. It was  detected within Mexico in the end of January but it hasn't become dominant.

Brazil has currently vaccinated 8.01 per 100 people, slightly better than Mexico's 5.03. This is much lower compared to countries who also have a high death toll (14.94 for the EU, 47.62 for the UK, 40.87 for the US). India isn't doing as well with vaccinations (4.21 per 100) but they have a very large vaccine supply, Brazil does not.

Maybe I didn't make it clear enough but I'm talking about the worst country in the world right now.

I can answer this as I work in a Microbiology lab (in the UK) - anybody suspected of coming into our A&amp;E (the Equivalent of ER)  with a respiratory illness was tested for multiple pathogens.  Since the beginning of October 2020 that is approximately 100 patients a day - so 15,000 up to the end of February

Covid positives accounted for between 7 and 35% of all tests during that time (Peaking at the higher number early in January 2021), around 1% tested positive for Rhinovirus (common cold).  Of the 15,000 samples the number of Influenza positives was Zero.

Why?  Several theories - people taking precautions such as hand washing and masks, much less international travel meant very low numbers in the Southern Hemisphere during their winter - and subsequently almost no cases in the Northern Hemisphere during ours. 

A negative to this is that with almost no circulating strains of influenza, it is difficult to know what to put in this years flu vaccine.",,,1616926285,{},gskhl56,False,t3_meop5d,False,True,t1_gskeg4g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/meop5d/mexico_says_excess_deaths_in_202021_have_exceeded/gskhl56/,1616926296,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

United States - there is nothing United about these states during the pandemic, aside from them all getting screwed by the federal government when it comes to getting the help a federal administration would typically provide.

All other candidates get a blue ballot.

Set up check points to make sure no criminals or suspected criminals vote and at these check points also verify if people have their ballots on them.

Everyone with a blue ballot gets stopped as a suspected foreign agitator and gets an instant re-education, where they are screamed at, roughed up and sent to the back of the line with everyone in line screaming at them and shaming them.

If these individuals come back with another blue ballot they really ARE foreign agitators trying to disrupt The Democratic People’s Voting process and they’re arrested.

End result China has 99.5% turnout with 99.97% of the votes for Xi, because a few protest votes will probably get through.

China also runs campaigns in Africa, Asia, and South America. While they are outspent by America, the Chinese focus on how they more than any other country know how to build economies and lift people out of poverty, while America is just selfish and is looking to exploit the world for its gain, and drone anyone who stands against it.

Somehow only today did I learn that the father of one of my son's closest friend (in 4th grade) who were loving across the street from us but had moved (never made the connection) died 2 days after Christmas. Due to remote learning my son didn't get a chance to talk to his friend even though for a while they were in the same remote classroom.

 It was also at that time that my son had gotten a knee surgery, we had just found out he had a vascular tumor in lower thigh/upper knee area (thankfully begnign, but let s just say our mind was quite concerned around that time as well). I almost feel horrible because back then my son was talking about his surgeries (first a biopsy and then the removal of the tumor), showing his scar and everyone was being all caring about him while his friend was going through so much worse (he also had his grandma hospitalized for 10 days at the same time, luckily she made it) and was sitting there silent. If only we had known I would have told my son to not gather everyone s sympathy so actively back then (I suppose the teacher and the school were limiting the conversation about anyone s private life off the zoom during learning hours, especially something so tragic, even though I highly doubt the kid had the mind to attend the class mentally, he went back to in person in January while my son stayed remote).

Worse thing is that I only found out on accident. We are truly shocked. He was 34 years old and a lovely dad to his kids. Both my son s friends and his sister are staying at their moms now (parents had been divorced for some time) and will still attend the schools in our town for the rest of the year but after that they probably will have to go to wherever their mother lives (a town nearby).

I wasn’t able to process this.

If it wasn't safe and [effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/li9jg8/it_works_0_deaths_only_4_severe_cases_among/), they wouldn't be paying thousands for shots.

There are some people (~7%) who don't develop lasting immunity from infections, but it's not clear to me now whether vaccines would develop lasting immunity for these people. 

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l9nfu8/stable_neutralizing_antibody_levels_six_months/) probably a lot,[ lot longer,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/)  probably many years.

The currently approved vaccines (Pfizer/Moderna) work acceptably against [all the new variants.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kqz7y5/comprehensive_mapping_of_mutations_to_the/) They [probably work better than you were expecting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l685dy/vaccination_against_the_new_variants_realworld/)  Even that [British one](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l15czh/neutralization_of_sarscov2_lineage_b117/) you just read about.  

[Seriously,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4pnde/mrna1273_vaccine_induces_neutralizing_antibodies/) it's [very probably](https://reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l6vs1t/in_vitro_studies_demonstrate_pfizer_and/), like, [not going to be a problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l0yqe6/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gjwov3s?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) Yes, even the SA variant, [which might not be a concern at all.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kxkrb9/endemic_sarscov2_will_maintain_postpandemic/) The more vaccines we test, the more we find that they still [work against the variants](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lax5wa/neutralization_of_sarscov2_voc_501yv2_by_human/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), at least enough to be totally worthwhile. 

ChAdOx1 (Oxford/Astrazeneca) protects [hamsters against UK and SA variants](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m3hgfo/chadox1_ncov19_azd1222_protects_against_sarscov2/).  Novavax's vaccine may have issues with the SA variant, though it doesn't seem that they're as big as with ChAdOx1. [This was encouraging,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmp5doo/) regarding the efficacy of vaccines against variants.

Pfizer [seems fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lf7uph/neutralization_of_viruses_with_european_south/) against the troubling variants, at least in the lab. At the very least, the mRNA vaccines [*still* work](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfp89k/neutralization_of_sarscov2_spike_6970_deletion/) on the three most worrying variants.

Most variants aren't great at being viruses.  Some, including [that one mink variant,](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/19/danish-covid-mink-variant-very-likely-extinct-but-controversial-cull-continues) have already gone extinct. I think there are other Mink variants that have made it into wild Mink populations, but that doesn't mean that it's definitely going to stay in Mink forever (it might, though).

Antibodies from recovered people who then got an mRNA vaccine [work on variants *and* OG SARS?!](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfiypu/antibodies_elicited_by_sarscov2_infection_and/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) This should really put the variant fear behind us.

**Vaccines Seem to Reduce Spread**

Vaccination and previous infection[ reduce viral load, which reduces spread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s).

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) * article does a good job of explaining the likelihood of vaccines *at least* reducing spread.  [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lf744r/daily_discussion_thread_february_08_2021/gml0gyi/) may help too. Data from [Scotland looks great](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m3tx1n/covid19_vaccine_linked_to_a_reduction_in/). 

[""Moderna vaccine blocks &gt;90% (87-93%) of infections &amp; 91% (89-94%) of transmission.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmqfk4q/)

Milder cases, especially asymptomatic cases [are worse at spreading](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kcy2e0/weekly_question_thread_week_of_december_14/gg8tp7n/).  

Looks like the amount of virus in people who've gotten one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and then infected is [greatly reduced compared to those not vaccinated](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfiqma/decreased_sarscov2_viral_load_following/).  This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a great reduction in ability to spread the virus. [Maybe even with just one dose!](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242) You should [get both doses though.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m2mtnv/immune_response_to_sarscov2_variants_of_concern/)

Any answer you get that is either ""yes"" or ""no"" is wrong, for now. We have only ""maybe, probably not"", and it's going to be that way for a long time.

Challenge studies with monkeys and the results look [*really good.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03041-6) They show strong immunity, or [sterilizing immunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/la4fud/immunogenic_bnt162b_vaccines_protect_rhesus/) from multiple vaccine types.  We're still figuring out if and how much sterilizing immunity can be expected from the current vaccines, though it's starting to look really good.

Also, you'll notice that any reputable person talking about this subject always says ""may be able to spread"", or ""maybe"", or ""we don't know if"". And that's because there is a small chance that vaccinated people will be able to spread the virus. But it's not a big chance. Doctors, scientists, and regulators are being very careful with their language on this subject, some would argue they're being too careful. That said, if they were to say that ""vaccinated people cannot spread the virus"", and then we find out that in some situations that vaccinated people have spread the virus, [that would end up worse for them than if they hedge for a while.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/los8r9/daily_discussion_thread_february_21_2021/goa8cu0/) So at least to me, the way they're framing it seems pretty reasonable, you just have to put yourself in their shoes.

That said, they seem to be [saying what I've been saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s). 

**Additional Thoughts/Cool Stuff**

Testing and the Positivity Rate: It's been said a lot in other subs that the positivity rate should go up over time as more people are vaccinated and don't require testing. Last year, it was *the* metric to watch, but it will likely wane quickly in importance as overall testing drops.  Don't necessarily worry about sudden high positivity rates, as mass testing will likely drop off pretty quickly, particularly as testing sites are converted to vaccination sites. 

We may want to use our newly found testing and sequencing capacity to test and sequence a higher proportion of flu samples.  This might give us a head start on which flu genetics are circulating, and help eliminate a flu or two.  We're in the single digits of flu cases most places, which is awesome!

The problem is that you have to wait longer for the second dose, and therefore, full protection.

Just because [mRNA vaccines aren't 100% effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/)  against the SA variant, *doesn't* [mean that we'll definitely need boosters](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gmu581s/).

I like [thegracefuldork's prediction about vaccine availability](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lcatpp/daily_discussion_thread_february_04_2021/gm0bwc8/) more than my own previous prediction.  Not because it's ""rosier"", but because it's just better.

**Which vaccine should I get?**

When someone asks me what my favorite beer is, the answer is always the same.

It's the one in front of me.

So get the first vaccine you can, the differences are pretty minor.


[**Conclusions**](https://gfycat.com/cleantalkativedassie)

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms.  This currently seems to also be true with post vaccination infection with any of the known variants. We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well. 

In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections and symptoms in those who do get infected. Therefore, vaccines should reduce spread.

Regarding side effects of the vaccine:

Nobody is saying there aren't side effects. There are clearly side effects. I'm not even saying there aren't side effects from the vaccine that could last for years. The effects of an infection may not show up for a while, [and we know they can last a long time](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m4jhpf/rapid_implementation_of_a_cohort_for_the_study_of/), most notably a loss of sense of smell.

I'm saying that we'd find out about all the side effects within a few months. There won't be side effects that suddenly show up six months after vaccination that haven't already shown up in some people.

If you have an example of a side effect from any vaccine where side effects not seen within the first four months were suddenly found over four months post-vaccination, I'd change the wording in my post.

I'll tell you though, I've still not gotten an example of a vaccine side effect that didn't show up in at least some people until way after the vaccine was administered.

I get plenty of ""look, this vaccine used decades ago in some tiny country rarely causes this one long-term side effect, so you're wrong"", which doesn't address the point I'm making.",,,1616951231,{},gslh9q1,False,t3_mewez1,False,True,t3_mewez1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mewez1/daily_discussion_thread_march_28_2021/gslh9q1/,1616951293,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The city itself has been in ""semaforo rojo"" and ""semaforo naranja"" for quite some time now, which would mean that public businesses and multitude of people would be prohibited, but the citizens have been fighting back the government regulations in order to re-activate the economy since our primary source of income is tourism; they lifted several regulations to restaurants, bars, clubs and hotels in order to re-gain some economic power.

However, this came with multiple waves of COVID-19 cases and safe to say, multitudes of people attending these public venues without any sort of protective regulations. If you passed by the Hotel Zone (where most clubs and hotels are) you'd be flabbergasted at how little importance they give to this whole pandemic. Large gatherings of people without masks, less than five centimeters next to each other, with little to no regard about physical contact.

And even if the venues are following careful procedures, they are on such a low level that they might as well not invest in them. For example, a government regulation mandated restaurants to include a ""shoe washing"" mat on the entries and exits of the establishments, (sure, because you can get COVID-19 from your feet), thermometers (which are usually pointed at the hands for some reason), and antibacterial gel (which most of the time, is soggy and inefficient since it's been sitting in full sun for multiple days).

The closing of Chichen Itza only drove away tourists to other archeological sites like Tulum, Coba, and El Rey, which are flocked with large gathering of maskless tourists and its only a matter of time before they close them as well.

Vaccination carps are ready to be introduced to the city, but with the low-supply of vaccines I don't think they'll be very effective for the population as a whole. Meanwhile, while the tourists are having the time of their lives enjoying cheap prices and the luxurious zones, us second-class citizens (students, office workers, salarymen/women) have to rely on the patience that someday we will be admitted back to our regular daily lives.

If I had COVID-19 and recovered do I need to get the vaccine?
 COVID-19 vaccination should be offered to you regardless of whether you already had COVID-19 infection. You should not be required to have an antibody test before you are vaccinated. However, anyone currently infected with COVID-19 should wait to get vaccinated until after their illness has resolved and after they have met the criteria to discontinue isolation (basically meaning 14 days post infection). While there is no recommended time frame between infection and vaccination, current evidence suggests that the risk of reinfection is low in the months after initial infection. Therefore, people with a recent infection may choose to temporarily delay vaccination while
 vaccine supplies are limited.

Notice how the wording is there is no recommended time frame but their recommendation  is essentially its safe  to get once you’re no longer sick most likely but you may want to wait before getting it because supply is limited. Given were nearing a point where supply is picking up I would say wait a month post infection then get it if you’re eligible. I know several people who have gotten the vaccine not too long after being infected and they were fine.

The vaccines were rushed, under studied, and under vetted, and are being widely distributed because of an impending sense of necessity as we further let this virus plague our every day lives in the US. Do I think the vaccines have micro chips? Absolutely not, I’m not fucking daft. I also don’t think it’ll kill me or have any real long lasting side effects. 

But there’s always that chance that something did go unnoticed in the process of developing these vaccines. And for a lot of people, that chance is just too great to justify getting vaccinated at this point in time.

It’s a personal choice. People should be allowed to make it themselves, regardless of our responsibilities to one another as a society.

121 countries have banned South African travellers yet SA schools have been open and functioning normally for a month.

No surge. Less than 21k active cases. Of course, many could be asymptomatic and not recorded because demand for testing is lower.

It has been on Level 1 before, but now it feels...almost normal again. God willing. 

Can’t quite credit vaccines, because Pfizer is a month late with their first shipment. After AZ was booted. J&amp;J stepped in to vaccinate frontline healthcare workers first. The fact that this collaboration was even possible was a miracle: https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2021-02-21-vax-the-beloved-country-how-mountains-were-moved-to-get-jj-vaccines-to-south-africa/

SAHPRA is fussy as hell.and the DOH clearly don’t favour panic jabbing with whatever is easily available without full data and local testing.J&amp;J fortunately conducted trials here, as did Pfizer, which is why they’re the only two we have on order. We’ve refused donations without data, but 500 000 doses of the J&amp;J research stock that we offered to pay for was put aside for our use and provided to us *gratis* as part of an implementation study. 

I hope anyone who thinks like the mayor of Detroit and regards J&amp;J as substandard to Moderna or Pfizer remembers that the President of South Africa willingly rolled up his sleeve to be one of the first to receive a vaccine we knew to be effective but was still technically experimental in that it had not been subject to formal EUA by *any* country at that stage,including our own. 

The man had the power to elect to wait a few months for Pfizer to arrive, not to mention the fact that he has a medical doctor as a wife, and he pitched up smiling at a public hospital in the middle of a Cape Town township to receive a jab that I’ve heard Americans say they’d rather avoid or leave for the homeless. With our variant, SA will not have the luxury of choice - at the moment it’s Pfizer or J&amp;J. It simply means a lot to so many people that every political/medical leader in the SA fight against COVID took the J&amp;J shot despite our active cases being pretty low, certainly low enough to wait for the ‘Golden Standard” vaccines to arrive. 

We always knew we’d be at the back of the queue. We have only secured the amount we need and no more - with other vaccines being evaluated as contingencies. We are where we are because people order 3-4x more doses than they need and promise to pass it on to the “poor” afterwards. Once they’re all done. Honestly, no. That won’t end a pandemic.We have and will pay for what we need, but being a touch poorer involves additional logistical roadblocks that push us further behind in the queue.

Recently, they've announced a £500m Mental Health Recovery Plan, so the argument that our government is using psychological warfare on us is pretty unconvincing. 

""Eat Out to Help Out"", however bad of a move for infection rates that it was, is strong evidence that they just want we, the people, to be out and about once more. They're moving to remove the ""Stay at Home"" order, even with the supposed ""third wave"" that has ""hit our shores

Incidentally, this third wave in Europe is being driven by the Kent variant that caused our third peak back in January. Our third wave is hitting their shores, and not the other way around. Fortunately for us, our vaccine rollout means that our most vulnerable groups are protected against most COVID strains, including the Kent variant that is set to be the globe's dominant strain.

Yes, I have my reservations with the current UK government and the way they have mismanaged many aspects of this pandemic, but I now find it far-fetched to suggest that there's a clandestine power grab going on, no matter what conspiracy theorists say.

I'm definitely concerned about US cases sort of flattening in the last few weeks, up in some states and countries, and I haven't seen enough yet about how effective the vaccines are against variants (could vary quite a bit depending on which one). That, vaccine updates, and how many people get one and how much long-term immunity getting the virus truly builds will go a long way towards determining where the trends go.

&gt;Peter Ben Embarek, the WHO’s leading animal disease expert, said the team conducted scientific investigations into four main scenarios about how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, spread into humans.

&gt;In the first, a single person was exposed to SARS-CoV-2 through direct contact with the host species, the horseshoe bat. The virus could have been circulating in humans for a while before making its breakthrough in heavily populated Wuhan.

&gt;The second scenario, seen as the most likely, involves transmission to humans via an as yet unknown intermediary species. Liang Wannian, an expert with China’s National Health Commission, said pangolins were potential candidates but other animals - including mink and even cats - may also be reservoirs.

&gt;A third possibility is that COVID-19 originated under the first or second scenarios and was then transmitted via cold chain products. Chinese experts have attributed later COVID-19 clusters to imported frozen food and have raised the possibility it might also have caused the Wuhan outbreak.

&gt;The final scenario is that SARS-CoV-2 was leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is known to have studied captive coronaviruses. Ben Embarek ruled out the possibility and said it would not be subject to further research. Accidents happen, he said, but it was “very unlikely” in this case.",,,1616899969,{},gsjk2t9,False,t3_merb9p,False,True,t3_merb9p,/r/Coronavirus/comments/merb9p/feng_zijian_deputy_director_of_chinas_center_for/gsjk2t9/,1616900592,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Just really wish people would be consistent with logic. The blatant contradiction on population density in the same comment stood out. My last reference cites a study that accounts for population density across all states.

&gt;In my state of Wisconsin, we didn’t have a mask mandate until late July, and we waited all but 2 weeks before we sent the kids back to college. This seeded the spike in cases that we saw in Wisconsin and the rest of the country.

Wisconsin has been a harder one to analyze because you have a governor that sorta gets it but constantly fighting a heavily-gerrymandered state legislature, wary of the court balance at what they'll strike down, and some counties that want to do their own thing, strong anti-mask sentiment from everything I've read. 

But yeah I think the a critical part in general was over the summer. Case counts had declined somewhat in a lot of places, many governments got complacent, lifted restrictions on high risk areas and mask mandates, surges happened in the south as people flocked to high-risk indoor areas, remained at a high level elsewhere. Pointing to the winter surge (where maskless indoor household gatherings had a larger contribution to the spread) as evidence masks failed is silly, since it was largely dependent on the level of virus currently in the community (in addition to antimask policies in many areas through November). Far greater chance that holiday gatherings spread the virus when the base level of contagion in the community is so much higher going in.

The best data we have on that point is the Israeli data on the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine, and what they found is that it prevents 97% of symptomatic infections and 94% of asymptomatic infections. This potentially suggests that this vaccine can decrease transmission pretty dramatically -- a person that isn't infected can't transmit the virus! In addition, community spread appears to have decreased dramatically in populations that are vaccinated, suggestive of potentially decreased transmission.

With that said, a couple things to keep in mind. First, it's not obvious that all the vaccines will be similarly effective at doing this -- in fact, it's quite likely that some vaccines will suppress transmission less than others. Second, these studies do not *directly* measure transmission; rather, they measure the amount of symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, and we use that decrease to interpret that there is very likely a decrease in transmission. Finally, it's likely that the risk will not be *zero*, per se -- although that's rarely the case with anything in medicine.

Divide and conquer would imply an outside power is going to swoop in and conquer us, that philosophy doesn't make sense internally. How does the US conquer the US? 

The issue is that one party (the GOP) who previously controlled a majority of the money, and previously held a majority stake on policy post-Reagan, is watching their followers die off and their money leech over to new industries due to their agenda being destroyed by a developing world. The other party (the Dems) are gleefully accepting the success they're being handed passively thanks to their investments into innovation, phony ""progressivism"", etc. So the GOP is getting desperate to maintain their party as they're starting to realize their party demise is inevitable in the current republic. This realization conveniently occurred during a time where we now have the ability to essentially brainwash the masses thanks to social media algorithms being trained by literally billions of brains at once. 

So now the Dems are retaliating with the same tools because they want to just ride this wave to the top unopposed before socialism can slip in and steal the show.

Boris Johnson tried to delay the vaccine rollout for two weeks to get a fucking Union Jack sticker on the vial, he doesn't care about helping people just re-opening the economy and being a ""war time"" hero.

The UK vaccine program has been great but with huge amounts of waste as there is no plan or list for extra leftover doses. We can't even build a list. Not to mention the millions of wasted taxpayer money spent on a ""world beating"" track and trace system that never, ever worked.

Multi-omni-shambles.

&gt;The sobering warning was delivered Sunday in a newspaper opinion signed by 41 Paris-region doctors. Published by Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper, it comes as French President Emmanuel Macron has been vigorously defending his decision not to completely lockdown France again as he did last year. Since January, Macron’s government has instead imposed a nationwide overnight curfew and followed that with a grab-bag of other restrictions.

&gt;But with infections soaring and hospitals increasingly running short of intensive care beds, doctors have been stepping up the pressure for a full French lockdown.

&gt;The Paris-region doctors who wrote in Le Journal du Dimanche said: “We have never known such a situation, even during the worst (terror) attacks” that targeted the French capital, notably assaults by Islamic State extremists in 2015 that killed 130 people and filled Paris emergency wards with the wounded.

&gt;The doctors predicted that softer new restrictions imposed this month on Paris and some other regions won’t quickly bring the resurgent epidemic under control. They warned that hospital resources won’t be able to keep pace with needs, forcing them to practice “catastrophe medicine” in the coming weeks as cases peak.

&gt;”We already know that our capacity to offer care will be overwhelmed,” they wrote. “We will be obliged to triage patients in order to save as many lives as possible. This triage will concern all patients, with and without COVID, in particular for adult patients’ access to critical care.”

&gt;Macron remains adamant that not locking France down again this year, like some other European countries, was sound, even as more than 2,000 deaths per week push the country ever closer to the milestone of 100,000 people lost to the pandemic. The country now counts more than 94,400 dead.",,,1616945909,{},gsl5ntr,False,t3_mf0yst,False,True,t3_mf0yst,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mf0yst/paris_doctors_warn_of_catastrophic_overload_of/gsl5ntr/,1616946010,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

British Medical Journal reported that Pfizer's first dose was 52% protective at two weeks, see https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4826

Israel's real world data, on the other hand, found almost no protection at 2 weeks, but around 90% protection at 3 weeks. ""After initial injection case numbers increased to day 8 before declining to low levels by day 21. **Estimated vaccine effectiveness was pretty much 0 at day 14 but then rose to about 90% at day 21 before levelling off**.

The most likely explanation for the gap: the trial volunteers did as they were told, behaved exactly as if they didn't get a vaccine, and saw steady rise in protection.

Yet, I need to pay premium for life and health insurance because people choose to lead very unhealthy lifestyles.

It shows a complete misunderstanding of market dynamics on a long term basis. Let me rewind a bit. In 1994, the market was in balance. Starting in Jan 1995, the dot com boom began and started a massive bubble. In late 2000, this began to correct. This became an over correction in July 2002, which quickly rebounded and brought the market back in balance in Jan 2004. The market made stable gains until Oct 2007, when the subprime mortgage crisis reared it ugly head. It should be noted that this was an actual crash, and there was no market bubble at the time. The market bottomed in March 2009 and has actually never fully recovered. After a partial recovery, Covid hit and pushed it down yet again. In Nov 2020, the market returned to where it should have been without Covid, but the recovery from the 2008 crisis is still far from complete. If it had fully recovered, the SP500 should have hit 5,850 this month. We’re at about 4,000 currently.

Barring another global crisis, what we are about to see is a bull market that will have to be seen to be believed. People will say “but it can’t do that! It’s already gained so much since March 2020!” And again...those are the people who lack long term market perspective. What funnier is that I would be willing to bet that once the market fully recovers, people will claim that it now must crash because surely this is just like the 1920s run up to the Great Depression.

“There were 68 steps that no one knew about,” Lurie recalled. “My favorite was the fumigation certificate required for the wood pallet for exporting doses to the Philippines.”

Merck faced similar problems when it tried to ship its Ebola vaccine to West Africa during the 2014-16 epidemic there. Commercial and trade rules, Food and Drug Administration regulations and other red tape make shipping an unlicensed vaccine out of the country very complex, said Feinberg, who was then a senior Merck scientist. “It took a lot of jumping through hoops to even send the vaccine to Guinea or Liberia or Sierra Leone.”

The UK plants are mentioned in 5.4 which deals with sites pre-approved for production as it talks about vaccines generally. This therefore included Additional and Optional doses which the EU could order later. Clause 5.1 specifically states that the Initial European Doses (defined as the original 300M) should be manufactured in the EU - which does not include the UK. 5.4 clearly limits the definition of EU including UK to 5.4 only so it cannot apply to 5.1. 

The two are somewhat contradictory but it seems (and most legal analysis I have read agree with my interpretation) that the Initial doses were to be manufactured at listed EU sites. The Uk factories were pre-approved if the EU ordered more or if AZ decided to use them down the line as they probably intended after fulfilling the 100M exclusivity deal with the UK. The Commission is choosing to interpret this as UK sites being involved for everything because it is politically expedient to do so. But if that were the intention why specifically state otherwise in 5.1 and limit the scope in 5.4? 

The contract seems to be a bit of a mess considering the high powered legal teams available to both sides but I am not a lawyer and certainly not a Belgian lawyer.

Few things:
Your articles are saying exactly what I am saying.  The problem is we are detaining minors in the US rather than turning away or making them wait on the river. We are not just letting ""illegals"" in as was originally stated.  Your article highlights that this detention has created the crisis that we see now.  Biden is going with the moral high ground.  


This is were I think you are confused: 
&gt;I would in fact make sure that there is, that we immediately surge to the border — all those people are seeking asylum. They deserve to be heard,” Biden said. “That’s who we are. We’re a nation that says, ‘If you want to flee and you’re fleeing oppression, you should come.’”

This is 100% correct but not saying what you think it is saying.  Asylum seeking is not illegal immigration.  We are legally and morally obligated to help asylum seekers. Since they came out with this statement, they have explicitly launched a campaign saying hold off due to the extreme circumstances we are dealing with now.  I can try to find the presser with the lady in charge of the program if you are interested.


Thanks for the link to the press conference, I watched it live (I end up watching most of them due to the nature of my job).  I think there are two great moments in that - the first, when he says something along the lines of, he has no regrets about detaining the minors over sending them back and forcing children to fend for themselves. This is important to me. The second was the analogy of the parents deciding to sell everything to send their child with a stranger to the United States.  The story is designed to tug at the heart strings but it is something that I have personal knowledge/experience with so it hit home.  Early in my career, I worked on a project cataloging the remains (DNA and other) of those who tried to make the trip to the US but never made it.  The goal of the project was to give parents and relatives closure.  To those parents and relatives that story was a reality. 


I agree with you that they are coming due to the perception that Joe Biden will allow them in.  I think this is different from reality and is unfortunately being used as an advertising tool as your links say.  I am careful distancing their perception with reality.  My immediate thought is to draw parallels to what the people who stormed the capital are stating about their reasons behind Jan 6th.",,,1616894037,{},gsj86ef,False,t3_md0o40,False,False,t1_gsctcv0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/md0o40/biden_will_announce_new_covid_vaccine_goal_200/gsj86ef/,1616895274,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

However, they’ve gone through all the stages any other vaccine would need to go through before being widespread. Other vaccines typically take longer just from stages being spread out due to the vaccine not needing to be out ASAP. After phase 3 trials, they’d submit for approval. It’s not like they then have to wait 1-5 years to see what happens to those in a phase 3 trial. They just approve it and then keep monitoring afterwards. No one would pour R&amp;D into vaccines if they took 5-10 years to come to market.  

And, these aren’t new in terms of research and development. mRNA technologies have been developed to treat other diseases and conditions, it’s just that there was no need for a new vaccine to use this type of delivery system. We finally ran into the scenario where using it makes a ton of sense, so they did. 

Pretty much all vaccine side effects are found within trial timelines. AFAIK, no vaccine has ever been used, only to find out it has some really bad side effect like 1+ year later. It is extremely unlikely, based on past precedence and how the vaccine works, that it will have side effects that take over a year to manifest. Shit, it would be extremely rare if they took over 6 weeks to manifest. That’s why trials are the length they are. It’s extremely unlikely something would present after they conclude. If it’s going to happen, it’s going to happen relatively fast. The mRNA in the vaccine is only going to be circulating within you for 1-3 days. I had mine last Sunday. The only thing inside me now are spike proteins that my body is producing an immune response to. It will eventually destroy those, and then that’s it.

Want to guess how many times I've seen someone on this sub say the vaccine doesn't reduce transmission? That an individual getting the vaccine changes nothing for that person and they still need to live like a hermit because they can still spread COVID?

Herd immunity comes from the result of individuals getting a vaccine that changes something for each individual person on a mass level. Every person that gets a vaccine is another individual step towards herd immunity. When you get the vaccine, you're helping to end the pandemic and help things get back to normal. Once you're fully vaccinated after a few weeks, you too can start going back to normal (seeing vaccinated friends and family, going to the beach, outdoor dining, etc)

But that's not what was being sold to a lot of Americans and this is the result of it. We all knew this was coming, where were the campaigns to tell people to #Stay Home or at least #Stay Local?

All of this in the same year where school closed abruptly mid year, no longer being able to see friends or have hobbies outside the home, probably some school struggling with remote learning like so many others... gosh 2020 is just cursed for them.

In comparison even if at that same time our family was going through a similar amount of stress, at least it ended up not being ""serious"", we got the news a couple day prior to xmas that our sons biopsy came back negative for cancer and that he could get the tumor removed safely and would no longer be in pain once recovered (he had the surgery the day after his friends dad died). Sure it had been a scary month but in comparison it is nothing. The worst for us this year was mostly our daughter who definitely struggled with remote learning and luckily she s been back in person for a bit while our son stayed remote to recover and have physical therapy.

As it is a novel disease, inevitably there have been numerous suggestions for treatments for Covid-19, ranging from [herbal tonics ](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-53756752)to the [anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine](https://www.drugs.com/monograph/hydroxychloroquine.html), as advocated by the former US president. The question is: what treatments work best?

It is not enough just to compare what happened to people who did or did not have the treatment, which may, for example, have been given to healthier patients. The only reliable method is to allocate volunteers at random to either receive the novel treatment or a control, and, if possible, neither they nor the medical team know which. [Randomised trials reduce statistical biases ](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aogs.13309)and, if they are large enough, researchers can robustly say whether the intervention helps.

The [Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy (Recovery) ](https://www.recoverytrial.net/)trials began in the UK [more than a year ago](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-03-23-recovery-trial-one-year) and have been extraordinarily successful. The world’s largest Covid-19 trial organisation, with about 40,000 hospital patients so far taking part, Recovery takes advantage of the NHS to simultaneously run overlapping trials, so that each patient may be in many studies.

[Recovery trials have been hugely influential](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m2670). Low-dose dexamethasone is a cheap and widely used steroid that [reduced deaths in Covid patients ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7383595/)receiving invasive mechanical ventilation by 36% (uncertainty interval 19%-49%) and those receiving oxygen by 18% (6%-28%). This finding alone is estimated to have saved 22,000 lives in the UK and more than [a million worldwide](https://www.england.nhs.uk/2021/03/covid-treatment-developed-in-the-nhs-saves-a-million-lives/). [Another study ](https://www.recoverytrial.net/files/recovery-press-release-tocilizumab_final.pdf)showed that for every 25 patients treated with tocilizumab, one additional life would be saved.

The trials have also found what doesn’t work: hydroxychloroquine showed no clear clinical benefit, and neither did [convalescent plasma](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/statement-from-the-recovery-trial-chief-investigators-15-january-2021-recovery-trial-closes-recruitment-to-convalescent-plasma-treatment-for-patients-hospitalised-with-covid-19), another of Trump’s enthusiasms; they have not tested injecting [bleach](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/trump-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus-claims-reaction).

Recovery is one of the UK’s greatest contributions to world health, all based on the deceptively simple principle of deciding treatment by the flip of a (digital) coin. It has demonstrated what can be achieved through efficient organisation, a national health service, dedicated medical teams and vast numbers of volunteers.

If there was some sort of promise that said - “Yes, we are in the height of our vaccine rollout.

Waiting longer does make it less severe - we're vaccinating millions of people every day. That's millions more people that are protected every single day. That's a good reason for me to stay at home. You do you, but I'm going to wait.

It's in Portuguese, so in case you can't read it, I will give a summary below:

* **Chaos in the Ministry of Health:** in the last twelve months, we've gone through four health ministers, including one who was fired by Bolsonaro for disagreements over how to handle the pandemic, and another who quit for the same reason. This made it very difficult to implement a national strategy against the virus.
* **Bolsonaro's comments against social distancing and other measures** made people confused about the severity of the disease. (I personally don't believe this is a big factor right now, since he has toned down a lot in the last few months.)
* **Fatigue:** people are just tired of never going out and seeing their friends and family. It feels a lot to sacrifice, especially when our economy is getting destroyed and we never actually managed to control the spread.
* **Lack of testing:** yes, we still don't test enough even a year after the pandemic started. We are actually testing *less*. I think I don't need to explain how bad this is. (It's not due to lack of money; mostly, it's about the government's incompetence in implementing a national strategy.)
* Like you suggested, **poor vaccination availability** is also a factor. This was also mostly caused by poor planning. Right now, not even 10% of the adult population has received the first shot.
* **Widespread promotion of use of ineffective (or even dangerous) medicines** against COVID made people feel a false sense of security. (I have my doubts about this one, but here is a [funny picture of Bolsonaro showing a box of hydroxychloroquine to a bird](https://conteudo.imguol.com.br/c/noticias/96/2020/07/23/jair-bolsonaro-segura-uma-caixa-de-cloroquina-do-lado-de-fora-do-palacio-da-alvorada-1595549805622_v2_750x421.jpg).)
* **The new strain:** studies pointed to the emergence of this new strain that is possibly 10 times more infectious than the ""regular strain"", whatever that is. It might be even making people sicker than usual, but we're not really sure.

**tl;dr: it's probably a combination of terrible handling of the situation by the government, people being tired and a new strain.

&gt;the only noticeable difference between Canada and the United States is the extent to which Canada has noticeably lower population density

So you understand population density. Good start. Somehow you failed to mention that comparison for the Dakotas.

&gt;[their death rates were still lower than multiple ""serious"" states and mostly indistinguishable from the bulk of the country](https://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/states-normalized.html?chart=states-normalized&amp;highlight=North%20Dakota&amp;show=us-states&amp;y=both&amp;scale=linear&amp;data=deaths&amp;data-source=jhu&amp;xaxis=right#states-normalized).

Fatality rate in South Dakotas is 28% higher than the national average. The Dakotas has a far lower population density than the national average, comparable to Canada in fact.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_states\_and\_territories\_of\_the\_United\_States\_by\_population\_density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population_density)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada)

Yet over 3 times the fatality rate as Canada.

[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/)

The Dakotas in fact have a higher fatality rate than the U.S. average despite 9 times lower population density. Remarkable achievement.

Study that accounts for population density:

1. Letting their guard down. I cannot tell you the feeling of seeing two elderly women, trying to talk to one another. Unable to hear each other, they both pulled down their cloth masks and leaned closer to speak. @#!&amp;??!!

2. Deniers who force their primary care doctors to prescribe antibiotics and steroids on pain of reporting them to insurance or whomever - who then congregate in public unmasked because ""I don't have COVID, it's just a sore throat,""... Six weeks later they arrive at our clinic asking for ""Something stronger."" Did they want a test? No. Did our provider convince them? 50/50. 

3. Antimaskers are at about a 20% rate here. They shop unmasked and unfettered despite a county mask mandate because shops are afraid that employees will be shot. Everyone has a gun carry permit here. 

4. Travel-related sickness. ""I had to see my family in Texas/Georgia/NYC/Michigan/Hawaii/Puerto Rico/Wherever. When I got back I got a call saying she tested positive. Now the entire family is sick.""

5. Some people are still unable to pronounce ""Coronavirus"", and do not know the name ""COVID"". They are completely unaware of the symptoms, do not know how to wear a mask, and have zero idea of how it is transmitted. Is it not watching the news for over a year, not reading a newspaper or magazine, not listening to the radio, having no Internet service, or is it absolutely morbid stupidity?

Fauci knows that people are stretching the rules. He can only keep repeating: Do not go out without a mask, do not travel, etc., over and over and over until perhaps 3 years from now people will look back and say, ""Oh, that's why so-and-so died. What a shame they never thought to follow the rules, tsk, tsk.""

[],,Blurandski,,,[],,,,text,t2_t096p,False,True,[],"Britain is planning to offer 3.7 million Covid jabs to Ireland, in part to help lift the lockdown in Northern Ireland, in a move that could raise tensions with the European Union.

It would be the first time the UK has exported vaccines to the EU, but the plan was described by a cabinet minister as a “poke in the eye for Brussels” because it could disrupt EU unity.
Brussels, which has co-ordinated vaccine procurement and delivery on behalf of its member states, has made slower progress than the UK. Amid an acrimonious dispute over supplies, the EU has threatened to block exports of vaccines and their ingredients.

Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, Michael Gove, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, and Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, have had “outline discussions” about the plan.
Failure to vaccinate the Irish could trigger a third wave in Northern Ireland if people travel across the border when lockdown restrictions are lifted.

A cabinet source said: “Everyone can see the logic of it. It’s good politics while at the same time solving a genuine public health concern in Northern Ireland.
“It is a balancing act, making sure that we have enough vaccines to give the UK’s adult population the second dose. Easter will be when we might be able to start offering vaccines to Ireland.”

Developing countries could receive UK vaccines after Ireland. But the Cabinet Office is drawing up plans to send surplus vaccines to other EU countries this year amid fears that the poor vaccine programme in France and Germany could boost extremist parties.

“The fear is that Macron has made such a mess of things that it might mean we end up with Marine Le Pen getting elected,” a well-placed Whitehall source said. “No one wants that.”
In Germany the Green Party candidate is tipped to succeed Angela Merkel’s CDU.

Yesterday Boris Johnson said he could see “absolutely nothing” to stop Britain “getting back to the life we love”. But, addressing the third wave in Europe, he said “bitter experience” had shown it could hit the UK “three weeks later”.
Public health officials in Northern Ireland have warned No 10 of the dangers of lifting lockdown restrictions, given the risks from the slower vaccination rate in the Irish Republic. Infection rates there are significantly higher, with 606 cases recorded on Thursday and three deaths, while in Northern Ireland 183 cases were recorded and zero deaths.
Johnson faces calls today to start donating vaccines amid claims that the UK is on track to have more than 100 million surplus doses. In a letter to the prime minister, leading health and development charities urge him to take “accelerated action”.

Research by the ICC Foundation warns that vaccine nationalism and unequal distribution of jabs could cost the UK £106 billion if “dangerous variants” emerge in unvaccinated populations abroad. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a scientist on the Sage team, said the UK “must start sharing” its surplus doses.
“The world won’t be safe while any single country is still fighting the virus. If left to spread, it risks mutating to an extent where our vaccines and treatments no longer work. This goes beyond ethics — it’s a scientific and economic imperative.”

Kevin Watkins, head of Save the Children, said “vaccine nationalism” would “prolong the pandemic and risk the emergence of dangerous variants”.
Two weeks ago, the prime minister told Micheál Martin, the taoiseach, that the UK would not be giving out any surplus supplies until its population had been protected.

According to the latest data, 55 per cent of UK adults over the age of 18 have received a first jab and 5.3 per cent a second after a record-breaking week.

All over-40s are expected to have received a vaccination by Easter. On Friday Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, accused the UK of “blackmailing” Brussels and making it “pay the price” for Britain’s decision to “hurry ahead” with first doses.",,,1616898090,{},gsjgphi,True,t3_mesgnl,False,True,t3_mesgnl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mesgnl/uk_to_offer_ireland_37m_spare_vaccines_from_easter/gsjgphi/,1616899048,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,Blurandski,,,[],,,,text,t2_t096p,False,True,[],"Britain is planning to offer 3.7 million Covid jabs to Ireland, in part to help lift the lockdown in Northern Ireland, in a move that could raise tensions with the European Union.

It would be the first time the UK has exported vaccines to the EU, but the plan was described by a cabinet minister as a “poke in the eye for Brussels” because it could disrupt EU unity.
Brussels, which has co-ordinated vaccine procurement and delivery on behalf of its member states, has made slower progress than the UK. Amid an acrimonious dispute over supplies, the EU has threatened to block exports of vaccines and their ingredients.

Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, Michael Gove, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, and Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, have had “outline discussions” about the plan.
Failure to vaccinate the Irish could trigger a third wave in Northern Ireland if people travel across the border when lockdown restrictions are lifted.

A cabinet source said: “Everyone can see the logic of it. It’s good politics while at the same time solving a genuine public health concern in Northern Ireland.
“It is a balancing act, making sure that we have enough vaccines to give the UK’s adult population the second dose. Easter will be when we might be able to start offering vaccines to Ireland.”

Developing countries could receive UK vaccines after Ireland. But the Cabinet Office is drawing up plans to send surplus vaccines to other EU countries this year amid fears that the poor vaccine programme in France and Germany could boost extremist parties.

“The fear is that Macron has made such a mess of things that it might mean we end up with Marine Le Pen getting elected,” a well-placed Whitehall source said. “No one wants that.”
In Germany the Green Party candidate is tipped to succeed Angela Merkel’s CDU.

Yesterday Boris Johnson said he could see “absolutely nothing” to stop Britain “getting back to the life we love”. But, addressing the third wave in Europe, he said “bitter experience” had shown it could hit the UK “three weeks later”.
Public health officials in Northern Ireland have warned No 10 of the dangers of lifting lockdown restrictions, given the risks from the slower vaccination rate in the Irish Republic. Infection rates there are significantly higher, with 606 cases recorded on Thursday and three deaths, while in Northern Ireland 183 cases were recorded and zero deaths.
Johnson faces calls today to start donating vaccines amid claims that the UK is on track to have more than 100 million surplus doses. In a letter to the prime minister, leading health and development charities urge him to take “accelerated action”.

Research by the ICC Foundation warns that vaccine nationalism and unequal distribution of jabs could cost the UK £106 billion if “dangerous variants” emerge in unvaccinated populations abroad. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a scientist on the Sage team, said the UK “must start sharing” its surplus doses.
“The world won’t be safe while any single country is still fighting the virus. If left to spread, it risks mutating to an extent where our vaccines and treatments no longer work. This goes beyond ethics — it’s a scientific and economic imperative.”

Kevin Watkins, head of Save the Children, said “vaccine nationalism” would “prolong the pandemic and risk the emergence of dangerous variants”.
Two weeks ago, the prime minister told Micheál Martin, the taoiseach, that the UK would not be giving out any surplus supplies until its population had been protected.

According to the latest data, 55 per cent of UK adults over the age of 18 have received a first jab and 5.3 per cent a second after a record-breaking week.

All over-40s are expected to have received a vaccination by Easter. On Friday Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, accused the UK of “blackmailing” Brussels and making it “pay the price” for Britain’s decision to “hurry ahead” with first doses.",,,1616897973,{},gsjghsh,True,t3_mesfj4,False,True,t3_mesfj4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mesfj4/britain_to_offer_ireland_37_million_covid/gsjghsh/,1616898950,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

If it was a few months later I would have sworn I had COVID, coughed so hard for a week I coughed up blood in the morning. Coughed so hard I threw up constantly.

But once I felt better, aka after a monthy coughing was no worse than a cold and I stopped having evening temps of 100 degrees, I just felt fatigued. Like bad. That Christmas (2019) I had gotten a smart watch I had been wanting. I would struggle to go up a single flight of stairs. My heart rate was like 100+ for a minute after. I wore that watch and every time I stood up to go to the break room it was 100-140bpm. 6 months later I was at brunch (a month before COVID lockdowns) and after brunch looked at my bom tracker, literally every time I stood up it shot up to 140bpm for a bit.

I was dizzy constantly. If I drank coffee (which I had high caffeine tolerance to) I would feel so dizzy I would have to sit down, it was like bad vertigo. I had times my vision would black out from standing. I got use to just sitting up slowly then standing slowly. Heart rate would be elevated just trying to go to sleep too, heart randomly racing. At one point I was raking dirt and had to stop because my heart was pounding, pulled my phone out, 180bpm. I will note that prior to getting sick my resting heart rate was like 65bpm and I could jog a half mile easily. But even now, 1.5 years later I still get winded just walking around sometimes. I never fully recovered. My lungs also feel just bad sometimes like they did when I was smoking, just congested and I feel out of breath wearing my mask (still do, pretty sure it doesn't affect oxygen levels).

I did a ton of research and just figured it had to be POTS. I didn't know that, like the article notes, it commonly shows up after illness. Whatever I had was bad and still sffects my life although I am mostly back to normal. I didn't even have COVID, it didn't exist yet. So when people tell me to stop being dramatic ... No. I can't go through that again. I can't put my family through it again.

On the same BOD previously has sat Jacob and Nathaniel Rothschild and this same org conducts deals behind the scenes with Soros Group. You see they play both sides on the political front, yet work together behind the scenes. Same goes for AEI who hold their group meetings down on Sea Island. They have never met a war they didn't like or couldn't profit from. Their members come from both political parties and hive five it in the hallways and clubrooms while the public gets duped and lied to time and time again about their wars, often conducted on behalf of Israel and the Zionist controlled media/Hollywood/banks, etc. 

Then there is the World Economic Forum and the Bilderberg Group seemingly working on behalf of the billionaire class. Their connections run deep into EU think tanks, the IMF, World Bank, UN and Swiss and German pharmaceutical companies. Behind the scenes they are tied into the Atlantic Council and the Council on Foreign Relations.

* The vaccine takes time to work.  It's at least 2 weeks from the time of the first dose until you've got any decent protection, and real ""immunity"" doesn't come until two weeks after the second dose.  So the number of people truly immunized is naturally lagging way behind the number of doses we're administering.

* At this point there is surely a lot of overlap between people with natural immunity and vaccinated people.  So you can't just add the two together.  

* Almost 25% of our population are under 18 and can't be vaccinated, so when you combine that with adults who won't get the vaccine, we probably can't actually reach herd immunity in the US right now.  Hopefully that won't be the benchmark for resuming normal life.

And even if we don’t, once the vaccine is widely available and everyone who wants it can get it, which Biden is encouraging by May 1 and many states are doing earlier, people are gonna start dropping restrictions and precautions left and right.

No way we're at herd immunity (meaning, so many people are immune that the virus can't spread) by end of Spring.  Even if we got to 70% vaccinated (which would be a stretch based on our expected pace), that's not enough to accomplish something that looks like herd immunity.  Honestly, I'm not sure we ever get to something that looks like herd immunity - cases will be lower, but I don't think they are ever going to be effectively zero and non-transmissible (as is the case with something like measles).

&gt; The U.S. vaccination campaign is accelerating rapidly, with more than 91 million people — roughly a third of the adult population — having received at least one shot of a Covid-19 vaccination by Saturday. And nearly every state has announced that it will meet President Biden’s directive to make all adults eligible by May 1.

&gt; But as of Saturday afternoon, two states — Arkansas and New York — still had not declared a timeline for their residents, according to a New York Times vaccine rollout tracker.

&gt; A third state, Wyoming, has also not said when all adults would be able to get the shot, but eligibility in the state expands on a county-by-county basis, a spokeswoman for the state’s Department of Health said, and 20 of the state’s 23 counties now allow all adults to get vaccinated. She said she expected full access “quite soon.”

&gt; In Arkansas, where a Times database shows that about 13 percent of the population of three million has been fully vaccinated, Gov. Asa Hutchinson this week extended eligibility to military veterans who are at least 18 years old. That decision came soon after appointments opened up for additional essential workers and adults between 16 and 64 who have some health conditions. ...

...

&gt; In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said at a news briefing this week that other states were setting dates based on allocation projections coming from the federal government. But Mr. Cuomo said he wanted “to make sure that the allocation projections that we’re getting from the feds are right” before setting a specific date for eligibility expansion.

&gt; “I would rather get the specific allocation number and then tell the people of the state,” Mr. Cuomo said, “so we don’t have to change advice and we don’t create pandemonium for the scheduling operation.” ...",,,1616945096,{},gsl3z8l,False,t3_mf1xw1,False,False,t3_mf1xw1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mf1xw1/a_third_of_us_adults_have_received_first_doses/gsl3z8l/,1616945176,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The important question is how many neutralising antibodies you actually need in real life.   It’s hard to tell.  But AZ looked like it still had an 22% efficacy against the SA strain in real life, even with an 86-fold reduction in neutralising antibodies in the lab.    So a 2-7 fold decrease in the other vaccines is probably not as bad as it sounds.   Definitely doesn’t mean efficacy would drop down to 50-13%.",,,1616931253,{},gskmwlp,False,t3_megqx9,False,True,t1_gsk6u7f,/r/Coronavirus/comments/megqx9/brazils_mismanagement_of_covid19_threatens_the/gskmwlp/,1616931263,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Essentially, had we failed to take the steps we did, millions more vulnerable people would have died. And we would have overwhelmed the health systems worldwide and millions more would have died from a lack of healthcare access. Certain areas had this outcome at least somewhat, like Italy. They relied on neighbors for help and took more and more extreme measures to reduce spread. However, if most of the globe had been the same, there would have been no neighbors to rely on. 

Even now, my local hospitals were on the verge of collapsing just a few months ago, and even now wait times can be 7+ hours in the ED. People have died in the ED waiting, it's horrible. And that's for many reasons, staff is stretched thin and finding more workers now is almost impossible, several units are still chock full of Covid people that need constant care, other regional hospitals are the same or worse. It's a bad time still to need hospital care. 

And the comments are angry because you are doubting something that's pretty basic.

Yes. It's called a 7 day average or weekly rolling average.

Its rolling average of deaths actually went from 23 on March 26 to 20 on March 27, so no, once again, you are giving out false information. 

&gt;That's why the trend line is consistently projecting upwards since early March.

It is not.

&gt;It's not difficult to understand why this is worrisome.

Too early to tell.

&gt;If you want to take a quick glance, look at the peak reporting day of each week, which falls on a thurs, and look at the trend over the past several weeks -- it's been increasing since early March. 

I have, and you're wrong. It's alright, people hate being wrong.

I don’t think there’s any official guidance on it yet.

Schools, particularly elementary schools, is one area where I have greater respect for the argument to reopen so my view is maybe more along the lines of reopening provided big steps are made to keep schools safer, filters, PPE. I hope the recent stimulus can help with making schools safer in general from virus spread going forward. The emotional effects of being out of school a long time are a big concern for kids, and at least younger kids may not be great vectors of spread.

The guy is pretending that the US did everything right but it was just the Canadians and Mexicans constantly bringing the virus into our borders and that was the problem. 

The fact remains that earlier action, masking from the beginning, and more effective lockdowns would have helped save us from the worst consequences.

In my state of Wisconsin, we didn’t have a mask mandate until late July, and we waited all but 2 weeks before we sent the kids back to college. This seeded the spike in cases that we saw in Wisconsin and the rest of the country. It was failed policy all around. If we had worn masks from day one, and shutdown the bars when needed, and the schools when cases got out of control; we wouldn’t have seen 550k deaths. 

It was poor management through and through and the anti mask and herd immunity crowd that wanted to shove this virus down our throats are the ones to blame for this mess.

https://artnaturals.com/blog/hand-sanitizer-recall-and-what-you-should-know.html

&gt;ONE QUESTION WE ARE OFTEN ASKED IS “IS ARTNATURALS HAND SANITIZER ON THE RECALL LIST?” 
 

&gt;Due to the global demand for sanitizing and personal protective products, hand sanitizer sales have grown at an unprecedented and exponential rate. With this demand, poorly formulated hand sanitizers made their way into the market, causing a massive recall of certain brands of hand sanitizer. 

 

&gt;Earlier this year the FDA warned that certain hand sanitizers may not be able to properly clean and sanitize hands, due to insufficient levels of ethyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol. On top of that, the agency has announced that certain hand sanitizers have tested positive for methanol, a type of alcohol that can be toxic when applied to your hands, and dangerous when ingested. 

 

&gt;The FDA released a list of 149 sanitizers that they deemed unsafe to use. One name you will not find that list is artnaturals! Your safety is our number one priority and we are committed to providing you with top of the line high-quality ingredients to keep you and your family safe. 

 

&gt;We offer a variety of sanitizing solutions that you can trust to be free of menthol, and contain the appropriate amount of sanitizing ingredients to effectively and safely sanitize your hands. 

 

&gt;Our scent-free plant-based hand sanitizer cleanses your hands of dirt, grime, and germs with the natural healing power of aloe vera, hydrating jojoba oil, and nourishing VItamin E.  Cleanse and protect your hands with our vegan formula that leaves your hands hydrated, healthy, and germ-free.

 

&gt;Additionally, you can make sanitizer with our Pure Isopropyl Alcohol. With 99% minimum specifications, it’s high-purity premium quality. You can use it directly on the skin, to make hand sanitizer, or mix with water to create a rubbing alcohol antiseptic. You can also use it for general cleaning, first aid, and more. It’s completely safe to use, but please be aware that prolonged exposure can dry the skin. This is why we recommend pairing it with aloe vera or a similar moisturizing agent.

 

&gt;For on-the-go use, try our artnaturals sanitizing wipes, formulated with 75% ethyl alcohol to help kill up to 99.9% of germs. Our on-the-go wipes help keep hands (and wipeable environments) safe and sanitary wherever you go!

7 in 10 people hospitalized for Covid-19 have not fully recovered five months after discharge, study says

By Meera Senthilingam, CNN

(CNN)Seven in 10 people hospitalized for Covid-19 have not fully recovered five months after discharge, a new study finds.

The Covid survivors continued to experience concerns with their mental and physical health, with 1 in 5 people developing a new disability, and a similar number either not working or having to change jobs due to their health, according to findings by UK researchers.

The people most likely to have persistent symptoms were middle-age White women who developed severe Covid-19, and who had at least two conditions that put them at greater risk of severe disease, such as diabetes, asthma or heart disease.

""Our results show a large burden of symptoms, mental and physical health problems and evidence of organ damage five months after discharge with COVID-19,"" Rachael Evans, an associate professor at the University of Leicester and respiratory consultant at Leicester's hospitals, said in a statement.

""It is also clear that those who required mechanical ventilation and were admitted to intensive care take longer to recover,"" she said, but highlighted that much of the wide variety of persistent problems was not explained by the severity illness, indicating other underlying reasons.

The UK-wide study analyzed 1,077 people who were discharged from hospital between March and November 2020, who developed Covid-19. Among them, 67% where White, 36% were women and 50% had at least two conditions that put them at risk of severe disease.

When the participants were followed up five months later, only 29% of people said they felt fully recovered, while more than 90% of people had at least one persistent symptom, and most experienced an average of nine ongoing symptoms.

The 10 most common symptoms were muscle pain, fatigue, physical slowing down, impaired sleep quality, joint pain or swelling, limb weakness, breathlessness, pain, short-term memory loss, and slowed thinking, according to the study, which has not been peer-reviewed.

Mental health was also affected, with more than 25% of people having clinical symptoms of anxiety or depression and 12% having symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

The participants were also divided into four groups based on the severity of their symptoms at follow-up: Very severe, severe, moderate and mild, with 46% of people in this last group.

Based on these groups, the researchers also identified a potential cause for the ongoing effect on health.

Five months after discharge, patients with the most severe symptoms had higher levels of a protein called C-reactive protein, which is associated with inflammation in the body, explained Louise Wain, chair in respiratory research at the University of Leicester and co-investigator on the study.

""From previous studies, it is known that systemic inflammation is associated with poor recovery from illnesses across the disease spectrum,"" said Wain.

In the groups, persistent inflammation in the body determined by this C-reactive protein was related to the severity of symptoms, but not how severe the participant had been affected by Covid-19 when in hospital.

""We also know that autoimmunity, where the body has an immune response to its own healthy cells and organs, is more common in middle-aged women. This may explain why post-COVID syndrome seems to be more prevalent in this group, but further investigation is needed to fully understand the processes.""

The researchers are now calling for more follow-up care to be provided for Covid survivors.

Our findings support the need for a proactive approach to clinical follow-up with a holistic assessment to include symptoms, mental and physical health, but also an objective assessment for cognition,"" said Chris Brightling, a professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Leicester and the chief investigator for study.

""Continued study of the trajectory of recovery over a longer timeframe, coupled with greater understanding of the biology underpinning post-COVID symptoms, will further inform approaches to the clinical management post-COVID19 infection,"" he said.

The study participants will be assessed again at 12 months to gather more data on the long-term impact of Covid-19.

Professor Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical officer and co-lead for the National Institute for Health Research, said in a statement: ""It is important that we work out what exactly the various elements of what is currently termed 'Long Covid' are so we can target actions to prevent and treat people suffering with long term effects.""

""I know Long COVID can have a lasting and debilitating impact on the lives of those affected and I'm determined to improve the care we can provide,"" UK Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said in a statement.

""Studies like this help us to rapidly build our understanding of the impact of the condition and we are working to develop new research so we can support and treat people.""

Every Pennsylvania adult who wants a coronavirus vaccine should be able to get it by June 20, according to projections made by Pennsylvania’s COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force. 

To accomplish that, the state will need to move through its next two phases of the vaccine rollout before opening up to the broader public, said state Sen. Ryan Aument, a Mount Joy Republican serving on the task force, which was created last month by Gov. Tom Wolf.

Aument said the state projects it will complete each of the state’s four vaccination phases by the following dates:

* Phase 1A by April 18
* Phase 1B by May 2
* Phase 1C by May 23
* Phase 2 (general public) by June 20

Pennsylvania is still in Phase 1A and remains committed to scheduling at least one vaccine appointment for everyone in that group by March 31, and opening eligibility more broadly by May 1, per President Joe Biden’s directive, a spokesperson for the Department of Health said in an email.

Communications staff from the department and Wolf’s office could  not immediately confirm the projected dates for completing most vaccinations shared by Aument.

The projections assume an 80% participation rate. No one will be required to receive a vaccine and some people say they won’t take it. As the vaccine supply increases, the state will continue to target hard-to-reach populations and those who are hesitant to get the vaccine, Aument said.

Vaccinations began in December in Pennsylvania, and Phase 1A includes people age 65 and older, residents and workers at long-term-care facilities, health care personnel and people with medical conditions that put them at high risk for COVID-19.

Once the state gets through Phase 1A, the rest of the rollout will move quickly, Aument predicted. He attributed much of the delay thus far to the large size of the state’s 65-and-older population and to early vaccine rollout fumbles.

The state’s population is 12.8 million, and about a third of them — or about 4.5 million — are eligible under Phase 1A. Some 3.6 million of them, or 80%, are expected to seek the vaccine, and about 2.9 million had already received at least one dose as of Thursday.

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses, while the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine requires only one dose.

The federal government this week reduced its projected Pennsylvania allocation of the one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, but with Pfizer and Moderna continuously surpassing their supply projections, Aument said state officials are confident they’ll still be able to meet their goals.

Many of the country’s most populous states are lowering their age for eligibility from 65 to those in their 50s, with several large states, such as Florida and California, setting April dates for when every adult will be eligible.

Aument said the task force has not discussed lowering the age at this point in Pennsylvania, and he said he believes that changing the eligibility requirements too soon could “lead to a lot of confusion.”

“We have to manage supply in the most effective manner, driving through-put with a laser-like focus on the 1A population that we’ve set,” Aument said. 

Pennsylvania continued to increase the volume of vaccine doses administered in the past week, now ranking 15th in the country for administering at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Aument predicted that the supply will surpass the demand “sooner than we think.” 

“It is quite remarkable — where we’ve been in the response to COVID,” Aument said.

Aument said he understands the frustration and early chaos during the state’s early rollout, but credited “American ingenuity” for the ability to mass produce vaccines to help the country end the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I hope folks can see how remarkable it has been particularly over the last couple of months and to get so many millions of Pennsylvanians vaccinated in a very short period of time,” he added.

As of Friday, at least 122,237 Lancaster County residents had been at least partially vaccinated, out of an estimated 432,000 people old enough to receive the vaccine.",,,1616961108,{},gsm1s0j,True,t3_mf8fam,False,True,t3_mf8fam,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mf8fam/pa_officials_project_every_adult_in_pa_will_be/gsm1s0j/,1616961119,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

But here's where it gets tricky. Let's say a person gets their first dose of either Pfizer or Moderna, but has a severe allergic and is told by their doctor not to get the second dose...

They would still likely have significant immunity from one dose, and from the studies in Israel a single dose of Pfizer may be similar to the J&amp;J vaccine, but would they still be able to receive a clearance on the vaccine passport? I would hope yes, but I would also assume not because the developers probably won't think of intricacies beyond ""Vaccinated yes/no""
