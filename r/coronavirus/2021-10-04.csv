Both my parents, recently boosted with Pfizer (around a month or so ago), took 2 PCR tests at separate locations for travel screening.

On Friday, both Negative (PCR) 
On Saturday, both POSITIVE (PCR Rapid NAAT)
On Sunday, both Negative (PCR)

Also on Sunday, they took rapid antigen tests at another location which also came back Negative.

But as of Saturday, they were positive &amp; I live with them. SO…

I booked 2 tests on Saturday.

Test 1: PCR, self administered at a pharmacy drive thru, Negative.

Test 2: ONE HOUR LATER, tested POSITIVE with a Binax Now Abbott Isolate Rapid Antigen test (administered by a nurse)

SO…three people, multiple types of tests, multiple locations, strange results.

To me, it makes sense for someone to test Negative one then Positive the next. But Negative for a highly sensitive PCR test, then Positive 1 hr later with a rapid antigen test….in an area with severe community spread &amp; low vaccinations…???

My parents’ Dr just told them they should consider themselves Negative. Even tho one of the first tests came back Positive. 

The folks at my urgent care place where I tested positive tell me I should assume I’m positive. Today because I’m high risk I got the monoclonal antibodies. Here’s the thing tho: if, by some wild odds, I had a false positive, that means I just spent 2 hrs in a closed environment with several Covid positive folks who were masked but coughing etc.

I’m just baffled at what to think at this point. Also surprised my parents’ dr, who’s usually excellent, is advising them to act negative even tho that goes against CDC guidelines.

Constantly producing antibodies to one particular virus isn't always a very efficient use of resources for an immune system that inhabits a world with millions or billions of different types of microbes and viruses that it has to fight off.

Sure, after an exposure to antigen X, it makes sense for your body to crank up production of antibodies against antigen X.  However, after not seeing it for a while, the immune system factory needs to shift production to the viruses, bacteria, etc., it's encountering more frequently.

That doesn't mean that your immune system is leaving you defenseless.  It has memory B cells, which store the blueprints on how to fight Antigen X, so that when it encounters it again, it can crank up production again.  Yes it takes a bit more time for the factory to shift gears and convert over to producing anti-Antigen X antibodies and T cells, and and yes that time it takes allows the virus to infect you, but once things kick in, the immune system will be in a good position to clean the infection up, preventing you from getting severely ill or dying.

&gt;Ochsner Health said in a letter to its employees last month that it was adding the extra charge — about $200 a month, starting next year — for unvaccinated spouses and domestic partners who are covered by the company’s insurance plan.

&gt;The letter said this move was an effort to “protect our entire Ochsner team, which includes employees, their families and the communities we serve.”

&gt;In a statement, Warner Thomas, the company’s president and chief executive, said that spouses and domestic partners would be allowed to file for medical or religious exemptions to the policy.

&gt;”This is not a mandate,” he said, because spouses and domestic partners can switch insurance plans to avoid the new fee.

&gt;”The reality is the cost of treating Covid-19, particularly for patients requiring intensive inpatient care, is expensive,” he added.

&gt;Mr. Thomas said that about 90 percent of the company’s Covid patients since December have been unvaccinated. According to a New York Times analysis in August, fully vaccinated people accounted for as much as 5 percent of hospitalizations in 40 states and Washington, D.C.

&gt;In August, Ochsner said that its employees must be vaccinated by the end of this month. Around 70 percent of its employees were inoculated at the time the mandate was announced.

&gt;The provider’s decision to charge extra was similar to a policy implemented by Delta Air Lines, which said in August that, starting on Nov. 1, it would charge any employee who remains unvaccinated an additional $200 per month to remain on the company’s health care plan.

&gt;Delta became the first large U.S. employer to embrace an idea that has been widely discussed but is mired in legal uncertainty: charging unvaccinated employees more for health insurance.

&gt;Insurance surcharges may appeal to companies that are seeking a less coercive means to increase vaccination rates, said Wade Symons, a partner at Mercer, a benefits consulting firm.

&gt;New infections in Louisiana on Sunday were less than a fifth of the amount in August, when the state reached a pandemic high, according to a New York Times database. Hospitalizations are experiencing a similar trend.

&gt;The state authorities are still struggling to vaccinate people, however. Less than half of the state’s eligible population is fully vaccinated, according to a Times database, which is below the nationwide average of 56 percent.

The government has spun bullshit about this being some sort of altruistic move for countries who ""needed it more"", but as [Covid 19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins was out claiming they would be ""front of the queue"" for vaccines _last November_](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/new-zealand-front-queue-chris-hipkins-says-nation-well-placed-covid-19-vaccine-roll), that is transparent rubbish.

Luckily their vaccination rates shot up during this recent outbreak, but they seem to be stalling out at just under 80% of adults with one dose. I hope that figure gets higher because since they have no natural immunity they'll be screwed if it tears through the population, as healthcare infrastructure there is woefully not cut out to deal with it. 

Interestingly, the amount of first doses delivered in the eligible population seems to be stalling at pretty much exactly where the [NZ government's polling predicted the acceptance rate](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines/covid-19-vaccine-strategy-planning-insights/covid-19-vaccine-research-insights) to be (77%) back in [April](https://imgur.com/a/QpmWYsU). This begs the question what the government has been planning to do about this, since it has clearly had accurate data on this since prior to when their rollout finally commenced and the current outbreak began.

New Zealand has done well so far in the pandemic, and I'm glad because my family are there. But IMO luck has played a big role in delaying them going through what the rest of the world already has. They managed to delay the start of their pandemic proper, but instead of using that borrowed time to properly prepare for the inevitable, either hubris or complacency has now led them into a situation where they are not prepared as a nation, either in real terms or psychologically, for what is ahead.",,,,1633417267,{},hfgbouq,False,t3_q1nrzx,False,False,t1_hfg6rtw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q1nrzx/new_zealand_admits_it_can_no_longer_get_rid_of/hfgbouq/,1633545432.0,45,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Australia, Medical Scientists perform PCR testing. I don't mean taking swabs. I mean running extraction and amplification processes hence why I noted the target genes. 

I'd be happy to provide you with my credentials if you require.

Post-vaccination bloodwork reflects the biochemical state of the components in the blood which are indicators of pathological trends. If a patient has a deranged MBA panel it usually relates to the state of the body when the blood was extracted. If post-vaccination bloodwork is showing abnormal biochemistry, depending on the value and patient history, it is usually an indicator of acute processes within the body. Im looking for someone to expound on the systemic effects this will have and the purported risk associated with such panels. 

My understanding of the risk associated with prophylatics outweighing the chance of survival from contracting the virus in the first place; is why I'm pursuing this line of questioning. For example, if I have underlying dilated cardiomyopathy and post-vaccination bloodwork is showing increased Troponin from other patients, is it less riskier for me to hold off until 6P vaccines are out? I'm sorry about the word salad. Like, I said I'm looking for someone who has initmate knowledge on the mechanisms of action and excretion of the spike protein post vaccination. 

I have some papers I have gone over, but there is so much conflicting  information out there and im trying to make sense of it all.

Also the situation you are referring to when you talk about countries with high vax rates: that is expected. Mainly vulnerable people get hospitalized with covid. Once you've vaccinated just about 100% of vulnerable people, those same vulnerable people will still be the ones going to the hospital with covid. The idea though is that fewer of them would be hospitalized than if they were unvaccinated and they will go home on their own two feet instead of a body bag.

The good news about our vaccines is that they have saved many lives. The bad news is that the protection drops quickly and we are still in unexplored territory on how many boosters we will need to give and if there's any bad effect from continued boosting.

[],,Dougmw1337,,,[],,,,text,t2_5bxj12z7,False,False,[],"Right now, I am having a darkly ironic laugh at the downvotes you are getting. The thing is, your question is where excellent science begins.

This Gaurdian article didn't even bother to link to the study it quotes, or even name it. It's a freely published study and I was only able to find it because they name dropped the journal and doctor for appeal to authority, not to make it easy for us to find. It's further frustrating that no one in this thread bothered to find, link to or read the study. Shame!

So anyway, to your question, they way we ""prove"" it is to read the study! Which I did! Crazy me! The short of it is that the study authors took electronic medical records from 3 million people in California and put them through a bunch of fancy statistics to try to estimate effectiveness. They attempt to control for the kinds of things that would throw off this kind of study, such as age, ethnicity, overall health and socioeconomic level. The thing is, as an observational study, it is extremely difficult to ""prove"" a cause and effect relationship between getting a vaccine and not getting hospitalized. That's because people know they have been vaccinated, and it's not random people, but specific people who choose to get vaccinated and those people might have very different lives and behaviors than unvaccinated. 

That's the reason FDA trials are randomized double blind, because that's the gold standard for science. These observational studies are more like the copper standard. Useful, but highly subject to the choices the researchers make while massaging the data from a big pile of random health data into a coherent analysis. If a researcher is excellent and ethical, and if the observational study is reviewed by other researchers in a peer review, we might get some good information, but if the researcher is trying to push a particular conclusion and no one else really checks over that closely, it's extremely easy to adjust or weigh the data to produce the conclusion you want.

[],,InclusivePhitness,,,[],,,,text,t2_fc0b6,False,False,[],"First of all, you're using terms very loosely. You said ""prevent hospitalizations/severe Covid"" and now you're loosely using the term ""severe infection"". What is a severe infection? You can have a low viral load and still get very sick.

Secondly, that video mainly focuses on why we shouldn't compare efficacy rates between vaccines, because people were comparing the 'efficacy' figures of each vaccine, which are the primary figures coming out of the vaccine trials that relate to how the vaccines (again, in the trials themselves) prevented INFECTION in the vaccine groups versus the placebo groups. 

Yes, they also published other figures such as efficacy vis-a-vis severe disease and death as well and the video from Vox is highlighting this as the ""more important"" number, but that's editorialization.

The numbers they always publish and highlight first from any vaccine clinical trial are how the vaccines are at preventing infection.

There are PLENTY of vaccines such as MMR, TB, Hep A, Polio, Tetanus, Rabies, etc. that are nearly perfect in preventing any infection when a person is exposed.

You never hear about someone who is missing work because they had a mild case of measles that was mitigated by the vaccine they took as a child. No. They're completely 100% immune to measles.

That's also why most of these viruses (like Polio) have virtually been eradicated worldwide. This is the goal of vaccination in a perfect situation.

Now, what the global health community has done is essentially moved the goalposts. And I don't fault them for doing that, because YES the vaccines aren't perfect, but they're GOOD ENOUGH to potentially stop the pandemic. We have some bad news coming out of countries like Israel and even Singapore, but there are so many moving parts that can explain the rise in cases, but the data on the vaccines are clear in that they greatly increase your chances of having a mild bout with COVID (even the Delta variant) when you are infected, because your body has a bit of a head start to fight against it.

And what we're learning about respiratory viruses (especially of the coronavirus type) is that they are likely to stay with us forever now. We'll have some form of SARS-COV-2, which will likely require us to take boosters every now and then for the rest of our lives, and in all likelihood, unless technology changes drastically, we're going to get less-than-perfect vaccines that won't prevent infection, but will help our bodies to improve our prognosis.

But to say that the primary goal of the global vaccination programs vs. SARS-Cov-2 is a pure moving of goalposts by the media and health organizations to underscore the importance of vaccination, especially in the face of breakthrough cases. But that was never the primary goal. The primary goal, if achievable, is always to prevent infection, period.",,,,1633420813,{},hfgffqy,False,t3_q144ie,False,True,t1_hfg5j9n,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q144ie/05_per_cent_of_those_vaccinated_with_moderna_or/hfgffqy/,1633547595.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The FCC eliminated the policy in 1987 and removed the rule that implemented the policy from the Federal Register in August 2011.\[1\]  
&gt;  
&gt;The fairness doctrine had two basic elements: It required broadcasters to devote some of their airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. Stations were given wide latitude as to how to provide contrasting views: It could be done through news segments, public affairs shows, or editorials. The doctrine did not require equal time for opposing views but required that contrasting viewpoints be presented. The demise of this FCC rule has been considered by some to be a contributing factor for the rising level of party polarization in the United States.\[2\]\[3\]",,,,1633443654,{},hfhcwn9,False,t3_q1n3ri,False,False,t1_hfhapzt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q1n3ri/pfizer_vaccines_protection_wanes_over_time_and/hfhcwn9/,1633566980.0,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Your also ignoring the scale of the problem, and basing things largely on outliers. The trend is pretty clear if you look at the below:

Vax rates / cases per 100k past 14 days / notes 

SK: 72 % / 549 / lifted indoor masking mandates and  gathering restrictions early July, and they did it when only 50% of over 12 had been vaccinated

AB: 72 % / 490 / Central, North and South regions have fully vaxxed less than 65%, and they have 2-3x the case loads / a massive laggard in terms of pretty much all distancing and masking controls, and didn't hit 70% of adults fully vaxxed till Sept 6 (opened up pretty much everything when 70% only had ONE dose on July 7).

BC: 81% / 195 / majority of cases are in the interior heath region, which is has a fully vaxxed rate of 61- 70% / widely criticized for lifting indoor mask mandates too early (on July 1...they since reintroduced)

ON: 81% / 57 / no region has a fully vaxed rate less than 77% / set target of 70% of adults fully vaxxed before lifting most restrictions (hit Aug 13), though even indoor masking guidelines and size restrictions still apply

MB: 82 % / 86 / all regions above 80% vaccination save 1 (southern is at 66%), and guess where most of their cases are coming from? They broadly hit 70% fully vaxxed July 30.

QC: 85% / 101 / hit 70% of adults fully vaxxed on June 21 / they still have indoor masking and capacity limits in place, and have the vaccine passport

Theory of mind is a sophisticated way of looking at the world which starts at around the age of five and continues being refined for years. 

I'm sure there are 4 year olds who could pass the test I described and there are five year olds who wouldn't. 

To your observation about hide and seek in preschoolers, that example highlights how observant little kids are. They know how to watch us and learn the rules. Just because they can play hide and seek the way we expect doesn't necessarily mean they are experiencing the game in the way we think they are. 

I've watched my own 4.5 year old evolve in the way she plays hide and seek over the last year and a half or so. It started as her ""hiding"" while I counted and then running to me as soon as I finished.

Then she was able to stay in place but kept calling my name and telling me where she was. 

Now she stays still and silent until I find ber. But - if I had a magic ball that let me see her thoughts - it wouldn't surprise me if she still *thinks* I already know where she is before I search.

Now, per your pre-edited comment:

Actually, those reactions are normal and to be expected. Additionally, while they may be uncomfortable, [they’re temporary and far less risky or as “bad” as an actual covid-19 infection.](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2021/why-covid-19-vaccines-offer-better-protection-than-infection)

The things that I think may account for our success (and might be useful to consider for places like the U.K.)

1. We have a very high vaccination rate. Eligible population with at least one dose, 86.5%, just over 80% with two. Eligible for us is 12+. Overall population is 76/70.5. 

2. We have had about 3% of the population confirmed with covid, and whatever natural immunity that comes with it - not the most useful number, as I don't know how many cases were missed and how many people who have had covid also got vaccinated (either before or after). But if I were to just throw out a number, it makes me think about 3% of the population + 76% is roughly our total for SOME level of protection - around 80%.

3. The vast vast vast majority of our cases come from the unvaccinated when we normalize the data, highlighting that our vaccines have been quite effective.

4. There seems so be some indication that Moderna has better protection against symptomatic covid, which might have other impacts on things like herd immunity.

5. We had a lot of space between our doses, which got us a lot of shit, but it seems like evidence continues to mount that there could be some impact on efficacy there.

6. We had a lot of mixed dosing, that's just a wild card though I have no idea what effect that has had. I wanna say a good one? Maybe because a lot of those second doses were Moderna due to supply.

7. We have been VERY cautious with masking and slowly opening up. Masking culture is still embedded in everything we do, and capacity limits are still down - and lots of our work force is still working remotely.


I don't know exactly how the UK compares, but I know they also have a pretty good rate of vaccination, and they are also spread out, but the vaccine efficacy might be different with AZ being the primary vaccine and I think Pfizer the second most common? Also they don't seem to have the same restrictions/masking culture and requirements.

So the virus will become endemic.

The thing to understand is that the entire drive towards vaccination since then has been done understanding that this would be the case, and that it is still vitally necessary.

The point of vaccinations is that after being vaccinated or infected the infection fatality rate of subsequent infections drops dramatically by a factor of 10x/20x or so.  Then the virus does become ""just the flu"" or even possibly just a cold.

Immunity will also start to force the virus to make choices towards immune escape and away from virulence.

It is going to look like the 1918 pandemic H1N1 influenza, which spread ever year after that as seasonal influenza until 1957.  The trick is surviving your first exposure to the virus, after that you'll have T-cells that recognize the virus from which immune escape is very difficult or impossible for the virus to achieve.

Everyone on this planet is going to catch the virus, for real, soon or later.  Get vaccinated, though, and by the time that happens it won't be a big deal.

Right now we're having problems in that not enough people got vaccinated, so they're insisting on doing it the natural way, and with high fatality rates they're clogging up the hospitals and the morgues.  1-2% of those people are going to die, but it needs to be dribbled out slowly so that the hospital systems don't fall over.  If everyone had been vaccinated, then we could be having the discussion right now about how to live with the virus, but instead we wait until everyone gets their SARS-CoV-2 T-cells one way or another.",,,,1633386497,{},hfetljr,False,t3_q10ew2,False,False,t1_hfcpklm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q10ew2/new_zealand_admits_it_can_no_longer_get_rid_of/hfetljr/,1633516064.0,27,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This.

I mean most people fully vaccinated who took the pandemic measures seriously last year and then got fully vaccinated are in no way shape in form down for another ""virtual holidays"" and down with avoiding gatherings with other fully vaccinated friends and family. And with reason, because the vaccine was the way out of having to go through those measures. We are as safe as we can be, and asking fully vaccinated people to keep avoiding socializing with other fully vaccinated friends and family is just ludicrious.

I think where Reddit and Redditors stand on avoiding gatherings or precautions even after already being fully vaccinated is nowhere near the reality for where even other previously-cautious people who are fully vaccinated stand. 

No one in my circle I know is avoiding any sort of gatherings, lol.

&gt;Recinos, a family medicine hospitalist in California, was not wearing perfume. The test result, Recinos told her patient, was accurate.

&gt;The interaction, in summer 2020, was an outlier at the time. But in recent months, such conversations have become more common. 

&gt;Recinos has treated people who, two weeks into hospital stays for Covid-related breathing struggles, still do not believe they have the coronavirus. She has had patients who have questioned her judgment, patients who have demanded to be given the same medications that former President Donald Trump received when he had Covid and family members of patients who have screamed at her for something as simple as giving their loved ones oxygen, a necessary treatment that they argue is doing more harm than good.

&gt;”It’s baffling. I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Recinos, who works 12-hour shifts for up to 20 days straight. “So many of us have worked so long and for so many hours, and we’re being undervalued by the general public.”

Given the messaging that 3rd shots are not a booster but part of the main series for immunocompromised, it I think pretty clear cut that 2 shots should not be considered fully vaccinated for that group. The bigger question is people in the ""recommended to get 3rd shot/booster"" group, which is probably something like 30-40% of the people who would have been considered fully vaccinated by the standards of 4 months ago. There's also a small group of people who got the Janssen vaccine who have less protection than the people who got 2 doses of Pfizer who aren't recommended to get the second dose yet. Then you also have the complexity added by 1-dosers. 

Its far from a simple issue, between different risk groups of the people participating, the number of people, the amount of ventilation, how many get negative test results before going, how many people each of the people participating with interacted with recently, how consistently those people wear masks, what masks they wore, etc. 

Perhaps the closest thing we could get to a message is an app that allows you to input your data and gives you an estimate at how likely it is covid will spread at your gathering, how severe the outcomes are to be, how much each NPI would do to prevent spread, etc. Something like the 19 and me calculator.",,LOW_SCORE,,1633385568,{},hferhkw,False,t3_q1e2kx,False,True,t1_hfelaaz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q1e2kx/fauci_remarks_on_christmas_gatherings_were/hferhkw/,1633514951.0,-5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. You said, ""Don't let your guard down."" There are two new studies out that show COVID's gotten better at transmitting through aerosols, just through the air. What does that mean? We're going into cold weather. We're going into the holidays. Do people need to start looking around and saying it's just too risky to gather with family members if there are unvaccinated children?

&gt; DR. FAUCI: Well, MARGARET, I believe just the way the CDC has recommended that when you are in a situation where you have a dynamic of virus in the community, where there's clearly a lot of spread, even if you are vaccinated and you are in an indoor setting, a congregate setting, it just makes sense to wear a mask and to avoid high risk situations. And what we should be doing is look at ventilation in indoor places. We know now that this is clearly spread by aerosol, and when you have something spread by aerosol, you absolutely want more ventilation, which is the reason why outdoors is always much safer than indoors. And if you are indoors, ventilation is going to be key. And that's the reason why we really should be paying attention to that.

&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN: But we can gather for Christmas, or it's just too soon to tell.

&gt; DR. FAUCI: You know, MARGARET, it's just too soon to tell. We've just got to concentrating on continuing to get those numbers down and not try to jump ahead by weeks or months and say what we're going to do at a particular time. Let's focus like a laser on continuing to get those- those cases down. And we can do it by people getting vaccinated and also in the situation where boosters are appropriate to get people boosted because we know that they can help greatly in diminishing infection and diminishing advanced disease, the kinds of data that are now accumulating in real time.


Why can't he just say, if you're vaccinated, it is safe for families to gather? This is what millions of people have been doing for months and will continue to do throughout the holidays.

I'm commenting on the hostility against scientists, and doctors for making advisements. I'm commenting that *where* you live is also a factor, and not everyone is vaccinated, and wearing masks. People have shown ""common sense"" to be in very short supply. And, if we need to break down every word, like we're starting from the beginning it's a little tiresome. My goal is not to argue to adhere to every letter, but to at least listen, and be cautious that there will be risk for *many* people. Why must everything be all, or nothing in conversation? If you only see the world in solid black vs, white, when we live in gradients, you're going to be speaking from absolutes. 

I'm not personally insulting you, or anyone else. Yet, that's how people are taking it. They're acting like the CDC is out to ruin Christmas, and it sounds like the propaganda peddled every year on the airwaves. 

This isn't over, and we can expect a surge for the winter. It's not like it matters, because it seems *everyone* is going to do what they want. What we do with that information is up to us. For a lot of places? That means no mask, no vaxx, and no rules. *those* are the people the guidance is trying to reach. People getting personally mad at the CDC is just ridiculous. Folks will get mad if they don't recommend masks. Then, they'll get mad if they do. I think they're trying to do the best they can, just like a lot of us.

That is some goalpost moving. The trials of the vaccines (at least Pfizer and Moderna) were against symptomatic illness, not just severe illness. During the winter and spring it was ""vaccinations prevent COVID"" not just ""vaccines prevent severe COVID"". It was only during the summer, when very strong evidence of efficacy waning over time began appearing and breakthrough infections were happening left and right that they lowered the bar considerably to ""well, you may get sick as a dog and give it to your loved ones, but you probably won't be intubated."" In Israel it became clear that efficacy against severe disease, at least in people over 60, was also waning. The waning coincided with arrival of Delta, which made the situation much more urgent.

The whole campaign against boosters was in part meant to not discourage the ""vaccine hesitant"" --- but many of them weren't going for shot #1. There was also an agenda on the part of some to concentrate on vaccinating Yemen or something.

From the transcript:

&gt; Well, Margaret, I believe just the way the CDC has recommended that when you are in a situation where you have a dynamic of virus in the community, where there's clearly a lot of spread, even if you are vaccinated and you are in an indoor setting, a congregate setting, it just makes sense to wear a mask and to avoid high risk situations. 

…

&gt; Let's focus like a laser on continuing to get those- those cases down. **And we can do it by people getting vaccinated and also in the situation where boosters are appropriate to get people boosted** because we know that they can help greatly in diminishing infection and diminishing advanced disease, the kinds of data that are now accumulating in real time.

&gt;In other words, we haven't found much evidence that T cells or other mechanisms can compensate for a weak antibody level. 

Eh, I don't know how you define ""much"", but there [is evidence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-021-00625-9) for cell-mediated immunity providing ample protection:

&gt;Intriguingly, host protection mediated by T cells has been observed in patients with COVID-19 who have insufficient humoral immune responses. Among patients with a haematological malignancy who became infected with SARS-CoV-2, anti-CD20 therapy was not associated with increased fatality, disease severity or viral load, despite low titres of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-021-00625-9#ref-CR5). In these patients, including those receiving anti-CD20 therapy, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses were detected, and higher levels of CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity were associated with improved patient survival.

&gt;Similarly, the protective roles of T cell-mediated immunity against SARS-CoV-2 have been demonstrated in animal models. Mice immunized with a vaccine expressing SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes exhibited decreased viral titres and reduced lung pathology when challenged with SARS-CoV-2, despite the absence of nAbs, which indicates that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell vaccination confers partial protection from severe disease[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-021-00625-9#ref-CR6). In a macaque model, CD8+ T cell depletion in convalescent animals was shown to partially abrogate host protection against SARS-CoV-2 re-challenge[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-021-00625-9#ref-CR7). Together, these results in human patients and animal models indicate that T cells have a host protective role during COVID-19, particularly when the humoral immune response is insufficient.",,,,1633404367,{},hfft2pk,False,t3_q1hnb2,False,True,t1_hffkidv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q1hnb2/pfizer_covid_vaccine_antibodies_may_disappear_in/hfft2pk/,1633534755.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;A Pennsylvania minister is counting on warm fall weather to allow some of her congregants to meet for worship outside in October, as it did two Sundays in September.

&gt;And a Virginia megachurch leader has twice met with his congregants at Maryland outdoor venues — usually reserved for concerts and football games — but doubts regular in-person worship will happen before December.

&gt;While many congregations have been back to worship for weeks and months, often masked and socially distant, some African American clergy continue to hold off on in-person services. Others have found that when they do open, most members continue to watch the livestreamed services from home.

&gt;”Every church has to make a decision on where they believe the line of safety is,” said the Rev. Howard-John Wesley of Alexandria, Virginia. “And in our mind, one member contracting COVID on the grounds of Alfred Street would be more than we believe glorifies God.”

&gt;Alfred Street Baptist Church has faced two realities during the pandemic: Virtual services are successfully attracting members, and people are continuing to die from the coronavirus, including a variant Wesley said recently took the life of a 39-year-old church member.

&gt;Wesley said his church is erring on the side of caution — and many of his colleagues are coming to the same conclusions.

&gt;”We compare that to the imagery you see of evangelical white conservative Christians that have their churches back open and are erring on the side of ‘faith,’ and that God will protect us,” Wesley said. “I think you have just a different perspective within African Americans.”

The current epidemiological outcome is a level of herd immunity that offers some protection to those who cannot vaccinate and to try and keep hospital load within manageable levels. This is hard enough as flu alone in the winter is enough to drive hospitals over 100% capacity in most of the world (especially in countries with older populations).

She starting cussing and yelling at the entire staff. She started off bitchy but then just got fucking pissed. 
And guess what, we had to still give her the shot after an hour of her cussing st us. Literally an hour. They seriously don’t pay us enough to “just put pills in a bottle.” I’m a pharmacist btw. 

But I’ll be honest, very honest. I’ve given thousands of shots and got denied by thousands of people when we ask if they want the shot. It’s only fear. Fear of the vaccine but also fear of death. One person asked right before rhe shot if he was going to die. I said yes, but not from this shot. He laughed and got the shot. 

Also, the whole anti vaccine thing is going off of peoples fears. And this is about one thing only, money. Someone somewhere (probably America) is making a lot of money.

There are essentially two types of long covid, the ""any symptom"" variety, most commonly anxiety, followed by any pain, which is fairly common, and where we know the vaccine reduces the probability quite a bit if infected. [This study for example](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1473-3099%2821%2900460-6) had about a 50% reduction to any symptom lasting 28 or more days, IF infected and vaccinated (compared to infected and not vaccinated, so this is not including the reduction in probability in the first place). 

Then there's the ""brain damage"" variety, or generally any measurable damage to organs and/or continuous debilitating symptoms, which is much rarer to start with, and we don't really have much data on how the probability changes IF infected with mild symptoms. We do know serious long covid is much more common with serious disease, and as the vaccine is good at preventing hospitalization, it is also good at  preventing this in general, but does it prevent it if infected but just mild symptoms? 

We cannot just take the 50% reduction of ""any symptom"" long covid and say the vaccine reduces ""brain damage"" long covid IF infected in the first place by 50%. It is easily possible it reduces the serious type of long covid much more - just on common sense, it would seem probable that the vaccine doesn't prevent post-covid anxiety all that well, but could still prevent ""brain damage"" really well. And whether they do or don't, we don't know if a booster would do it better.

A number of Russian regions **reintroduced Covid restrictions — including self-isolation rules and closures of public spaces** — in the days after Russians went to the polls to elect lawmakers and local leaders in mid-September.   
Pro-government media reported Tuesday, citing unnamed government sources, that authorities planned to reimpose restrictions across 11 additional regions in central and southern Russia. The **Kremlin has stopped short of announcing nationwide efforts to slow the spread.**  
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin on Monday expressed the government’s “serious concern” about the surge in infections, saying **hospitalizations have doubled compared with the same period in 2020 and criticizing “insufficient” vaccination rates.**

Ultimately they believe that the risks associated with this illness, to them (and they only think about themselves) are non-existent - and the risks associated with vaccination are therefore significantly higher.

Simple put - they believe they will 100% get nothing more than the sniffles with COVID, and the chance they get a blood clot from a vaccine is being “under reported.”

The rest to them is irrelevant.  Why would they risk ANY chance of some extremely rare side effect when they “know” they’ll be 100% okay if they get COVID.

It’s hyper illogical, and hyper selfish to the extreme, but this is how they think.

They then proceed to believe that because the impact to them will be negligible - well the world (which exists to serve them and them only) needs to go back to normal.

Personal immunity doesn't mean you can't get infected but that you're better prepared to mount an immune response faster, which is why many won't ever see symptoms.  (And the ones that do are likely avoiding a hospital trip/death sentence.)

However, an infected person who has been vaccinated can still spread the disease through air particles, saliva, etc.  We just produce significantly less infectious particles than the unvaccinated because of that rapid immune response, which limits the virus's ability to replicate quickly and cuts down on the available viral load necessary to infect another.

The biggest hurdle was always going to be herd immunity.  You need, at minimum, 60-70% of the population vaccinated or exposed in order to create basic herd immunity, and more virulent diseases need significantly higher rates.  (Things like measles, which requires about 95% to be effective, versus polio, which needs about 80%.)

Explanation: Through the initial estimate and two updates, the CDC has been estimating 4.2 actual infections for every person who gets a positive test. If we multiple current case total by 4.2 and divide by total population, that's enough infections to account for 55% of the population. We also have 56% of the population (67% of adults) fully vaccinated. If we assume that all complicating factors balance out (some cases are reinfections which would reduce number of people exposed, but vaccinated people have been less likely to catch it so cases should be more frequent among the unvaccinated people) then 55% of the population exposed, plus 56% of the other 45% vaccinated comes to 80% (.55+.45*.56=.80) Likewise, .55+.45*.67=.85",,,,1633463327,{},hfinu1m,False,t3_q1pfar,False,True,t1_hfi5eep,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q1pfar/daily_discussion_thread_october_05_2021/hfinu1m/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,9eb379b4faf90c3498f27e837f498b02c9db4e78,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1633463340.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,,

They got the vaccine for other reasons, either for themselves, the sake of their job, their family and local groups. Thus they are protected and feel like they've done ""enough"" and feel warranted to forgo wider precautions. 

It's a difference in the scale of empathy. Which neither smaller or wider scale empathy is bad. But regardless of the scale of their empathy, some people feel justified that they've done their duty and should have their rewards--regardless of others around them. Many people disagree with that; others don't disagree. 

Personally, I wear a mask for the sake of children, immune compromised folks, and people who can't get vaccinated for various reasons (even the folks like someone I know who's husband won't let her be vaccinated). And to lessen the spread and chances of breakthrough cases.

[],,GreunLight,,,[],,,,text,t2_bz91eiwq,False,True,,"&gt; immunity from infection exists 

Indeed it does. Vaccination is recommended, regardless. 

&gt; Vaccinated is better, stronger, and longer-lasting than “natural.” And vaccinated is what’s recommended for everyone.

&gt; Some people who get COVID-19 receive no protection from reinfection – their natural immunity is nonexistent. A recent study found that 36% of COVID-19 cases didn't result in development of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The people had different levels of illness – most had moderate disease, but some were asymptomatic and some experienced severe COVID-19.

…

&gt; Natural immunity can decay within about 90 days. Immunity from COVID-19 vaccines has been shown to last longer. Both Pfizer and Moderna reported strong vaccine protection for at least six months.

&gt; Studies are ongoing to evaluate the full duration of protective immunity, including the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.

&gt; Real-world studies also indicate natural immunity's short life. For example, 65% of people with a lower baseline antibody from infection to begin with completely lost their COVID-19 antibodies by 60 days.

…

&gt; What about that Israeli study suggesting natural immunity is stronger? Infectious diseases expert James Lawler, MD, MPH, FIDSA, carefully evaluates the study design of the retrospective Maccabi Health System study in his Aug. 31 briefing. In the briefing, he identifies two concerning sources of error that were not corrected for: survivorship bias and selection bias.

…

&gt; Furthermore, there is no country on the globe in which natural infection and natural immunity has brought the pandemic under control. In countries like Iran or Brazil very high levels of natural infection have not prevented recurrent waves of infection.

North Carolina has had over 1.4 million cases of covid, and 10,812 of them have been reinfections. If someone told you under 1% of cases during the pandemic had come in vaccinated people, that would shouted from the rooftops as proof of how brilliantly effective vaccines are. But under 1% of cases being reinfections is evidence against natural immunity. Or, if you're team no-vax, it would be the opposite. This study will be pointed to as proof of how great natural immunity does but one story of a vaccinated person dying is proof to them that vaccines don't work.

When we're finding that sterilizing immunity from the vaccines wanes over the course of only 4 to 5 months, pointing to reinfection after recovery isn't the slam dunk some are acting like it is. The whole picture is that both infection and vaccination give incomplete and time limited sterilizing immunity, both in the short term look very strongly protective, and both in the medium term at least are showing strong protective effects against hospitalization and death. *This is good news.*

Only 94 out of nearly 17,000 deaths in the state have been from reinfections. We know that likewise a small percentage of deaths are coming among vaccinated people. When we are (likely) somewhere in the neighborhood of 85% of adults/80% of all people having either vaccination, infection, or both, that means we're running out of people with naive immune systems. Neither prior infection nor vaccination is looking like it's going to give long lasting defense against infection. We're not going to have herd immunity.

There is three signs requesting to wear a mask, at the door, but popup display and at the desk right before they the shopping center.

The exchange went like this:
1: Hi do you happen to have a mask
2: Im fully vaccinated and i don’t need to prove it to you
1: Out store just requires everyone to wear a mask
2: Okay to make YOU comfortable i will wear this stupid mask despite being FULLY VACCINATED you should know what that means right?

Problem: employee follows the instructions by corporate. 

Taking your frustration out on employees doesnt help you. Remember that you aren’t the first person to attack them they probably face this problem 8 hours a day 5 times a week.

They didn’t cause covid-19, they didn’t cause lock doens, they didnt cause mask mandates, they didn’t cause the delta variant. They are human beings just like you doing their jobs.

But I wouldn't take molnupiravir for mild symptoms:

&gt;Molnupiravir works by incorporating itself into the genetic material of the virus, and then causing a huge number of mutations as the virus replicates, effectively killing it. In some lab tests, the drug has also shown the ability to integrate into the genetic material of mammalian cells, causing mutations as those cells replicate.

&gt;If that were to happen in the cells of a patient being treated with molnupiravir, it could theoretically lead to cancer or birth defects.

Now, it could be that this only happens in the dish, but 

1) I'd like to be sure here

2) I am not sure I want to take a drug that basically puts mutation rates for the virus into overdrive. Worst case, it causes a viable mutation that diminishes vaccine efficacy but fails to kill that strain.

Anthem for instance, the largest of the 36 BCBS companies, has a market cap of 91.8 billion.  This is in addition to dividents that are paid out quarterly (est. 1.22%). This is just one example of the profit for the sake of profit that is pulled out of the medical machine and goes to stockholders with no direct benefit to either the patient population or the providers.

On a small side note, can we split off a comment thread on tipping culture and how it would be so much better for everyone if we just paid staff a good, honest wage and didn't make every shift a gamble?",,,,1633445050,{},hfhg2gl,False,t3_q1n88l,False,False,t1_hfgqhpd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q1n88l/a_louisiana_health_system_will_increase_insurance/hfhg2gl/,1633568721.0,16,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I saw a job and they basically combined several completely different jobs together into one and are paying less than jobs I was applying for almost two decades ago out of school.

You want graphic designer who does marketing and imports/exports logistics, scheduling, and also sales who has 10 years experience and speaks 3 languages fluently and has experience with the super niche programs only your company uses and has a masters degree and you are offering $16 an hour and you list 0 benefits but talk about free shitty coffee. And an ounce of research shows people who worked there all hated it and the owners family and personal friends all run it and just yell and scream at people all day.

And then wonder why no one is applying.


Meanwhile people applying for the decent jobs are getting ghosted like crazy.




See people seem to think unemployed = low end job workers and that's not true, especially during the pandemic. In fact most were making less on unemployment even with the $600 weekly boost than they did at their old jobs.


Those low end jobs? Those people worked the entire pandemic. Got called ""heroes"" yet rarely got hazard pay or raises.

 there's a lot of shitty retail and restaurant jobs out there but the people who previously worked those jobs found something else. A lot do gig work like uber/door dash or stuff where they grocery shop for other people. Some switched to new jobs. There's no one to replace them.

&gt; 
&gt;  The difference in risk can be calculated as a percentage. Zero percent means that vaccinated people are at as much risk as people who got the placebo. A hundred percent means that the risk was entirely eliminated by the vaccine. In the United States trial site, Johnson &amp; Johnson determined that the efficacy is 72 percent.
&gt; 
&gt; Efficacy depends on the details of a trial, such as where it took place. Johnson &amp; Johnson ran trials at three sites: in the United States, Latin America and South Africa. The overall efficacy was lower than that in the United States alone. One reason for that appears to be that the South Africa trial took place after a new variant had swept across that country. Called B.1.351, the variant has mutations that enable it to evade some of the antibodies produced by vaccination. The variant didn’t make the vaccine useless, however. Far from it: In South Africa, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s efficacy was 64 percent.
&gt; 
&gt; Efficacy can also change when scientists look at different outcomes. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine had an 85 percent efficacy rate against severe cases of Covid-19, for example.

Admittedly COVID infection rates may be a touch misleading because of widespread testing: subclinical infections may be common in vaccinated individuals for some diseases but since they are not tested for as aggressively as COVID, they are likely to not be found. PCR tests are notorious for detecting subclinical infections that may not be contagious or have any meaningful health impact which is why some are looking at antigen tests for vaccinated individuals to actually be a more realistic test of whether someone is likely to be contagious. 

Infection prevention is a secondary goal of every vaccine (and in many cases, the primary objective), because the best way to reduce risk is to reduce exposure risk. At least looking at a nationwide level, a vaccinated person was more at risk of hospitalization and about the same risk of death in the middle of September than an unvaccinated person was in in late June. When cases are 15-20X higher, 90% reduction just gets you back to that sweet, sweet time when cases were at 3-4 daily cases per 100K across the US. 

This ""at least it prevents severe disease"" crap just seems like an attempt to back into support for the FDA's boneheaded decision not to broadly recommend boosters for all. Mild COVID is still a pain in the ass for many, and fear of infection definitely impacts consumer and employer behavior (I still can't travel without pre-approval, and large events are still banned). 

Even if a third dose ultimately wanes, it will still almost certainly in the end provide superior protection over two doses with very limited risk for harm. Most vaccines require three doses, and those that require two typically aren't three weeks apart. All the FDA has sown is confusion about whether boosters are really needed, and they are killing people because of it: both vaccinated people unfortunate enough to die from COVID, as well as the unvaccinated that get caught in the crossfire of more aggravated community spread.",,,,1633439526,{},hfh454i,False,t3_q1n3ri,False,False,t1_hffyet9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q1n3ri/pfizer_vaccines_protection_wanes_over_time_and/hfh454i/,1633562064.0,47,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**LUCKILY**, the vaccines prevent the VAST majority of people from having any kind of serious outcomes, and those that do have serious breakthrough infections are almost exclusively elderly or immunocompromised. 

The vaccines do their job of allowing the majority of the population to go on about their lives with a very minimal risk profile, that is what the science says. For those that have been categorized as vulnerable, they should continue taking further precautions that account for their **unique situations** that are above and beyond the needs of the majority of vaccinated population. 

My problem is that some people are never going to be satisfied until there is *zero* risk. You're holding on to some fantasy of Covid eradication even though nearly every single scientist is saying that this is not an achievable goal with such a contagious virus that has animal reservoirs. So when rational people come on here and state that they have accepted that there will be latent minimal risk for the foreseeable future, and go on about their life with that understanding, you freak out because they're not living up to your unrealistic nonsense standard of pursuing a zero risk profile. 

AS for the science, take a look at what's being said by our scientists and politicians GLOBALLY. Heck even the Surgeon General came out a few weeks ago saying we need to realign our expectations, and that the end of the pandemic does *not* mean zero covid, or zero cases. The UK, Norway, Denmark, and others are all dropping Covid precautions and telling their populations that we're just going to have to learn to deal with ongoing minimal risk.

However, that doesn't imply that vaccine effectiveness is the same against all types of disease below that. Covid severity is a continuum. If we split that continuun into 4 categories, asymptomatic to symptomatic to hospitalized to death, as most studies do out of convenience, yeah, we get higher efficacy in each step. If we were to split it into more categories, from asymptomatic to sniffles to bed-ridden for some days to worst illness ever to hospitalization to death, we would likely see the same higher efficacy.

Unfortunately, we don't have many or even any studies with finer outcome scales, but in their absence, our best bet is that the unknown works like the known, with the vaccine working better and better against worse symptoms.

Same for long covid - IF infected, the vaccine prevented 50% of long covid defined as any symptom persisting over 28 days. It's likely to be more effective against permanent heart damage and less effective against minor symptoms, especially anxiety if that's included in the symptoms (the recent ""37% get long covid"" included any observation of anxiety at 90-180 days after a positive test as long covid, even without any other symptoms, and it's easy to see the vaccine not being very efficient against that).",,,,1633449440,{},hfhqdjk,False,t3_q1n3ri,False,False,t1_hfhkecr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q1n3ri/pfizer_vaccines_protection_wanes_over_time_and/hfhqdjk/,1633574309.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,GreunLight,,,[],,,,text,t2_bz91eiwq,False,True,,"It’s more “stable” than natural immunity. 

&gt; Some people who get COVID-19 receive no protection from reinfection – their natural immunity is nonexistent. A recent study found that 36% of COVID-19 cases didn't result in development of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The people had different levels of illness – most had moderate disease, but some were asymptomatic and some experienced severe COVID-19.

…

&gt; Natural immunity can decay within about 90 days. Immunity from COVID-19 vaccines has been shown to last longer. Both Pfizer and Moderna reported strong vaccine protection for at least six months.

&gt; Studies are ongoing to evaluate the full duration of protective immunity, including the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.

&gt; Real-world studies also indicate natural immunity's short life. For example, 65% of people with a lower baseline antibody from infection to begin with completely lost their COVID-19 antibodies by 60 days.

…

&gt; What about that Israeli study suggesting natural immunity is stronger? Infectious diseases expert James Lawler, MD, MPH, FIDSA, carefully evaluates the study design of the retrospective Maccabi Health System study in his Aug. 31 briefing. In the briefing, he identifies two concerning sources of error that were not corrected for: survivorship bias and selection bias.

…

&gt; Furthermore, there is no country on the globe in which natural infection and natural immunity has brought the pandemic under control. In countries like Iran or Brazil very high levels of natural infection have not prevented recurrent waves of infection.
