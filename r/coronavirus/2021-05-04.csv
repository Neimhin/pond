In your case, I'd encourage you to call your doctor.

I understand wanting to batch it with other medical errands. I'd anyway encourage you to not wait til June. I don't know what your motivations are, but there a number of good things that happen sooner the more people that get vaccinated sooner (less deaths, less suffering, less restrictions, etc). 

I guess overall, I really do want you to be vaccinated. For you, for me, for our neighbors, and for the world. I want that sooner rather than later. I'd definitely take later rather than never. Your hangups are totally valid. I think we should really atep back amd listen to people amd understand what is preventing them from getting it, and do our best to remove those barriers.

As I have written, AZ did shit nothing. Without Serum which got started on its own, AZ would have provided some 60 million. It will run among others, a disappointment.

https://globalcommissionforpostpandemicpolicy.org/vaccine-production-april-2021/

&gt;I think it would've gone differently had the UK had no Oxford vaccine production.

Yeah, the Oxford vaccine would have enjoyed the support of the Merck expertise, which, besides providing the Moderna plant in Switzerland and helping to set up the Biontech facility with a monthly output of 80 million per month, would have set up a satisfying production for the Jenners institute. It's their business model, you know? But hej, instead AZ is now sued by the EU and day after day another country gives up on lies from that British company.

&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson pause

&gt; Earlier this month, the Food and Drug Administration and CDC asked states to temporarily halt using the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine “out of an abundance of caution” following reports that six women had developed rare blood clots. U.S. health regulators last week lifted the pause after 10 days, saying the benefits of the shot outweighed the risk.

&gt; So did the J&amp;J pause play a role in the drop in vaccinations? Kates said it’s not enough to explain the full story of the slowdown. 

&gt; Only about 8.2 million of the 237 million total shots given in the U.S. to date have been from J&amp;J, though it was being used for an average of 425,000 reported shots per day in mid-April. 

&gt; The single-shot option, which is also easier to transport and store, has proven valuable for certain situations and communities, such as in mobile vaccination units and for homeless people who have trouble accessing a vaccination site multiple times.

&gt; “We know there are some populations who wanted the single dose or were harder to reach and having a single touchpoint is ideal, so it’s possible that some number of people did not get vaccinated because of that,” she said. “But big picture, it’s not enough to be a huge shift.”

&gt; Indeed, counting Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots alone, the downward trend still holds true. The combination of those two vaccines peaked at an average of 3 million reported daily shots on April 16 and has declined 13% since then.

&gt; The murkier question, though, is whether the J&amp;J halt hurt confidence in the safety of vaccines more broadly and made Americans less likely to get a dose of any of the three vaccine options.

&gt; The J&amp;J shot may have been more appealing to those who were hesitant to get a vaccine to begin with. Polling from the Kaiser Family Foundation in March showed that among those who said they want to wait to see how the vaccines are working before getting vaccinated themselves, a larger share would get the J&amp;J one-dose vaccine compared with either of the two-dose options.

&gt; However, Kates does not believe the J&amp;J pause was a significant factor in vaccine hesitancy. “From what I can tell, confidence has not been shaken at all,” she said.

Restrictions have become a moral question, with easing restrictions being seen as evil and more restrictions good. Seeing people’s reactions to people in this thread saying they want restrictions eased is proof of that. There’s no point to getting vaccinated if we’ll have to wear masks, attend online school, and have businesses shut down/otherwise crippled indefinitely.

The side effects, and no, I’m not talking about the fringe cases of people dying, etc. I trust it enough that I’m not worried about them. There’s just no time in my world to feel like I got hit by an electric streetcar for upwards of a week. I’m a college student, and accommodations made to people down for the count from the immediate side effects highly depend on the professor. There will be no accommodations for me.

Reduced availability from the J&amp;J freeze. I had originally intended to take the J&amp;J vaccine to minimize the effect of the previous point, but after the freeze, it became and continues to be incredibly difficult in my area to get.

Cost. This is a simple one, but there are likely to be negative financial repercussions for getting it, i.e. having to pay for it.

Lack of a positive incentive. As a college student, I didn’t receive any stimulus checks that went out earlier this and last year. There might be a reason to get it if there was an incentive to doing so in a similar manner I would actually receive, but I see no movement on that.

The effectiveness time per vaccine. I’ve heard estimates putting the time of effectiveness as low as 3-6 months, depending on the variant. Given all these other factors, the fact that I would have to take this 4x a year in perpetuity makes this sound about as futile as it gets.

Those are the big ones, and I don’t really see any of them changing any time soon, at least in my area. Open to new information/having my mind changed.

Because what he's arguing is head scratching. If the country hit herd immunity through vaccinations, it would not be long before natural immunity strangled the virus out in the areas that didn't quite reach it.

&gt;Herd level immunity, many scooters are now agreeing, will not be achievable.

That's mostly irrelevant to the discussion since we are talking about if we do hit herd immunity levels.

&gt;Easterly in the pandemic there was hope that if spread could be limited, and thus mutations/different strains, it might be possible to eliminate it with a vaccine (though even then many experts expressed doubt that it could be fully eliminated).

A large part of this, though, is due to vaccine hesitancy.  If everyone in the world was willing to get vaccinated, it could be a different story.

Out of the confirmed 6373 cumulative cases, 5277 cases have been recovered. Of the current active cases, 84% are Seychellois and 16% foreigners. 65% of active cases are unvaccinated or had one dose of vaccine. 35% of the positive cases have taken both doses. Of all vaccinated cases 81% had received both doses and have let down their guard. The total number of pupils who tested positive from Crèche 1 to S5 are 49 and 16 are from post-secondary. The Family Hospital services are working at capacity.”

&gt;Do we have the new variants in Seychelles? Dr Gédéon explained that in an ongoing pandemic we do not know how fast the virus is changing. “The cases we received recently are mostly close contacts and the majority of them are without symptom or with mild symptoms. In the world right now, no country knows what kind of variant is prevalent in the country. We will keep doing the test to know more about our cases,” explained Dr Gedeon.

This is what drives me bonkers.

I haven't gotten the vaccine for a couple of reasons:

*  I had a severe reaction to a vaccine in the past.  I got myocarditis and spent several days in the hospital.  The cardiologist I saw afterwards suggested I speak to an Allergist/Immunologist if I ever needed to get a vaccine again.  I never had a need until now.

*  All the local Allergists/Immunologists have been backed up, probably due to COVID related stuff.  I called to make an appointment in Feb/March and my appointment is in June.  And who knows if I need any tests run and how long that will take.

*  I work at a non-public facing role and I am able to do my job remotely.  I'm also in a lower risk group.  I basically have all my grocery and other needs physically delivered to my door step so I hardly ever go out in public, and when I do I wear my mask and try and social distance.

Based on my previous reactions to a vaccine, the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines being technology that never has been widely released, COVID risk profile and being able to stay home, I held off.

I've been fully vaccinated in past to be completely safe.  The vaccine that did me in was TDAP.  I worked in India for a month and did a term in the UK when I was in college.  I got all the vaccines I needed, even the ones that were not required/only recommended.

Hanoi Chairman Chu Ngoc Anh said Wednesday afternoon that the city has locked down the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Dong Anh District to curb the spread of the disease and protect its medical workers.

The decision was taken a day after a male doctor at the hospital tested positive for the coronavirus during an overseas trip. His close contacts are being traced in Dong Anh, Ba Dinh, Dong Da, Tay Ho and Hoang Mai districts. His residence in Ba Dinh’s Ngoc Khanh Ward has been locked down as well.

The lockdown means that the hospital has stopped receiving patients starting Wednesday. All employees of the hospital are being tested. So far, 14 of more than 800 samples have tested positive, though more tests have to be done before the result is confirmed.

Deputy health minister Do Xuan Tuyen said the lockdown is expected to last until May 19.

The National Hospital for Tropical Diseases has been responsible for handling all Covid-19 cases in the north ever since the nation’s first outbreak early last year. Nearly 1,000 patients have been treated in the hospital since.

[],,BusyBusyBizzy,,,[],,,,text,t2_a3mtomme,False,True,[],"&gt;Longstanding health disparities affecting ethnic minorities in the UK have been made acutely visible by the COVID-19 pandemic. The disproportionate effects of COVID-19 among minority ethnic groups were present from the beginning, with Black and Asian patients in the UK being over-represented among those with COVID-19 receiving advanced respiratory support.[1](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#bib1) Analysis of data from Public Health England later highlighted that deaths from COVID-19 among people from minority ethnic groups were two to four times greater than those among the White population in England.[2](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#bib2) Several reasons for these differences were considered, including a higher prevalence of comorbidities associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes (eg, type 2 diabetes among British South Asians), greater social deprivation, large multigenerational households, differences in occupational risk, and delayed access to health care, which all disproportionally affect minority ethnic groups.[3](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#), [4](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#) Despite these concerns, public health recommendations specifically targeted for ethnic minority groups at the time were limited.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *The Lancet*, Rohini Mathur and colleagues[5](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#bib5) clarify some of these issues through a cohort study using the OpenSAFELY platform, by analysing primary care electronic health records linked to COVID-19 PCR testing, hospitalisation, and death records from 17 288 532 adults in England (around 30% of the population). The authors studied up to 16 disaggregated minority ethnic groups covering two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and comprehensively examined the spectrum of COVID-19 outcomes, from SARS-CoV-2 testing through to hospitalisation and death, to identify where the disproportionate effects on ethnic minorities lie.  
&gt;  
&gt;During wave 1 of the pandemic, Mathur and colleagues report, minority ethnic groups in England were younger and over-represented in deprived areas and large households, and were more likely to have diabetes. After adjustment for other risk factors, South Asian, Black, and mixed ethnic groups were all more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than were White people in England, and had higher rates of hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death due to COVID-19. In contrast to other minority ethnic groups, South Asians in England had the largest household size, with only 20·4% having a household size of less than three, and had around double the risk of testing positive—the highest among the minority ethnic groups. Importantly, when household size was adjusted for, the risk of death from COVID-19 in South Asians was attenuated (hazard ratio \[HR\] 1·26 \[95% CI 1·15–1·37\]) compared with estimates adjusted only for age, sex, deprivation, comorbidities, and clinical factors. This finding suggests that the risk of COVID-19-related death, and potentially other COVID-19 outcomes, is, in part, mediated through an increased risk of household transmission that disproportionately affects South Asians.  
&gt;  
&gt;The risks of COVID-19 hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death were greater for Black and mixed ethnicity groups relative to the White group during wave 1, with adjusted HRs for death of 1·51 (1·33–1·71) in the Black group and 1·41 (1·11–1·81) in the mixed ethnicity group. However, during wave 2, these groups were no longer at increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the White population, and their subsequent risks of poor COVID-19 outcomes were also attenuated, with HRs for death of 0·92 (0·73–1·16) in the Black group and 1·24 (0·85–1·83) in the mixed ethnicity group. Although the reduced risk among Black and mixed ethnic groups during wave 2 was positive, it is concerning that the opposite was observed for South Asians, in whom the risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes was exacerbated (1·87 \[1·68–2·07\] for COVID-19-related death). Reasons for these differences are complex, but policy measures introduced between the pandemic waves—such as access to COVID-19 testing, education, and tackling occupational risk—are likely to have been important. Despite the wealth of data and what we believe to be generalisable study results across England, limitations of this study include the lack of some explanatory factors that are not routinely well captured in existing data sources, such as occupation. Further work is required to understand why these differences have occurred, and in other settings.  
&gt;  
&gt;The pressing challenge is now ensuring that COVID-19 vaccination programmes are rolled out effectively in all minority ethnic groups. Key to this will be ensuring that the need for increased vaccine confidence is urgently addressed. There are reports of increased hesitancy among minority ethnic groups, including those working in front-line health and social care roles, who are known to face an increased risk of COVID-19.[6](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#), [7](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#), [8](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#) Unless direct measures are taken to increase vaccine confidence, differential vaccine uptake could further exacerbate health inequalities faced by minority ethnic groups compared with White groups.  
&gt;  
&gt;The value of being able to analyse routinely collected health data at scale to support the rapid implementation of public health and medicine regulatory recommendations using secure data platforms has been proven during the pandemic.[9](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#), [10](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#) An ongoing issue remains the lack of adequate mandatory ethnic coding in National Health Service (NHS) medical records, compounding the difficulty in identifying the actual scale of health inequalities. A key recommendation, which is in line with those made by health experts and Public Health England, should therefore be to comprehensively mandate the collection and recording of ethnicity data routinely within NHS and social care data collection systems.[4](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#), [11](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00949-1/fulltext#) Mathur and colleagues' findings clearly demonstrate the public health importance of not only collecting such data, but also making it accessible for analysis.",,,1620215960,{},gx0lmwd,False,t3_n5e4nd,False,True,t3_n5e4nd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n5e4nd/covid19_and_disparities_affecting_ethnic/gx0lmwd/,1620254987,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

And pregnant women who catch covid are in more danger than oreviouslt thought. As are their babies.

&gt; Pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and their newborn children face higher risks of complications than was previously known, a study by British scientists showed on Friday.
&gt; 
&gt; A**n infection of the new coronavirus in such newborns is associated with a three-fold risk of severe medical complications**, according to a study conducted by scientists at the University of Oxford.

Real question though are you sure you’ve actually had the flu?     Because when you have the flu it  bothers one a great deal.   

I find a lot of people use the term cold and flu interchangeably.  

There is a significant difference.

I have found the old saying true, “if you think you have the flu you have a cold. If you think you are dying you have the flu.”

I’ve only had it about four times in my life but it has been very different than any cold I’ve ever had.

Influenza A for example is an entirely different subtype when compared to Influenza B, but all of these Covid mutations are still the same subtype of Coronavirus which is SARS Cov 2. With all of this said, every Covid 19 vaccine should be effective against a majority of these ""mutations"" since it's in the end all the same virus, but some future modifications may be needed.

Taubman the head of the company at the time recalled decades later that some people complained they felt like they were getting ripped off because the Third Pounder was more expensive. 

No data from the study was ever presented and it was never made clear how Taubman was presented the information. 

It could have been as few as a single person who was bad at math in a 20 person study who felt like they just had to come up with 'any' feedback. 

Or it was a funny story an project coordinator told him about a study participant that was exaggerated for comedic effect that now gets repeated by Taubman as a potential reason for 'why' the failure happened. 

Or it could just be a funny story that he spun that isn't really rooted in fact. 

All we know is the Third-Pounder didn't do as well, as to 'why' is a big question that could have countless legitimate market forces responsible for it. 

Many larger burgers than the quarter pounder have come to the market and not dethroned it, when you are rolling out a burger to usurp a multi-billion dollar company you have to beat them in a lot more ways than size; flavor, price, speed, cleanliness of facilities, ease of getting in and out, rolling your restaurants out in cities where they are wanted and can be competitive, making sure you are growing at a good rate and making sure competant and motivated managers are in charge, perception of the quality of the product, etc. 

Look at the success and growth of InNOut, Five Guys, Chik-Fil-A, they all offer products smaller than the quarter pounder, which have been successful and carved out market niches and persisted. 

The SIZE is not the end all of the success or failure of a burger.

They dramatically reduce the risks of getting Covid and transmitting the virus to other people. They are powerful weapons against all of the circulating variants. In short, they are the clear ticket to normality.
 
&gt;People need to know, for example, that the risk of two vaccinated people sickening one another with Covid-19 is vanishingly small. Even the CDC has acknowledged this fact. They should be made aware that vaccinated people are safe to unmask outdoors in non-close-crowd settings -- and indoors among low-risk unvaccinated people and other vaccinated people.
Vaccinated grandparents should be reassured, for example, that seeing their unvaccinated grandchildren poses very little risk to themselves and that, in general, the risks of Covid-19 in kids are small.",,,1620168147,{},gwyiwi7,True,t3_n4yhad,False,False,t1_gwyh8dr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n4yhad/holohan_to_the_vaccinated_you_can_now_get_back/gwyiwi7/,1620210039,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I know they've issues with the EU, but the EU isn't the world. In terms of the poorer parts of the world AZ is the only vaccine to be delivered at scale through COVAX with 30+ million doses already delivered, I don't think anyone else comes close.

[],,Pinewood74,,,[],,,,text,t2_b4npv,False,False,[],"&gt; but the US is split between rural and cities

In terms of spreading of a virus, not as much as you or the top level poster are saying.

Look at influenza for a second.  Even in places where you and I would say ""They don't think COVID is real, They aren't doing anything,""  influenza is gone.  Why?  Because they are still pretty closely tied to the cities.

Diseases move pretty far and wide.  Even in the midst of the biggest slow down in international travel we've seen since a World War, we're still seeing variants traveling across the world in relatively short order.  These things move around and if we truly do hit herd immunity, we will see cases slow to a crawl and outbreaks, even in rural areas will be newsworthy.

I mean, I think of my rural MIL.  Lives in a ""town"" with 8 people.  Where'd she get COVID from?  Her relative visiting from Albuquerque.  Sure, it's just an anecdote, but when you say ""there will be pockets all over the US where the pandemic continues to kill"" I think you're forgetting that these pockets still need to be seeded with cases.

One also needs to consider that R0 isn't constant between cities and rural areas.  Having a higher rate of vaccinations in cities may actually be better in strangling this thing out.  We might only need 55% vacciantions (alongside natural immunity) to hit herd immunity in Salina, UT whereas Manhattan might need 88% or 92%.


Back to the ""seeding the cases"" thing.  Many of these really rural areas, they aren't like the city that you and I live in where this thing is constantly swirling.  That's part of the reason that COVID denial kicked up.  When the country started locking down, they hadn't seen any cases.  Part of that was a lack of testing, but it was still a good long while before it found it's way into these areas and so all the while businesses are hemorrhaging cash and they don't see anyone dying.  Well then it pops in and kills 12 people in the nursing home a town over, but then they contain it and no one's getting sick for awhile until someone else from three towns over who caught it from their sister who lives in the city brings it into the local diner.

We currently are experiencing 1 case for every 6000 people per day.  A community of only 500 people?  They might not be seeing a case but once a month.  And sure, chains of asymptomatic people could be causing the spread in those communities, but more likely it's coming in from outside the community.

If we hit in that 80%+ range for vaccines, we'd really start to see that 1 in X number rise.

I'm seeing announcements here and there that some sports teams in the United States are going to establish sections in their stadiums/arenas dedicated to vaccinated individuals, presumably leaving other sections for either only unvaccinated individuals, or whoever wants to sit there regardless.

Here's my question: the notion of herd immunity, and how individuals with immunity are the key to stopping the spread of a disease with a high transmission R value, suggests to me that what we ought to be doing to prevent spread in these situations is either not allow unvaccinated people in at all, or (more realistically) set up seating guidelines that distribute the seats for the unvaccinated among the seats for the vaccinated.

I mean, if the idea is to open up the stadium seating once we feel confident that spread of the disease can be minimized, doesn't it also follow that you should use the vaccinated attendees as a buffer between the unvaccinated attendees?

Of course, in outdoor stadiums/arenas, there's going to be little COVID-19 transmission to begin with.  And even in indoor settings, the volume of air in a facility is so large that it'll take a while for COVID-19 aerosols to accumulate anyway.

Many people are hesitant or scared to test. They only do it when they are sick enough to need hospitalization. 
So many of the patients are dead on the day of admission. 
Test results takes longer time to arrive in case of surge in cases in a perticular region. Some test results arrive after a person has been declared dead. 
I say this because many in family are doctors and often have complained to familes of patients for delaying testing and admission. My region doesn't even have hospitaI shortages , yet people are terrified  and are constantly hounded by doomsday 24 /7 news channels. 
So have the administration been urging people to get tested if they are showing symptoms. But people want to deny the illness or wait it out. 
This also roots because in general there is shortage of hospitals in many cities I guess.

[],,cowboyjosh2010,,,[],,,,text,t2_578c3,False,False,[],"That's a good extension of the conversation.  I'm definitely not against (or even hesitant) about vaccines in general, and with our kid we haven't been resistant to the vaccine schedule recommended for her by her pediatrician at all.  ""Better living through chemistry!""  ""Give my immune system all the super powers you want to give it, pal.""

But yeah I think you could say that I want to be convinced that the COVID-19 vaccines do not have effects that are unique to children that may not have shown up in adults.  **I do not doubt** that the trials will show the vaccine is safe in children, but I am also not taking it for granted that it will go well.  Let's act like I'm from Missouri, and ""show me"".

That's how I approached the vaccine for adults, and the data I have seen about the trials in adults easily convinced me that it was worth getting.  The trial data showed little-to-no adverse reactions, and even then: the bulk of the adverse reactions were chalked up to allergies to the ingredients.  Non-allergy related adverse reactions were triflingly rare, and the short lived side effects most people got were well within my bounds of acceptability for myself.  Add on to that the fact that they are *remarkably* effective at preventing COVID-19 cases at all--not to mention severe cases--and it's a pretty easy choice to get it.  Especially for somebody like me, who cannot telework and tends to run all the errands for my household: if I have to be out in public, I want to be immunized.  The trials showed that there weren't really any downsides to getting it, so get me that immunity!

But there's something about me I didn't mention before, and it is very relevant to how I'm not immediately gun-ho about giving the vaccine to my child right now:  I'm almost never an early adopter or snap decision maker.  New flagship smart phone model comes out?  I'll give it a little while before I buy it--let them work out the kinks first while the price drops.  I'm in the market for a new car?  I'll get one that hasn't been redesigned for a few years so I avoid the first year issues that so many new and redesigned cars have.  I researched the process of buying and assembling components to build my own computer for a YEAR before I finally did it.  I spent an entire winter reading up on how to successfully start a garden before I put shovel to sod and got started.

I think that tendency of mine to wait before I get in line for something is playing into effect here with the COVID-19 vaccine.  In my state, I was not immediately eligible to get it.  The eligibility boundaries weren't expanded to a point where I was included until we were a few months along with the vaccination effort.  By the time I got it, over 5 million doses had been given out in my state *alone*, let alone nationally or worldwide.  I figured by then that if there weren't reports of unexpected outcomes coming up, they wouldn't hit me, either.

And so it follows that it'll take a few months of seeing how it goes for the general public outside of the trials before I'll feel comfortable having my child get the vaccine when her age group becomes eligible for it.  She's not even a year and a half old yet--let alone 2 years old.  So I am extra cautious about how her immune system at that young age may behave differently with this vaccine than the immune system of an older child, let alone an adult, may behave with it.  I am SURE that the trial data will alleviate my concerns.  But I'm not an automatic ""yes"" to her getting the vaccine until I see that data and give the rest of the public a chance to prove that data, first.  It's a bit selfish to not want to be the tip of the spear, sure, but a little more patience for that peace of mind is worth it to me.",,,1620231321,{},gx1icuj,False,t3_n59r6h,False,True,t1_gx1f8pd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n59r6h/daily_discussion_thread_may_05_2021/gx1icuj/,1620274030,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,True

Dude above is trying to say ""okay vulnerable only get the vaccine"" because he's terrified of vaccines and is a flat earther.

Here's what the moron committee doesn't understand.

The point of herd immunity is to make the virus EXTINCT. It has a 2 week lifespan pretty much whereby it must find an UNVAXXED DINGUS to jump to in order to survive. Sure, a vaxxed person can get it, but it's like &lt;5% and a shorter duration. 5% by 5% = 0.25% spreading between two random vaxxed people of the unvaxed spread rate.

Goal: make virus EXTINCT. This requires somewhere between 60-90% vaccination, they don't know exactly the figure.

Alternative? Virus continues spreading --- indefinitely --- among the UNVAXXED DINGUSES.

A year down the road --- where this thing is still killing people, by the way ... maybe some mutation emerges that the vaccines don't work again -- at all.

When the fda reviewed for emergency use they reviewed the safety and efficacy info and if they are curious about what that entails there’s info here -https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines

You can assure them that mRNA technology is not gene editing/ DNA editing technology - it just delivers the recipe for the antibodies and then is cleared by our system - there’s info here and a helpful quote https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html

“Facts about COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines
They cannot give someone COVID-19.

mRNA vaccines do not use the live virus that causes COVID-19.
They do not affect or interact with our DNA in any way.

mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA (genetic material) is kept.
The cell breaks down and gets rid of the mRNA soon after it is finished using the instructions.”

Finally you can advise them there are serious long term effects being reported in covid patients even with no symptoms, that COVID itself is seeming more vascular in nature and in addition to all the normal things we’ve heard, can cause blood clots, strokes, aneurysms and brain damage. 

That in the balance of the risks known to covid vs the risks known of the vaccines it’s like being asked if you want to take your chances being hit by a car or getting punched in the arm.

Finally we can say how vaccination is a community effort that helps protects individuals as well as others in society who may not be able to get the vaccine (young children immuno compromised) and that asking the public to do things for the greater safety is like the entire governing idea of road safety.",,,1620239488,{},gx222eo,False,t3_n4uoij,False,True,t1_gx14ch4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n4uoij/biden_sets_new_goal_for_at_least_70_of_adults_to/gx222eo/,1620284760,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The CDC indicates the data is by ""Date Administered"", but it actually appears to be by ""Date Reported"".
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC demographic data, so the tables do not match national totals.
* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group. The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, assuming that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17.",,,1620239419,{},gx21wnd,False,t3_n5mq15,False,False,t3_n5mq15,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n5mq15/us_administers_2496_mln_doses_of_covid19_vaccines/gx21wnd/,1620284672,34,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

But it certainly appears that the elderly population is getting vaccinated at high rates across the country (because they make up a tiny percentage of the unvaccinated), and there's a lot of room for improving vaccination rates by focusing on the 18-29 age group and by expanding vaccine approval to younger ages. 

I think it's way too much for a table in a reddit comment but I'd be interested to know whether these age-based patterns look similar in low-vaccine-rate states (e.g., southeast United States) versus high-vaccine-rate states (e.g., the Northeast). If the 18-29 year old group makes up a high proportion of unvaxxed in most states, it suggests that it may be not be political persuasion that is the barrier, but rather something that may be surmountable - e.g., need to make it easier or more convenient to get vaxxed or incentivize it for a group that perceives themselves at very low risk for the disease.",,,1620245509,{},gx2gdd4,False,t3_n5mq15,False,False,t1_gx22csv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n5mq15/us_administers_2496_mln_doses_of_covid19_vaccines/gx2gdd4/,1620292417,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You are just misunderstanding the difference between the word supply and the term supply in a market sense.

There are a shortage of houses on the market, yes.  There is not a shortage of houses that exist.  It's not the same thing.

It was just unrealistic and frankly way too extreme and controlling (well, I guess more restrictive than controlling, since there was no attempt or goal for enforcement that I know).  And creepy in a way - women are now to live their lives according to what's healthiest for children they could potentially/theoretically conceive, but have no intention of doing conceiving.  And while I am completely in favor of birth control being available, the most common methods for women do involve hormones that have potential side effects.

But I do think that its a sign of how its been here for the past year: folks are taking it very seriously, being considerate of others and mindful of scientific recommendations, and following rules and guidelines. I think most of it is thanks to strong government leadership and acting quickly and decisively. We were the first to shut down schools in the country and the first to have an official lockdown, and now we're the last to open back up. We opened up partially for a bit and then shut down harder when cases got worse. Leadership payed close attention to the science and the numbers and acted accordingly, seperate from California as a whole in some cases. I think it ties back to the AIDS epidemic - San Francisco was a leader in addressing that epidemic and put a lot of things in place to let it act decisively during a pandemic, and some people here remember how bad it was.

There's a simple solution to the free riding issue when it comes to government funded research, and that's for government to enforce its own IP and sell it off through public auctions. There isn't a strong precedent for that, but it's entirely possible.

Incidentally, the situation is much the same for the internet, but for some reason it's the pharmaceutical companies that are bad people for free riding off of government research, while the tech companies that have been free riding off of government research for just as long are somehow just fine doing the exact same thing.

&gt; This is a global health crisis and worrying about the future profitability of highly profitable companies before worrying about expanding manufacturing capabilities is having the wrong priorities.

Expanding manufacturing and protecting IP are the same thing. You aren't going to get a lot of people excited about building another factory to pump out cheap generics with razor-thin profit margins.

&gt; Slippery slope arguments are stupid . . . There is no reason to believe this type of waiver will be used for other issues given this is a once in a generation global pandemic.

I've been around long enough to know that the slippery slope absolutely is a thing, and ""once in a generation"" is never once in a generation, and any argument based on it is a lie.

This is probably the #1 factor in some parents choosing not to vaccinate their kids. They need to see a higher risk. 

You also have articles that say that kids did not drive household spread. Like it or not, these two pieces of information are going to be hurdles to getting kids vaccinated.

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/12/kids-likely-not-driving-household-covid-19-outbreaks

&gt;A study in Clinical Infectious Diseases yesterday shows that children are unlikely to be the source of COVID-19 household outbreaks and are less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 by another household member, with implications for vaccine distribution.

He vaccinates for the flu, but not COVID. So the guy's behavior is kind of in line with the conclusion of this study.

No doubt vaccinations help the numbers, I’m obviously not disputing that at all. The government just seems unresponsive to the great decreases we’ve been seeing in case and death numbers. 20 people in a family owned restaurant is unsustainable, and given that nothing changed from 0% vaccination rate to 55%, and there are essentially no plans to make meaningful changes on the next leg of the national and statewide journey, I don’t see that changing, regardless of the numbers.

Yeah, from what I’ve seen, the reactions tend to be pretty personal. I know people my age who’ve been essentially unaffected, I also know people who’ve gotten fevers above 104°. I’ve had reactions in the past, so I’m inclined to say I’d be toward the latter end of that spectrum. The 6 days number I got was from 2 doses and up to 3 days each, not 6 for both though.

That’s good news.

They can’t directly charge me, they can’t send me a bill in the mail. But what they can do (and probably will do, given the state of things) is pass those costs onto me and my family in other ways which don’t directly violate the law. My parents are very opposed to me getting the vaccine at this point. I’m not taking that into account in making the decision, but they would be rather angry if their rates went up because I got the vaccine.

I agree, though it’d be nice to see *something*, even down to something like personal covid restrictions depending on vaccination status. Admittedly, that would be nearly impossible to enforce.

Of course we can only say for certain what we’ve observed, but what has been observed is a noticeable wane in effectiveness over time.

It appears like the prevailing TX culture would rather sustain COVID damage than to be strangled with restriction. Is this broad-stroke assessment correct, do you think? And for someone who listened to Dr. Osterholm during the pandemic, how was it to be in Texas? 

[Texas' COVID metrics were quite average relative to other states.](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/cumulative-covid-19-cases-and-deaths) California's more restrictive but seemed to measure a little better. 

You know, looking back, I really wonder if I really needed to be depressed/anxious about COVID, even if there were reasons for it. My state, Virginia, was very middle-of-the-road in terms of restriction. Feeling crappy about the COVID didn't do anything to help the situation. It just made it worse. 

[This article from The New Yorker](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/03/how-the-west-lost-covid-19.html) gave a decently comprehensive story of how the pandemic went/is going globally. I spent a lot of last year bitter about how differently it could have played out in the US because I knew very clearly how differently life was in the very few places that handled it well, e.g. Taiwan and Vietnam. I am less aware of how peachy it was in New Zealand. Add to that list Finland, Norway and Australia.

But after reading the New Yorker article, it just seemed like the vast majority of the world was doomed between sustaining damage while staying open (U.S.) or suffering through multiple, extended lockdowns (UK, Germany), and a myriad of combinations in that spectrum (e.g. vulnerable, developing countries that are like sitting ducks). Of course, things can always be improved. It's pretty obvious what went wrong in the US. But there's some solace in knowing most everyone failed badly in many ways. The successful outliers seemed to hit the jackpot on geography, effective governance, and compliance from the populace. Exceedingly (!!) few got the eradicate-the-pandemic secret sauce right.

And if it's an annual booster situation, then you can bet your ass I'm waiting a full year from the time i tested positive before i even bother starting a *lifetime* of vaccination boosters.

I. The vaccine enthusiastic. These people tend to either be Northeastern secular educated and affluent European Americans, or Asian Americans from all social classes. You can find many people in this category shopping at Whole Foods, eating healthy balanced meals, reading about scientific advancements in the news, etc.

II. The vaccine moderates, who are not strongly for or against personal vaccination. These people tend to be working class African Americans and Hispanics. Many people in this group would like to eat healthier meals, or get their kids into higher education, but just don't have the money or social networks to do so. Some Group 2 people are willing to be vaccinated, but do not want to go out of their way to do it. They might be unable to take 1-2 days off from work to go an appointment and recover from the side effects. Some of them are moderately unwilling to be vaccinated, but can be persuaded through grassroots outreach.

That said, politicization of the virus, and the vaccine, it seems to me, has actually resulted in some areas being more or less prone to vaccinate (thus making cities work more like oc claimed). I expect there will be some interesting studies in the years to come that result from the disparity in vaccination rates that does exist.

Herd level immunity, many scooters are now agreeing, will not be achievable. Covid is likely here to stay, just like the corona-viruses (e.g. Colds) we deal with on an annual basis.  Easterly in the pandemic there was hope that if spread could be limited, and thus mutations/different strains, it might be possible to eliminate it with a vaccine (though even then many experts expressed doubt that it could be fully eliminated).

What I have noticed is that most Americans tend to fall into three socio-cultural groups when it comes to vaccination

I. The vaccine enthusiastic. These people tend to either be Northeastern secular educated and affluent European Americans, or Asian Americans from all social classes. You can find many people in this category shopping at Whole Foods, eating healthy balanced meals, reading about scientific advancements in the news, etc. 

II. The vaccine moderates, who are not strongly for or against personal vaccination. These people tend to be working class African Americans and Hispanics. Many people in this group would like to eat healthier meals, or get their kids into higher education, but just don't have the money or social networks to do so. Some Group 2 people are willing to be vaccinated, but do not want to go out of their way to do it. They might be unable to take 1-2 days off from work to go an appointment and recover from the side effects.

The fact of the matter is that the coronavirus has been known for decades not to mutate significantly, and not at the same speed as something like influenza. The fact that only 3-5 variants of interest or concern have been identified despite hundreds of millions of unique infections really speaks volumes.

I think we also need to separate B1617 from the current awful situation they're living in India. In many ways what they're experiencing is not that different from the UK last summer when B117 first came to be.

People don't seem to understand that the vaccine works by establishing herd immunity such that there's only a small chance that ANYONE will be exposed to the virus, vaccinated or not. They want to make this an ""every person for themselves"" kind of thing, and they just can't, because our fates are intertwined. The vaccine will greatly reduce odds of illness in any *individual* who gets the vaccine, but the only way to actually end the pandemic is to get *enough people vaccinated overall*.

The only point I would disagree with is that we need to bring cases down to 0. In theory there can be isolated pockets of infection in parts of the country while the vast majority of us enjoy the protection of herd immunity--like how there are still occasional outbreaks of measles and whooping cough in anti-vax communities, but since the vast majority of the nation is immune, it's not a concern on a national scale (yet).",,,1620222948,{},gx0yo4n,False,t3_n5d6vt,False,False,t1_gx0ww7y,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n5d6vt/us_parents_excited_over_prospect_of_virus_shots/gx0yo4n/,1620262605,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

To contrast that with covid, there are around 30m cases and 600k deaths thus far (again, that’s a really hard number to accurately account for.) Maybe a better way to discuss the numbers is just how the hospital “feels.” Every year hospitals plan for a surge in respiratory illnesses in the winter months. Some pediatric places have whole floors that are only open in the winter. 2017 was a bad year for the flu and hospitals “felt” really strained. Covid was different for two reasons. Er volumes dropped to record lows. Everyone was terrified of getting it so no one came to the er for bullshit (30% of everything in the er is bullshit). This, coupled with mandatory stopping of elective procedure, put very quick and dramatic financial strain on hospitals. Hospitals are businesses and reacted by trying to cut staff and save money. Meanwhile, covid decimated the elderly population. Early in (March/April) the only people I saw in the er were old, from a nursing home, or very chronically ill. They all died slow deaths and took up space in the hospital. The general course of covid was different than say flu or some other pneumonia. In those cases people die quickly or they get better in a few days. Covid-19 pts would linger in for a month before finally dying. So, the decrease in revenue/staff and the prolonged course of covid led to shifting of nursing staff (they would travel to find new work) and thus hospitals had no rooms. When you hear about hospitals being at capacity, it really doesn’t mean they don’t have any physical space, it’s that they don’t have nurses to staff the patients. 
So flu seasons are sorta planned for and feel busy, but are manageable. Less people die and when they do it’s generally quicker so the hospitals have more beds.

&gt; *“Congratulations........
The majority of you have all been ‘New World Ordered’.
Within the past few weeks you have lost every liberty, every freedom, every right you thought you had. Over a ‘cold’.
This is just a test run.
The bankers, the UN and big Pharma companies who run the world, are sitting back laughing their heads off.
I bet that within 4-6 weeks, the entire thing will be over.....like all the other viruses. It’s just about done in China.
You’ll all say what a “great job” the government did.
They had a little warm up over the past few years, with Mad cow, Ebola, swine flu, etc. No big deal really. Just reconnaissance runs. No one had anything removed.
This time......you lost EVERYTHING.""*

Although it's a pretty funny story. For our first shot, we both felt barely anything. For our second however, we had very different experiences. I am so happy she chose table 2 instead of table 3 where I was.

Her national guard guy was friendly, he was asking her all about our life. We're renovating our attic, so he asked about that. Then the nurse handed her the vaccine card and she was like ""oh, I'm done?""

My situation was completely different. My national guard guy pointed to the questions on a sheet of paper, he didn't even say ""would you answer yes to any of these?"" Nope, just a point. Then when I had a question about one of them he very loudly sighed. Then he asked for my vaccine card. I gave it to him and he looked my dead in the eye and said (this is a direct quote, which was so rediculous that I wrote it down so I wouldn't forget) ""Really? Are you sure you're supposed to be getting your second dose?"" I was so confused. When he handed the card to the nurse, he even was like ""it says the second dose, but I dont know."" Like seriously?? Why would I lie about getting the first shot? If I was one of those people, I doubt I'd get the second shot. But then the nurse. She was having a seperate conversation with a nurse who was on break. She asked me which arm I wanted, clearly not paying attention since my right sleave was rolled up. I told her my right, then sat down, with my right arm facing her. She then turned to me and said (again direct quote) ""Sir your sleave needs to be rolled up and facing me."" Pointing to my left arm. I responded that I wanted it in my right. She sighs and goes ""fine."" Then no warning jabs my arm. That shot hurt like hell. 

100% would get it again. The county sent me a survey afterwards asking about it, and after describing the muscle aches, I made sure to put that even knowing how I would be treated, nothing was gonna stop us from getting the vaccine. I'll admit though, most of the pain was probably from me not being ready. And on top of that, it was the most momentary thing. Like, yeah it hurt, then 5 seconds later it was back to a dull ache.

But I don't know how accessible it is to entities like airlines and concert promoters and sports teams.  I see an unfortunate slippery slope in giving up so much privacy although I feel that in this case privacy is not a right.  Public safety should be the number one priority.  But it begs the question of how this precedent might be abused in the future to invade the privacy of political rivals even inventing fake acts and attributing those acts to certain individuals.  I think that there are a lot of people with oppositional defiance issues and that politics as it where allows them an outlet for said defiance.  Rather than focusing on public safety and believing that vaccines serve a great service to us they see it as their political rivals trying to control them in a power dynamic.  And they resent experts who have the public trust to advise citizens on best practices.  It makes them feel dumb and out of control.  Many have shown they are willing to lie to get control or to try to and they go all out to not allow their opposition to be truly out for the common good.  The very steps they suggest to save lives and lessen the impact become tools of oppresion and control done out of sadism and to further an agenda.  I went on a rant there I just don't know that there will be a centralized data base that is used to confirm vaccinations one that could be accessed by cleared compliance people from entities where people gather in groups.  I also think that it is hard to put anything past Republicans these days and that someone in the government could end up selling vacination verifications to people for $100 or something.  Or maybe it would be a doctor or other health professional certified to give vaccinations who fake them for a price of for religious reasons but they still want the freedoms of being vaccinated.,,,1620218593,{},gx0q1ch,False,t3_n4uoij,False,True,t1_gx0nq3d,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n4uoij/biden_sets_new_goal_for_at_least_70_of_adults_to/gx0q1ch/,1620257632,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

meningitis A/B kill only about 100 kids any given year yet we routinely recommend it and it is required in virtually all dorms/colleges.  thats besides the fact that kids can still spread it to other kids and perpetuate a cycle downstream.  ive seen many young fathers/mothers in the hospital that were not able to get the vaccine in time.    you are correct - it is very rare that young adults and more so kids have a low chance of having anything significant and the chance of hospitalization is around 1%, which is low.  the bottom line is that they still are a major vector of spread - there were 72,000 cases w/ kids in the last week.  its extremely hard to contact trace when you're in a large community spread situation - the only thing you can do is shut down local schools for a few weeks.  covid vaccination is pretty clearly effective in every single community that its been studied in so far - since the start of vaccination - in adults who have been vaccinated there's only been 76 deaths total - compare that to the hundred thousand or more that have died since january.  my local nursing home has had outbreaks but no symptoms since all the residents are vaccinated. pediatrics is probably the most boring specialty in medicine thanks to vaccinations.  you typically don't see anything rare or debilitating these days and its because of vaccines - hospitals actually recognize that having a pediatrics floor is just not very lucrative - which is a good thing for kids but a bad thing for making money.  i encourage you to read on the history of vaccinations and just medical advancements in general - you can see that despite the outcries against vaccination we've been able to save so many people not just from deaths but from permanent side effects or disabilities.  rubella doesn't kill people but causes deafness or mental retardation in 90% of kids that were born w/ it - however no one ever knows about it these days or cares why we vaccinate against it.  the more we educate ourselves the more we understand how these diseases work and how we prevent against something like this happening again - unfortunately history likes to repeat itself",,,1620226473,{},gx16lb1,False,t3_n5d6vt,False,False,t1_gx0y05u,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n5d6vt/us_parents_excited_over_prospect_of_virus_shots/gx16lb1/,1620267361,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

We're both a bit unsure about it, because while we've been fully vaccinated, vaccinations for my children (ages 5-9) won't be approved until later this year, or maybe early next.

On one hand, COVID severity in children is typically much less than adults. Not a guarantee, but few things in life are. And their teachers will be vaccinated. But it's still possible - likely, even - that there will be children attending class in person whose parents have refused to get the vaccine. And if they get sick, then what are the chances of it spreading to our kids? I mean, they probably won't get a severe case, but we'd need to quarantine, which is difficult financially, as my wife drives for Amazon as part of our income.

On the other hand, my children are sick of online schooling, and rightfully so. My eldest's online teacher is regularly unavailable during the school day and rarely responds to messages. And my middle child really struggles with online learning - she does so much better in person. And my youngest is just ready for Kindergarten, and really needs some in-person instruction to thrive.

The way we see it, we have three options: back to school in-person, online schooling, or home schooling. We're taking a wait-and-see approach, but I could use some input from you guys.

So now, the poorer countries that couldn’t afford to risk investing in a vaccine, much more multiple ones, very early in the development are way back in line that they’d only get their turn on 2023-2024, when the richer nations are done hoarding enough for their population many times over.

Basically: because they can't reap the benefits of the mask mandate being lifted *on their own*, and instead they need other people chipping in and doing their part, they aren't going to do it.  The kinds of people who probably resisted wearing a mask, at least at first, based on the grounds that ""wearing *my* mask protects *you*"", but who would have worn it in a heart beat if ""wearing *my* mask protects *me*.""  ""But what if I get the vaccine and then we never hit 70%?  I'm not going to bother, then--what's the point?""  They may be the types of people who SEVERELY discount how beneficial it would be to get immunity from the vaccine, which ties back in to what I wrote above about how they're probably feeling a bit untouchable about it all already.

You're missing a bunch of crucial things when you're looking at it this way.

Throughout the entire pandemic, the overall incidence rate of getting covid has been ~30%, the VE is 90% for all infections. It's also likely that even if you are infected you become less infectious than someone who is unvaccinated and infected due to a lower peak viral load. So it's fairly reasonable to call VE from person 1-&gt;2 something closer to 94%. The household attack rate is 16% for non-spouse members of your household.

Assuming both were somehow vaccinated the whole time, the chances of one vaccinated person getting covid and giving it to someone else in their household throughout the entire pandemic ends up being:

0.3(incidence) * 0.06(VE 1-&gt;2) * (0.16 household attack rate) "" (0.9 VE 2) = 0.00028 * 100% = 0.03% chance of household secondary transmission between two vaccinated people throughout the whole pandemic.

For a one time interaction, you would use your community's current Infection prevalence which is likely below a percent at this point, but let's say it's as high as 2.5%. We'll also just keep the same attack rate even though a brief interaction isn't the same as living with someone, just to be pessimistic:

0.025(incidence) * 0.06(VE 1-&gt;2) * (0.16 household attack rate) "" (0.9 VE 2) = 0.00028 * 100% = 0.0024% chance of transmission from a one time visit between two vaccinated people in a community with extremely high incidence.

These numbers are also going to be a bit off, but they are closer than multiplying VE is, and infinitely closer than saying it's a 10% chance somehow. 

You're reasonable to be cautious but we got so lucky with these vaccines that they essentially kill almost all risk in most situations.",,,1620230723,{},gx1gwns,False,t3_n4l67m,False,True,t1_gwz74k7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n4l67m/everybodys_vaccinated_party_hard_says_disease/gx1gwns/,1620273230,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You get vaccinated, your health insurance is DRASTICALLY cheaper than someone who gets it.  That's a good way to enforce it without actually enforcing it.

The CDC indicates the data is by ""Date Administered"", but it actually appears to be by ""Date Reported"".
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC demographic data, so the tables do not match national totals.
* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group. The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, assuming that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17.",,,1620244066,{},gx2cxfu,False,t3_n59r6h,False,False,t1_gx2425z,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n59r6h/daily_discussion_thread_may_05_2021/gx2cxfu/,1620290556,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This value is the expected amount of infections that are generated by a single case of infection from a virus in a given population, assuming that everyone is susceptible to infection or are immunity-naïve. This also considers the absence of non-pharmaceutical intervention methods. As such, this number doesn't change as an outbreak progresses, and represents an exponential growth rate.

Alternatively, the effective reproduction number (Rt) is time-variable, and this is the value that you regularly see being revised in the news. This number considers a level of immunity already present within a population, in addition to intervention methods that are responsible for reducing the transmission rate. When this value drops below 1, herd immunity has been achieved and the number of cases will gradually decrease until no infections are present within a population.

For comparison, SARS-COV-2 has an R0 value of around 2.4 to 3.4, whereas influenza is estimated at 1.2 to 1.4. Although these values appear similar, you need to remember that this value is the exponential growth rate of viral transmissibility, so SARS-COV-2 is actually considerably more infectious. Measles, mumps, and rubella have an R0 value of 12 to 18, 10 to 12, and 6 to 7, respectively. I don't know much about the norovirus, [but I found a research article that suggests that the R0 value for norovirus ranges from 1.1 to 7.2, with a value of 2 for population-based estimates, and increases depending on particular outbreaks.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5851036/)",,,1620235414,{},gx1sglc,False,t3_n59r6h,False,True,t1_gx1iosc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n59r6h/daily_discussion_thread_may_05_2021/gx1sglc/,1620279581,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In an interview to CNN, Senator Wellington Fagundes (PL-MT), author of the project that will allow the development, spoke about the production capacity of three factories that have maximum security level, adequate to the development of the immunizers.

&gt; ""These three industries have the capacity to produce every 35 days a batch of approximately 80 million vaccines. Every 35 days, the three laboratories could produce more than 200 million vaccines,"" he stressed.

&gt; According to the National Union of the Animal Health Products Industry (Sindan), the vaccine plants for veterinary use installed in Brazil, regulated by the Ministry of Agriculture, have a high level of security, three of them with maximum biosafety level (NB4).

&gt; The senator highlighted the safety of the spaces and the need to expand the production of the vaccines against Covid-19 to serve the Brazilian population in the short and long term. ""For over 20 years, we have produced vaccines from inactivated virus, and we have never had a virus escape, we have never had any problem. Today, the security of these companies is total, besides the great production capacity"", said Fagundes.

&gt; According to the senator, are already in negotiation with the Ministry of Health and the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) the guidelines to put into practice the action. ""At a meeting, the Ministry of Health guaranteed that would buy the entire vaccine produced. Anvisa is already in talks with three laboratories for this transfer of technology. We have 100% of the technology to produce the API [Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient],"" he said.

&gt; The Health Minister, Marcelo Queiroga, even said at a press conference that the measure would help to increase the capacity for vaccination and distribution of vaccines. The minister said that is under analysis with health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) the suitability of animal vaccine industries for the production of immunizers for humans.

&gt; About the project
&gt; Bill 1.343/2021, authored by Senator Wellington Fagundes (PL-MT), was presented to the Senate on April 12. It authorizes, temporarily, the production of vaccines against Covid-19 by factories for veterinary use that meet the sanitary standards and biosafety requirements of their own, such as those of laboratories that produce the immunizers used in humans. 

&gt; The bill, approved in the Senate, will still need to pass through the approval of the House to proceed to sanction by the President of the Republic, Jair Bolsonaro.",,,1620174566,{},gwywda8,True,t3_n52p32,False,False,t3_n52p32,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n52p32/brazil_200_million_vaccines_could_be_made_in/gwywda8/,1620217655,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The retail giants on Tuesday announced it will offer the Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to people via appointment or walk-in.

Texans can choose from more than 500 Walmart and Sam’s Club pharmacies in the Lone Star State, according to a news release.

Walmart Pharmacies are open seven days a week, and Sam’s Club Pharmacies are closed on Sundays. People wanting to get a shot from Sam’s Club do not have to be a member.

Those who want to make an appointment can do so at [**walmart.com/COVIDvaccine**](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.walmart.com_COVIDvaccine&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=IdVe9qYOlLvEHvfqFspkfxuOEuSulhj36o8Ug6l7Bq4&amp;r=UItga8wDJS9fussz3UGFcQ&amp;m=m92KprB3IT5FgxG4K0IZ-sNWskiY4dYc1u_pi8iFXvo&amp;s=1qphAC8VkxZB-xoz_5NovGzS-_WNekhETYEhj7axgJw&amp;e=) or [**samsclub.com/covid**](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.samsclub.com_pharmacy_immunization-3FimzType-3Dcovid&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=IdVe9qYOlLvEHvfqFspkfxuOEuSulhj36o8Ug6l7Bq4&amp;r=UItga8wDJS9fussz3UGFcQ&amp;m=m92KprB3IT5FgxG4K0IZ-sNWskiY4dYc1u_pi8iFXvo&amp;s=u1v_U3Zk6v0ceFJBgBV6ZG99qBi7Lw8KffFT6BWQmbk&amp;e=). People who schedule an appointment can complete their pre-vaccination paperwork online.

The expansion comes amid an effort to get more Americans inoculated as the demand for vaccines has waned.

“Now that supply and eligibility have expanded, it’s even more important for us to reach underserved and vulnerable populations to ensure equitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine,” Dr. Cheryl Pegus, the executive vice president of Health &amp; Wellness, said in a news release. “Widespread vaccination is the only way we will eventually end the pandemic and help our country reopen, and we don’t want anyone to get left behind as we enter this new chapter in our fight against COVID-19.”

Employees are encouraged but not required to get the vaccine. The company is providing employees with two hours of paid time to get an inoculation and allowing three days of paid leave for those experiencing side effects.",,,1620164696,{},gwyb7qa,True,t3_n4z5x6,False,False,t3_n4z5x6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n4z5x6/walmart_sams_club_accepting_walkins_for_covid19/gwyb7qa/,1620205925,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

 I think you're trying to ask ""why aren't you skeptical of Pfizer, when they've had just as many manufacturing problems as other companies?"".  You would have been a lot more effective if you just came out and said what you meant.

The answer is that they've spent the last few years preparing to specifically manufacture mRNA vaccines as part of their partnership with BioNTech that predated the pandemic, with full support from that team to put manufacturing processes into place.

Pfizer didn't just acquire IP from BioNTech - they worked closely together to design the manufacturing processes.  Which is exactly what is needed to expand production:  a simple IP waiver isn't sufficient.",,,1620185652,{},gwzip8v,False,t3_n3if3j,False,True,t1_gwzaxbp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n3if3j/gates_foundation_who_help_launch_go_give_one/gwzip8v/,1620231266,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

NJ's transmission rate plummets again to .27, down from .37 yesterday (which itself was already the lowest by far its been since the pandemic began). Its phenomenal how fast and steeply they've dropped. For some perspective, one week ago it went down to .88 and that was a big deal because it was the lowest it had been for months. Now each day since then we've been dropping and dropping. Now we're at the point where it basically takes 4 infected people to infect one other. 

As I always say, take the numbers with a slight grain of salt because other factors are in play (people are still masking, jobs/school still remote, students are locked inside studying for finals, etc) but even taking that into account, the way it has dropped so fast is a really good sign of things to come quickly. We were doing all those things for over a year but it has really only started dropping this fast now once vaccinations have opened up to everyone and people are building up immunity (I know natural immunity from infections plays a role too but still). We cant get complacent yet (the number has to stay low for a sustained period of time) and have to keep doing what has gotten us here (get vaxx'd and if you havent keep taking precautions) but if we keep this up for only a few more weeks we're in good shape for the summer.",,,1620168625,{},gwyjx9n,False,t3_n4i30t,False,False,t3_n4i30t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n4i30t/daily_discussion_thread_may_04_2021/gwyjx9n/,1620210600,17,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Again: *it doesn't matter if they were justified in feeling this way or not*.  The punchline is that they decided they were only comfortable with their PCP giving them the shot.

Sometime in the summer this changed.  Metrics that were well defined and publicly facing suddenly didn't seem to be the ONLY things they were considering when making decisions for the red/yellow/green phase reopening system.  A lot of their decision making seemed to start incorporating ""it just doesn't feel like the right time"" types of emotional/illogical concerns.  They were remaining excessively harsh on mitigation measures that didn't seem to really do a whole lot to reduce spread of COVID-19, while also being a little loose about things that DO reduce spread of it.  The ""former businessman"" governor sure seemed like he didn't care much about providing effective relief for the businesses being harmed by the orders.

I am sure that some of what seemed like conflicting or inept decisions on their part stemmed from a Republican legislature that simply refused to work with them at any point.

But after all that last summer/year, I kind of started to give up on the idea that Wolf and his administration would take a turn and suddenly start feeling like good, effective leaders again during this pandemic.

And yet, just like you: I have to agree.  They did indeed hit a home run yesterday with that announcement.  It's clear, concise, has understandable nuance to it, a simple date and an easy to understand metric.

By my tracking of vaccination progress in PA, I think we could hit 70% fully vaccinated (read: shot-in-arm, not necessarily fully built up immune systems) by mid-June.  But if we keep slipping on vaccine administration, that'll push back.  If this announcement about masks being tied to vaccination levels has the intended impact on the public, though, we could see increased vaccine participation and we might beat the mid-June timeframe.

“The effect was impressive. From 28 000 reported cases of polio in 1955, in 1956, one year after immunisation, there were only 15 000 cases.”

“1953. Perhaps because of the worst polio epidemic in history in 1952, the National Foundation’s Committee backed Salk’s work. In the 1954 trials over a million children were randomly assigned to vaccinated or non-vaccinated groups. Vaccination reduced the incidence to less than 50%; when a vaccinated child did contract polio, it was usually non-paralytic.”

There was mass outbreak in 52 and by 56, half of all kids were vaccinated, HOW IS THE ANALOGY NOT APT?!?

PTSD triggering events, when done repeatedly, like I could imagine in a hospital, have their own psychological damage that might be harder to unwind. Definitely start digging into PTSD and CPTSD  resources. 


I have my own emotional damage sustained from this time-period: wrangling covidiot family members, dealing with undiagnosed dementia in one of them, my dog having a stroke, and as people are commisersting with above-- a loss of faith in humanity which really has profoundly changed my outlook. I don't know what comes next but I will say that having had some minor PTSD from a small car accident that took a few months for the adrenaline surges, hypervigilance, sick-to-my-stomach feelings and panic to leave, I cannot imagine what it's like for you, to keep walking into work where I assume you keep having situations that trigger the anxiety and panic.

- First, this is anecdotal at best, not actually evidence of escape variants. You're grossly misrepresenting the reporting here and blowing it up to be as scary as possible. 

- Second, The vaccines are 90-94% effective at blocking asymptomatic infection, but there are a few breakthrough. As of April 29th that was about 9,500 people in the United States, or a percentage of about .009% which INCLUDES the B.1.351, B.1.1.7, and P41 variants that are circulating the US. 

- Third, Pfizer/Moderna aren't even being distributed in India. It's all AZ and Covaxin, which are completely different technologies, and are not what are being used in this country. 

You're massively overselling the anecdotal cases that you're seeing and conflating it with the crisis in India right now that is primarily due to the population NOT being vaccinated an NOT adhering to distancing protocols right now.

Many feel this is a capitalistic evil scheme and while that interpretation is not unreasonable,  your concerns of maintaining a consistent quality and control of the product so that one third party fucking up a batch doesn’t cause the entire population to distrust the whole vaccine is a valid worry. So I think there’s a nuance there and I have to mostly side with letting Pfizer keep the control. 

However it is also true that much of the development and research initially comes from tax payer funded university research first and then gets taken up by pharma.  Pharma does very little actual original research from the ground up.

You have a whole ecosystem around it. At first, you need the trained people, which takes years. Then the Marburg facility is just the ""mixing"" process. The MRNA essence is produced in Mainz and Idar-Oberstein.

The lipids are still produced in Canada, whose suppliers were found by Merck, Evonik is still in the phase to upgrade one of its facilities to produce the lipids domestically and just started production.

Biontech is the fortunate situation to have two bioreactor producers, Sartorius and Merck, just around the corner, who helped to set up the facility.

Then you need vials. One of the biggest producers, Schott, is around the corner, so that you didn't need to set it up.

Despite already existing big fill&amp;finish capacities, the federal government had to boost them and subsidise an upgrade of a plant in Dessau with 400 million € (additionally and unrelated to the Biontech subsidies). Additionally, several other companies like Dermapharm, Sanofi, Siegfried, Delpharm, Baxter had to convert their facilities, which just start to work now.

To set it up from scratch would take years. And then you have the question if you want to decentralise the manufacturing process. The Marburg facility has a monthly production target of 84 million doses.
