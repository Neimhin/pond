It is going to take a very long time to parse through the repercussions of everything.  That means biologically, emotionally, socially, economically, etc.  With so many unknowns it is helpful to change expectations to not necessarily good (positive) or bad (negative) and just try to have a wait and see attitude.  We can mitigate, we can weigh risk/benefit/cost but ultimately there's not much we can do.  So realizing this, and knowing much is out of our control, but the way we react to these things is within our control is helpful.  Science is dynamic, constantly changing.  This is going to become endemic.  We need to listen to what experts and our doctors are telling us and go from there.  The ripples of this pandemic are going to effect a lot of things for many years to come.  It's important to calm down and not lose perspective.  It's going to be like this for probably 5-10 years, but it's going to get gradually better.  I'm fully vaccinated, I wear a mask, I social distance.  My son is 13 and fully vaccinated and is in person school since last fall.  My husband is an ER physician that has come into contact with and intubated CV19 patients every day for going on 2 years.  He's never gotten sick from this, or if he has it was completely asymptomatic.  He's not been subjected to weekly tests and has only taken one test when he was sick with something else, that was negative.  I am a nurse in the PICU and NICU.  I haven't gotten sick from work around positive patients or in the community either.  It's a tough balance, but we do everything we can to minimize our risk while maintaining some perspective and we still live our lives without being hermits or catastrophizing every little thing.  Media, social or otherwise is one of the worst things people with real fear and severe anxiety from this can consume.  We live in a time that our media is polarized, click-baity, and maximized as such to generate clicks/money.  This is how the algorithms are designed.  Staying informed and educated is good, but it's important to step back and unplug.  Instead of doing this, people should talk to their personal physicians and even consider a therapist if needed.

The 30% of the country that has this problem *is* the larger social issue. Also, these people weren't created in a vacuum. What drove them to such positions?

I could go on at length in terms of my opinion, but I'll try to be brief. 

It's worth noting that probably the vast majority of that remaining 30% are also those who identify as ""conservative"" (GOP). I don't believe that is a coincidence. The GOP is undergoing a demographic crunch, and neoliberalism is decimating rural infrastructure, jobs, and services (e.g. rural hospitals closing, no grocery stores except dollar generals, etc); the GOP to stay relevant must radicalize, and since the GOP is the only party paying lip service to rural areas *the GOPs base is also being radicalized.* 

Part of this radicalization is the dismissal of science, of established norms wrt politics, dismissing anyone who challenges party dogma even if its a sensible rebuttal, shouting ""FREEDOM!"" whenever some restriction for the public good is suggested, etc, etc. When you combine this radical attitude with an already exploitative system (that most people can intuitively sense on some level), a system that plays fast and loose with human life, etc you get some people that *identify* as anti-mask, some anti-vax, some both, etc.

To close this, every system suffers *diminishing marginal returns on material/social complexity.* When you fuck people long enough eventually they don't want to trust you even when you are actually trying to help them, even when you need their cooperation, etc.",,,,1629433946,{},h9mhx81,False,t3_p7iiip,False,True,t1_h9lcncm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p7iiip/photo_of_severely_ill_covid_patients_lying_on_the/h9mhx81/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_ry0b5,False,False,False,d3f099db3aa8fc9ff8d66fd13df404604708771a,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1629433957.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,,

Urg.

I confess, I avoid shots as much as possible. They were very painful as a child and they are still painful. The injected fluid burns in addition to the piercing pain. I went 12 years without a tetanus shot and never have gotten a flu shot. *(I have no contact with the immunocompromised)*

For everyone saying that it didn't hurt, I'm glad for you! Everyone experiences pain differently similar to taste: different densities of nerves and pain receptors mean some people feel more sensation and/or perceives the sensation more painfully.

Breaking the skin with either a pierce or a slice makes me squirm. I can't watch it, I can't see it, even in an image. I *hate* all of the stock footage of injections splashed all over publications these days. Just thinking about a shot makes my knees weak. I remember crying as a tot with every trip to the clinic; it didn't matter why we went.

I went and got the J&amp;J as soon as I was eligible and it was available. Yeah, it hurt, both the pinch and the injection. But I didn't wait on it and if a booster ends up being advised and transmissions are still a problem local to me, I will go get it despite how the very idea of shots makes me feel, how I know it will hurt to some degree, and the 3 days flat from the side effects.

I get trembly-nervous before a blood draw and weak kneed after but I actually prefer a draw to an injection.

Based on reporting it seems that doses for boosters are going to be diverted from facilities that would otherwise be delivering first/second doses, so it seems like supply, not demand, will be the issue until possibly later than 2023. 

&gt; IMO variants will never stop at this point.

You could be right, although the number of variants (and therefore also the possibility of vaccine resistant variants) is expected to be less if we do not do boosters (per the news article we are commenting on).

&gt; As long as everyone who wants a vaccine can get one, that’s the bar I care most about.

As above, even before boosters, that point was predicted to be years away.

&gt; Beyond that, stockpiling based on assuming everyone will accept one is a bit silly at this point.

Is anyone recommending stockpiling?

A third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is not currently authorized for broad use in the U.S. However, under the current amended Emergency Use Authorization, a third dose was authorized on August 12 for administration to individuals at least 12 years of age who have undergone solid organ transplantation, or who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise. This authorization is based on information from an independent report evaluating safety and effectiveness of a third dose in people who received solid organ transplants.”

[],,DickieTurpin,,,,,,[],"In April 2020, using the very limited data available then, I calculated that the mortality rate in healthy under 70s was around 3 in 10000. By October the WHO revealed that a more comprehensive study had shown that on average 5 in 10000 people under 70 were dying, but this included everyone below that age. The paper gave a range as well, based on the fact that different countries have different baselines of health. Delta, while being more transmissible, doesn't seem to have altered those tiny numbers.

At the moment in the UK the virus mortality is in line with Influenza right now. The CFR is slightly higher than a bad Influenza year IF the same average number of deaths occurred each day for a year. The IFR will be lower as 1) all the cases won't have been tested and reported and 2) it's unlikely this level will remain for a whole year imo. It's entirely possibly that due to many being vaccinated, others having natural immunity and the young being largely unaffected that the UK may already be in the position of it only ever being an Influenza level illness since around March this year. 

Interestingly, Sweden has only the occasional death and has had weeks without any reported deaths. However, they didn't restrict the virus from spreading too much in the first place, because of a very mild set of guidelines in their country. This was criticised and toward the end of 2020 they increased the restrictions slightly, but that wasn't for too long and for a while now they have been back to advising a metre between groups and hand washing, as far as I saw.

Safety trumps privacy (whether I fully agree with this statement or not is something else but it's certainly the approach being taken). 

There are key factors when making a decision like this.

There are of course always privacy risks involved but these are weighted against the necessity, effectiveness, and proportionality.

**Necessity:**  must be evidence-based and there must be no other less privacy-intrusive measures available and equally effective in achieving the specified purposes.

**Effectiveness:** must be likely to be effective at achieving each of their defined purposes

**Proportionality:**  the privacy risks associated must be proportionate to each of the public health purposes they are intended to address. Data minimization needs to be applied so that the least amount of personal health information is collected, used or disclosed.

For example, under Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act, employers have a duty to protect their workers from health and safety risks. There exists a similar duty for federally regulated employers subject to the Canada Labour Code. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, an argument could eventually be made that, in the face of evidence demonstrating that the COVID-19 vaccination is an effective measure for reducing the risk of transmitting (as opposed to contracting) the virus, employers are within their rights to mandate immunization in order to protect all other employees in the workplace.",,,,1629495503,{},h9pqghq,True,t3_p89j4s,False,False,t1_h9pnws1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p89j4s/canadas_big_5_banks_will_mandate_covid19_vaccines/h9pqghq/,1629565653.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_2dbsvbqj,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

##Cases
- 150,740 new resident cases weekly's report - Total Resident Cases: 3,027,954. **A change of -1,024 over last week's (151,764).**

##Testing
- 19.8% (+0.5% than last week's 19.3%) new cases positivity rate.

##Death
- 1,486 resident death- 42,252 Total Resident Deaths. 

###Averaging the case and death numbers into 7 days
- **150,740/7= 21,534.29 new cases per day in the last 7 days**
- **1,486/7=212.29 new death per day in the last 7 days**

##Percentage for Population That Are Vaccinated 
**(18+ population is removed since Total People Vaccinated counts 12+ now and age groups go from 12-14, 15-24 so it's hard to exclude under 18 from the adult population)**
- Total Population: 21,944,577
- Everyone who's Vaccinated in the Entire State Population (includes partially and fully vaccinated): 12,691,414/21,944,577=57.83% **(+1.23%)**

*The latest figures show that 264 U.S. hospitals out of more than 6,000 in the country have the ability to perform ECMO. Because of geographic distribution, only 58.5 percent of the adult population in the United States has access to an ECMO-capable center. This number jumps above 90 percent when effective interhospital transfer is available, under ideal circumstances.*

Only a small portion of the ones listed above will have the knowledge and capacity to do it for small children.

It's certainly a remarkable treatment that can provide a chance of survival in some cases where there otherwise was none. However, it's far from certain. I've been reading several comments lately on social media by people that were sure that their loved ones would have survived covid if they had received ECMO. That may well have been the true in some of those cases, but the fatality rate for covid patients that have received ECMO is still close to 50% based on the ELSO registry.

In other words: One should definitely try to get ECMO if it is considered useful by the hospital, but you really don't want to be in that situation because that means it's extremely serious and the risk of death is very high.",,,,1629495115,{},h9ppka1,False,t3_p893m3,False,True,t1_h9p1kul,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p893m3/florida_we_probably_called_over_50_places_a_covid/h9ppka1/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_15384w,False,False,False,4a88438ac5c276070baf7522bcc2af4032f557e6,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1629495127.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,,

This regularly advocates for extrajudicial lynching of people who hurt animals (and make no mistake I have 0 sympathy for abusers). Hell, half the time they want the justice system to treat it like regular murder. 

It’s just very hard to get across to people the true ethics and morality of some of this. 

Medically, ethically, you can’t deprioritize someone’s treatment just because they chose not to get vaccinated. I understand emotionally most of us want them to get second rate treatment next to someone who is vaccinated or can’t get the vaccine. Fuck, even I think that’s ‘just deserts’. But from an ethics standpoint, that’s a giant hard no. Even explaining to people why it’s a no go will be met with people going “bUt tHeY cHoSe sO” (or “how come it’s okay for them to endanger others!!!” Which is true, but it’s shifting the discussion away from the doctors duty). People don’t think of the ramifications beyond the immediate future example. I also hate to invoke a slippery slope argument, but ethically it’s a tight rope to walk. Plus people sometimes just make bad choices. Making a mistake or having a shitty opinion isn’t grounds for a doctor to sign your death warrant. 

It sucks, doctors often wrestle with it and dislike it too. But thankfully most of them understand the ethics and their oath. Fuck the unvaccinated, but ethically you still have a duty to treat them just as anyone else. Medical care is a fundamental human right, and you can’t start segregating and not treating people just because you don’t like their choices or because they’re morons. 

As much as I on a basal/reactionary level agree with people saying unvaccinated people should deserve the fate of their own idiocy. It sucks to know that people doing everything right or that are unable to get vaccinated have to potentially suffer because a selfish entitled asshole didn’t want to get vaccinated. And that is an incredibly, *incredibly* difficult thing to turn the other cheek towards and do the right thing on. 

Of course it’s also much more complicated than I make it out to be. Medical ethics (and ethics in general) is its own entire field of study.

Less hospital resources need to be taken up that way. In India there was a mad scramble of families trying to find oxygen tanks, even empty ones, to fill and supply to ill family members. People were sitting in cars with an oxygen tank next to the door and an oxygen hose running in through the window to a person sitting in the passenger seat or the back seat because that was the only treatment available. There comes a point where deaths increase not necessarily due to the virus itself, but due to all conditions that require hospitalization yet have no beds open to offer timely and adequate treatment. It's the reason why reducing the curve was emphasized so strongly at the start of the pandemic. At this point in the southern US the curve is approaching a vertical line and so many ICUs are out of beds or at least out of the staff needed to work more ICU beds, effectively keeping some out of service. Even if all the Covid patients currently in the ICU recover fully and gain natural immunity, that doesn't help people in the meantime having heart attacks and strokes and getting injured who don't have a hospital nearby that can take them in. You can't just hit snooze on your heart attack and tell it not to happen until the hospitals have room.

Elimination does not mean that there will never be cases. For example, we say that measles has been eliminated in the US, but from time to time there is infection from abroad which results in an outbreak. But thanks to effective disease control measures those outbreaks are quickly suppressed.

The situation with COVID-19 in China and New Zealand is exactly analogous. The only cases are those due to infection brought in from abroad which escape the border controls. In China, robust quarantine measures mean that the recent outbreak originating from Nanjing airport has quickly been brought under control. Yesterday, the number of new cases of COVID-19 in the community was four (4) across the entire country; three stemming from the Nanjing outbreak, one coming over the border from Myanmar. I fully expect that number to be back down to zero within the next few days.

As for animal reservoirs, yes they do exist, but neither China nor New Zealand has recorded even a single case of transmission from animal to human. The only cases of animal-to-human transmission reported elsewhere have been from minks to humans, which is not exactly a high-risk route for many people. Breeders are now aware of this and can take appropriate precautions. 

Even the Nature article that you cited states that ""More than one-third of the respondents to Nature’s survey thought that it would be possible to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 from some regions while it continued to circulate in others. In zero-COVID regions there would be a continual risk of disease outbreaks, but they could be quenched quickly by herd immunity if most people had been vaccinated."" That is pretty much the situation we have with polio and with measles, so why don't we pursue it for COVID too?

Me thinks we will not.

&gt; Just like the flu shot every fall is probably a good idea. 

It's been a bit of meme, but it bears repeating: Covid-19 is not like the flu. And in this case, that's actually a good thing.

The flu is caused by multiple different viruses of the same family. Not different variants, actually different viruses. So that's one problem. The next one is that flu viruses mutate even more rapidly than coronaviruses. And to top that all up, the genetic data of influenzaviruses is segmented into several strands, as opposed to having a single long strand of RNA like coronaviruses. This means that if 2 different influenzaviruses infect the same cell, that cell can produce new influenzaviruses using RNA segments from both of the two invaders, mixing and matching to create new forms of the virus.

All these properties together result in the fact that vaccinating against the flu is vastly more difficult than vaccinating against anything else that we have vaccines against. It's also why the flu shot is the only commonly used vaccine that is updated seasonally.

Other vaccines, such as childhood vaccines, have a few shots (1-3 typically) and then you're done.

So why then do we still need a booster for covid-19? Because we're not sure yet what the best prime-boost interval is. The childhood vaccines I mentioned before all have considerably longer delays between shots than the covid-19 vaccines. But running a vaccine with a 6+ month delay between shots through several trial phases amidst an ongoing pandemic was not a good idea, so vaccine researchers essentially took the shortest interval that still made sense: a few weeks. But our experience with other vaccines suggest that longer intervals will provide a much more robust and long lasting protection.",,,,1629453777,{},h9n6z5w,False,t3_p7l2fr,False,True,t1_h9llba1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p7l2fr/cdc_director_says_we_might_not_need_annual_covid/h9n6z5w/,1629516498.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_a4fbm,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think ""escape"" needs to mean ""significantly overcomes the vaccine's ability to prevent serious illness and death"", and with the UK's example over the last few months I don't think Delta qualifies for that.

Boosters and therapeutics will continue to erode the effects of the virus, but we're already at a manageable state and that will only get better as we continue to vaccinate holdouts. 

Thanks about the vaccines btw.

[],,cos,,,,,,[],"&gt; In my county (in upstate NY), since the start of July, 40% of new cases have been in fully-vaccinated people. I wouldn't be at all surprised if it reaches 50% by the time boosters start in September. Making it seem like vaccinated people have zero reason to take precautions is not helpful.

You've fallen victim to narrowed vision.  You're in the US, a country in which huge numbers of people are vaccinated.  And even where you are, it's still the case that a majority of cases are in unvaccinated people, by your own admission!  But the WHO is thinking of the whole world, and there are plenty of countries where hardly anyone is vaccinated, and countries where they have no access to vaccines.

Their statement is very very true.  The overwhleming majority of covid-19 spread in the world is among unvaccinated people.  Vaccinating more people for the first time would reduce spread much more quickly than giving boosters.  If we can do the latter without slowing down the former, great, let's do both.  But if the latter actually does slow down the former, then it's a bad tradeoff.

&gt; They can't have it both ways: we're told constantly that we're only supposed to care about hospitalizations and deaths. And then we're also told that letting the virus spread freely leads to the development of more variants. But apparently spreading freely among vaccinated people just doesn't count?

Here, you're a bit confused.  You've been seeing a lot of the messaging that's trying to counter claims that ""vaccines don't work"" because vaccinated people can still spread Delta (although with lower probability).  The counter to that is that even with Delta, vaccines are still extremely effective against hospitalization and death, so for your personal protection, getting vaccinated definitely works really really well.

But if anyone told you that means it's the *only* thing that matters, they were wrong - and maybe they didn't say that explicitly and you just interpreted it that way.  It's the main thing that matters *for the individual*.  But from a public health perspective, overall levels of spread have always mattered, and I've never seen the WHO or CDC say otherwise.

As for ""apparently spreading freely among vaccinated people"", you're again confused.  What does ""freely"" mean?  Vaccination significantly slows the spread of even Delta, but not to a level where it can be fully contained by vaccination alone.  So of course it counts, but the point is this: Getting unvaccinated people vaccinated for the first time, reduces spread a lot more than giving vaccinated people boosters, from what we know so far.  Both of these things will reduce transmission, so both are valuable, but based on current knowledge, getting more people vaccinated for the first time slows the spread by a lot more, than giving boosters does.  So that's the tradeoff they're talking about.

Your comment is full of misconceptions, and I urge you to let go of your apparent disbelief and anger, and really think about it, based on the knowledge that these recommendations are coming from people who know the subject a lot better.

&gt;Still, experience with other viruses gives evolutionary biologists some clues about where SARS-CoV-2 may be headed. The courses of past outbreaks show the coronavirus could well become even more infectious than Delta is now, Read says: “I think there’s every expectation that this virus will continue to adapt to humans and will get better and better at us.” Far from making people less sick, it could also evolve to become even deadlier, as some previous viruses including the 1918 flu have. And although COVID-19 vaccines have held up well so far, history shows the virus could evolve further to elude their protective effect—although a recent study in another coronavirus suggests that could take many years, which would leave more time to adapt vaccines to the changing threat.

This is where I have to disagree, because providing care and dealing with people is no where near an ideal 8-5, 40/wk, stocking shelf 'job'. Admittedly I am biased, but take my mom for example. She's an ICU nurse. When the big wave came in, she went from taking care of 2 patients to 4. She told me how she herself and other coworkers were racking up PTO, but hospital admins were 'trying' to somehow undercut workers from taking time off, to try and manage the increasing demand of care. Pretty sure some labor laws were infringed upon here. In addition, I'd agree with you there with HCW having increased risk. Do they get hazard pay? Most actually haven't, my mom included.

Trust me, there are a lot of 'heroes' who are doing a lot more than 'what they were asked of', to unfortunately more often than their 'human' ability entailed. But hey it's ok, they were just doing their 'job', and returned with words of thanks, pizza/sandwhich parties, car parades, and celebration of being 'heroes', which btw don't pay the bills. /s

So in a way we've been through it all again but with new eyes - the first time when we had our own kids, and the second time where we got to sit back and observe and watch. I think maybe that is another reason I feel the way I do about it. Watching the pregnancy and first year or two... I mean during the pregnancy there's all the shopping and preparing for the new baby... which during a pandemic increases your risk every time you have to go to Target or where ever you shop. And then all the bathroom breaks because anyone who has been pregnant knows that especially that last trimester you learn very quickly where every restroom is. Who wants to use a public restroom during a pendmic? And especially while pregnant?

And then once baby is here, there's the endless visits... friends, family, neighbors, even coworkers.... everybody who wants to see the baby. Which is really sweet and wonderful but... Delta virus? Hmmm. And are you a jerk if you tell people to stay away? So many awkward situations come to mind as well, if you do try to keep socially distanced. And of course the doctor visits to get all the checkups and regular routine vaccinations. It is a busy time, and lots of situations that would make social distancing and making safe choices really challenging.

I just think that if people really stopped and thought about it, and took their own biological clock out of the equation, and really stopped and thought about what they were about to embark on... and the risks... and the stress.... and the work... I just think they might give it some time (for the younger ones who have some time). But again that also makes me feel like.... OK, older mom's have higher risk pregnancies, don't they? Oh gosh. I didn't mean to get all into this today! This is just how I honestly feel. If one of my kids were to come to me and ask me my thoughts about whether I think they should have another baby... I'd tell them the exact same thing. Personally I feel it's way too risky right now. For mom and baby. But people are going to do what they are going to do.

The driver’s infection is deemed to have been “highly infectious”, as he also passed on the virus to a woman who had been sitting outside at a cafe in Vaucluse.

“This indicates that the initial case was highly infectious, as transmission must have occurred through fleeting exposure, noting that the person who caught the infection at the cafe was seated outside and there was no known on-site contact with the initial case,” Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said.”

[],,urbanpencil,,,,,,[],"""The Food and Drug Administration is pushing to approve Pfizer-BioNTech’s two-dose Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, further expediting an earlier timeline for licensing the shot, according to people familiar with the agency’s planning.

Regulators were working to finish the process by Friday but were still working through a substantial amount of paperwork and negotiation with the company. The people familiar with the planning, who were not authorized to speak publicly about it, cautioned that the approval might slide beyond Monday if some components of the review need more time.

An F.D.A. spokeswoman declined to comment.

The agency had recently set an unofficial deadline for approval of around Labor Day.

The approval is expected to pave the way for a series of vaccination requirements by public and private organizations who were awaiting firmer regulatory backing before implementing mandates. Federal and state health officials are also hoping that an approved vaccine will draw interest from some Americans who have been hesitant to take one that was only authorized for emergency use, a phenomenon suggested by recent polling.

Some universities and hospitals are expected to mandate inoculation once a vaccine is fully approved. The Pentagon earlier this month said it plans to make Covid vaccinations mandatory for the country’s 1.3 million active-duty troops “no later” than the middle of next month, or sooner if the F.D.A. acts earlier.

The timing of the approval could result in an uncomfortable messaging problem for the Biden administration, which on Wednesday announced that fully vaccinated people should prepare to get booster shots eight months after they received second doses. Approving the vaccine and encouraging boosters at the same time may suggest to some that the vaccine as licensed is inadequate without an extra shot.

The F.D.A. last week updated its authorizations of Pfizer-BioNTech’s and Moderna’s vaccine to allow third doses for some immunocompromised people, a decision backed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Regulators are still reviewing Moderna’s application for full approval for its coronavirus vaccine, and a decision could come at least several weeks after the one for Pfizer-BioNTech.""",,,,1629494433,{},h9pnz04,True,t3_p8e6s6,False,False,t3_p8e6s6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p8e6s6/the_fda_is_aiming_to_give_full_approval_to/h9pnz04/,1629564262.0,189,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_42gpz0uk,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,sometimes_insightful,,,,,,[],"Bears, baboons, tigers are getting COVID vaccines at zoos across the U.S.
Here’s what you should know about the experimental COVID-19 vaccine rolling out to zoo animals—and why your pets aren’t getting it.
Kern the brown bear got his COVID-19 vaccine on July 21. Then he ate whipped cream straight from the can.
Along with their vaccines, the tigers got their favorite meat—beef tenderloin—on shish kebab skewers, and a spritz of goat milk in their mouths. The siamangs—big black-furred gibbons—each got a large marshmallow. The baboons: gummy fruit snacks and a (peeled) hard-boiled egg.
At the Oakland Zoo, in California, 48 animals—including hyenas, chimpanzees, and mountain lions—have received at least one dose of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine made exclusively for animals. Half are already fully vaccinated. 
The Oakland Zoo is among dozens of zoos, research institutions, and sanctuaries that have requested the vaccines from veterinary pharmaceutical company Zoetis. The requests came in the wake of news that great apes at the San Diego Zoo became the first zoo animals in the country to receive the vaccines; that was in February, as first reported by National Geographic. 
“The story sparked interest from so many of the other zoos, and that’s what led to our big donation plans,” says Mahesh Kumar, senior vice president of global biologics at Zoetis, which developed the vaccine. 
Those plans include fulfilling requests to send some 11,000 doses of the animal vaccine to more than 80 institutions in 27 states for free. It’s a promising development for zoo animals, which are at risk of the disease because of their proximity to humans. 
But much remains unknown. How effective will the vaccines be? Will they protect animals against the Delta variant? Will the rollout be complicated by anti-vaxxers’ loud objections? And will pets ever need to be vaccinated? The scientists and institutions at the heart of the animal vaccine rollout hope to find answers in the coming months.
Why vaccinate zoo animals?
Since early in the pandemic, zoo animals have contracted the virus. First, tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo in April 2020; later, a gorilla troop at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. In June 2021, two lions died at a zoo in India after testing positive for COVID-19.

“We have such a large spectrum of animals to care for, from little poison dart frogs to elephants,” says Alex Herman, vice president of veterinary services at the Oakland Zoo.
Although the Oakland Zoo hasn’t detected symptoms of COVID-19 in its animals, “we knew our animals were at risk,” Herman says. Her staff are all fully vaccinated, but “we don’t know how severe Delta will be” or the risk of transmission to animals, she says.
“This virus originated in animals and spread to people, and we know it can be spread back to animals,” adds Nadine Lamberski, chief conservation and wildlife health officer at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. In addition to wanting to keep more of the San Diego Zoo animals safe, “we wanted to do our best to interrupt that [transmission] cycle to prevent the virus from sticking around.”
Getting an experimental vaccine to zoos 
After a dog tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong in February 2020—the first reported case in a domesticated animal—Zoetis began developing a COVID-19 vaccine for dogs and cats. By October 2020 the pharmaceutical company had confidence it was safe and effective in both species. 
The experimental vaccine, Kumar says, works similarly to the Novavax vaccine for humans, which is currently in large-scale efficacy tests. Instead of using mRNA (like the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines), a viral vector (like the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine), or a live virus, it uses synthetic spike proteins to trigger the same antibodies the live virus would. 
The vaccines are being distributed to zoos on an experimental basis. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is not considering commercial approval of any vaccines for animals, with the exception of mink on fur farms where outbreaks have spread widely, Kumar says. 

Prior to each shipment, Zoetis must get case-by-case approval from both the USDA and the state veterinarian where the zoo is located. “There’s a lot of work,” says Kumar, who is overseeing 80 individual [zoo] agreements and 80 individual requests to the USDA and state veterinarians. So far, Zoetis has completed the process for 15 zoos and sent out about 2,000 doses. 
The company has received many requests from zoos and other facilities internationally, but the added logistics of navigating various countries’ regulations will be a challenge, Kumar says. For now, they’re focused on U.S. zoos.
Deciding which animals get the vaccine
A year and a half into the pandemic, scientists still know little about how the virus affects non-human animals. Some studies have identified species that may be at heightened risk. In many cases, the veterinary community must rely on limited data sets, learning what it can from individual clinical cases and sporadic outbreaks in a handful of species. 
Both the San Diego Zoo and Oakland Zoo requested vaccines for all of their primates and carnivorans—a group of animals that includes big cats, bears, hyenas, ferrets, and mink, among others. These animals are known to be susceptible to the virus, but aside from the deaths of the two lions in India, the majority of big cats and primates have had only minor respiratory symptoms and have made full recoveries. 
At the San Diego Zoo and the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, 266 animals have received at least one dose of the vaccine. None of the animals there or at the Oakland Zoo have shown any side effects, according to Lamberski and Herman.

Animal anti-vaxxers
After the Oakland Zoo announced plans to vaccinate some of its animals, it immediately faced backlash from anti-vaxxers on social media, by phone, and by email. Anti-vaxxer Instagram influencers with tens of thousands of followers helped amplify the attacks. 
“It was such an onslaught,” says Erin Harrison, vice president of marketing and communications at the Oakland Zoo. “Saying you’re poisoning your animals, killing your animals.” 
Many of the messages, filled with misinformation, took the fact that the vaccine is legally defined as experimental to be an indication that zoos were conducting experiments on their animals. “Half of them said we’re going to report you to PETA,” Harrison says. 
PETA, for its part, then put out a statement in support of the Oakland Zoo, noting, “These vaccines have been clinically tested and administered to animals only after deep consideration by veterinary professionals. Since growing numbers of big cats, apes, and otters in zoos are contracting SARS-CoV-2—the virus that causes COVID-19—from asymptomatic humans, the evidence clearly indicates that the benefits of vaccination in susceptible species far outweigh the dire risks of infection for unvaccinated animals.”
The Oakland and San Diego zoos plan to do antibody testing of the vaccinated animals and share the results with the zoological community to build a database that can help determine the vaccine’s efficacy in various species.
Why zoo animals are getting COVID-19 vaccines and your pet isn't
Although dogs and cats have tested positive for COVID-19 in a smattering of cases around the world, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) don’t recommend vaccinating pets, due to their relatively mild clinical signs and the lack of evidence that pets can transmit the virus to humans. 
“It remains our opinion that there is no need for owners to consider vaccinating their pets against SARS-CoV-2 at this time,” notes WSAVA in an April 29 report.

Between zoo visitors and animal caretakers, the chances of a zoo animal getting exposed to the virus is higher, Zoetis’s Kumar says. When compared to lions and tigers, “I wouldn’t say that [domestic] cats are less susceptible—just that the cat is getting exposed to people probably a lot less.” 
Any request to vaccinate a cat or dog would have to go through the same process as vaccine requests for zoo animals, with individual approval from the USDA and state veterinarian. “You can imagine if we got 100,000 requests for cats and dogs. So it’s not a practical way for us to supply it,” says Kumar. 
Vaccinations for cats and dogs would depend on the government soliciting and authorizing broad commercial use, he says. The USDA is currently only accepting applications for animal COVID-19 vaccines for mink, so unless that changes, the Zoetis vaccine will only be available for other species on an experimental, case-by-case basis. 
“The best way to prevent [COVID-19] in dogs and cats is not to let their people become infected,” says Lappin. In other words, Kumar says to pet owners, “vaccinate yourself.”

A few will still perish, a large chunk will still get brutally pummeled but will survive, and some will be able to knock Ali out with one lucky punch.  See there is a range of possibilities that can happen to you when you are vaccinated.  It is a wide range ...from death on one end....to being completely unfazed by the virus on the other end, with a much higher percentage on the side of the range that is not serious or severe.  Unvaccinated people too have a range which goes from death on one side to feeling kind of crummy....however, there is a higher percentage of people in this range that are leaning toward more severe disease, hospitalization, and death.

Are you aware that by your numbers and doing some rounding it would take 5 children in the state of Mississippi to “overload the system”, and that is assuming that they have the average amount of beds per child that you provided, which i probably doubt. 

Not to mention the risk goes up exponentially by age, so even between 1-10 and 11-20 there is a big difference. When 600 kids in the entire country cause this how many have a very serious chronic disease? how many are in the age group of 12+ in which they could have the vaccine?

That's actually not the case. The injection *is* the immune response, but it was manufactured outside your body. It's an immune response in a bottle, specific to a disease. 

MAb therapy provides the antibodies that your body would otherwise make given time (or given vaccination). It doesn't create an immune response.

People were talking about MAb therapy as a bridge to vaccination last summer, in case vaccine development took longer than it did. But it's stupid expensive, and the antibodies fade away quickly as your body isn't producing new ones

Vaccines act by introducing a part of a virus/bacteria (called an antigen) that will be recognizable to your body, and allowing your body to develop its own antibodies. In doing this, your immune system has to develop the type of immune cells that make antibodies. These cells stick around in low-ish numbers and can be ready to produce more antibodies in the future if you are ever exposed to that antigen again.

The monoclonal antibody treatment is literally antibodies collected from the blood of people who have the antibodies. Your body will not be able to replicate those antibodies, although if you are infected, it will be making its own. However, adding extra antibodies in when someone is at the beginning of an infection will allow the body to attack the virus much more quickly because the unvaccinated patient would not have had enough time to make their own.

There have been 962,193 infections in Israel. If I make a crazy assumption and say they were all unvaccinated, that would leave 1,827,807 vulnerable Israelis.

&gt;The order was instituted Thursday, after the Tri-County Board of Health — which oversees Douglas, Arapahoe and Adams counties — voted to require masks for children 11 and younger in school and child care settings, as well as for the adults they work with. Immediately after that vote, Douglas County's three commissioners signaled they would opt out of that mandate, as it's done previously.

&gt;The commissioners — and many of the 55 anti-mask mandate speakers — argued that parents in Douglas County should make their own decision for their children, rather than require masks in schools. In all, just five people spoke in favor of sticking with the mandate, commissioner Lora Thomas said. 

&gt;”My view is that my job is not to stand in your way, to shackle your children with unreasonable restrictions,"" commissioner Abe Laydon said when public comment ended. ""That is my job, to get out of your way and empower your decisions.""

But, I think we should still try to limit the spread of the virus. I work in healthcare staffing, and I cant express to you enough how much hospital systems are taxed right now, and how much we're seeing the grave effects of that. Even if you perhaps dont care if antivaxxers get sick, the fact that the virus continues to spread so fiercely is wrecking havoc on our healthcare resources in a way that impacts ""innocent"" lives.

 Healthcare workers are exhausted, sometimes irreparably so. In places where ERs are struggling with capacity issues, if you get in a car accident, or have a heart attack, there is literally nowhere for you to get care. And if you have a mild/moderate medical condition, your treatment may be placed on hold entirely.

Theres are also children and immunocompromised folks that are dependent on us all to not coat the country in corona. About 2.7% of Americans are immunocompromised, which seems like a sizable group of people to me. Yes it's true that some people have always had to take additional precautions due to medical issues - but the US seems like a covid19 cesspool at the moment, and those aren't typical conditions for a medically susceptible person to endure. 

Again, I understand it's been a long road. I'm not suggesting we completely hunker down. I'm just saying... do we have to go all Full Rona Rampage Fest 2021??

  How do you think your cells are instructed to make these viral proteins ?   


DNA from the vector gets transcribed into mRNA which then instructs your cellular machinery to make the proteins that was encoded into that sequence of mRNA

mRNA is what instructs your cells to make the  proteins  you need day in and day out.  Its part of every day biology.   
 Its also used by viruses or in this case vaccines to produce viral proteins.

(also, apparently, 'hoodies' are fairly common to viruses)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

AFAIK, last year, researchers photographed viruses with their 'hoodies' on and off, and photographed viruses that were partially and fully attached to human cells.

&amp;#x200B;

The OP article speaks to how a team of researchers, using super-computers, were able to simulate the opening and closing process of the virus's 'hoodies.' 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that one of the researchers behind the simulation is quoted in the OP article as suggesting that this information could be used to build novel therapeutics; specifically:

&amp;#x200B;

""""""Amaro believes the research team's gate discovery opens potential avenues for new therapeutics to counter SARS-CoV-2 infection. If glycan gates could be pharmacologically locked in the closed position, then the virus is effectively prevented from opening to entry and infection.""""""

('hoodie' for me is ""gate"" for them)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious as to whether anyone can speculate (or smartulate) as to how long permanently 'hoodied' viruses would float around in our system.

I'm curious as to whether anyone can speculate (or smartulate) as to whether the proteins we make after taking Pfizer have similar hoodies... my guess is probably no; and that there's no reason then to try to open non-existing hoodies in an attempt to make the vaccines more effective.

I am asking because I'm a 20 year old male and I've already received 2 doses of Moderna, but this was before that information came out and I'm worried about getting myocarditis if I get a 3rd dose. I didn't have a severe reaction to either dose, just arm pain and chills for a few days, so it would ease my mind to know that the people who got myocarditis also had other very severe side effects, and not just mild side effects and happened to get myocarditis as well. After learning about the myocarditis incidents I was worried that I could have had it and been unaware and possibly be suffering damage from it. Another alternative I am wondering about is receiving a 3rd dose from Pfizer, as I've seen information that indicates there is significantly more myocarditis cases from Moderna than Pfizer per vaccine given, making Pfizer the safer vaccine for people in my age and gender group, although my only concern about that is the safety and efficiency of mixing the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.

One aspect to look at is what interventions senior doctors choose or refuse for themselves when the time comes - as a rule, they consent to significantly less of such activities as the average person. Various attempts to prolong the last weeks of life often are very invasive and sometimes literally torturing, and it would be far more pleasant for the patient and their loved ones to spend their last days at home with their family just managing pain and such with palliative care, instead of doctors pushing your body beyond the limits to eke out a week more while cut up and tied to machines. The financial aspect is just a bonus, but a meaningful one as well - but the finances are a strong motivation for the hospital system to provide unneeded (and even harmful) extra care if relatives ask.

You're overestimating the data that companies look at. HR has no idea how productive a software engineer is, and engineering management or product aren't making the decision to come back to the office. 

I'm in management. Generally speaking, all I care about are: Are my teams meeting their OKRs? Do they have the resources they need? Is my P&amp;L growing as fast as it should? Are they working on the most important things?

None of that has any bearing on whether they're in an office or not. I mean hell, most of the teams are split around various parts of the globe anyways. Who gives a shit if one person is in an office in SF, and the other person is in an office in Berlin?

&gt; Employees should also remember that once their job shifts fully remote, if it does, they will not be likely to continue to receive the salary that they are getting, which is based on living in the Bay Area

LOL. Good luck with that. If that were the case, India would have taken over all of the software engineering jobs 2 decades ago.

""The people who refuse to help us all get through this"" are not the same group of people having to make the hard decision of whether to send their kids back to school/daycare.  The forever/indefinitely issue is a real issue facing lots of parents who took covid very seriously right from the start.

""The chance an area with some of the largest problems related to this   
issue has the largest percentage of problem-parents causing the problem.""

I don't know what you mean by ""problem-parents"", are they doing something specifically parenting-related that's causing the problem? or just that they're people causing the problem and are also parents?  because certainly in areas that have a higher percentage of people not taking covid seriously, there will also be a higher percentage of parents not taking covid seriously.

I don't think it's as high here in the US.  Mostly because our vaccination rate is lower, but partially because our vaccines are slightly better at preventing symptomatic infection (although, the evidence to claim that feels rather thin).  But really we (the US) have no clue.  We're not looking.

Possibly an even bigger factor:  Vaccination, and being a responsible adult, are tightly coupled in the US.  So, the unvaccinated are the least likely to be making changes to their day to reduce risk of exposure.

[],,Synonyms26,,,,,,[],"HCM CITY — Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính has urged the country’s pandemic hotpot HCM City to impose its toughest COVID-19 prevention measures ever beginning on Monday as “everyone is asked to stay at home”.   
  
Speaking at an online meeting on pandemic prevention late Thursday, PM Chính said the fight against the virus would focus on major roles played by ward and commune authorities.  
  
“Everyone is asked to stay at home,” said PM Chính, adding that each ward or commune will ensure that  residents are supplied with food, essential items and accommodation.  
  
The Prime Minister ordered the city to classify the pandemic situation in all 312 communes or wards according to three levels: green zone (COVID-free zone), red zone (extremely high-risk zone)  and yellow zone (high-risk zone).  
  
The goal is to maintain and expand the green zones while isolating and reducing red and yellow zones.  
  
The PM has ordered the city to strictly implement Directive 16 by fulfilling six key tasks.  
  
Firstly, the city must implement “thorough isolation between people, families, wards, and communes”. The police and army forces will be mobilised in case of a personnel shortage.  
  
Second, the army will be responsible for providing food and essential items for people so that no one lacks food.   
  
Thirdly, medical capacity will be enhanced, including more medical equipment (including oxygen supply), as well as nurses and doctors, to treat patients in communes and wards.   
  
The city must prepare emergency vehicles and emergency centres in each district to respond immediately when needed. Treatment is on three levels: commune or ward level (mild or moderate symptoms), and district level and city level (more severe and critically ill cases).  
  
The PM recommended that the city continue piloting home treatment of asymptomatic cases.   
  
Chính also ordered the Ministry of Health to research and determine whether a combination of oriental and western medicine is needed in order to minimise the number of deaths.   
  
Fourth, the city must strengthen the police force to ensure security, order and safety for the people.  
  
Fifth, the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs will work closely to provide timely support to people in need of relief. Police forces at grassroots level will provide food to the homeless.  
  
Sixth, the city will speed up testing under the guidance of the Ministry of Health with appropriate forms, including testing at home, and will detect cases in the community so the city can isolate and treat all COVID patients in a timely manner.  
  
The PM also asked the city to consider relocating certain people out of densely populated areas to reduce the number of cross-infections. This proposal is based on what northern provinces did in fighting a COVID outbreak. The city should use military sites, schools and accommodation facilities for this purpose.  
  
PM Chính has assigned Deputy Prime Minister Phạm Bình Minh to be in charge of vaccine diplomacy. Deputy Prime Minister Lê Minh Khái is in charge of logistics, finance, and allocation of national reserves, and Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam pandemic prevention and healthcare issues.  Deputy Prime Minister Lê Văn Thành is in charge of goods supply.

[],,BebertLeChat,,,,,,[],"Uncertainty over quarantine rules and teaching plans for city public school students exposed to COVID-19 cases is sowing confusion weeks before kids return to class.

In-person public school classes start on Sept. 13, but Mayor de Blasio has not spelled out what criteria officials will use to decide when students must isolate at home after exposure to a coronavirus case in class, or how schools will instruct them during quarantine.

The lack of clarity is ratcheting up stress levels for city parents worried about school disruptions. Educators are uncertain how they’ll continue teaching if rolling quarantines interrupt in-person classes.
“I’m pretty sure at least a couple kids are going to be quarantined. I think it would be better to plan for that now,” said Stacie Johnson, the parent of an elementary-schooler in Bushwick, Brooklyn. “They should not be giving us crazy, last-minute changes. Last year was a pretty stressful year.”


Some lawmakers and advocates have criticized the mayor’s decision to offer no remote option for students this school year. They argue such a system would allow students to keep learning while in temporary quarantine.

“That is really irresponsible and outrageous that it is Aug. 19 — principals who should be taking well-deserved time off are waiting for the mayor to kindly come up with a plan,” said City Council Member Mark Treyger (D-Brooklyn), who has called for the city to offer a virtual option for kids under 12 and immunocompromised students.

De Blasio has stayed steadfast in his refusal to continue full-time remote learning, citing the benefits of in-person classes for all kids and the low COVID-19 transmission last year in city schools. Building a citywide remote school would be a major undertaking of staffing and curriculum needs.

“I am absolutely convinced that with all the health and safety measures put in place, and a lot more vaccination that is going to happen between now and the opening day of school ... this [in-person school] is going to be the place that the kids need to be,” de Blasio said Thursday.



But big logistical and health questions still remain about what in-person school will look like.

Officials haven’t yet specified the criteria to determine when students need to quarantine after COVID exposure.

During much of last school year, city officials enforced a quarantine policy that most epidemiologists agreed was overly cautious, temporarily shuttering entire school buildings after two positive, unrelated cases cropped up within a week of each other. The protocol resulted in widespread back-and-forth closures.



The current rules, which were in effect for the city’s summer school, mandate 10-day quarantines for any unvaccinated students or staff sharing a classroom with someone infected. Vaccinated kids and teachers are not required to quarantine. Whole schools are closed only if there are four or more cases and officials conclude the virus was transmitted in the school.

As of Thursday, 266 individual classrooms across the nearly 800 sites offering summer school programs were closed for temporary quarantines, according to DOE data.

De Blasio suggested Tuesday that the city will continue with the standard of exempting vaccinated kids and adults from mandatory quarantine. DOE officials did not immediately respond to a question about whether the city will adopt CDC guidance allowing even unvaccinated kids sharing a room with an infected classmate to forego quarantine as long as both kids were wearing masks — a measure that would likely cut down significantly on the number of kids required to isolate at home.

Then there’s the question of how schools will continue teaching kids forced to quarantine. Several districts across the country have committed to teaching quarantined students online, while others say they’ll livestream in-person classes. Other districts plan to send kids home with paper packets, according to a recent review by Chalkbeat.

Treyger worries that schools will be saddled with extra work and produce uneven results without coordinated help or guidance from the city on how to instruct kids in quarantine.

Johnson, the Bushwick parent, said she hopes there will at least be some time during the school day her daughter can receive remote instruction from her regular teacher if she’s in quarantine.

“You’d think there would be a way to jiggle that around … that there would at least be an hour where the teacher could log on with the kids who are home,” she said.

De Blasio said Thursday that there will be more details on plans to teach kids in quarantine in the coming days.",,,,1629467624,{},h9nuhcl,True,t3_p85cx0,False,False,t3_p85cx0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p85cx0/uncertainty_over_quarantine_rules_at_nyc_schools/h9nuhcl/,1629529380.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_qrsd11c,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basically the harm caused by antivaxxers quitting would be greater than the harm they cause by continuing to work.  It's a pick your poison situation.

However I am getting frustrated at the garbled messaging of the CDC. It reminds me of the early days of the pandemic when we were advised that masks were unnecessary - and that was because they knew masks were unavailable and PPE needed to be conserved for front line workers.

However, as soon as reports of the first break through cases started appearing I immediately assumed that it was going to turn out to be worse than was initially reported. And I essentially went back to my pre-vaccination life style of being fully masked with KN95, going out only for essential stuff and essentially isolating within my pod of people who I trust in terms of being risk adverse. 

I cancelled some minor repair work two weeks ago because I thought - who the F wants to contracting COVID in order to hang my new ceiling fixture. 

And as it turns out my caution proved to be prophetic as it is increasingly evident that there are significant numbers of breakthrough cases - and even if not hospitalized or dead - some of them become very ill. 

What seems uncertain is what the booster shot will accomplish. Will increased markers mean one is safer from breakthroughs?

Masks are traditionally used in healthcare to protect the patient, often with open wounds, from droplets form the caregiver. Having a surgical mask in your pocket, or hanging from your mirror in your car, is very very far from how masks are traditionally used.

It seems completely believable that a vaxxed person might ignore or not have symptoms and then even if contagious only for a few days... that could be worse than an unvaccinated person getting sick and quarantining... A vaccinated person could still technically create something like a superspreader event with something like this delta variant if right place right time, right?

In other words, anything can happen and if we really want to both unite people against this thing AND also prevent the spread of Covid in high risk areas/gatherings, I personally think that this ""prove vaccination OR prove a negative test"" to stand next to another few 1,000 people somewhere is a little off the mark and maybe even a bad idea. 

It both segregates &amp; angers some people right out of the gate, and also goes out of the way to leave an opening for a vaccinated person with Covid who is still contagious. It is literally easy to avoid both of those fallacies.

&gt;Yes, this is better than opening up prematurely (before herd immunity) and ending up with a massive surge like the US is having now.

&gt;China is performing at the very top on the economic side precisely because they don't need to lock down massive numbers of people every time the ICUs are full like here.

I don't live in the US, but anyway, the US has been recovering economically better and faster than most other countries in the world, including New Zealand.

And also: you just told me that the US is not having lockdowns and not containing therefore has a massive surge...but then you tell me China doesn't have to lock down massive numbers of people every time the ICUs are full, unlike the US...which is *not* locking down massive numbers of people?

I would even go as far as saying that the average American living outside a few pockets (especially NYC and the Bay Areas) has been subject to fewer restrictions overall since last summer than the average Chinese. Or not significantly more at least. The first lockdown was also significantly less strict.

&gt;The cost of testing and containment is clearly less than the cost of having to shut down their economy.

The point is that with a large vaccine coverage you don't need to do either of these, as an increasing number of countries is showing. 

&gt;Tourism is additionally not heavily impacted

Unlike the state’s public universities, which cannot mandate vaccines or masks, Rice has imposed stringent requirements for being on campus. It requires student and faculty members to wear masks and has testing protocols for all visitors. And while not specifically requiring vaccines and risking running afoul of Texas law, it has told students they were expected to be vaccinated.

Still, the virus has surged in Houston, and on Thursday, Rice became the second university in the state to shift classes online, dampening hopes for a return to normal college life this fall. The university delayed the start of school by two days until Aug. 25 and said that classes would remain online through Sept. 3.

It also said that members of the Rice community had tested positive for Covid despite the high vaccination rates — 98.5 percent — among the student body.

“I’ll be blunt: the level of breakthrough cases (positive testing among vaccinated persons) is much higher than anticipated,” Bridget Gorman, the dean of undergraduates, wrote in a letter to the school’s 8,000 graduate and undergraduate students. The university didn’t specify how many breakthrough cases there were.

More than 12,000 people are hospitalized with the coronavirus in Texas, where officials have prohibited both masks and vaccine mandates, and where Gov. Greg Abbott recently tested positive.

“We’re in a hot spot right now,” said Rice’s president, David Leebron, adding that the decision to move temporarily to remote classes was made to give the university time to assess the results of its recent testing.

“Having new information of concern, as people worry about breakthrough infections, as people with children are worried around those issues, we wanted to have a little bit of time to gather data and look at it more carefully,” he said.

Rice was the second Texas university that has announced a move to remote learning. Last week, the University of Texas at San Antonio said it would begin with mostly remote classes, citing the city’s high infection rate.",,,,1629485502,{},h9p2cck,True,t3_p8bfzg,False,False,t3_p8bfzg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p8bfzg/rice_university_delays_inperson_classes_as_virus/h9p2cck/,1629552393.0,16,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_m76zflk,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, take a look at the data here:

This chart displays all the mutations by various variants and how they came to be.

It can be seen that Alpha variant started to appear and mutate more as vaccines were rolled out and Delta variant took over when vaccines were freely available to everyone. It seems extremely likely to me that virus is responding to vaccines in the sense that if there's a favorable mutation on a variant that will get through defenses this same mutation is likely to live on as it's capable of infecting people, which other mutations can't.

Basically, antibodies are developed by cells called B cells. When the B cells are developing, they undergo a series of mutations in a very specific part of their DNA that helps to randomly create candidate antibodies. These candidate antibodies are displayed on the surface of the cell,And if they buy into an antigen that is being presented, the best sellers allowed to mature and start making actual antibodies.

If you have a bunch of circulating antibodies that you did not make, then they will simply buy into the antigen and neutralize it. This will never allow it to get it to developing B cells.

This is why an Rh negative expectant mother is given an infusion of an antibody against Rh positive blood.  It prevents her from developing her own antibody response against Rh positive blood so that she doesn’t kill the baby.

I don't for a second believe that they are so stupid to actually believe that masks are ineffective against viruses (doctors would have taken off their masks long ago if that was the case!) or that they didn't know COVID was spread through the air. Before the virus was identified outside of Wuhan we had more than enough evidence that it was spreading through the air.   
They likely said those things to ensure that was not a massive demand for masks immediately, and so that people didn't panic.  

More recently, they have oversold the efficacy of vaccines, because vaccines are the most important tool for fighting COVID and they rightfully want to maximize the number of people that get vaccinated.  

In my opinion, the criticisms for those things are exactly correct. Science and especially medicine has always had to pay more attention to ethics than other fields -- ""Don't lie"" is one of the most basic principles for any group whose entire purpose is supposed to be to disseminate the truth.   
Why should I trust someone who I know is a liar? Even if I'm too stupid to actually discover the truth for myself, I might be more inclined to believe my own mistaken conclusions than the conclusions of an expert who lies. 

There have been a lot of good public health organization responses throughout the world, but I take serious issue with the CDC's, from an ethical standpoint.

Remember that breakthroughs are semi-rare; in the UK data vaccines reduce them 9-fold.  With a one-month gap between doses this is much lower and should wane faster, but a booster should take it up above that factor of 9.

Without vaccination that 9-fold protection against infection goes away and you're also (in UK data) about 3.5x more likely to die if you do test positive.

But it has also picked up another trick: the enzymatic cutting of this mutated spike attachment now causes a new spill of preactivated viral RNA into the host cell in advance of the main delivery. 

Essentially, the virus just needed a better skeleton key to open more doors three times as fast and wide. Hence the exponentially higher viral load seen in Delta.

The smell, taste, etc becomes like ringing a bell for neurotransmitters that compliment the altered state and I suspect building up conditioning like that in yourself is especially easy while stoned.  

So basically just find ways to build up associations with pot and good times.  Smoke only before you're about to do something you really enjoy that requires your complete attention: Exercise (if you're in good cardiovascular health b/c of smoking blood pressure issues), playing sports, video games, socializing w/ other stoners, watching a movie, etc.  I particularly enjoy cycling and smoking or lifting weights and smoking while listening to music.  It's good to make it a bit of a ritual too.  Think of the way the British and the Chinese create systems around tea time.

The primary reason seems to be to avoid spreading it to others.   For example, the US CDC guidance says in part:

&gt; People in the community or in outpatient settings who have had a known COVID-19 exposure should not seek vaccination until their quarantine period has ended to avoid potentially exposing healthcare personnel and others during the vaccination visit. This recommendation also applies to people with a known COVID-19 exposure before receipt of the second mRNA vaccine dose.

Have you not heard that people who take antibiotics for long periods of time, cause the bacteria to evolve a resistance to antibiotics, so they get isolated and put on different kinds of antibiotics as a last resort? This is just a simple mechanism of evolution. Of course each virus entity has the same likelihood of mutating, meaning that unvaccinated people with higher viral loads lead to more mutations. What is important though, is which kinds of mutations are being filtered for. In unvaccinated people most mutations will just die, with many others being weaker than the original and in very few cases, a more dominant strain emerges. If you run through this whole process in a vaccinated person, the same applies, but the strains that make it through and become more dominant, are now also a lot better equipped to handle a vaccinated immune system, leading to more resistant strains.

Pressley Stutts, the GOP leader who helped reshape the Greenville County Republican Party leadership, died Thursday of complications from COVID-19.

He had been hospitalized since late July and admitted to the ICU on Aug. 3. He had been on a ventilator at Spartanburg Regional Hospital, suffering from pneumonia, renal failure and blood clots.

Stutts was a member of the Tea Party and helped found MySCGOP, a conservative organization intended as an alternative to the S.C. Republican Party.

He was a leader in pushing for a more right-leaning Republican Party that led to the resignation of Greenville GOP Chair Jennifer Black, 1st Vice Chair Stacy Shea and state Executive Committeeman Randy Page.

He was a fervent supporter of President Donald J. Trump and posted photos on Facebook of himself with the former president.

After Stutts tested positive for COVID and was hospitalized, he continued to post Facebook messages reaffirming his belief that masks and vaccines should not be mandated by the government.

His wife, Patty, also tested positive for COVID and was hospitalized but has since recovered.

“On behalf of Pressley’s family, and at Patty’s specific request, we would please request privacy for the family at this very difficult time. We will provide further updates as they develop,” a message on Stutts’ Facebook page said.

Hundreds of people have posted on his Facebook page supporting him through his illness and since his death.

Stutts said he never doubted the insidiousness of COVID and that the virus is not anything to fool around with..

“It is a deadly bio-weapon perpetrated upon the people of the world by enemies foreign, and perhaps domestic,” he said on social media.

He said it was up to individuals — and not government — to decide to wear a mask or to be vaccinated against the disease.

“Mandates and coercions do not work, especially when they come to us from a government that has repeatedly lied to the American People time and time again,” he said. “We the people have been awakened by the truth-telling and exposure of the depth of depravity and corruption President Trump has ...",,,,1629415027,{},h9lfytu,True,t3_p7q2ie,False,True,t3_p7q2ie,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p7q2ie/sc_gop_leader_dies_after_battling_covid_for_more/h9lfytu/,1629481234.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_10yqj6,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am vaccinated and believe in the science and encourage others to do the same.

But it really sucks how much everyone gave up on caring to do their part to manage the pandemic once they got vaxxed. I get it, I was elated to receive a vaccine and ""get right back to normal"" too... and I went back out to restaurants, met with friends, and even ditched the mask for awhile.

But we cant keep denying the reality that is in front of us. Its fantastic that vaccines really help keep us safe, but the fact is, that the pandemic isnt gone, it has the potential to get even worse, and our personal actions continue to contribute to the situation getting better, or worse. Theres no real reason anyone NEEDS to host/attend a big event, or pack themselves in to busy restaurants, or jump on a cruise ship.

I know we are all collectively exhausted, traumatized, overwhelmed. I'm not saying everyone needs to lock themselves at home with a hazmat suit on. I'm just really disheartened that so many folks are willing to give up the fight because they no longer think covid has the power to personally affect them. Which of course is false. But, here we are.

I realize this isnt the most popular opinion. But I'm just getting really confused by why it's seemingly becoming less common to understand that, even if I dont get sick, me needlessly bouncing around the world could kill someone else.

This is the problem with people not knowing WTF they are talking about. They hear 2 percentages and somehow think they mean the same thing. In this case, she is claiming that the CFR for Covid is .1%. I believe conservative estimates were .8%. I won’t even get into how merely living after Covid is not the whole story. She tries to compare this to a 90% vaccine efficacy. A number that has nothing to do with death rate in this context. A number that simply means your chances of catching Covid after vaccination are reduced by 90%. So if you had a 100% chance of getting Covid, the vaccine takes that down to a 10% chance.

This headline at least is bad medicine.

 I'm going to be an MD in just a few short months. I'm going to take my hippocratic oath and pledge to help patients, all patients. Hopefully I can give you guys a perspective that some of you need. 

When I'm in the hospital, as I've seen this year, last year, and the years prior, I care for patients that do nearly everything against their own healthcare interests. 

I am currently carrying a male who has Renal Cell Carcinoma that has smoked for 40 years and continues to smoke despite having this cancer with a known risk factor for renal cell Carcinoma and other cancers. 

While on family medicine, I counseled obese patients that refuse to diet or exercise. I would damn near beg patients to just walk 30 minutes a day and start 1 meal at a time and hardly make any effect. 

While on nephrology, I cared for a patient x3 in the same 2 months for uremic encephalopathy because the patient repeatedly refused dialysis. 

This year I've dealt with a number of patients that died of covid despite refusing the vaccine. 

The answer to all these things as medical professionals is to continue to fight for our patients tooth and nail. Continue to counsel them and treat them despite them going against our advice at every turn. 

I get that people love to rip on anti-vax folks on reddit and I promise you I'm 100% pro-vax and have convinced many many patients to get the Covid vaccine (even got to stick em with it). 

But we can't lose our humanity or endorse health care professionals to give up on patients that, even if ignorantly or arrogantly, gave up themselves. I won't and will push back.

First paragraphs:

&gt;North Texas doctors have quietly developed a plan that seeks to prepare for the possibility that due to the COVID-19 surge the region will run out of intensive-care beds.

&gt;If that happens, for the first time, doctors officially will be allowed to take vaccination status of sick patients into account along with other triage factors to see who gets a bed.
 
&gt; A copy of an internal memo written by Dr. Robert Fine, co-chair of the North Texas Mass Critical Care Guideline Task Force, was sent to members of the task force -- and leaked to The Watchdog. It summarizes the latest work by the task force, a volunteer group that periodically updates medical guidelines for hospitals in our region. There are about 50 members from various hospitals in the group. Although their recommendations are not enforceable, the guidelines are generally followed.

&gt;The one-page summary memo is a “heads up” alert in the event things get worse, says Dr. Mark Casanova, director of clinical ethics for Baylor University Medical Center and a spokesperson for the task force. After Monday’s meeting, doctors had yet to make plans to inform the public.

The official line is that Pfizer only offered them 10M doses and both the AUS government and Pfizer are repeating that same story.  Multiple independent sources have come forward though saying that the AUS government sent a Jr. representative who tried to haggle over the price and gain access to intellectual property.  That dramatically slowed negotiations while other governments like Israel were willing to simply buy as much as they could immediately at the asking price.  That's the unofficial explanation for why several other countries were able to secure large contracts in July while Australia didn't secure a much smaller contract until months later.

A point I agree with you on is people acting like these kids have just been sitting in isolation all summer. At least in my district, the majority of these kids have maintained their social lives throughout the summer - hell, they maintained them last year too. We did everything to keep them apart during the school day, but it didn’t matter when they hung out outside of school anyway.

But what really, really bothers me is people acting like schools being a hotbed for disease spread is some new thing. Every single elementary classroom in every single school, every single year, is a disease factory. Illnesses come in waves, and you can tell when a handful of students from a single classroom are all out sick at the same time. Or in general when schoolwide attendance is light and the most common thing you’ll hear from teachers is “there must be something going around”. Is this is a good thing? No, students shouldn’t be sent to school when they’re sick to spread those illnesses to begin with. However, it’s reality and one that every educator knows very well. Did anyone care about this at all before covid? Hell no, it was just how it is. Kids get sick from other kids at school.

Even more frustrating is once covid becomes endemic and we are back to normal, these same people will go back to not giving a shit when other viruses and illnesses are passed around classrooms. No one cares that RSV numbers are high right now, it’s all about covid. 

Essentially I’m tired of people using school as a way to boost their ego and signal how good they are when it comes to covid, without having ever given a single thought or care to the numerous illnesses that have spread in classrooms before or will happen afterward. This has been said before, but it’s all just posturing for people to say “look how good at the pandemic I am and how much I take covid seriously!”

All this to say, where I differ from your opinion is that it’s inevitable students will get sick this year. It doesn’t matter what mandates are put in place, with both covid and rsv spreading like wildfire, students WILL get sick. Hopefully all of them stay mild, but anyone acting like the spread of disease in school is completely preventable, ESPECIALLY in elementary, is delusional.",,,,1629419430,{},h9lpcln,False,t3_p79ssr,False,False,t1_h9ljd46,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p79ssr/daily_discussion_thread_august_19_2021/h9lpcln/,1629486114.0,17,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_78knjobg,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I also recall seeing fairly good data in the early days that suggested the original Wuhan outbreak was likely started by a much more virulent variant of the virus with a significantly higher death/complication rate. It behaved more like original SARS, spreading slowly, but killing more. This probably fooled Chinese authorities into thinking it was something like SARS, or SARS itself. But at some point fairly early on a new variant split off that was much more contagious (sort of like Delta is signficantly more contagious than previous variants). This was the variant which broke out worldwide. 

If that turns out to be true, then it starts fitting a troubling pattern. The virus seems to be rapidly mutating (not surprising), and the mutations that are successful in taking the mantle of the pandemic are the more contagious ones (also not surprising). Theoretically, in order for the virus to become more contagious, it may be sacrificing some of its disease causing abilities, which should lead to lower mortality rates (which we may be seeing with Delta already).

I don't know about preventable... Delta is just too contagious. One way or another almost everyone is going to get it in the near future. The only thing we can do is try and slow it down enough that our hospitals and larger economy doesn't grind to a halt.

Schools might end up being our achilles heel. No matter how hard we try everywhere else if kids are not vaccinated and spreading it in school that is putting it into homes almost everywhere and most people are not going to mask at home.

Masks and social distancing are our best shot at slowing it down but nothign can prevent everyone from getting infected. (imo)

In California the schools are requiring masks but more importantly there is a set of protocols that kick in when someone tests positive. Many other students get quarantined after that and have to stay home for 10 days even if they get a negative test. The kids showing symptoms but get a test and it's negative, they can return sooner but because covid can develop slowly and you won't test positive for several days they're choose a route that assumes contact with the known infected, passed the virus and you won't test negative or show symptoms for almost 7 days. This, hopefully will  make it less likely a kid will come back and keep spreading it even after a negative test and no symptoms. I'm only learning all this because I just had to go pick my kid up and keep her home for 10 days. No symptoms but contact with a known positive.

&gt;For weeks in June and July, workers at a Maine factory making one of America’s most popular rapid tests for Covid-19 were given a task that shocked them: take apart millions of the products they had worked so hard to create and stuff them into garbage bags.

&gt;Soon afterward, Andy Wilkinson, a site manager for Abbott Laboratories, the manufacturer, stood before rows of employees to announce layoffs. The company canceled contracts with suppliers and shuttered the only other plant making the test, in Illinois, dismissing a work force of 2,000. “The numbers are going down,” he told the workers of the demand for testing, saying it wasn’t their fault. “This is all about money.”

&gt;As virus cases in the U.S. plummeted this spring, so did Abbott’s Covid-testing sales. But now, amid a new surge in infections, steps the company took to eliminate stock and wind down manufacturing are proving untimely — hobbling efforts to expand screening as the highly contagious Delta strain rages across the country.

&gt;Demand for the 15-minute antigen test, BinaxNOW, is soaring again as people return to schools and offices. Yet Abbott has reportedly told thousands of newly interested companies that it cannot equip their testing programs in the near future. CVS, Rite Aid and Walgreens locations have been selling out of the at-home version, and Amazon shows shipping delays of up to three weeks. Abbott is scrambling to hire back hundreds of workers.",,,,1629493317,{},h9plcfa,False,t3_p8dfmw,False,False,t1_h9pjffx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p8dfmw/maker_of_popular_covid_test_told_factory_to/h9plcfa/,1629562746.0,24,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_mia8t,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's a fascinating read which details the whole lifecycle of an infection, and points out different attack vectors for us.

How the coronavirus infects cells — and why Delta is so dangerous

https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02039-y

As I understand it:
The one mentioned here (P681R) seems to modify the virus' furin cleavage site. This is a part o the S protein which ""activates"" the S protein right before a new virus is released from an infected cell. More furin cleavages, more infectious.

""Two coronavirus variants, Alpha and Delta, have altered furin cleavage sites. In the Alpha variant, the initial proline amino acid is changed to a histidine (P681H) ; in the Delta variant, it is changed to an arginine (P681R). Both changes make the sequence less acidic, and the more basic the string of amino acids, the more effectively furin recognizes and cuts it, says Barclay. “We would hypothesize that this is the virus getting even better at transmitting.”

More furin cuts mean more spike proteins primed to enter human cells. In SARS-CoV, less than 10% of spike proteins are primed, says Menachery, whose lab group has been quantifying the primed spike proteins but is yet to publish this work. In SARS-CoV-2, that percentage rises to 50%. In the Alpha variant, it’s more than 50%. In the highly transmissible Delta variant, the group has found, greater than 75% of spikes are primed to infect a human cell.""",,,,1629482829,{},h9ovw37,False,t3_p83990,False,False,t3_p83990,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p83990/the_mutation_that_helps_delta_spread_like/h9ovw37/,1629549037.0,20,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_6sibx,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A lot of people are just going about their week normally. They go to work, go to church, go out to eat. They see their friends. Have play dates for the kids. Rinse and repeat. Fox news isn’t showing the overwhelmed hospitals. They aren’t showing people gasping for air. And that’s assuming they really watch any news at all. A lot of people get their news from the local conservative shock jockeys on the radio as they drive to work.

As far as many people are concerned, life is literally normal. It’s not until it effects them personally that they actually see what’s going on.

Even though last winters surge was still brutal, the infection rate of Covid at the time was a lot lower. A lot of people never had more than a potential exposure, even the ones flagrantly ignoring masks and social distancing. Delta is far more infectious though, even with the vaccines, so a lot of these people who avoided it last year are coming face to face with reality now.

I have zero pity for people not being vaccinated at this point, but the reality is that a lot more people would probably be more willing to get vaccinated if they actually saw what was going on. But in red leaning states, cities, and towns, where people only watch Fox, and their local news station is conservative and avoiding addressing covid… they just aren’t seeing it because their “news” isn’t showing it. And most people don’t seek out other news, they don’t check other sources. They watch their programs and that’s that. That’s all the source of news they get.

I think this past year and a half, more than ever, has proven that there needs to be some sort of semblance of regulation in journalism. Because this shit just isn’t acceptable. When the local news doesn’t report that the ICUs are full, that’s a problem. When Fox News declares its fake or vaccines are deadly, or whatever literal bullshit they’re peddling, that’s not okay.

[],,wc_helmets,,,,,,[],"On top of what others have said, a lot of local health departments have taken it upon themselves to keep track of vaccinations.  The County Health Department where I live (Southwest Missouri) started tracking daily cases and breaking it down by vaccination status.  We're on the tail end of our summer peak (hopefully), so we're seeing about 85-95% on a daily basis still unvaccinated.

Now the vaccination rate in the county is poor (25% fully vaccinated.  The City I live in (Joplin) has it's own health department and is around 49% fully vaccinated with 57% started their first dose), but if the vaccines were ineffective, you'd expect to see something like 25% of the cases be vaccinated, but you don't.  It's probably about half that.  Reinfections, and by reinfections I assume not genetic sequencing but simply asking ""Did you have covid before?"", account for even less than that around here.

Now, will vaccinated breakthroughs go up in places where there is a lot of vaccination? Of course, but you still will see a matter of overall cases trending down.  It becomes something of a Simpson's Paradox.

San Francisco appears to have hit it's peak and it is trending downward again, and their spike really wasn't that extended.

I remember thinking that it was lucky that the original strains of COVID didn't spread as easily because so many Americans just didn't care about the vaccines; cases started to decline with just a small amount of people getting immunity, it was great! 

But the fact is that vaccines are preventive tools and not cures. Given that COVID is a disease that comes and goes in waves, it would only make sense to try to urgently get as many people as vaccinated as possible before the next wave comes. Herd immunity is a group effort and not an individual task, which is why it was so frustrating to see the CDC constantly forgetting to assert that if we want herd immunity and normalcy, that means that almost every adult needs to be vaccinated. But that's not the message that was put out and we wasted several months fighting about masking instead of focusing on reaching herd immunity.

They keep saying herd immunity is not possible with Delta, but I don't know. To me, it just sounds like a copout for not really having any overall plan to deal with Delta.
