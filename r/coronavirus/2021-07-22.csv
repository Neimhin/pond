Pre-Delta.. if you got fully vaccinated with two shots and you encounter the virus in a contagious setting, 9/10 times it would basically bounce right off of you. This is great because it means transmission is reduced.  
 
But if you are exposed 10 times, you are likely to contract it eventually.  
  
Furthermore the vaccine reduces the severity of the disease if you do manage to contract it that 1/10 time. By about ~half. So if you originally had a 10% chance of being hospitalized with it, now it would only be a 5% chance.  
 
&gt;   &gt; [This showed that COVID-19 cases vaccinated with a single dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the AstraZeneca vaccines had similar levels of protection against mortality after a single dose, at 44% and 55% respectively, compared with unvaccinated cases.](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-vaccines-further-evidence-of-success?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications)  
  
&gt; [..The data shows that protection against mortality from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is even higher ‚Äì around 69% ‚Äì for confirmed cases who had their second dose at least 7 days prior to their positive test.](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-vaccines-further-evidence-of-success?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications)  
  
^(these numbers are a bit lower for the Delta strain)  
  
That's still a nasty virus that you wouldn't want to get but -50% severity is definitely nice.  
  
-----  
 
The point is just because you're vaccinated doesn't mean you are immune. It's almost the equivalent of walking around with an N95 mask on your face. That's very helpful, but if you sit around in a contagious room long enough you'll still contract it. And you can spread it (at a reduced rate than an unvaccinated person), and you can still be hurt or even die from it.  
 
So if cases are really growing in your area, I still think it's a good idea for even vaccinated people to wear masks and keep some distance.

The only option that is feasible right now is to brace for the worst and apply as many safeties as we can for the rest. This means making sure that hospitals are prepared for the worst case scenario; advising local and state health departments; ensuring everyone who does want the vaccine knows they have the option; applying pressure or placing incentives on businesses to enforce or mandate the vaccine, mask use, or continued remote work.

We also must keep the seat open for the people who finally want to have honest discussions, and make sure they are aware that the offer is always open so long at they're honestly willing to join. Some people will still be seriously hurt or die. It's sad. But continuing to appease them doesn't work. Shaming them doesn't work. All that's left is to prepare to move on without them and leave them a map of where to find us if they want to come along on the wagon.

I agree that societies are an organism themselves. When one part of society is hurting has effects on us all in some way or another. The unfortunate reality is this system has parts acting as though it is completely autonomous. It endangers everyone.

I‚Äôm all for being wrong I‚Äôm just not seeing this add up. 

Take all of this into consideration than look at Israel‚Äôs covid cases - they are going up but considering delta has an R0 of around 6 we should be seeing much larger case numbers/exponential growth in Israel given the laxed distancing measures.

Compare that to Los Angeles county which had almost identical case loads as Israel one month ago that now has 2500 cases a day to Israel‚Äôs 1200.

[],,Worms_sg,,,,,,[],"SINGAPORE - A $1.1 billion support package that includes enhanced wage subsidies under the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), and rental relief, more support for drivers of taxis and private-hire vehicles and a new relief fund for market and hawker centre stallholders will be rolled out to cushion businesses and workers from the impact of harsher Covid-19 restrictions.

JSS support will be bumped up to 60 per cent for the hardest-hit sectors such as food and beverage, gyms and performing arts organisations, where the tightened measures require them to suspend many, if not all, of their activities, said the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on Friday (July 23), a day after the measures kicked in.

The package will be funded by reallocated monies arising from one-off underutilised budgets as a result of Covid-19 delaying some projects, as well as funds set aside earlier in the event of extension of support measures.

""In putting together this support package, the Government took into account feedback from workers and businesses, and engaged business and trade association leaders to understand their concerns,"" said the ministry in its statement, which comes ahead of a debate in Parliament next week on the package.

Since Thursday (July 22), Singapore has reverted to phase two (heightened alert), with tighter measures in place until Aug 18 to curb the worsening Covid-19 situation.

These include cutting the limit on group sizes for social gatherings from five to two, and allowing food and beverage establishments to offer only takeaway and delivery services, among others.

Earlier this month, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said in Parliament that Covid-19 support measures during Singapore's earlier heightened alert period that began in May were expected to cost $1.2 billion.

This would be financed by a reallocation of monies previously budgeted for, he said, in introducing a Supplementary Supply Bill for this reallocation.

Half of the $1.2 billion figure would come from the capitalisation of development expenditure under the recently passed Significant Infrastructure Government Loan Act, while the rest would come from underutilised development expenditure.

&gt; Enhanced JSS for affected sectors

The JSS will be enhanced for affected sectors from July 22 to Aug 18.

Wage support will be increased to 60 per cent for sectors where the tightened measures require them to suspend many, if not all, of their activities.

These include food and beverage businesses, gyms, fitness studios, performing arts organisations and arts education centres.

Support will be increased to 40 per cent for sectors that are significantly affected by the restrictions. These include the retail sector, affected personal care services, tourist attractions, licensed hotels, cruise and regional ferry operators, Mice(meetings, incentives, conferencing and exhibitions) organisers, travel agents, museums, art galleries, cinema operators and other family entertainment centres.

JSS support for these sectors will taper to 10 per cent from Aug 19 to 31.

&gt; Rental relief for commercial properties

Tenants of government-owned commercial properties will get an additional four-week rental waiver and qualifying tenant-occupiers and owner-occupiers of privately-owned commercial properties will get an additional two-week rental relief cash payout under the Rental Support Scheme.

This will offset rent for the full duration of phase two (heightened alert) for government-owned commercial properties, and for half the duration of heightened measures for privately-owned commercial properties, MOF noted.

More details will be available on the Inland Revenue Authority Singapore website.

Noting that many tenants have said that not all landlords were forthcoming with rental support, MOF said it is looking at how to require rental obligations to be shared fairly between the Government, landlords and qualifying tenants.

The Ministry of Law will announce more details.

&gt; Enhanced Covid-19 Driver Relief Fund for taxi, private-hire car drivers

To support taxi and private-hire car drivers, the Government will enhance the Covid-19 Driver Relief Fund from July 22 to end-September.

Currently, the fund provides eligible drivers with $10 per vehicle per day for 60 days from July, and $5 per vehicle per day for the next 30 days.

Under this latest enhancement, eligible drivers will get an additional $10 per vehicle per day from July 22 to Aug 31, and an additional $5 per vehicle per day in September.

&gt; Support for hawker and market stallholders, other affected workers

A new Market and Hawker Centre Relief Fund will give a one-off $500 cash payout to all individual stallholders of cooked food and market stalls in centres managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA) or NEA-appointed operators .

This follows the announcement earlier this month of an additional one month of subsidies for table-cleaning and centralised dishwashing service fees, and one month of rental waivers.

To help other workers affected by the tightened measures, the Government will also make the temporary Covid-19 Recovery Grant available until Aug 31.

It provides a payout of up to $700 for those who were placed on involuntary no-pay leave, and up to $500 for those who lost at least half of their income for at least one month due to tightened safe management measures since May 16.

Existing grant recipients who continue to need help can apply for a second support payout, said the ministry.

&gt; Extension of food delivery, e-commerce booster packages

Given the impact of tighter measures on the food and beverage sector, Enterprise Singapore (ESG) will reintroduce the Food Delivery Booster Package to defray part of food delivery costs via food delivery platforms and third-party logistics partners, for transactions made from July 22 to Aug 18.

For the use of food delivery platforms, ESG will fund five percentage points of the commission cost charged. ESG will fund 20 per cent of the delivery cost for food delivery orders through third-party logistics partners.

Grant support will also be given to local retailers to get on-board local e-commerce platforms through the extension of the E-commerce Booster Package, which will now be available till Nov 16.

Retailers get a one-time 80 per cent support on qualifying costs of service fees charged by platforms such as Lazada, Qoo10 and Shopee, capped at $8,000.

1. Last summer was also a pretty big dip in the death/infection statistics, even as most of Europe was actually starting the second wave already. People commented that this was due to the good weather encouraging people to go outside and outdoors, people leaving the big cities to go to their summer vacation spots and also people being able to keep better distance in these conditions.
2. Sweden is doing really well with the vaccination rates in the groups that are high risk for complications and death and in all-adults-age groups. 87+% of all adults above 60 years old are now fully vaccinated, 4.5% more in this group have received first dose of vaccination. In many regions the vaccination schedule is now available for 18+ years olds and in that age group already 43% have received at least one vaccination. As of today's reporting, 75.8 % of all adults in Sweden have received at least 1 dose, with  48.1% of all adults being fully vaccinated already.
3. During the summer reporting has much larger lag than usually. It is extremely likely that some deaths occurring right now (in low numbers, but still some) will be added retroactively once the reporting catches up with everyone's summer holiday and then there will be few deaths daily.
4. However, even with the lag in reporting, the numbers that do get reported are very encouraging.

Some reasons:

1. School year ends in early june in Sweden and next school year starts in late august. So at the moment schools and universitys are closed.

2. We have long dark winters in Sweden which makes us appreciate summer even more and people spend very little time indoors together with other people now. Our summers are not warm enough so that we need to go indoors to air conditioned areas.

3. Summer holidays in Sweden is mostly in Juli so work activity is low now.

My guess is that we will see the same pattern as last year when the second wave started in october. But this time vaccine will help keeping the death toll down.

We do not have many generations living together. It is a highly developed country where many have the ability to work from home (which they do).

We still have to take care of them. We still have to watch them die. We still have to put them in body bags. We still are dangerously close to having a completely overwhelmed healthcare system, running out of ventilators, running out of supplies, etc etc etc.

Nurses and doctors are fried, burned out, statistically &gt; 50% of us dealing with mental health issues like PTSD from this past year, and we were soooo close to the light at the end of the tunnel.

I had gone almost 4 months without having to tell a patient who couldn't breathe that they could try to facetime their family before going on the ventilator as it would likely be the last time they spoke, and I have had to do it twice this week.

Not asking for sympathy - i unfortunately chose a career that involves trying to stop natural selection from killing people who run straight into the jaws of death out of stupidity... I am just tired and afraid.

What we are looking at is that it's more like 120 people with covid, 20 vaccinated and 100 unvaccinated people. So ~80% effective (i pulled all those number out of my backside to just show the concept, actual effectiveness is higher). 


But it doesn't say anything about exposure or other health problems. In fact those things are most likely a reason that a part of the vaccinated people got covid: different exposure, preexisting health problems, ...



So people who have a high risk before the vaccination also have a higher risk after the vaccination. Basically your risk is just 10 times lower. But if i remember right for pepole over 60 the risk is already ~50 times higher than the risk for younger people. That means an unvaccinated young person has a lower risk than a vaccinated old person. It also means if you are a young healthy person your risk was always low and with the vaccinations the risk is even lower.

Objectives and Setting.  
As the lethal COVID-19 pandemic enters its second year, the need for effective modalities of alleviation remains urgent. This includes modalities that can readily be used by the public to reduce disease spread and severity. Such preventive measures and early-stage treatments may temper the immediacy of demand for advanced anti-COVID measures (drugs, antibodies, vaccines) and help relieve strain also on other health system resources.  
  
Design and Participants.  
We present results of a clinical study with a multi-component OTC ‚Äúcore formulation‚Äù regimen used in a multiply exposed adult population. Analysis of clinical outcome data from our sample of over 100 subjects ‚àí comprised of roughly equal sized regimen-compliant (test) and non-compliant (control) groups meeting equivalent inclusion criteria ‚àí demonstrates a strong statistical significance in favor of use of the core formulations.  
  
Results.  
While both groups were moderate in size, the difference between them in outcomes over the 20-week study period was large and stark: Just under 4% of the compliant test group presented flu-like symptoms, but none of the test group was COVID-positive; whereas 20% of the non-compliant control group presented flu-like symptoms, three-quarters of whom (15% overall of the control group) were COVID-positive.  
  
Conclusions.  
Offering a low cost, readily implemented anti-viral approach, the study regimen may serve, at the least, as a stopgap modality and, perhaps, as a useful tool in combatting the pandemic.",,,,1627059282,{},h69nm2m,True,t3_oq6ias,False,True,t3_oq6ias,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oq6ias/20week_study_of_clinical_outcomes_of/h69nm2m/,1627215051,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,

Another thing I want people to not be afraid of is the risk of GBS from J&amp;J, which is detailed [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/health/covid-guillain-barre-vaccines.html). I've seen a lot of worry from people regarding the USDA's report, and want to put it in perspective.  


I have GBS. Was diagnosed with a variant of it in 2019. Hospitalized, intubated, completely paralyzed for about two weeks, then used a walker/cane for another couple months. It's a disease that is pretty awful, but it is extremely rare. I still got the vaccine even after the warning was released.  


According to the [National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Guillain-Barr%C3%A9-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet), GBS is estimated to affect about 1 person in 100,000 each year, or about 0.001% of people. There currently are 100 reports of GBS out of 12.8 million doses, or 0.000781% of people.  
  
This is a significantly lower rate than the overall average of reported cases.

...and masking isn't going to change that. Do you think masks are some magic bullet? They're a mediocre solution that depended on being paired with strict social distancing to be effective. Only together were they acceptable as a temporary solution while we found a better way. The vaccines are WAY more effective, to the point that adding a mask on top for a vaccinated person WITHOUT distancing is only a negligible change in efficacy. 

So unless you're proposing that we bring back business restrictions and distancing requirements to pair with those masks. The symbolic act of masking vaccinated people won't do anything more than make you feel good. 

I'm not interested in maintaining your fantasy for you. Vaccinations work, they prevent spread, lessen symptoms, and lower viral load if you do get infected, making it more difficult to spread to others. This is the way.

If 100% of the population is vaccinated, this virus will still spread and basic logic tells you that since no vaccine ever protects 100% of those vaccinated, you're still going to have cases, you're going to have hospitalizations, you're going to have deaths and they would all be vaccinated.   


The good news in that scenario is that you'd likely be talking about extremely small numbers of people that are susceptible to severe cases.  Somewhat like what we're seeing in Israel right now.  Cases have jumped up considerably and there's evidence of spread among the vaccinated but hospitalizations are at 1/16th of their previous peak.   That's simple confirmation that the vaccines are working.  They were never meant to stop the virus from spreading, but to stop the hospitals getting flooded from sick patients and to prevent loss of life.

[],,MDCCCLV,,,,,,[],"Close to 70% (68.3%) of the adult population in the United States have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. While this progress represents a marked achievement in vaccinations that has led to steep declines in COVID-19 cases and deaths, vaccination coverage‚Äîand the protections provided by it‚Äîremains uneven across the country. With growing spread of the more transmissible Delta variant, cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are once again rising, largely among unvaccinated people. Persistently lower vaccination rates among Black and Hispanic people compared to their White counterparts across most states leave them at increased risk, particularly as the variant spreads.


Reaching high vaccination rates across individuals and communities will be key for achieving broad protection through a vaccine, mitigating the disproportionate impacts of the virus for people of color, and preventing widening racial health disparities going forward. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has indicated that vaccine equity is an important goal and defined equity as preferential access and administration to those who have been most affected by COVID-19.


The CDC reports demographic characteristics, including race/ethnicity, of people receiving COVID-19 vaccinations at the national level. As of July 19, 2021, CDC reported that race/ethnicity was known for 58% of people who had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Among this group, nearly two thirds were White (59%), 9% were Black, 16% were Hispanic, 6% were Asian, 1% were American Indian or Alaska Native, and &lt;1% were Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, while 8% reported multiple or other race. However, CDC data also show that recent vaccinations are reaching larger shares of Hispanic, Asian, and Black populations compared to overall vaccinations. Thirty percent of vaccines administered in the past 14 days have gone to Hispanic people, 6% to Asian people, and 14% to Black people (Figure 1). 




These recent patterns suggest a narrowing of racial gaps in vaccinations at the national level, particularly for Hispanic and Black people, who account for a larger share of recent vaccinations compared to their share of the total population (30% vs. 17% and 13% vs. 12%, respectively). ¬†While these data provide helpful insights at a national level, to date, CDC is not publicly reporting state-level data on the racial/ethnic composition of people vaccinated.",,,,1627039142,{},h68ir9y,True,t3_oq0ae4,False,False,t3_oq0ae4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oq0ae4/latest_data_on_covid19_vaccinations_by/h68ir9y/,1627194865,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_nklge,False,False,,

Although I agree with the spirit of what you're saying, this part is a bit silly and naive.  Obviously if you take the same person and pay them more money, they're probably not going to get any better at their job (aside from maybe some small motivational improvements).  But if you consistently offer high compensation over a period of many years, of course you're going to be attracting more talented and more driven people.  For example, if a random Wal Mart suddenly started paying their cashiers $150k a year, probably not much would change with them.  But come back to that Wal Mart in 5 years and you're probably going to see some really fucking smart cashiers because people with PhDs have now probably been applying for every opening in that time rather than a bunch of high school students.  Medicine is no different.  If the position is paying $600k, it's going to attract the cream of the crop, naturally.

The country's team has six coronavirus cases in total.

&gt;A doctor who was on the flight was reportedly among the first to test positive. As of late Thursday, four athletes had also tested positive for the coronavirus.

&gt;Road cyclist Michal Schlegel is the latest athlete to test positive, joining a list that includes two beach volleyball players and a table tennis player. Schlegel will not be able to compete in Saturday's Olympic road race, the Czech Olympic Committee said.

&gt;Another athlete who tested positive is beach volleyball player Mark√©ta Nausch Slukov√°, who will miss her match that was also slated for Saturday.

&gt;The national team says it's urgently investigating the flight, which brought a large part of the Czech Olympic delegation to Tokyo last week. In a sign of how deep the suspicions about the flight run, after Schlegel's test was confirmed, only those cycling team officials who were on the charter plane were required to report directly to Tokyo for further coronavirus testing.

&gt;The cluster of cases tied to the charter flight has become a big story in the Czech Republic, especially after media outlets there reported that many passengers had taken off their masks immediately after the plane took off.

&gt;‚ÄùPrime Minister Andrej Babi≈° has described the situation as a scandal and unfair to the athletes,"" Radio Prague International reports.

&gt;Much of the scrutiny is falling on a doctor who was on the flight, Vlastimil Vor√°ƒçek, who was reportedly not vaccinated and who has spouted outlandish theories about the COVID-19 pandemic ‚Äî including the idea that people could protect themselves by gargling regularly with mouthwash, according to the news outlet Seznam Zpr√°vy.

&gt;The country's Olympic officials say they want the inquiry to focus on whether all precautions against COVID-19 were observed before, during and after the charter flight ‚Äî and whether some of the plane's passengers may have failed to fulfill their responsibilities.",,,,1627028190,{},h68659c,True,t3_opxxec,False,True,t3_opxxec,/r/Coronavirus/comments/opxxec/czech_olympic_team_investigates_charter_flight/h68659c/,1627188593,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_3nelaphm,False,True,,

[],,ddek,,,,,,[],"You can‚Äôt have an immune response unless you are infected. The immune system is not a shield that is penetrated, it cant mount a response to a disease you don‚Äôt have.\*

This means your odds of catching COVID are entirely on your behaviour, not your immune system.

The hope with vaccinations etc is that your immune system can mount a faster response if you are infected. If the response is fast and accurate, you won‚Äôt feel symptoms. If there is no prepared response (I.e. first exposure) then the immune system will have to work it out, in the process causing symptoms that may be quite severe.

So 88% effective is meaningful, because it indicates that the population who were vaccinated were 88% less likely to become ill, which is the point of the vaccination.

This does not mean that for each exposure there is a 12% chance you will get COVID. At the other end, this does not mean there is an 88% chance that you will never get COVID, regardless of how many exposures you had. It would be statistically challenging to calculate those probabilities.

In the 88% case, if you are infected the virus will start to replicate in your respiratory system. After a few days, the virus will be present in high enough concentrations that you may trigger a positive test, and you‚Äôre immune system will detect it. This triggers are targeted antibody response, using existing antibodies or new ones from T-cells. The virus is rapidly dispensed with, without causing symptoms. Remember symptoms are caused by the immune response, not the virus itself. To you, a potential upside of this is that your immune system was challenged, so your immunity was probably improved. 

The other number quoted about vaccines is the effectiveness at preventing severe COVID. This number is calculated based on significantly positive infections (based on antigen concentration), so excludes asymptomatic cases. This means the preconditions commute - if the vaccine is 88% protection from symptoms, and 97% at preventing hospitalisation, then you are 99.996% less likely to be hospitalised.

No sources on hand but this is based on discussions with my GF (MD &amp; PhD, researching immunologist at UCL), and my mom (PhD immunology, currently near the top of UK gov).

They followed a control group of 60 subjects and a treatment group of 53 subjects, all age 30+, 60:40 female:male, roughly the same distribution of comorbidities.

They started with the following prevention/prophylaxis dose:

- Zinc  (25mg/day)
- Quinine (as quina-brand supplement - 10 drops/day) 
- Quercetin 400 mg/day 
- Vitamin C 1000 mg/day
- Vitamin D3 1000 IU/day
- Vitamin E 400 IU/day
- L-lysine 500 mg/day



If somebody in the compliant group presented with flu-like illness, they doubled the prevention dose (so 2x the above numbers per day), with the exception of zinc, which they ""initiated incremental increase of the zinc over 2-3 days to as high as 200 mg/day, as tolerated.""

Their results were:
&gt;At 5 weeks into the study, none of the test group of 53 had presented with COVID-19 or other flu-like illness, while 6 of the control group of 60 did so present. At 20 weeks, a total of 2 of the test group have presented, versus 12 of the control group.

Note that only 9 (not 12) of the control group had COVID, and neither of the 2 in the treatment group (those 5 collectively had ""non-covid illness"" so I'm not sure why they even included those numbers).  They try to estimate ""exposure counts"" (how in the hell could you do that) and their conclusion is that the treatment regimen likely works as prophylaxis though they admit there could be confounding factors.

This study is... weird.  There's not much to take away from it.

But now, not every infection is considered a case in vaccinated people. Only the serious ones are.

The next issue will be the number of unvaccinated.  On top of that there will be the issue of multiple strains with the potential of a new strain emerging.

If we estimate vaccinations at 2/3rds, that still leaves about 8,333 unvaccinated people which means we are looking at 15-20 deaths of which we are looking 6-10 athlete deaths. 

Even worse there will be longhaulers from this exposure round.

If people with the vaccine are still getting infected/transmitting, that's still buying lottery tickets to the mutation lottery.  More tickets more odds of a winner (mutation).

Just because you're now capped to 1000 lottery tickets for vaccinated people doesn't they can't win, especially if enough people play.

Just so happens people not vaccinated are able to purchase many more tickets.  But that doesn't guarantee they win either. Just gives them a bit better odds.

Reality is the blame game doesn't work here. The virus doesn't care.  It's just going to reproduce and mutate as many times as possible to survive.  **It's called ""evolution"".**  Your opinions don't matter. It's just math and biology. Give it enough chances, and eventually you risk getting something bad.

Reality is with so much virus around, getting infected may not be so bad for you, but it's bad for society as a whole if you're the asshole that the bad mutation happens in.

Pfizer Inc.‚Äôs Covid-19 vaccine provided a strong shield against hospitalization and more severe disease in cases caused by the contagious delta variant in Israel in recent weeks, **even though it was just 39% effective in preventing infections**, according to the country‚Äôs health ministry.  
  
The vaccine, developed with BioNTech SE, **provided 88% protection against hospitalization and 91% against severe illness for an unspecified number of people studied between June 20 and July 17**, according to a report Thursday from the health ministry.  
  
The report said that the data could be skewed because of different ways of testing vaccinated groups of people versus those who hadn‚Äôt been inoculated. Still, the data are likely to fuel debate over whether booster shots should be given to people who‚Äôve already been vaccinated -- something Pfizer has said it plans to request in the U.S. Israeli authorities said earlier this month they‚Äôll only give a third round of shots to people with weakened immune systems.

The data out of Israel, which had earlier access to vaccines than most anywhere else in the world, contrast with a study out of the U.K. That paper, published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine offer 88% protection against symptomatic disease caused by the delta variant and 94% against the alpha variant that was first discovered in Britain**. Public Health England also previously found that the Pfizer and BioNTech shot was 96% effective against hospitalization**.

Pfizer and BioNTech are confident in the protection and safety of the two-dose vaccine, Pfizer said in a statement on Friday. BioNTech is conducting an ongoing review of study data on the vaccine, a spokeswoman said.

Analysis of the companies‚Äô more than 43,000-person clinical trial shows that effectiveness against symptomatic infection dips over time, from 95% in the first two months to the low- to mid-80% range four to six months after the second dose, Pfizer said.  
  
From Alpha to Delta, Why Virus Mutations Cause Alarm: QuickTake  
  
The delta variant first emerged in India and is spreading around the globe as governments race to inoculate people, sometimes infecting those already fully vaccinated against Covid. The mutation has forced some countries to delay or rethink plans to loosen curbs on businesses, activity and travel.  
  
Israel has had one of the world‚Äôs most effective inoculation drives, with 57% of the population fully vaccinated, but has seen a recent surge in infections due to delta. Critical cases have also climbed, but remain a fraction of the peak earlier this year.  
  
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has urged vaccine holdouts -- who number some 1.1 million people -- to get inoculated, calling it the most effective way to defeat the delta strain. The government has also reinstated some restrictions for indoor events and plans to ban flights to several countries with rising infection rates, including the U.K. and Cyprus.

However, this leaves important questions unanswered.

* Are you still shedding the virus and can thus still pass it to others during this time? 
* Are you likely to experience ""long covid"" symptoms after you fight off the virus itself?

New South Wales Health Minister Jeroen Weimar warned that transmission had occurred with only ‚Äúfleeting contact‚Äù between individuals. For example, contact tracing and genomic sequencing showed that a woman in her 70s was infected while sitting outside a cafe visited by ‚ÄúPatient Zero,‚Äù an airport limo driver. In another instance, the virus seems to have been transmitted in the time it took for two unmasked strangers to pass each other in a shopping center, an encounter captured by mall security cameras.

If you're young and active, you're very low risk of having a PE unless you have other risk factors. Also something to note is the ""gold standard"" PCR test has between 9-30% false negatives depending on the study you read. So there's between a 1/10 and 1/3 chance you were actually positive.   


PE's are nothing to play with, it's good you were watching it and got to the ER when you did.

Also being the most dominant strain also occurs because the previous dominant variants started declining as those waves ended. For example the UK had a lockdown over the winter to contain alpha and once cases dropped to a low point people from outside likely brought in delta and effected a previously non immune group which set off another chain of infections. This time however the infections were occurring when most restrictions lifted and therefore more people are in contact with the virus.

&gt; The data shows that protection against mortality from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is even higher ‚Äì around 69% ‚Äì for confirmed cases who had their second dose at least 7 days prior to their positive test.

&gt; When combined with the estimated protection against becoming a case, this is equivalent to an estimated 97% protection against mortality in individuals vaccinated with 2 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.  
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-vaccines-further-evidence-of-success  
  
The numbers are not as good for Delta, as we know.  
  
Efficacy is the overall reduction of chance. It's like saying if you live in Antarctica you're 99% less likely to die in a collision on a highway. It doesn't necessarily mean you're the safest driver, it just means your exposure to the risk is very reduced.  
  
If you went back home to Los Angeles and drove to meet your friend across town, suddenly your chances of dying in a traffic accident are way higher. Because your exposure level has changed. That's what a high case load and un-distanced behavior with 
  
The meat and potatoes of these vaccines is the apparent ability for it to shake off infection in the first place. But if you expose yourself enough, like going to night clubs with a questionable screening process, you can absolutely still contract it.  
So it's important to know that vaccinated people can and still do get hurt and even die from COVID.  
  
-----  
  
Think of it this way: if you were staying at home before the vaccine rollout, and practically never saw anyone - your chance of dying was minuscule.   
If you got fully vaccinated (-90% chance of being infected, so 1/10 chance now) but went out **12x** as often as you use to - you're net more exposed now than you were when you were staying home.  
 
The whole point of the vaccine was that if enough of us got it, that stacked 90% reduction in transmission would bring case numbers down so far that *anyone's* chance of contracting it was just impossibly low even regardless of your vaccination status.  
 
Delta has thrown a wrench into that process. We almost had an effective herd immunity with what vaccinating we did, but now our ~50% is simply not enough. And vaccinated people are at some risk as well.  
The big difference being vaccinated people are on a slower growth curve of cases and hospitalizations, and their chances of severe disease are ~half.

Before, there were ostensibly two camps: those who took most of the necessary precautions and those who didn't.  Now, we're gradually splitting into three camps: the (wittingly) unvaccinated, those who are vaccinated and feel comfortable/content to resume pre-pandemic habits, and those who are vaccinated that are maintaining personal restrictions.  

Like yourself, I'm a fully vaccinated person who is trusting the efficacy of the vaccines  and doesn't wish to follow the whole one step up, two steps back approach.  I'm thoroughly okay with other vaccinated people who wish to continue mask wearing or want to avoid gatherings where they may be exposed to the unvaccinated, etc.  But, what I'm starting to detect here on Reddit (a poor proxy perhaps for the larger population, I know) is that this vaccinated but vigilant crowd is keen on lumping you and me in with the vaccine-hostile folks at this point i.e. we're selfish, reckless, entitled, et al.

The way I look at the messaging from various health experts is like getting similar but different advice from doctors about any medical question.  Some are going to say ""well, *ideally*, you would do this, but..."" while others are going to be more hard line in their recommendations.  The science for vaccine efficacy is strong.

&gt;Reasons we are still concerned and you should be too, from an epidemiologist:

&gt;1. These unvaccinated people are still filling up our hospital beds. ICUs in the metro area are starting to fill up again. These patients are a burden for our doctors and nurses. Also, our doctors and nurses mental health is suffering from this continued pandemic and crisis. They are going to burn out. Many hospitals are already seeing a mass exodus of nurses.

&gt;2. The vaccines are not 100% effective. Remember, under clinical trial circumstances, Pfizer/Moderna are 95% effective and J&amp;J 60%. They are slightly less effective against some of these variants like delta. I am seeing more and more vaccine breakthrough cases. I've even seen cases of fully vaccinated people die of COVID. Someone has to fall into that percentage of vaccine failure and the higher community prevalence of the virus is, the more people we will see that are fully vaccinated getting COVID.

&gt;3. Unvaccinated people and continued transmission of the virus will basically create variant factories. Eventually as the virus continues to spread, it will mutate in unpredictable ways that will become more deadly or evade the vaccines we currently have.

&gt;4. People who are immunocompromised often do not form antibodies after getting vaccinated and thus are not protected. I'm a transplant patient and did not produce antibodies after getting vaccinated. I basically have no protection and getting COVID could kill me. This would also include cancer patients, HIV patients, MS, and basically anyone else with a severely weakened immune system.

&gt;5. Children under 12 cannot get vaccinated. While serious health impacts from COVID in kids is rare, when it happens it is devastating for those kids and their families. Long haul COVID isn't just impacting adults. I recall one particularly heartbreaking case of a young girl whose passion was dancing and after becoming infected with COVID, her lungs and heart were damaged so severely she cannot dance at the level she was.

How about a nationwide ban on allowing kids to swim? Make it forbidden for kids to go in any pools or go on to any beach. That would surely save a lot of children's lives. We could also install high fencing at any river acess to make sure no kid can get to the water and drown.

&gt;**Neutralizing antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 and viral variants drop markedly during the extended dosing interval**  
&gt;  
&gt;Overall, a NAb response against the vaccine strain virus is induced by a single dose of vaccine across the cohort, as previously noted, but is not well maintained ‚Äì in contrast to the clinical protection that was seen against the alpha variant. In addition, **NAb against the delta variant were poorly induced after a single dose, and not maintained at all during the interval before the second dose**, despite a degree of protection against delta variant now reported following a single dose.

So it boils down to a tradeoff

* The longer dosing interval of 8 weeks seems to offer protection for a longer time.
* However, it also increases the risk of infection from the delta variant in the short term (in the interval between the doses).

Personally I think it is better to get the vaccines as soon as possible (if they are available) as protection from delta variant is of key importance.

Your point is contradictory to what I said because you are talking about a ""shorter time line of immunity"" which is patently untrue. The timeline of immunity is still just as strong as ever - thus 4 months or 4 decades. You said ""88% at 4 months"" which shows you have no idea what the keyword ***variant*** indicates, thus my comments. A variant that appears five years from now, or five days from now, will have a lower efficacy from a vaccine that was never built for it; because... of the word... VARIANT. If everyone was immunized, variants would not be a possibility and we would *actually* be seeing a world where COVID is ""basically gone.""

Yes!  I've been saying exactly this for the past couple weeks as people have started calling for mandates to be imposed again.  Unless they are coupled with large scale mitigation measures, wearing a mask at the grocery is more of a symbolic, performative move than a ""spread prevention"" measure.

[],,Berthololdt,,,,,,[],"Okay, I have a dilemma. My parents and I want to go on vacation in a few weeks, and we're vaccinated with moderna. On paper we should be safe, but I'm a bit concerned.

Here's the thing, my parents are in their 70s. My mom has congestive heart failure. These are all risk factors for COVID. The vaccine has breakthrough cases, and people can still get sick and even die with the vaccine. This happens mostly with older people, and people with preexisting conditions (like CHF). So...as you can tell I'm concerned.

Another factor. I live in a state where COVID rates are pretty low and we got our act together (northeast). We're going to be going to Tennessee and South Carolina. Looking at COVID maps and forecasts for the next few weeks, it looks like the situation down south is rapidly deterioriating and by the time we get down there, things could be really bad, with a risk factor 10x what it would be if we stayed home. 

For reference, this is going to be a fairly long vacation, around 3 weeks, starting in early-mid august (week of either the 8th or 15th) and we will be returning probably in early september. If things keep going as they are, the south might be rampant with COVID. And given we will be out, and going to all the touristy areas, and being around other people, yeah, idk, even WITH a vaccine. Again, vaccine isn't foolproof. Even if we avoid hospitalization, we could still get bad flu like symptoms putting a drag on the whole thing.

That said, I decided to ask for advice here. CDC seems to generally say ""if you're vaccinated, you're good to go"", but I'm cautious. We've been social distancing for over a year, we STILL wear our masks DESPITE being vaccinated. And I'm quite frankly a germophobe. The thing is, between the risk factors, the fact that the vaccine isn't infallible, and the fact that I'm going to be going to areas of the country with a logarithmically higher risk rate than staying home, is my concern legitimate? Or am I overthinking it? (I tend to overthink things). My parents are gung ho on going, they keep saying ""we already didnt go last year, were vaccinated, we're going, but idk, I just think that this could be bad given we're likely going to be going when the rates are far worse than they are now and have been for the past few months.",,,,1627064734,{},h6a08al,False,t3_opwzna,False,False,t3_opwzna,/r/Coronavirus/comments/opwzna/daily_discussion_thread_july_23_2021/h6a08al/,1627221831,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_ar2zkj6,False,False,,

What worries me is when the US boarder opens up again despite requiring Americans to be fully vaccinated to cross I'm sure it wouldn't surprise me to see a surge again in the next few months due to the delta variant especially if you add in international travel  

I take it will be the same going into the US

Essentially 100% of the non-vaccinated workers were either infected *or* had active antibodies against Covid, presumably from a previous infection. So ignoring the confounding variable of non-vaccinated workers with antibodies, the breakthrough rate basically sets the efficacy of the vaccine compared to novel exposure.

Which brings up an important point about these kinds of numbers. As ‚Äúnatural‚Äù immunity continues to grow by infection with Covid, vaccine efficacy compared against the general population would be *expected* to drop just because some portion have a level of natural immunity from a previous encounter. Keep that in mind when seeing numbers like ‚Äú32% efficacy‚Äù, it‚Äôs still quite worrying, but without looking deeper we don‚Äôt know if the control group was screened for antibodies before enrollment. At the extreme case after all non-vaccinated people have been exposed naturally, we would only *expect* a very low (if any) ‚Äúefficacy‚Äù of the vaccine compared with the non-vaccinated population (with their own antibodies from previous exposure).

Do you think putting a mask on a vaccinated person, without strict distancing has any efficacy whatsoever? Do you think requiring vaccinated people to mask in all situations is going to move the needle in any way whatsoever?

The answer to those questions is no. Without adding in distancing requirements, masking is generally pretty ineffective. It was a bandaid that held the place of a better option. Now we have a FAR better option, which turns Covid into a minor inconvenience for the the vast majority of people. 

So unless you're suggesting locking things down, or reinstituting restrictions that will keep people from congregating while destroying the economy, masks do nothing more than to make you feel better.

[],,Ayesha24601,,,,,,[],"This is a BIG problem.

I live in Indiana. I‚Äôm not elderly, but I have a disability and use a wheelchair. I have personal care assistants who help me with daily tasks. I went through total hell during much of the pandemic; since I‚Äôm high-risk I stopped leaving the house at all, except for medical appointments. I have always been an active person, traveling around the country, going to concerts etc. so this had a horrible effect on my mental health. One of my PCAs had worked for me for years and had traveled with me and saw how my life changed. She saw how I became a different person, how I had frequent panic attacks and was severely depressed.

Then the vaccine came and I had hope again. I got vaccinated and so did all of my assistants except for that one, who repeatedly refused. It was devastating to me. I thought she cared about me but she couldn‚Äôt do the one thing that was needed to keep me safe. And I was afraid to fire her over it because she seemed like the type to try to cause problems over it. She had been my best assistant and we got along well, but everything changed. She became very toxic and I lost respect for her as well. Finally, we mutually agreed that she should stop working for me, and I didn‚Äôt mention the vaccine, but in truth it was the biggest reason why I didn‚Äôt want her around anymore. I simply couldn‚Äôt feel safe around her.

I believe the only solution is to make the vaccine mandatory for nursing home and home health workers. Some of them just don‚Äôt have the education or knowledge or willingness to get the vaccine otherwise. And sometimes it‚Äôs not the people you expect. I now don‚Äôt hire people unless they are vaccinated, and it‚Äôs surprising the number of unvaxxed who apply even though I say the vaccine is required. It‚Äôs limiting my life because it‚Äôs hard to find people who are vaxxed on top of all the other requirements.

If you are not vaccinated, GTFO of healthcare.

(First shot) üíâüí™ü©π,dark,[],"Full text: EMA‚Äôs human medicines committee (CHMP) has recommended granting an extension of indication for the COVID-19 vaccine Spikevax (previously COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna) to include use in children aged 12 to 17 years. The vaccine is already authorised for use in people aged 18 and above.

The use of the Spikevax vaccine in children from 12 to 17 years of age will be the same as in people aged 18 and above. It is given as two injections in the muscles of the upper arm, four weeks apart.

The effects of Spikevax have been investigated in a study involving 3,732 children aged 12 to 17 years. This ongoing study is being carried out in accordance with Spikevax‚Äôs paediatric investigation plan (PIP), which was agreed by EMA's Paediatric Committee (PDCO).

The study showed that Spikevax produced a comparable antibody response in 12- to 17-year-olds to that seen in young adults aged 18 to 25 years (as measured by the level of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2). In addition, none of 2,163 children receiving the vaccine developed COVID-19 compared with four of 1,073 children given a dummy injection. These results allowed the CHMP to conclude that the efficacy of Spikevax in 12- to 17-year-olds is similar to that in adults.

The most common side effects in children aged 12 to 17 are similar to those in people aged 18 and above. They include pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, enlarged lymph nodes, chills, nausea, vomiting and fever. These effects are usually mild or moderate and improve within a few days from the vaccination.

The CHMP noted that due to the limited number of children and adolescents included in the study, the trial could not have detected new uncommon side effects or estimated the risk of known side effects such as myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane around the heart).

However, the overall safety profile of Spikevax determined in adults was confirmed in the adolescent study; the CHMP therefore considered that the benefits of Spikevax in children aged 12 to 17 outweigh the risks, in particular in those with conditions that increase the risk of severe COVID-19.

The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in both children and adults will continue to be monitored closely as it is used in vaccination campaigns across the Member States, through the EU pharmacovigilance system and ongoing and additional studies by the company and by European authorities.

How Spikevax works
Spikevax works by preparing the body to defend itself against COVID-19. It contains a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) which has instructions for making the spike protein. This is a protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which the virus needs to enter the body‚Äôs cells.

When a person is given the vaccine, some of their cells will read the mRNA instructions and temporarily produce the spike protein. The person‚Äôs immune system will then recognise this protein as foreign and produce antibodies and activate T cells (white blood cells) to attack it.

If, later on, the person comes into contact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, their immune system will recognise it and be ready to defend the body against it.

The mRNA from the vaccine does not stay in the body but is broken down shortly after vaccination.

Where to find more information
The product information approved by the CHMP for Spikevax contains prescribing information for healthcare professionals, a package leaflet for members of the public and details of conditions of the vaccine‚Äôs authorisation.

An assessment report, with details of EMA‚Äôs evaluation of the use of Spikevax in children, will be published on the EMA website. Clinical trial data submitted by the company in the application for the paediatric extension of indication will be published on the Agency‚Äôs clinical data website in due course.

More information is available in an overview of the vaccine in lay language, including a description of the vaccine‚Äôs benefits and risks and why EMA recommended its authorisation in the EU.

Monitoring the safety of Spikevax
In line with the EU‚Äôs safety monitoring plan for COVID-19 vaccines, Spikevax is closely monitored and subject to several activities that apply specifically to COVID-19 vaccines. Although large numbers of people have already received COVID-19 vaccines, certain side effects may still emerge as more and more people receive the vaccine.

Companies are required to provide monthly safety reports in addition to the regular updates required by legislation and to conduct studies to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines as they are used by the public. Authorities also conduct additional studies to monitor the vaccines.

These measures allow regulators to swiftly assess data emerging from a range of different sources and take appropriate regulatory action to protect public health if needed.",,,,1627047865,{},h68xj43,True,t3_oq2oco,False,True,t3_oq2oco,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oq2oco/covid19_vaccine_spikevax_moderna_approved_for/h68xj43/,1627202134,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_16a0fd,False,False,,

‚ÄúFirst, we used a test-negative case‚Äìcontrol design to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease caused by the delta variant, as compared with the alpha variant, over the period that the delta variant has been circulating. This approach has been described in detail elsewhere.10 In brief, we compared vaccination status in persons with symptomatic Covid-19 with vaccination status in persons who reported symptoms but had a negative test. This approach helps to control for biases related to health-seeking behavior, access to testing, and case ascertainment.‚Äù

‚ÄîAlso the NEJM authors go on to highlight that they are comparing efficacy against alpha to against delta‚Äù: 
From NEJM: ‚ÄúFor the secondary analysis, the proportion of persons with cases caused by the delta variant relative to the main circulating virus (the alpha variant) was estimated according to vaccination status. The underlying assumption was that if the vaccine had some efficacy and was equally effective against each variant, a similar proportion of cases with either variant would be expected in unvaccinated persons and in vaccinated persons. Conversely, if the vaccine was less effective against the delta variant than against the alpha variant, then the delta variant would be expected to make up a higher proportion of cases occurring more than 3 weeks after vaccination than among unvaccinated persons. ‚Äú",,,,1627049319,{},h690lxl,False,t3_opi0xh,False,False,t1_h68uljx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/opi0xh/2_shots_of_pfizer_vaccine_88_effective_against/h690lxl/,1627203621,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_ddoc9,False,False,,

To me it just shows how poorly those in the media do their research and contribute to the spread of conspiracy theories.

That program to look into bat-born Coronaviruses has been ongoing since Covid-19's cousin, 2003 SARS-1 broke out in China, Taiwan, and then sporadically around the world before being contained within a year. It only finally discovered the host and intermediary animal species' that led to that outbreak fourteen years later in 2017. 

SARS-1 was the warning that nature gave the world about the potential for this kind of pandemic.

The problem with that theory, is that in the warmer/hotter parts of the USA, people are sequestering indoors **in the summer**.

It could also do what Influenza does once in a while and pick up genes with other mammal borne coronaviruses and become more deadly and contagious again in later years after most of the population has had exposure to the original Covid or it's vaccines. 

The risk of that isn't going to be as high as Influenza, since it doesn't mutate as often, but all it takes is one person infected with a Covid derivative to meet a mammal infected with a similar enough other coronavirus and we get the ball rolling all over again just like with this pandemic and the SARS outbreak in 2003.",,,,1627053790,{},h69aq8i,False,t3_opqmx9,False,True,t1_h68ldle,/r/Coronavirus/comments/opqmx9/delta_variant_is_one_of_the_most_infectious/h69aq8i/,1627208604,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_epakr,False,True,,

Besides which, I don't see how the two studies contradict each other. The volunteers were infected but to such a slight degree that they wouldn't have been aware that they were infected without blood samples and nasal washing.

It's certainly unclear that if any of the infected volunteers were infectious in a meaningful sense - you probably don't want to wash your nostrils with their nasal flushings, but for typical spreading situations, we don't know. It's not an unreasonable assumption that their likelihood of infecting others was dramatically lower than symptomatic people.

More broadly, it's easy to treat immunity as a binary concept - but at a biochemical level this isn't true.

Lets use that math: .05 (which is 1/20) * .18 (1.8%) = .009%

Everyone in my family except for my youngest was fully vaccinated in April.  Pfizer for my wife and I and Moderna for our daughter.  

We decided to go on an extremely overdue family visit and ended up getting exposed to an unvaccinated family member.  We got there on Sunday and the family member started showing symptoms on Tuesday and had a positive Covid test on Thursday.  By Saturday everyone in the house was symptomatic except me.

My youngest was sick with a fever, cough and headache for 2 days and then seemed fine.  He's the only one that's been tested since and he tested positive.  My daughter was coughing and lethargic for a week or so but never ran a fever.  My wife was miserable for a week and a half with migraines, hacking cough, chills and exhaustion but no fever.  I had no symptoms at all other than minor sniffles that could've just been allergies.  

We assumed at first that we must've gotten a summer cold of some kind since we thought that the vaccine would protect us.  Based on what I've read recently I'm pretty sure we were feeling the symptoms of Covid - just with milder symptoms than we would've had without the vaccine.

It likely will be the same for the vaccinated (against SARS-COV-2) population. Vaccine provides the SAR-CoV-2 specific memory t-cells and b-cells that will prevent the virus from getting into the lungs. The vaccinated might be infected but likely won't be hospitalized. Most of the cases will likely be asymptomatic or mild (maybe a little bit for severe than with the 4 human corona-viruses)

Based exclusively on this article

&gt; In hospitals around the country, 97% of people admitted with Covid symptoms are unvaccinated, and 99.5% of all Covid deaths are also among the unvaccinated.

From the WHO website

&gt; Vaccination protects you from getting seriously ill and dying from COVID-19. For the first fourteen days after getting a vaccination, you do not have significant levels of protection, then it increases gradually. For a single dose vaccine, immunity will generally occur two weeks after vaccination. For two-dose vaccines, both doses are needed to achieve the highest level of **immunity possible.** 

---

&gt; I‚Äôm also hearing that studies show that the vaccines are highly effective against the Delta Variant.

The fact is nobody is 100% sure and if you read scientific sources they say vaccines are **""still""** effective, so yeah, the only defense right now against COVID is the vaccine.

‚Ä¶

&gt;**Garner,** who said he agrees with the science of vaccines, anticipated legal challenges but stands by the law. He **said it would take around a 30% mortality rate,** the historical rate associated with confluent smallpox, **before he‚Äôd consider supporting a mask mandate.** He said in this example, dramatic short-term measures were needed.

&gt;‚ÄúIf there was ever a time we needed to put a mask mandate back in place again, the legislature would have to be called to actually have the enforcement of the law to do that,‚Äù Garner said.

Yes this is consistent with what I said:  
  
&gt; &gt; To be specific your chances of hospitalization and death etc. are essentially cut in ~half if you're fully vaccinated **and manage to contract the disease**.

[],,Synonyms26,,,,,,[],"HCM CITY ‚Äî The HCM City Department of Health has changed from a four-level to five-level admission and treatment plan for COVID-19 patients.  
  
First-level treatment is for asymptomatic COVID-19 patients with no underlying medical conditions and no obesity. They are brought to quarantine facilities in districts where they are screened by local health officials to determine if they can spend quarantine at home.  
  
The number of patients in this category is estimated to account for nearly 50 per cent of the city‚Äôs total number of cases.    
  
At the second level, field hospitals are in charge of treating symptomatic patients with underlying medical conditions and providing emergency aid for those whose condition becomes worse before they are transferred to hospitals at the third level.    
  
The number of patients in this category is estimated to account for nearly 27 per cent of the total.  
  
At the third level, designated hospitals that have been changed into ones for COVID-19 treatment admit moderately and severely ill symptomatic patients. The number of patients in the category accounts for nearly 10 per cent.      
  
At the fourth level, hospitals such as the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and Ch·ª£ R·∫´y Hospital treat COVID patients with severe underlying medical conditions who need specialised medical intervention.  
  
These hospitals need high-end ICU ventilators and continuous hemofiltration machines. The number of patients at the hospitals accounts for nearly 8 per cent of the total.  
  
At the fifth level, the COVID-19 Patient Resuscitation Hospital with modern resuscitation equipment treats patients with life-threatening risks.      
  
Chairman of the People‚Äôs Committee Nguy·ªÖn Th√†nh Phong said the city needs 927 doctors and 4,137 nurses and technicians to treat COVID patients.     
  
It also needs 2,000 medical professionals who can conduct COVID-19 tests and give vaccines.  
  
Earlier, the Ministry of Health assigned 1,936 health staff from hospitals in H√† N·ªôi and other provinces to come to HCM City for assistance.  
  
Moreover, 1,601 lecturers and students at medical schools in the country have been assigned to assist the city.  
  
The ministry said that more than 2,000 ventilators, hemofiltration machines and oxygen generators, and more than 12 million masks have been provided to the warehouse at Ch·ª£ R·∫´y Hospital for COVID-19 prevention and control in the city and the southern region.  
  
Three extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machines have been provided to the city and ƒê·ªìng Nai Province.  
  
The ministry this week will provide 500 high-flow oxygen therapy systems and other kinds of medical equipment to the city and southern region.

The HCM City Urban Environment Company Limited (CITENCO) collects and treats all wastes from hospitals and quarantine facilities.   
  
Cao VƒÉn Tu·∫•n, head of its environmental technology and quality control department, said the daily medical waste output had increased to nearly 40 tonnes a day, including 12 tonnes from quarantine zones, since the outbreak, and the treatment capacity is 42 tonnes.  
  
If coronavirus-related waste continues to grow, it would lead to an overload at the treatment plant, according to Tu·∫•n.    
  
Besides having equipment prescribed for handling hazardous wastes, they also need to safeguard people handling the wastes.   
  
Wastes from locked-down areas are mainly collected by local authorities who spray them with disinfectants before sending to trash dumps.  
  
With social distancing in place the volume of goods packaged and delivered to consumers‚Äô homes and the use of plastic bags have increased exponentially.   
  
According to Nguy·ªÖn Gia Thanh, an online seller in T√¢n B√¨nh District, he has to use six kilogrammes of plastic bags a month for packaging now, twice the usual rate.   
  
Customers want goods to be covered with more plastic bags as a virus prevention measure.   
  
‚ÄúPlastic is the most economical solution for a hard situation despite its negative impact on the environment,‚Äù he said.  
  
Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn T·ªët, a garbage collector in H√≥c M√¥n District, said while normally plastic accounted for 50 per cent of the garbage, it had now increased to 60-65 per cent.   
  
Wastes are now mainly in landfills and plastic wastes, though increasing, are not being sorted, and this portends serious harm to the environment.  
  
More companies needed to treat COVID-related waste   
  
The HCM City Department of Natural Resources and Environment is seeking approval from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment to add more companies capable of receiving and treating COVID-19-related waste.  
  
Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Thanh M·ªπ, deputy director of the city department, said the list of added businesses included Vi·ªát √öc Environment JSC, M·ªôc An Ch√¢u Company, Saigon Green Biotechnology Company and T√¢m Sinh Nghƒ©a Investment Development JSC.  
  
These companies had invested in industrial waste and hazardous-waste incinerators, but they were still in the testing phase. But due to the growing coronavirus-related waste in the city, the department asked the ministry to approve the use of these companies' waste incinerators to treat waste related to Covid-19.  
  
CITENCO is currently the only company that receives and treats Covid-19 related waste in HCM City.  
  
According to CITENCO, the amount of garbage in quarantine areas and field hospitals is nearly 100 tonnes per day, exceeding its processing capacity.  
  
Hu·ª≥nh Minh Nh·ª±t, director of CITENCO, said the process of collecting and treating medical waste and waste from isolation areas was being carried out under strict safety standards, and garbage collection workers all wear protective gear.  
  
Medical waste is taken to ƒê√¥ng Th·∫°nh waste treatment zone in H√≥c M√¥n District where it undergoes chemical and thermal disinfection. After the trash is burned, the ash is solidified and buried in a location reserved for hazardous waste.  
  
Other waste, such as face masks and protective clothing, is treated separately according to regulations, while the rest can be sent to landfills to be treated by incineration and burial.

The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Science and Technology held a meeting on July 22 to review the outcomes of clinical trials of the vaccine, which is produced by Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology JSC based on recombinant DNA/protein technology.  
  
Based on the evaluation, the vaccine may be approved for emergency use.  
  
It went through the first phase trial from December 18, 2020, and the second phase from February 26, 2021. The third phase started on June 11, 2021.  
  
Results from the first two trial phases showed that all volunteers developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.  
  
At the meeting, a representative from Nanogen said more than 13,620 volunteers had been vaccinated with Nano Covax vaccine so far.  
  
The third and the final phase saw participation of 13,000 volunteers with 1,004 people getting two jabs.  
  
The company said it would continue to complete documents relating to the products and outcomes of the trials to submit to the Ministry of Health next week.  
  
Chairman of the Advisory Council for the Registration of Circulation of Drugs and Medicinal Ingredients Le Van Truyen said the council supported the research and development of homegrown vaccines but registration dossiers for approving vaccines in emergency situations must meet scientific and legal standards.  
  
Deputy Minister of Science and Technology Bui The Duy said under the current complex development of the pandemic, the ministry hoped health experts would evaluate outcomes of the clinical trials scientifically and create conditions to speed up research and production of the vaccine.  
  
Deputy Minister of Health Tran Van Thuan said the ministry supported and created conditions for Nanogen as well as other domestic companies and units to research and develop vaccines with the hope that Vietnam would soon be able to produce ‚ÄúMade in Vietnam‚Äù vaccines to help ensure vaccine supply for coronavirus control.  
  
Regarding licensing conditions, Thuan asked Nanogen to work with agencies to complete dossiers about the outcomes of the first and second phases of human trials and soon update results of the third phase.  
  
Based on the outcomes of trials and the opinions of domestic and foreign experts as well as the pandemic situation and vaccine demand, the Ministry of Health will study and consider the licensing of the Nano Covax vaccine for emergency use.  
  
Nano Covax is the most promising candidate among four domestic vaccines being developed by Vietnam. If approved, commercial production could start soon.  
  
The other vaccines are being developed by the Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals, the Vaccine and Biological Production Company No. 1, and the Center for Research and Production of Vaccines and Biologicals.  
  
Vietnam has so far approved six vaccines for emergency use, namely Janssen, Moderna, Sputnik V, Pfizer, Sinopharm and AstraZeneca.  
  
The Government is making efforts to secure at least 150 million vaccine doses to inoculate 70 percent of the population.  
  
As of July 23 morning, 4,411,659 doses of the vaccines, mainly AstraZeneca, have been administered in Vietnam, with 334,560 people having received the full two doses./.",,,,1627055238,{},h69e3ug,True,t3_oq54oz,False,False,t3_oq54oz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oq54oz/vietnam_may_approve_homegrown_nano_covax_vaccine/h69e3ug/,1627210262,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,,

ƒêam, head of the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control, said it was important to prevent the spread of the virus between HCM City and neighbouring provinces while ensuring circulation of goods in the region.  
  
He spoke on Thursday at an online meeting with the Government‚Äôs Special Working Group and representatives from six southern provinces (An Giang, Ki√™n Giang, H·∫≠u Giang, C√† Mau, B·∫°c Li√™u and S√≥c TrƒÉng).  
  
ƒêam stressed the role of organisations such as community COVID-19 groups that ‚Äúgo to every corner and every house, and check every person‚Äù to ensure that they have made health declarations.   
  
‚ÄúThose who fail to complete medical declarations or provide dishonest declarations must be strictly handled, including their family members,‚Äù he said.  
  
Provincial authorities would be held responsible for failing to control people arriving from HCM City or other provinces, and for people who don't submit health declarations.  
  
ƒêam also called for stricter prevention measures in locked-down areas to ensure that all residents of all ages practise social distancing to prevent cross-infection in the areas.  
  
HCM City late Friday afternoon announced that the city would extend the social distancing measures under the Government‚Äôs Directive 16 until August 1, but would apply even stricter measures in certain high-risk wards or districts in the city.  
  
Extensive testing  
  
Nguy·ªÖn Tr∆∞·ªùng S∆°n, deputy minister of Health, said the COVID-19 situation in the southern provinces was still under control with tracing, zoning and testing activities being carried out in accordance with the Health Ministry‚Äôs instructions.  
  
He urged the provinces to increase the number of RT-PCR tests in high-risk areas so that COVID-19 exposure sites could be cleared in the community. To speed up testing and discover positive cases more quickly, pooled samples from five to 10 people should be taken.  
  
S∆°n said the ministry would ensure supply of medical equipment and biological products for testing.  
  
‚ÄúProvinces need to set up a centralised oxygen system to ensure enough oxygen and high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), and enhance training for medical staff to be ready for the increasing number of infections, and to limit the number of deaths,‚Äù he said.  
  
The primary COVID-19 treatment facilities in the provinces need to monitor and evaluate the condition of patients regularly and transfer patients with serious symptoms as soon as possible to higher-level hospitals.  
  
L√™ Qu·ªëc H√πng, deputy minister of Public Security, urged the provinces to work with police forces to strengthen tracing of all F1 cases (close contacts of infected patients) to reduce the risk of community infections.  
  
Tr·∫ßn Thanh Nam, deputy minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, said: ‚ÄúProvinces need to set up working groups to connect with businesses to remove difficulties in selling farmers' agricultural products.‚Äù  
  
ƒê·ªó Th·∫Øng H·∫£i, deputy Minister of Industry and Trade, noted that traditional markets under Directive 16 could remain open, but they must meet strict prevention measures.  
  
The six southern provinces were asked to be fully prepared to support HCM City, the epicentre of the latest outbreak, and other provinces, as directed by the Ministry of Health.  
  
Facilities that treat severe and critical COVID cases must be equipped with medical oxygen supply systems, medical devices and medicines to prevent development of more serious symptoms and reduce the risk of death.  
  
Smooth transport of goods   
  
Deputy Prime Minister V≈© ƒê·ª©c ƒêam stressed that only trucks with essential goods were allowed to move during the lockdown period under Directive 16.  
  
ƒêam asked the provinces to provide favourable conditions for truck drivers to get tested and ensure smooth movement between localities.  
  
Local authorities were asked to strictly oversee businesses that transport goods and conduct quick tests or RT-PCR tests for truck drivers and their helpers.  
  
In 19 southern cities and provinces under Directive 16, trucks are required to carry logos and QR codes that allow access to their medical declarations before they are permitted to enter or leave hotspot areas.  
  
In the manufacturing sector, local authorities have been told to strengthen preventive measures at industrial parks. Businesses and manufacturers must strictly comply with COVID-19 prevention and control criteria and manage workers‚Äô movement from their workplaces to their accommodations to limit their number of contacts.‚Äî VNS",,,,1627055190,{},h69dzra,True,t3_oq543r,False,True,t3_oq543r,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oq543r/vietnam_deputy_pm_tells_southern_provinces_to/h69dzra/,1627210206,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,,

I'm actually quite good at math.  Not sure why you felt the need to lead with an insult but whatever.

&gt;Let‚Äôs say that there will be 25,000 people there in some form or another involved in putting it on.

Goal post move.  The above poster clearly said athletes.  My statement about there being no deaths used the word athlete.

Sure, some 80 year old overweight IOC big wig contracted it and dying?  Yeah, I see that as a possibility.  I don't know how many 60+ unvaccinated coaches are running around.  I'm not speaking to that, though.

I'm also going to say that the Paraolympics is also out of scope.  Mostly because I haven't seen the vaccination numbers for them, but also because I don't really know the scope of potential high risk factors.  The article is also only about the Olympics.

&gt;The next issue will be the number of unvaccinated.

About 2000 Olympic athletes.  

&gt;On top of that there will be the issue of multiple strains with the potential of a new strain emerging. 

A new variant could pop up at anytime.  We have had, what, 4 total variants of concern?  And that's from hundreds of millions of cases. Even with 50k people congregating, it's a rounding error in the risk of new variants.

&gt;If we estimate vaccinations at 2/3rds,

I told you the number. If you don't believe me, Google it first before estimating.  If I do ""80 olympics vaccination,"" the 2nd link is for all the athletes (1st is a version of this article with just the US).

&gt;of which we are looking 6-10 athlete deaths.

So using your (incorrect) 3600 unvaccinated athletes, that's an IFR of 0.167% to 0.278%.  Or rather, 1 in 600 to 1 in 360.

Those numbers are FAR too high for the age range in question.  Even without considering that high risk factors will be at lower rates than the general population.

There's a lot of ways to skin the IFR cat.  [I like this chart](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html).  If your IFR numbers were accurate, 85+ would have between a 25% and 100% chance of dying.  We know that's not true. You're off by at least a factor of 10, but most likely more like 100 or more.

&gt;I would argue that it would be a miracle if athletes didn‚Äôt die

Even then, there's a contingent of people, especially on this sub, who appear to want symptom free people (everyone, I guess) to get tested regularly. So with the middle ground, it still feels as though there's a large group focused only on positive case #'s and no other metric, and that metric will likely never be in a range that they find acceptable. Not for a significant period of time, anyway. 

There are billions of unvaccinated people in the world and things are going to be that way for years. I just don't see how this middle ground, which is just as, if not *more* fabled than COVID zero, is sustainable for as long as it will take to make a meaningful impact. And that impact will likely be the result of things that would have happened anyway because there's just too many hosts to go around. 

I think its important to emphasize that unvaccinated people should mask up and that in areas with high positive case counts, people should use extra caution. This is something my family and I do anyway, our two children under twelve continue to wear masks and we're in a highly vaccinated state. 

Would I throw caution to the wind and go on a vacation to Florida? Disney World? 

Hell no. That's the economic impact those places are going to feel at some point by having so many people running around unvaccinated. The states that will likely reinstate mandates are the states that need them the least, so it does send this message that things will never end, even with vaccinations. 

That's my two cents, and I hope none of this , I get that people want certainty and some kind of mandatory precautions but the fact is that there's just too many people in the world that won't be vaccinated for a long time. For those that want to get their shot, we should do whatever it takes to get it to them wherever they are.

Background  
There is growing concern about possible cognitive consequences of COVID-19, with reports of ‚ÄòLong COVID‚Äô symptoms persisting into the chronic phase and case studies revealing neurological problems in severely affected patients. However, there is little information regarding the nature and broader prevalence of cognitive problems post-infection or across the full spread of disease severity.

  
Methods  
We sought to confirm whether there was an association between cross-sectional cognitive performance data from 81,337 participants who between January and December 2020 undertook a clinically validated web-optimized assessment as part of the Great British Intelligence Test, and questionnaire items capturing self-report of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 infection and respiratory symptoms.

  
Findings  
People who had recovered from COVID-19, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits versus controls when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group, pre-existing medical disorders, tiredness, depression and anxiety. The deficits were of substantial effect size for people who had been hospitalised (N = 192), but also for non-hospitalised cases who had biological confirmation of COVID-19 infection (N = 326). Analysing markers of premorbid intelligence did not support these differences being present prior to infection. Finer grained analysis of performance across sub-tests supported the hypothesis that COVID-19 has a multi-domain impact on human cognition.

  
Interpretation  
Interpretation. These results accord with reports of ‚ÄòLong Covid‚Äô cognitive symptoms that persist into the early-chronic phase. They should act as a clarion call for further research with longitudinal and neuroimaging cohorts to plot recovery trajectories and identify the biological basis of cognitive deficits in SARS-COV-2 survivors.

This is a big part of it...where's the endpoint?  Not being cynical, simply realistic in believing that among the anti-vaxx crowd, many are more likely to at least be exposed to Covid at some point than ever get the vaccine.  In the meantime, following restrictive measures may provide you (and those close to you) with an extra layer of protection, but it isn't going to halt the spread.  Children under 12 are quite low risk.  Vaccinated individuals are still generally low risk (and everyone has to make the choice now about what risk they will take).  Unvaccinated people have to protect themselves.  

Bottom line (and I could be wrong): that ""larger portion of the population"" isn't going to get vaccinated.  If you wish to be extra cautious until this wave subsides (whenever that may be), no one is stopping you.  But don't hold your breath waiting for a sizeable chunk of the currently unvaccinated to ""see the light"" all of a sudden.",,,,1627059831,{},h69ox69,False,t3_opzzsu,False,False,t1_h68wex9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/opzzsu/as_americans_navigate_conflicting_covid19_mask/h69ox69/,1627215749,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_xp442,False,False,,

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

Of the domestic cases, 13 were reported in New Taipei, four each in Taipei and in Taoyuan, and one each in Yilan and Kaohsiung, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).

Only five of the patients had no apparent link to previously confirmed COVID-19 cases, and Taiwan has seen such cases remain in single digits for a week, indicating that the situation is under control, said CECC chief, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (Èô≥ÊôÇ‰∏≠) at a daily press briefing.

He said the current Level 3 restrictions will be relaxed to allow the reopening of more businesses and venues that have been ordered to close since COVID-19 cases began surging in mid-May, as well as gatherings of as many as 50 people indoors and 100 outdoors.

Under the current Level 3 alert, part of a four-tier system, gatherings of more than four people indoors and nine outdoors have been banned, schools and entertainment venues have been closed, and in-person dining in restaurants has been prohibited.

The CECC eased some of those restrictions on July 13, allowing libraries, movie theaters, and gyms to reopen and restaurants to serve customers on-site.

But some of the businesses have remained closed, and local governments rejected the CECC's guidance on in-person dining for fear it could lead to the spread of the disease.

""Despite some easing of restrictions, existing border controls will remain in place, Chen said, though consideration is being given to loosening quarantine requirements for people entering Taiwan from abroad who have received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.""

The new cases reported Friday bring the total in the country to 15,535, of which 14,064 are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 COVID-19 cases in a single day.

The one imported case was a Croatian boy under 10, who traveled to Taiwan from Switzerland on June 28 and tested positive for the disease on Friday, the CECC said.

Meanwhile, two deaths were reported, a man in his 60s and a woman in her 80s, according to the CECC.
To date, 784 people have died of COVID-19 in Taiwan, including 772 since May 15.

In our peak in January, **when no one had vaccines**, there were 250k cases per day and 3k deaths. 

So even if you keep that ratio the same, that would mean 60k cases would lead to 750 deaths per day. 

But that doesn't take into account the abundance of data that the vaccines are **extremely effective against preventing death**. 

It also doesn't take into account that a lot of the people getting sick and dying now are unvaccinated. The pool of those who don't have a vaccine and also have not yet had covid or antibodies is going to get smaller and smaller over time. 

4k deaths per day is batshit crazy conspiracy level propaganda bullshit. 850 per day is also too high. It will probably be closer to 400-500 at the absolute peak.

True, but especially with a disease like Covid, which takes it's time before it kills an infected person.

With something as terrifying as Spanish Flu, a person could wake up feeling fine, feel sniffly by lunch time, and suffocate in their own fluids by midnight or die of multiple organ failure a few days later.

The vaccine has only been widely available in the US since April, 3 months before the Olympics which I would expect they're training hard for.  2 weeks or more missed training could set you back especially in events that are won or lost in tenths or hundreds of a second.

Background  
The COVID-19 pandemic priorities have focused on prevention, detection, and response. Beyond morbidity and mortality, pandemics carry secondary impacts, such as children orphaned or bereft of their caregivers. Such children often face adverse consequences, including poverty, abuse, and institutionalisation. We provide estimates for the magnitude of this problem resulting from COVID-19 and describe the need for resource allocation.  
Methods  
We used mortality and fertility data to model minimum estimates and rates of COVID-19-associated deaths of primary or secondary caregivers for children younger than 18 years in 21 countries. We considered parents and custodial grandparents as primary caregivers, and co-residing grandparents or older kin (aged 60‚Äì84 years) as secondary caregivers. To avoid overcounting, we adjusted for possible clustering of deaths using an estimated secondary attack rate and age-specific infection‚Äìfatality ratios for SARS-CoV-2. We used these estimates to model global extrapolations for the number of children who have experienced COVID-19-associated deaths of primary and secondary caregivers.  
Findings  
Globally, from March 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021, we estimate 1‚Äâ134‚Äâ000 children (95% credible interval 884‚Äâ000‚Äì1‚Äâ185‚Äâ000) experienced the death of primary caregivers, including at least one parent or custodial grandparent. 1‚Äâ562‚Äâ000 children (1‚Äâ299‚Äâ000‚Äì1‚Äâ683‚Äâ000) experienced the death of at least one primary or secondary caregiver. Countries in our study set with primary caregiver death rates of at least one per 1000 children included Peru (10¬∑2 per 1000 children), South Africa (5¬∑1), Mexico (3¬∑5), Brazil (2¬∑4), Colombia (2¬∑3), Iran (1¬∑7), the USA (1¬∑5), Argentina (1¬∑1), and Russia (1¬∑0). Numbers of children orphaned exceeded numbers of deaths among those aged 15‚Äì50 years. Between two and five times more children had deceased fathers than deceased mothers.  
Interpretation  
Orphanhood and caregiver deaths are a hidden pandemic resulting from COVID-19-associated deaths. Accelerating equitable vaccine delivery is key to prevention. Psychosocial and economic support can help families to nurture children bereft of caregivers and help to ensure that institutionalisation is avoided. These data show the need for an additional pillar of our response: prevent, detect, respond, and care for children.

The vast majority of people here have tied their political beliefs to their everyday life. We will have ""Trump shops"" as a prime example. 

The state government didn't fuck anything up. Fucking something up implies they tried to something, they didn't.

For instance, the 2009 Swine Flu came about when pigs infected with a pig flu and human capable flu virus mingled with birds infected with bird flu viruses and swapped genes to form a new strain that could easily infect humans. Luckily that strain wasn't any more serious than the regular flu strains already in circulation among humans.

However, when something similar happened in 1918, up to 5% of the human population was killed by the ensuing pandemic... Granted, the lack of modern medication and technology didn't help.

&amp;#x200B;

Coronaviruses are generally more stable, but since they do occur in many other mammal species, particularly bats, that we know of, there is still the potential for new genes to be picked up if a person or other animal is coinfected with both Covid-19, and a similar enough animal coronavirus.

&amp;#x200B;

That's one theory for how this Coronavirus popped up actually, a wild or domesticated animal/ livestock was infected with one of their coronaviruses and came into contact with another species with a similar enough other coronavirus, then came into contact with a human who had one of the 4 ""common cold"" causing species of coronavirus, which swapped some genes and then reassorted into an entirely new hybrid that no one was prepared for.",,,,1627054717,{},h69cvxk,False,t3_opqmx9,False,False,t1_h69bipr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/opqmx9/delta_variant_is_one_of_the_most_infectious/h69cvxk/,1627209673,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_epakr,False,True,,

I'm (like others, my feelings are not unique) so disgusted and angry with our government on every level and the American people. The time to let people make their own decisions has come and gone. We have the ability to slow this thing down and make it less deadly and people are deliberately choosing not to, making the world more dangerous and uncertain for everyone else who busted their ass to follow CDC guidelines, wear the masks, and then get vaccinated when eligible. I feel like I'm living a Twilight Zone world. I can't go back to work because YOU are choosing not to get vaccinated. I have to continue working from home and struggle every day with the isolation that comes with that. I have to live with ongoing anxiety about the future of our world and country because YOU simply REFUSE to get vaccinated.

Get the FDA approval. Start mandating the vaccine everywhere you can. Make people show vaccine cards (or a very strict justification exemption) if they want to get a manicure or haircut or go to a restaurant or travel. I generally do not want lots of government regulations. I understand what a slippery slope it can be and we need to protect personal freedom and choice. But this is beyond absurd at this point.

I'm sorry, there's nothing in my post that's new or useful. Just me being burnt out, exhausted from chronic anxiety, and tired of doing all the right things are still suffering because of others' decisions.

‚Äê‚Äê----
 I included 3 links that explain what vaccine efficacy means at the end of this comment.

 If the definition of a case is symptomatic infection, then vaccine efficacy against symptomatic infection during a given follow-up period is (1- relative risk). To get relative risk you first get the risk for each group and divide them ((# cases in vaccinated group / # of people in vaccinated group)/(# of cases in unvaccinated group/# of people in the unvaccinated group)).

So if during a 6 month follow up 5 out of 10,000 people in the vaccinated group have a symptomatic infection and 100 out of 10,000 in an unvaccinated group have a symptomatic infection, the vaccine efficacy is (1-((5/10,000)/(100/10,000))  = 95%. You would get the same answer even if the total number of people in each both group went up to a million, if the number of cases stayed the same. 

So it is incorrect to say that if the vaccine efficacy is 95%  during a 6 month follow-up, that of 10,000 people, about 5% will have a symptomatic infection.

 The CDC explains that ""Vaccine efficacy/effectiveness is interpreted as the proportionate reduction in disease among the vaccinated group. So a VE of 90% indicates a 90% reduction in disease occurrence among the vaccinated group, or a 90% reduction from the number of cases you would expect if they have not been vaccinated.""


Also, we have no idea how many people were exposed to the virus in each group or how long the exposure lasted. We just assumed that because this is a randomized controlled trial, people in each group will experience similar exposures.

Side-effect:  others around me are protected too.

I trust the vaccines I took (doubled down because I‚Äôm in a high risk area) to protect me against hospitalization and serious illness, maybe against long-term COVID-19.  Wearing an N95 mask while around others reduces my probability of catching it.

I don‚Äôt understand why people make such a big deal about wearing a mask.  I‚Äôll take a little inconvenience over illness for me or others.  Mask mandate or not it makes sense to wear one in high risk areas.

I‚Äôm on holiday and will be flying back to the UK today so I needed to do an online COVID test with a doctor to be able to fly home (it was a ridiculously expensive service). The only problem was, in the test kit provided, the tube with the liquid in which is used for testing had a crack in it and there was insufficient liquid to complete the test.

My first idea on how to resolve the issue was to get a new test kit from the local pharmacy. But, this company would only let me use their test kit which I only had one of. So, my only choice was to either fake the test or miss my flight home. I chose the former option and it turned out to be scarily easy to do.

I just filled the test tube with water and carried out the test as normal with the doctor online. When I had been completed the test I was instructed to just take a picture of the result and write some other details (like the date and some sort of code) on the test strip and then email it to them. Because I‚Äôd obviously just poured a mix of water and the stuff from my nostrils onto the test strip, the test strip was just blank after 15 minutes. So, I simply just took a photograph of it and drew a red line on it using photoshop and emailed it to them and got away with falsifying the test to avoid missing my flight.

To clear my conscience and make sure that I didn‚Äôt have COVID, I then did the test again using a kit from the local pharmacy (which I wasn‚Äôt allowed to use to provide evidence to the company presumably because the test strip doesn‚Äôt have a QR code on).

The rate of transmission is measured with the R0 number, which is the number of people that one person with a virus can infect on average.

The original Covid-19 out of Wuhan in the early days of the pandemic had an R0 of around 2.7, which is double that of seasonal flu which has an R0 of 1.3

The 1918 Spanish Flu is estimated to have had an R0 between 2.0 and 3.0, which is in line with the original variants of Covid-19.

The 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu, R0 of around 1.9

[The Delta Variant that's spreading right now has an estimated R0 of 6](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2021/07/13/the-delta-dilemma-loosening-covid-19-controls-at-a-time-of-increased-danger/?sh=43e0c60a2750)

To put that into perspective, that's around the same level of transmissibility that Smallpox had way back in the 1970s and earlier when it was still ravaging the earth unchecked

There are of course other more infectious diseases with a higher R0 out there, like Polio at 10-12, and Measles at 12-18, but those have had effective vaccines for decades now and are generally easily preventable/ treatable in developed countries

CLAIM: No virus has ever mutated to become more lethal. As viruses mutate, they become less lethal.

AP ASSESSMENT: False. There are documented cases of viruses becoming more deadly.

THE FACTS: As the spread of coronavirus variants raise new public health questions, social media users are sharing misinformation about how viruses mutate.

A post on Facebook reads, ‚ÄúIn the history of virology, there has never, EVER, been a viral mutation that resulted in a virus that was MORE lethal. As viruses mutate, they become more contagious/transmissible and LESS lethal.‚Äù

But in fact, there have been cases of viruses that mutated to become more deadly.

‚ÄúThat claim as a whole is just nonsense,‚Äù said Troy Day, a professor of mathematics and biology at Queen‚Äôs University in Canada, who has studied the ways infectious diseases, including coronavirus, can evolve.

Some examples of viruses that became more deadly over time include those that developed drug resistant variants, and animal viruses such as bird flu, which were harmless to humans initially but then mutated to become capable of killing people, according to Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University‚Äôs Center for Health Security.

‚ÄúFlu viruses have developed resistance to certain antivirals that make them more difficult to treat, and therefore make them more deadly,‚Äù Adalja said, also noting the same has happened with HIV and certain Hepatitis C strains.

Viruses constantly mutate as they copy themselves. Some mutations may not make meaningful changes, while others can give the virus new characteristics. While early scientific theories suggested that as viruses evolved, they would become more contagious and less lethal to keep spreading, over time the scientific community has acknowledged that‚Äôs not always the case.",,,,1627048385,{},h68ymck,False,t3_opi0kj,False,True,t1_h68y2b5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/opi0kj/amid_rising_cases_the_cdc_director_warns_the_us/h68ymck/,1627202658,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5rqozpe5,False,True,,
