[],,wolfcaroling,,,,,,[],"That‚Äôs not true. 

Kids have shitty immune systems but they don‚Äôt usually go to the hospital for Covid. 

The problem is ‚Äúinflammaging‚Äù. 

Hospitalization for Covid is usually a result of an over enthusiastic immune reaction, called cytokine release syndrome, which people become increasingly likely to have as they age. 

Kids don‚Äôt have the world‚Äôs strongest immune systems but as long as their immune system is reasonably functional they can fight off covid. 

Unlike Dad or great uncle Joe whose systems are TOO experienced. 

Basically, the body calls out the cavalry and they all come pouring out and start stabbing everything on sight. It‚Äôs very ineffective so it‚Äôs a kind of charge of the light brigade and does more harm than good. 

Hence ‚Äúcomplications related to covid‚Äù - aka ‚Äútheir body tried so hard to kill covid it killed itself by mistake‚Äù 

Kids and young peoples‚Äô immune systems aren‚Äôt powerful enough to do that so they are less likely to end up in hospital. 

But. 

If you use a vaccine to train those powerful immune systems properly, give them the blueprints to covid, show the body how it works and let it strategize, teach it to recognize covid and how to fight it properly, many of those same people who would have died from cytokine syndrome instead can mount a good immune response.

These are the people who need the vaccine the most - and there‚Äôs no real for-sure way to know whether your body is going to do the cytokine thing until you get covid, so that‚Äôs how you end up on r/HermanCainawards


THEN there are people who just have crappy immune systems.  If you give them the vaccine the body can‚Äôt do anything with it. Can‚Äôt fight without an army. 

 So the vaccine doesn‚Äôt help and they end up in hospital anyway. 

(Which is why masking and social distancing around granny still needs to be a thing)

They probably would have died anyway - not much you can do about an old and disordered immune system.  A nasty flu or pneumonia would have done the same thing to them perhaps. 

The people that the vaccine really save are the ones who could fight off a flu or a cold no problem, but then fight themselves to death when they get covid.

[],,Garbarrage,,,,,,[],"If you dismiss their concerns, you actually feed them.

They're right in that there are no long term studies. Francis Collins said this on Lex Friedman's podcast recently. He also said that even though the chances of long term adverse effects are **not zero**, there have been no long term adverse effects from similar vaccines, so there's no reason to believe these will be any different. So given the benefits, it's worth the outside risk.

Their echo chambers are filled with anecdotal stories of adverse effects. Some of them serious. While some are fake, I've seen quite a few which are credible. This doesn't mean the vaccines are not safe compared to Covid, or even that they're less safe than other medicine, without actual data, but dismissing the concerns will only convince them that there's a cover up.

There was a recent study on mice (or rats. Can't remember off hand) that showed intravenous injection of concentrated vaccine caused Myo/pericarditis and blood clotting. The only way to guarantee that an intramuscular injection hasn't inadvertently hit a blood vessel is to aspirate the syringe before injection. This may explain why blood clotting and heart inflammation is more common in young men after vaccination. Bigger, more developed deltoid muscles = more blood vessels = more chance of hitting one. It hasn't been well studied, but seems to be worth looking into. It is however the policy of many national health services to *not* aspirate before injection. Denmark in fact recently changed this policy, but not many others have followed suit.

These are just some of the concerns I've come across arguing with anti-vax, conspiracy theorist friends. I've actually convinced a few to get vaccinated. I did this by listening and researching and presenting reasoned responses. To be fair, it took a lot of patience and more time than I would have liked.

According to the article: 

&gt;The new rule will apply to COVID-19 patients who are eligible for vaccination but choose not to do so. ...   
&gt;  
&gt;COVID-19 patients who are unvaccinated by choice **may still tap on regular healthcare financing arrangements to pay for their bills** where applicable.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Singaporeans and permanent residents may access regular government subsidies and MediShield Life or the Integrated Shield Plan where applicable.** Long-term pass holders may use their usual financing arrangements, such as private insurance.  
&gt;  
&gt;People who are ineligible for vaccination, including children under 12 years old or medically ineligible patients, will still have their COVID-19 medical bills fully paid for by the Government, the Health Ministry added. (emphasis added)

The ""Integrated Shield Plan"" referred to in the article is a medical insurance plan that includes *both* public (i.e. MediShield Life) and private insurance. The public insurance component covers pre-existing conditions even if the private insurance component does not. Payments for MediShield Life, whether on its own or as part of an Integrated Shield Plan, are made through MediSave, which is a national medical savings scheme.

This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions. However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

There's another issue which is the tying-up of resources.  My wife works in our local hospital and their intensive care has been running at over 100% capacity almost constantly since the pandemic began.  At times it's been over 200% capacity.  The problem with this isn't just cost: the hospital can create new ITU beds by expanding into other areas including operating theatres (which is what they did), but they can't magic-up additional staff.  As a result, they've been taking nurses from completely unrelated specialisms and telling them ""You're an intensive care nurse now"".  People have died because they haven't been cared for properly - that's not a criticism of the staff who've been doing the best they can, it's just inevitable under the circumstances.

At the same time, they've been cancelling surgery because there isn't the capacity to care for patients afterwards, and in some cases because the operating theatres (and staff) have been seconded to intensive care.  Again, people have died because they didn't receive timely treatment.

Finally, people who would normally receive a bed in intensive care aren't getting one because of the limited capacity.  The unvaccinated Covid patient lying in an ITU bed for 18 days is blocking that resource from other patients who need it.  I look at my parents and their friends who are all getting older, and imagine how I'd feel to be told she won't get a bed after a heart attack because the ITU us full of unvaccinated younger patients with Covid.

I HATE the idea of refusing treatment to people - it goes entirely against my values and beliefs.  However, even I am starting to feel that people who actively refuse the free vaccination that the rest of the country is desperately persuading them to take perhaps shouldn't expect free treatment for the predictable consequences of that refusal.",,,,1636452837,{},hjx4i6f,False,t3_qprjem,False,False,t1_hjw9334,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qprjem/people_unvaccinated_by_choice_in_singapore_no/hjx4i6f/,1636716009.0,27,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_4gv9cfqt,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,saintlyknighted,,,,,,[],"As someone from Singapore, this is quite an interesting development. On one hand, it's a step in the right direction because the unvaccinated make up a disproportionate number of people in the hospital/ICU/morgue, so they're contributing to the strain on our (rather understaffed) healthcare system, which is _the_ big concern at the moment. Some people support this a lot because we're still under heavy social restrictions because of the healthcare strain despite having 85% total population vaccinated, and it's like getting back at the unvaccinated for getting us into this situation, even though the number is pretty small now. Some others also support this because they dislike their tax money being funnelled to treat people who refuse to vaccinate. And obviously free Covid treatment isn't gonna last forever, it has to end at some point.

On the other hand, Singapore has a comparatively low elderly vaccination rate, presumably because unlike other countries the elderly here do not see their compatriots dying en masse in a healthcare overload, so there isn't as much of a push factor for them to get jabbed. Despite all the government's efforts to get them vaccinated, quite a significant number still refuse to, whether it is the stubborn fear of side effects due to various health issues, distrust of Western medicine or the attitude of ""I'm ok with dying because I'm old"". Unfortunately this makes them convenient scapegoats especially to the younger generation who feel like they're being held back by stubborn boomers (and older). And now with these elderly needing to pay for treatment, more of them might decide to forgo testing/treatment altogether, and we might see more of them beginning to die at home, which never looks good no matter if they don't want to get jabbed.",,,,1636451610,{},hjx357p,False,t3_qprjem,False,False,t3_qprjem,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qprjem/people_unvaccinated_by_choice_in_singapore_no/hjx357p/,1636715298.0,19,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_ov3qf,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,Hessesieli,,,,,,[],"Living in Ukraine. This country is not incredibly poor per se, it can provide food and communications and electricity, and whatnot. Agriculture, mining, and chemical industries, and recently the IT sector provide the majority of the country's income (aside from taxes). The prices are much lower than in Europe. The majority of the population, on the other side, is really poor. The level of corruption is outrageous. Outside of large sites such as Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, etc, people are really struggling. Most of them make 100-200 dollars per month. The roads are broken and the budgeting for repairs is stolen long before reconstruction. Gov. healthcare is free, and the condition of any state clinics/hospitals is atrocious. And with Covid here, it has turned to worse, people don't have access to oxygen, some of them don't even have a place and are stationed in the corridors.  
And the cherry on top: the vaccination is free, but people are actively refusing it. 20% are vaccinated at best.  
The GDP is definitely much lower than it could be, but then again, these days, the country's budget goes to unknown purposes (read: being stolen), and the Donbas war crashed the economy quite a bit.

All in all, it is possible to live really good and to be able to afford basically anything you want (including private healthcare, buying cars, and apt/house) with an income of about $2-3k, which essentially puts you in like top 5-7% of the population. But that goes to the IT sector and to those who own a private business (then again, Covid almost killed small businesses recently).  
The government doesn't give a furry crack of the rat's behind about its people. That's why we live in shit.

[],,enigmaticowl,,,,,,,"10th Amendment... Congress‚Äô powers are limited to the handful of those specifically granted by the Constitution (and none mention public health), and all others are retained by the States.

Even though this is happening through OSHA, this mandate implicates Congress‚Äô authority because it was an act of Congress that created OSHA. Thus, OSHA‚Äôs actions must fall within the statutory scope of the act which established the agency, as well as the constitutional scope of Congress‚Äô authority to grant an agency any such powers in the first place.

Congress had the authority to create OSHA because of the commerce clause because they were able to satisfactorily show that the regulation of workplace safety standards was effectively legislation of interstate commerce and thus within their scope. The government will have to be able to make the same direct connection between ‚Äúinterstate commerce‚Äù and any given 100+ employee employer‚Äôs decision not to mandate vaccines/testing/masks for unvaccinated.

That‚Äôs just one of the issues here. There are also statutory issues based on the legislation behind OSHA and how/when a heath or safety issue is specifically a workplace/occupational issue or just a a health/safety risk generally which also follows employees into the workforce, and whether this is sufficient for OSHA to have authority here or not, and if so, whether this is so broad a grant of authority that it violates the nondelegation doctrine.",,,,1636488690,{},hjz7of5,False,t3_qpvx0c,False,True,t1_hjyvdbi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qpvx0c/white_house_tells_businesses_to_proceed_with/hjz7of5/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_v52u5,False,False,,False,f4ebc49b18da91bcb8a3613e2874934b6cbf8785,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1636488704.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

This is the gist of it though:

&gt;	The vaccine grew out of a four-year collaboration between Moderna and the N.I.H., the government‚Äôs biomedical research agency ‚Äî a partnership that was widely hailed when the shot was found to be highly effective. The government called it the ‚ÄúN.I.H.-Moderna Covid-19 vaccine‚Äù at the time.

&gt;The agency says three scientists at its Vaccine Research Center ‚Äî Dr. John R. Mascola, the center‚Äôs director; Dr. Barney S. Graham, who recently retired; and Dr. Kizzmekia S. Corbett, who is now at Harvard ‚Äî worked with Moderna scientists to invent the process that prompts the vaccine to produce an immune response, and should be named on the ‚Äúprincipal patent application.‚Äù

&gt;Moderna disagrees. In a July filing with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the company said it had ‚Äúreached the good-faith determination that these individuals did not co-invent‚Äù the component in question. Its application for the patent, which has not yet been issued, names several of its own employees as the sole inventors.

And naturally it‚Äôs about money. 

&gt;	The dispute is about much more than scientific accolades or ego. If the three agency scientists are named on the patent along with the Moderna employees, the federal government could have more of a say in which companies manufacture the vaccine, which in turn could influence which countries get access. It would also secure a nearly unfettered right to license the technology, which could bring millions into the federal treasury.",,,,1636487830,{},hjz5ioj,True,t3_qqbse3,False,True,t3_qqbse3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qqbse3/moderna_and_us_at_odds_over_vaccine_patent_rights/hjz5ioj/,1636758886.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_3yab6yfn,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

90% lower would mean there were actually 100,000 COVID deaths,

100% lower would mean there were actually 0 COVID deaths,

and 1600% lower would mean there were actually -15,000,000 COVID deaths, which is literally impossible.

Truveta, a Redmond startup that has pooled data from 20 American health systems from 42 states, released the new findings Tuesday morning. They are based on an analysis of 1.7 million vaccinated people living in the United States. The company is hoping its data set, which is updated daily, will offer a more comprehensive look at the health of Americans as a whole.

‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre going to study our country, we need data from our country,‚Äù said Terry Myerson, CEO of Truveta, who noted that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has leaned heavily on studies from Israel so far to issue guidance on booster shots.

The company found that 9% of both Pfizer and Moderna-vaccinated patients who suffer a breakthrough infection end up hospitalized. In contrast, the same figure is 15% for those who got the J&amp;J vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna‚Äôs vaccines are based on a technology called mRNA, whereas J&amp;J vaccines use a different and traditional technology called an adenovirus.

Truveta also found that people who have high-risk conditions such as cancer, organ transplants or HIV are twice as likely to end up hospitalized if they suffer a breakthrough infection.

Of all the high-risk conditions studied, the company found that people with chronic kidney disease were hospitalized with breakthrough infections at the highest rate at 25%.

There's no evidence of this, and you can read the WHO report yourself:

* 1st December 2019 - first symptomatic case, but nobody knew what it was (compare with American 'vaping' cases).

* 29th December - 4 identified cases of unknown disease in Wuhan, but not old SARS

* 31st December - 2 days later, China tells the WHO they have a new disease.

* 1st January 2020 - next day, China shuts down Wuhan seafood market, 

* 7th January - China identifies what Covid-19 is (sequencing), but nobody knows exactly how it spreads.  

* 11th January - FIRST death, with comorbidities.  

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7378494/

* 20th January - China confirms human transmission 

* 23rd January - China takes the unprecedented step of locking down an entire city (Wuhan). As cases grow, China expands the lockdown to multiple provinces. 

* 26th January - As cases grow into the 100s and appear across the country, China completes the unprecedented step of locking down the rest of the country of 1.4 Billion Chinese.  They literally shut down their entire economy for 2 months to stop a pandemic in its tracks.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_January_2020#26_January

China was transparent and shared what information they had, as they were able to obtain and confirm it.  It's not China's fault that the West was too busy gloating to actually pay attention until it came to them. 

As far as pace, they locked down the entire country within days of finding out that it was spreading rapidly and potentially lethal.

There‚Äôs an initial inflammatory stage, which often has a fever and difficulty breathing as part of the presentation. Some people get better after this, just like with other respiratory viruses. But some people end up with scarring in their lungs (fibrosis) as a consequence of the inflammation OR get a superimposed bacterial pneumonia. Either of these will cause worse oxygenation. Plus, the best treatment we have for severe COVID is dexamethasone, a steroid, which acts as an anti inflammatory but as such can suppress fevers. 

So it‚Äôs not uncommon for us to see an initial spike in illness (with fever) followed by a more prolonged respiratory process, characterized by decreased oxygenation. Some patients do get better from the second phase, although it‚Äôs a prolonged recovery (and we don‚Äôt really know how many people truly, fully recover).

Yes it does. There's an unlimited amount of issues and a limited number of resources. If X kills a few cops and Y kills 10-100x more cops and we want to minimize cop deaths, then X is relatively unimportant. 

&gt;We hear all the time how a cop is killed in the line of duty and there is a big response to it and there is all sorts of press about how we need to keep the cops safer

Well, I think heart disease and cancer are much more dangerous. Police have irregular working hours. Poor diet and sleep contribute heavily, as do higher levels of stress potentially. 

&gt;So by your logic the number of cops killed every year by gun fire is like .005%. I guess then we should stop caring about it like you want us to stop caring about Covid killing cops.

You are correct, it isn't a major issue to which a significant amount of resources should be dedicated to it.  Assuming that the % you quoted is accurate. 

&gt;I guess then we should stop caring about it like you want us to stop caring about Covid killing cops.

Correct. 

&gt;If they don‚Äôt want to get the vaccine then why not wear a mask. They refuse to do both.

It's almost as if they are adults who are making poor decisions you don't agree with. Then, they are also paying for those decisions. How horrible. 

&gt;Their family‚Äôs get a big payout if a cop is killed in the line of duty. I really hope they don‚Äôt get a payout if they die from Covid they contracted while on the job.

A large cull could be a benefit to the general environment in many areas though.  Deer are way overpopulated east of the Mississippi because we killed off most of their predators and deforested to a level they prefer.

When something did break through, they brought massive (PCR) testing and tracing to bear, to rapidly identify and isolate all infected individuals before a major outbreak occurred.  This is why 89 cases is a ""large"" daily number for China.  

With Delta, this is harder because the transmission rate is so high. It spreads faster, so it takes more testing (10s of Millions of tests) and more time (~1 month).  Nevertheless, China has contained at least a dozen Delta outbreaks so far.  

Because China has successful experience stopping outbreaks before they spread widely, they will continue to do so.

These are also not the only available schemes and subsidies available.

One example is [MediFund](https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/medifund), which is an endowment fund that provides for patients facing financial difficulties. There are also other existing subsidies schemes in place for services and medication at public healthcare institutions, such as public hospitals and specialist outpatient clinics (see [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/subsidies-for-services-and-drugs-at-public-healthcare-settings)).

Thank your for the reference!  That led me to this transcript. Emphasis mine...

&amp;#x200B;

EZRA KLEIN: This is, in some ways, my big question, because I think that how it falls really says a lot about what we‚Äôre targeting in policy. **If I am vaccinated, fully vaccinated, and I get Delta, how do my outcomes compare to getting the seasonal flu?**  
  
CELINE GOUNDER: A lot of people have compared Covid to the flu. And to be very clear, Covid is not the flu. But **through vaccination, we could turn Covid into something like the flu, where yeah, you might get a bit sick, you might not feel well enough to go to work or to school, might feel sort of achy and nauseous, and have a bit of a fever, have the sniffles, but you don‚Äôt end up in the hospital**. And through vaccination, we could turn Covid into something like the flu.  
  
EZRA KLEIN: So there‚Äôs this leaked CDC document that The Washington Post got. And this was the document that was behind the change in their masking guidance. It then got out. And it‚Äôs terrifying in a lot of ways. But on page three, they have this set of charts, and they‚Äôre comparing, based on the data they have, outcomes for infection, for hospitalization, for death among the unvaccinated and the vaccinated. And the point of these charts is that you‚Äôre eightfold less likely to get the virus if you‚Äôre vaccinated. And then you‚Äôre 25-fold less likely to be hospitalized or to die.  
**So you‚Äôre getting to fatality levels here that are beneath that of the flu.** The seasonal flu is about 0.1% in terms of how many people it kills. So if that number holds, and I recognize these can all change, that means for the vaccinated, coronavirus is now at a risk level, it seems, comparable to other things that we simply live with, like the flu.  
CELINE GOUNDER: **If anything, your risk of death, if you are a vaccinated person who gets Covid, is much lower than somebody who gets the flu**, but who‚Äôs one of these people who doesn‚Äôt get a yearly flu shot..................

No, the covid vaccines are actually better than expected. Waning of antibodies always was expected, specially for respiratory infections, but B and T cells last and protect against severe infection except the immunocompromised. Its a new virus, theres no basic immunity in the population, different from other infections
First of all local immune system in mucous membrane is waning the quickest, around 3 months, after that you arent sterile immune, then the antibodies, but cells last. You actually dont want antibodies of every infection your body ever encountered swarming in your bloodstream.

The fact this fool got rid of our national pandemic team during a pandemic... When my friend from Sweden heard he got elected he called me so excited and I asked why? He said I just won a bet the American people would elect an orangutan to lead them. He said Europe is laughing. He made $500 because the other guy said there is no way Americans would vote for this man ha. 

I think there are two leaders, those that do what is necessary for the people knowing it is for their own good and those that do it for the power. Those that do was is necessary for a better outcome in the future may not look good short term to the people, many will hate them, but they would do it anyway probably well aware this would hurt their view. However, those there for the power like Trump will make themselves look good in the short term only to advance themselves. All the while, not caring about the long term outcomes of their actions.

A leader that locked this country down hard to save lives would be hated upon by many, yet some of those same people may have lost their lives otherwise. The long term outcome also being the giant economic burden of all those that survived but can't work and need disability. How much will that cost the country? Many revere Trump for what he did for the economy but none of them are thinking of the future problems this created. These problems will then be blamed on later presidents too. A good leader I believe would rather be hated and know they saved lives than loved and live with the blood in their hands. 

Our political system is flawed in that people only care to advance their party instead of thinking of the long term advancement of the people. Our infastructure in this country is failing according to many engineers, ex our Levees. However, whatever president that takes those problem on will be viewed as bad because it costs money. However, those that make themselves look good with short term outcomes are a big draw even though there are often long term costs that are much larger.

This was the pandemic in a nutshell. We had little like my brothers looking at gas prices and complaining while others suffered the loss of their loved ones...

[],,cdegallo,,,,,,[],"&gt;but I‚Äôve never seen the requirements for a one off social event

Many cities started requiring proof of covid-19 vaccination for things like indoor dining, bars, etc.  I would consider all of those one-off events.

I think it's perfectly okay to have extenuating requirements for extenuating circumstances, like a virus that spreads so easily indoors with severe potential health consequences.

&gt;so is there also a timeframe on that? Shouldn‚Äôt the requirement be recent vaccination for many age groups? If you can prove you already have antibodies, then do you really need the vaccine? Someone with a prior infection who had good vaccine development could easily have better protection than an older vaccinated person who doesn‚Äôt develop protection as well.

Slippery slope fallacy.  Practical limit vs theoretical best; the things that can be done within practical limit not achieving the theoretical best doesn't invalidate the worth of the practical limit. Nothing you mentioned is incorrect, but the practical best is verifying vaccination status for now.  We have information that shows an overwhelming reduction in risk from being vaccinated.  It's not zero and it's never going to be zero and nothing we measure in addition will guarantee zero so it's a balance of diminishing returns.

And as things have already evolved re. full FDA authorization for the initial vaccination and passage of vaccine mandates, so will things change with as the boosters go through the same transition.  We already request period of boosters on existing vaccines for other diseases, no reason why the same can't be true for covid-19 with time.

&gt;If you can prove you already have antibodies, then do you really need the vaccine

Having active antibodies doesn't indicate strength of immune system response upon exposure, and it's been demonstrated for many months that the effectiveness of the vaccine upon exposure to the virus to trigger an adequate immune response is high, even out to 6 months.

&gt;but I also think the arbitrariness and broadness of these rules makes them ridiculous at times.

Requiring that people who engage in various activities that are known to have elevated risk of spreading the virus to show the status of something that is known to reduce the risk of spreading it is not arbitrary.",,,,1636473026,{},hjy4aee,False,t3_qpy64h,False,False,t1_hjxh7zq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qpy64h/san_francisco_will_require_children_5_to_11_to/hjy4aee/,1636736796.0,5,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_h0n50,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,PedroDaGr8,#46d160,,02cc5c36-ae80-11eb-a76b-0e911ea99c5d,I'm fully vaccinated! üíâüí™ü©π,light,[],"I know you have gotten a lot of answers but I will give you a short answer and a longer answer (which includes a bit deeper dive into the science behind it, you don't have to read it if you don't want to).

**The short answer:** The virus (even within the variants) has not mutated enough to evade the antibodies or cellular immunity produced by the vaccine.


**The long answer:** You are correct that the mRNA needs the genes from the virus. It doesn't need all of the genes of the virus though, it just needs the genes for a portion of the protein which the virus uses to invade cells. This portion of the genes is called the Binding Domain (BD) and is very specific to both the species of animal and the particular cells the virus infects. The BD is of particular interest because blocking the BD prevents the virus from binding to its target receptor which in turn prevents it from infecting a cell. This is in essence how the vaccines block infection. 

The fact that the BD is very specific to both the species of animal and the particular cells the virus infects is both a blessing and a curse for the virus. It is a blessing because it enables the virus to become EXTREMELY efficient at infecting a particular type of cell. It is a curse because it provides structural limits on how much the ""shape"" of the BD can change before it dramatically impacts its ability to infect the target cells. As such, the virus can't just wildly evolve to take on any shape it wants and still cause an infection, it has to play within the chemical/physical realm of the receptor which the BD targets. Not just that, but it has to be a protein structure which is relatively easy for our own cells to make. It is hypothesizes that one of the ways that Delta evolved to produces higher viral loads is that one of the mutations makes the protein easier for our cells to synthesize, increasing the number of virus particles a cell can make. 

Now we get to your question. Because the virus has to operate within these constraints, evolution can occur but the BD has to remain structurally similar to its previous versions. This means, in most cases, the antibodies are still going to bind pretty well to the BD. Furthermore, the immune system is always monitoring to see if it can improve the antibodies against a target. If there is a slight mismatch, the immune system will detect this and further refine the antibodies it is producing to target this mutated form. So far, we have not encountered a variant with sufficient enough mutations that it can significantly escape the antibodies produced by the vaccine. 


Now that I have answered your question, I will add a little bit more information about the immune response generated. Along with the antibody response, there is also the cellular immune response. The cellular immune response includes a number of different immunological pathways which not only enable one to maintain long-term immunity but also provide ""already trained"" immune cells which can ramp up at a moments notice to respond against future exposures to the virus. This latter set of ""already trained"" immune cells often determines ""how sick"" you get if a breakthrough infection occurs. Basically, an infection gets a foothold but these cells ramp up and wipe it out before it can do wide spread damage. In the case of our current vaccines, even though there has been some evidence of the antibody response waning, there is little sign of the cellular immune response waning (around 10% and mostly in the elderly).


In the long run, as the years wear on and we have all been exposed multiple times (with or without infection), our immune picture will likely evolve into the combination of an aggressive cellular immune response coupled with high levels of localized antibody production in the mucous membranes. This is very much analogous to a number of viruses which we are exposed to through childhood and/or are vaccinated against in childhood. By the time we are adults, our immune response mirrors the description I just described. If you drew our blood, you would see very few antibodies in our blood stream but a high number of them in the mucous membranes.",,,,1636478201,{},hjyh73q,False,t3_qpyw4z,False,False,t1_hjxlcz2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qpyw4z/daily_discussion_thread_november_09_2021/hjyh73q/,1636744660.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_a3anf,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Died ‚Äúof‚Äù COVID vs died ‚Äúwith‚Äù COVID has been a sticking point.

&gt;	Early in the pandemic, some of the answers provided by public officials ‚Äî who were scrambling to track the disease as it overwhelmed health systems ‚Äî fed skepticism. Last April, Deborah Birx, MD, coordinator of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said this when asked about people who have COVID-19 but die from preexisting conditions: ‚ÄúIf someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that as a COVID-19 death.‚Äù

. 
&gt;	That statement, combined with some state health officials saying they follow the same policy, sparked charges that the COVID-19 totals were inflated by deaths from other diseases and *even auto accidents* if the victims happened to have COVID-19. Federal and state governments gradually altered such policies over the spring and summer to say that in order for a death to be counted as a COVID-19 death, the disease had to have played a role.

[],,ListCraft,,,,,,[],"&gt;There was a very interesting podcast on the Ezra Klein show from NYT that argued that some of the cases of long covid might be due to the virus but a big part can also be anxiety based. Episode was with Meghan O'Rourke

Found it!  Here's just a tiny bit of the transcript, emphasis mine.......

ROSS DOUTHAT: Right, but then you also have patients who have symptoms that clearly would place them into the long Covid diagnostic bucket, but who didn‚Äôt test positive at the outset or didn‚Äôt get tested because it was obviously really hard to get a Covid test in the first few months of the outbreak, but later on, don‚Äôt test positive for antibodies six months or a year after the initial infection. There are studies of patients who report long Covid symptoms who find people in the studies who have the symptoms fall into these no initial positive test or no antibody test.  
  
And that connects to what I think is the **fourth commonplace explanation for long Covid** to go with the explanations you‚Äôve just offered, right, which is that it is, in some sense, actually, **mental health related and some version of what is often called a psychosomatic or psychogenic illness**, with the basic argument being that **Covid-19 was for everyone a kind of psychologically traumatic experience.** **Everyone had less social connection, had more anxiety about the future, knew people who were getting sick, lived in fear of the illness**.  
  
And this created some kind of **collective mental health crisis**. And mental health problems manifest in all kinds of different ways. But for some of these **people who are being diagnosed with long Covid, they actually never had it**. And somehow they have acquired a **psychosomatic illness that mimics it**. So what do you think of that argument?

[],,freedomtopoast,,,,,,[],"&gt;to workplace safety? There are seven states that have State-level OSHA agencies and they do take precedence ove

State OSHA can be more strict that Federal guidelines. States typically have the right to police these things more stringently. 

The issue with this federal mandate is that it is too overreaching constitutionally for the reasons I raised above. Since public health isn't an enumerated power, states can set their own rules, but Federal restrictions relating to public health have to pass a much higher level of scrutiny.

The other problems with using OSHA for this mandate are: 

\- OSHA is typically a workplace sphere of influence, but you can catch COVID anywhere. You can catch it at work too, but it's not like the dangerous chemicals that you would only deal with at work that OSHA traditionally deals with. So it's kind of a clunky argument to say that you're only at risk for COVID at work.

\- People have returned back to work for over a year in some states and this mandate coming up now through OSHA indicates that it's not that ""urgent."" One could argue Biden is a new president, but he's also been in office for months and it wasn't ""urgent"" enough to put in place in January when he took office and when cases were much higher.

\- Another issue is that people can work remotely now and being in an office isn't required for some jobs. This is one of the areas where the rule could have been more narrowly tailored. 

\- A practical issue with using OSHA is that courts have struck down OSHA rules in the recent past. 5 of the last 6 were struck down. The Biden administration knew this, so it's a bit of a head scratcher why they decided to use OSHA rather than some other method to do this.",,,,1636491720,{},hjzfc2v,False,t3_qpvx0c,False,True,t1_hjzbai2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qpvx0c/white_house_tells_businesses_to_proceed_with/hjzfc2v/,1636764455.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_1s9v0wae,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,FreekBugg,,,,,,[],"As a southerner, I have wondered what folks who are immunocompromised can do. I was a nurse before my health made that impossible for me, which honestly, had it not been as bad as it has been, I probabaly would have went back to work durring the early pandemic and wouldn't be here today. I have watched in horror as people have disregarded their fellow humans lives, both causualy and with disdain. I shouldn't have been suprised after what I had seen in the last, oh, maybe 5 years or so (you know what I'm talking about). 

Being a nurse before, you see people at their worst, but also at their best at times, and I had hoped the pandemic would bring us together. (Ha!) Anyway, after more than a year and a half of watching this through a nurse's eyes, knowing about the effects this would be having on the various groups of medically vulnerable, averaging at least a few months before it finally catches the attention of the general population or media, finally it seems like everyone is getting around to wondering about the nurses. They are done at this point. 

I have a quite a few medical problems and some are rare. I've been putting off a surgery since May of last year, at first out of fear of catching the virus, but now because I know that even in the best of times my conditions require extra attention and they just don't have it in them anymore. They are so tired and beyond sick of the b.s. 

They too have been watching, waiting for people to step up and start doing the right thing, take care of the vulnerable. Watching the same people who wouldn't take precautions, not only for themselves, but for others, turn around and scream at them for not be able to save a loved one, or for ""lying"" about a diagnosis with a made up virus. Those who were lauded as heros for maybe all of 5 months before they forgot about them. I knew of plenty who left nursing well before the virus hit, because honestly it's most financially profitable to hire the least amount of nurses legally possible and work them like that continuously. If you thought things were bad before, give it a few more years. 

So, back to what I was saying before I went off on that tangent, the only thing I think that those who are immunocompromised and living in the South can do is likely to move north. People aren't going to change, they aren't going to get vaccinated, they aren't going to start caring about them, and if they do get hospitalized, the nurses aren't going to be able to give them the specialized care they need. Unfortunately, because of the state of American healthcare, those people with those kinds of conditions aren't going to be financially able to move.

Restaurants never stopped indoor seating, bars never required distancing and masks, performances went on, festivals happened, sporting events allowed full crowds. Few people ever in masks. Tourist season happened as usual and while nothing was happening in more populated areas, people from the cities and suburbs flooded into the small towns and rural communities to look at wildflowers, visit boutique farms, stop at gas stations, have wine tastings, eat at restaurants, shop in stores, attend weddings, watch performances, drink in bars, go to sporting events, and attend festivals. In spring 2021 it was even bigger. All the city/suburb daytrippers ditching their masks to flock to the country and mingle with the majority unvaccinated. Same now, fall events in every small town every weekend and weekly football games drawing crowds. Few masks, less than 50% vaccine rate, and hordes of city/suburb tourists coming out to play on the weekends. And people wonder why so many people are getting sick and dying.

I work directly with people with disabilities, including some who are unable to get vaccinated for legitimate medical reasons. Due to this, I have been and remain very careful to avoid unneeded trips to stores and have been visiting only with one vaccinated friend who lives alone from another household.

[],,koi-lotus-water-pond,,,,,,[],"""There are many reasons why the pandemic has hit rural residents hard.  
  
More than 180 rural hospitals have closed since 2005, and people living in rural areas had a 20% greater death rate before the pandemic. Hospitals and medical centers were short-staffed to begin with, but burnout ‚Äì and the temptation of higher pay in cities ‚Äì has led to an exodus of experienced health workers. Smaller hospitals often don‚Äôt have the budget to hire expensive travel nurses.  
  
The remaining hospitals are often far away and don‚Äôt offer higher levels of care like intensive care units, but many of the larger hospitals are full and can‚Äôt accept transfers. And it‚Äôs hard for rural residents to seek early treatments like monoclonal antibodies, which are typically offered at specialized infusion centers. Other types of health access have also worsened during the pandemic, with rural residents lacking access to high-speed internet for telehealth visits and vaccine appointments.  
  
There are also disparities within the urban-rural divide. Across the US, people of color are more likely to get very sick and die from the virus than white people. But these disparities are even more pronounced in rural areas, according to a recent study. Living in a rural area as a person of color is a ‚Äúdouble whammy‚Äù, said Kwadwo Boakye, co-author of the study.  
  
At the start of the pandemic in the US, the coronavirus was often seen as an issue facing cities. For the first four months, as major metropolitan centers like New York and Los Angeles called in refrigerated trucks to handle the overwhelming crush of deaths, the virus mainly spread in the close quarters of metropolitan areas.  
  
But by July, it was spreading in rural America, too ‚Äì and when rates in cities began to decline, many rural areas continued adding new cases. By the fall, Covid was more common in rural areas than in cities.  
  
Yet ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to get rid of that earlier notion that this really was not a rural problem,‚Äù Ullrich said.  
  
‚ÄúRural is not a refuge. It‚Äôs clear that the disease has sought out every corner of the country, and it doesn‚Äôt make any difference where you live,‚Äù Ullrich said.

I also hate the idea of not treating people. My brother refuses to get vaccinated. He is my half brother and his mother has brainwashed him... It bends me up inside because I see all these Herman cane awards and it kills me, but he's the guy that instead of taking lunch to eat goes around downtown Chicago and feeds the homeless people on his lunch. He works 14 to 15 hours a day to pay bills for his immunocompromised girlfriend to get treatments she needs. Dude has nothing but best intentions. 

So it kills me to think about not giving people treatment because there are people like my brother. He was ill informed by someone he trusts and loves. Does that mean he should die, no.

However, I cannot say I'm not pissed off. I literally was advocating the vaccine before it even came out. Even tried to be part of the trials lol. I was the only one keeping my family in line from not doing stupid shit to catch covid. In the end, I got COVID. That was 9 months ago. I am so screwed up at 24 I can barely function. Now I need my parents help for daily life. Before this I had won multiple fitness competitions and ate extremely healthy (I don't even like how sugar tastes rather eat a carrot haha). Some days I look at my brother, knowing how much I love him, and hate his guts for not being vaccinated. Cause he has had all the time in the world to get his... Plus, he is 350lbs and eats vegetables once it twice a week. Mostly eats red meats, carbs, and sugar. I was one month to short for mine vaccine because of my age. If I had the time he has had I would have a life. It's even harder because he knows how screwed up I am, so much so he comes and visits me daily cause he knows I might not live more than a couple of years at this rate, yet knowing this he still won't get it...

Massachusetts upheld a government mandate which required smallpox vaccination. The  Supreme Court said that we don't have a right to place other people at risk. And by 1922, in another case, Justice Brandeis, writing for unanimous court, upheld childhood school vaccination mandates, calling it settled law.

OSHA has been writing business safety and health mandates for half a century.

&gt;NEW DELHI ‚Äî India‚Äôs coronavirus crisis, which was killing thousands of people a day just seven months ago, has eased after the nation‚Äôs leaders revamped their policies and dramatically ramped up their vaccination drive.

&gt;Now, as India celebrates the delivery of its one billionth dose, a feat that until recently seemed improbable, public health experts are sounding a new warning: The turnaround is losing steam.

&gt;Vaccinations are slowing down. As the temperature dips amid India‚Äôs most important festival season, people are crowding markets and hosting unmasked friends and family indoors. And the government is telling vaccination campaign volunteers like Namanjaya Khobragade that they are no longer needed.

&gt;‚ÄùNow is not the time to let our guard down,‚Äù said Ms. Khobragade, a coordinator for a health nonprofit in the eastern state of Jharkhand. ‚ÄúMany people have taken just the first vaccine. We cannot leave them like this. We need to increase the intensity.‚Äù

And even among adults, we already know demographics matter in the Pfizer vaccine alone.

For example, no possible trial could have captured the risk of myocarditis in males aged 18-29, because it is such a rare side effect. That's not to say they shouldn't get the vaccine (they **absolutely** should, the risk of myocarditis is **much** higher from COVID alone, nevermind all the other COVID risks that are avoided with the vaccine).

But the statement ""We will learn nothing between a trial and a rollout for any particular demographic"" is not true.

Clinical trials have different endpoints and methods, so the way to run a comparison is with a metanalisis. Metanalisis of vaccine are hard for a variety of reasons. So you need to have other studies like antibody levels and T cell response over time like surrogate points of efficacy against infection. In those papers inactivated vaccines don‚Äôt hold up as well as ARNm or viral vector. Antibody levels drop faster from a lower high and T cell response is way lower. This is more worrisome for those over 50yo. 
Im not saying they have no place and should not be used, if you have nothing else like many countries you should use them like a stop gag measure.

It deals with Putin who turned disinformation into an art form and Russian politics into a kind of grotesque theater, playing both sides (like, his people would set up anti-Putin rallies etc.). The aim is to confuse people so much they don't know what to believe any more, so they believe nothing. If you're the guy in the middle with all the power and money this is extremely helpful as it's very hard for an opposition to crystallize around any one subject. 
 
Anyway, I was talking to an old friend the oter day. We know a couple of guys who went in at the deep end on various conspiracies. Luckily they both came out the other side, but all credit to them they had to confront they'd been misled for a couple of years which is very hard to do. As I said, most people are just too proud to do that - and when you are immersed in an echo chamber it's far easier to go along with the shouting. This is why critical thinking skills are so, so important, and the ability to admit when you have been wrong. I'm lucky in that I used to be a research scientist so Im used to being wrong 90% of the time :-)
