52% immunity does mean than (in _very_ simplistic terms) if you have 100 people who are exposed to covid, 52 won't get it.

*But* the fight your body makes with the virus would be very, very different since you do not have the full antibody arsenal. Again, in simplistic fashion, there will be a fight which may last days, may be close, and the effects of that fight might be catastrophic.

THAT might be the danger zone.

Imagine it like a boxing match (hear me out).
You know _all_ the weak spots of the virus (after the second dose) and know where to hit.
The match starts, you knock him out in 5 seconds.
You win.
The virus couldn't even get a scratch on you and have no clue what went wrong.

Think of the same scenario at one dose.

The match starts, and the fight is underway.. you take a couple of blows, and give some back. You aren't close to losing, bur definitely getting _some_ beating.
Ultimately you win (one of the 52% ""lucky"" ones).

BUT - the fight lasted hours.
Days.
Definitely did not end the moment it started.

Now Imagine you're one of the 48% and the virus actually _won_ (managed to infect the host and start it's replication). The virus managed this because it managed to go around, find the weakness and essentially _adapt_ to the vaccine's response. The virus essentially started to mutate.

Anybody infected by this new person will have the mutated version. If that person infects 10people and out of these, 2 people ""lose"" their fictitious boxing match, you're in deep, deep sh*t (without even considering the mutations it might get from the other 2).

Welcome variant 3 (technically there are multiple, but they only give it proper acknowledgement when the mutation is substantial). A variant which is able to fight the body back on the vaccine, rendering it obsolete.

The vaccine works because the virus does not know how to work around it, gets destroyed before it manages to infect/replicate. 
_Everything_ must be done to avoid losing that.
This is not how you avoid it.

One last point. Think how some traditional vaccines work (not the Pfizer) where you'd get a weakened version of the virus, your body starts learning about it, and then fighting it, and will win.

Given you have nothing factual to claim that, as details are not public, this ""definitive proof"" is just a function of blind trust, isn't it. If this was a matter of religion, I'd stop here. But in science, we don't just make shit up when met with absence of facts, and explain it with our beliefs.

The history of medicine is riddled with examples where we fail to connect cause and effect due to insufficient familiarity (even of experts) with the impossibly complex ways our systems are interconnected. Before we discovered blood types, the idea you might sometimes die during blood transfusion was explained with just infection or stress for the body or something unrelated like this.

- IFR by age: I took the equation from https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-020-00698-1 - note that it gets larger than 1 around the age 100, so I just assumed it to be 1 from then on - there is probably not enough data, but it seems fair game to assume at this age, covid kills you almost always. If some

- life expectancy at the given age: last column of the table here https://www.lifeexpectancy.org/lifetable.shtml + from this article https://news.berkeley.edu/2018/06/28/supercentenarians/ I gather that it plateaus at 1.5 years above 105, so I have put two data points of 1.5 at 105 and 110 and made a simple polynomial fit that's quite nice

Then I simply plotted the two curves and their product - which is the average years lost per infected person as a function of  age in this super-simplified model (which does not, for example, take into account the correlation between the life expectancy of the individual and their chance to die from covid, which, I presume, is quite high for people already suffering other diseases). 

The result - https://i.imgur.com/t01X2Ik.png - frankly surprised me. I was expecting that the interplay between a rising and falling curve will create a peak somewhere around 70-80 but it didn't, the mortality just rises so fast that the decay of life expectancy doesn't beat it. I went into this exercise with a bias thinking I will show how pointless it is to vaccinate a 104-old, but the data changed my mind.

edit: for better visualisation, I am plotting ""IFR/10 in percent"" or ""IFR*10"" - you get the gist - the red curve at 10 means everyone dies.

Written in pre-Covid times but more relevant now than ever. The TL;DR is that our old age care has essentially extended the suffering of our elderly and made them more likely to have a more painful death and extend their period of suffering.

He writes:

I take guidance from what Sir William Osler wrote in his classic turn-of-the-century medical textbook, The Principles and Practice of Medicine: “Pneumonia may well be called the friend of the aged. Taken off by it in an acute, short, not often painful illness, the old man escapes those ‘cold gradations of decay’ so distressing to himself and to his friends.”

That little bit caused my eyesight to go in and out and darker and darker. It was terrifying. I had to crawl on the floor to feel my way to the phone to make an emergency call. A corticosteroid shot turned my skin gray and caused anaphylaxis. The doctor who prescribed it said that I should never again have the shot even if I take Benadryl beforehand. I'm not allowed to take NSAIDs. These are just a few examples from a very long list. 

Nope. Pfizer admitted that they didn't test people who are prone to rare and often severe reactions. So, why would I take the risk with an untested vaccine for my risk group? I'm not going to parties or hanging out with people from outside of the home. A person who gets the vaccine might still be able to spread the virus.

ABSTRACT:

Background: The sudden onset of COVID-19 began in late 2019 caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-COV2) and on 11th March, WHO declared it to have developed pandemic status. There is still no specific treatment and vaccine available for COVID-19; causing wide spread health problem and concern of the globe. Povidone iodine (PVP-I) is an antiseptic that has been used for over 150 years. It is already proved that different concentration of PVP-I can deactivate COVID-19 virus. Methodology: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, out of 1113 patients 606 patients were enrolled and divided in 2 groups by randomization after taken consents. In Gr-A, 303 patients underwent mouthwash/gargle, nasal drops and eye drops with 1% povidone iodine 4 hourly for 4 weeks as well as symptomatic treatment according to need. In Gr-B 303 patients were advised mouthwash/gargle, nasal cavity and eye wash with lukewarm water 4 hourly for 4 weeks and symptomatic treatment according to need. RT-PCR test done every 3rd, 5th and 7th day and Thyroid hormone level (TSH,T3, T4 FT4) at 4th week for follow up. Results: The group of patients used 1% PVP-I have shown tremendously reduced mortality, morbidity and hospital as well as financial burden in this covid situation. Conclusion: Administration of 1% PVP-I as mouthwash/gargle, nasal or eye drop is simple, rapid and cost effective in reduction of mortality and morbidity by COVID-19.",,,1610309255,{},gisl1p6,False,t3_kulrm5,False,True,t3_kulrm5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kulrm5/view_of_effect_of_1_povidone_iodine/gisl1p6/,1610351174,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Lots of people here (especially on the other thread about the Biden proposal) are confusing the risks of Biden plan with the UK plan.  Biden is staying with the recommended second dose timeframe, and allocating vaccines for second doses when people's second doses are due.   The UK is prioritizing giving everyone possible a first dose and not even doing second doses any priority for \~12 weeks.

That's just a much different level of risk that is being taken on.  Under Biden's plan, there will still occasionally be big groups of people whose second dose is delayed by a couple weeks, but then they'll get prioritized for their second doses with follow-on supplies.

The science doesn't really support the idea that getting the second dose a week or two later is more risky.  Yes, the study did the 21 day protocol, but it isn't a magic number - compliance was not 100%, people can't make their appointment sometimes, there was a short grace period, and most importantly the underlying science doesn't predict the immune response would be so sensitive to a 2-week delay - a delay which, to be clear, would only happen if there's a supply snafu between your first and second dose, not for most people.    Being able to vaccinate more quickly right now when the epidemic is exploding seems well worth that risk. Which is why Gottlieb, a former FDA commissioner and a Pfizer board member, spoke out supporting not holding back the second doses.  And why NYT reporting on the December rollout had Pfizer executives and scientists on background saying they were surprised and confused why Operation Warp Speed was saving the second doses.

By contrast, the idea that you would just delay the second dose for three months, like the UK is doin, is a much more radical step that does open up questions about how efficacy would be affected.  Which is also why Pfizer came out with a statement warning that they did not believe that the science supported the UK plan.",,,1610235690,{},giphcxi,False,t3_ktysdz,False,False,t3_ktysdz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ktysdz/pfizer_ready_to_release_millions_of_doses_each/giphcxi/,1610278134,63,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,MeltingMandarins,,,[],,,,text,t2_z2cfink,False,False,[],"This is normal.  Speaking in general, for all vaccines (regardless of disease), there are 3 ways this happens.

1) Most viruses have some kind of immune dampening effect.  Even if the virus isn’t acting directly on the immune system, when you get infected and cells start dying parts of the immune system go into overdrive which activates other parts to slow down (so your immune system doesn’t escalate out of control and kill you).   The vaccine doesn’t have that problem, so your immune system works smoothly, leading to better results.

2) On the completely opposite end of that problem, if you have an asymptomatic infection your body can think it’s no big deal and not create/store many antibodies at all.   So many vaccines include an adjuvant (thing designed to wave a red flag at your immune system) to make sure your body sees the danger, and you get a stronger/longer-lasting result than you might get with mild disease.

3) Many vaccines have a booster or second shot.  That alerts the immune system that this isn’t a once-off exposure, and increases the chance of memory B cells being stored long term.   Even if un-vaccinated, that nurse is now highly unlikely to catch it a third time (unless she has some undiagnosed immune issue).   Same with a 2 dose vaccine.   2 exposures (however obtained) are more protective than 1.

A combination of caution and some measure of herd immunity should bring the virus under control enough that your chances of catching it are low, and then your chance of surviving it is high.

The disease was infectious enough last spring.  California will be public health disaster, there is no way around that at this point.

The worse case scenario is a mutation that is resistant to the vaccines and the odds of that increases the more infections that occur.

The big problem right now is doses are out there and not being put into arms. They are just sitting due to either administrative incompetence or lack of ability to administer; which is probably due to the former .  

There will be shortages regardless until everyone that can and is willing to be vaccinated gets their dosages.  I don't think we will get to a point where the supply ever outpaces the demand.

It is better in my opinion to gamble on maximizing your ability to administer the vaccine first, even if you err on the side of having shortages pop up, rather than throttle back to ensure second doses.  I don't think we can afford that level of caution at this point.  Deployment speed is critical, if we don't hit her immunity through vaccination before hospitals fail there is no point to any of this.

Gamble on the second dose being available after 21 days, this can be aided if you have a good enough scheduling system in place so that you can delay first doses if the supply chain is interrupted.

I can't stress the the time crunch.  Get as many people partial immunity as possible, hope that decreases serious cases and hospitalizations, hope production increases not decreases, and really hope a resistant strain doesn't emerge.  

We can't be reckless for sure, but we can't afford to be 100% safe either.  We have to vaccinate on ""credit"" and faith in distribution; if distribution gets messed up we are screwed anyway.

Additionally we musn't agonize to the point of paralysis about the most egalitarian distribution hierarchy who gets what first past the initial 75+/Health Care workers who need it most; as some states seem to be doing.

At the current vaccination pace, it will take over 2 years to vaccinate 60% of the US population. Globally the vaccination process is just starting and this is an unprecedented logistical global health challenge.

We all hope for an improvement and there are many hurdles in front of us, some unknown. For example we do not know if vaccinated people can be silent carriers. We do not know how easy it will be to convince enough of the population to get vaccinated. We don't know if more viral mutations will happen while the cases spike this winter.

I believe that we will go back to something resembling normal in 2022 and hope to see live music by the end of 2021. Let's go easy on each other as we all make tough decisions and analyze the situation to the best of our own abilities and knowledge.

""Because SARS-CoV-2 attacks the respiratory system first, in a very interesting letter [8] Kanduc and Shoenfeld suggested that because the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and lung surfactant proteins shared 13 out of 24 pentapeptides, the immune response following infection with SARS-CoV-2 may lead to cross-reactions with pulmonary surfactant proteins, followed by SARS-CoV-2-associated lung disease [8]. Based on their findings, they warned against the use of the entire SARS-CoV-2 antigens in the vaccines and cautioned that perhaps the use of only unique peptides would be the most effective way to fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Very similar suggestions were made by Razim et al., in designing a vaccine against Clostridium difficile [9]. Two sequences, peptide 9 and peptide 10, of C. difficile were recognized not only by the sera of patients with C. difficile infections but also by the sera of patients with autoimmune disease. Razim et al. concluded that before considering a protein as a vaccine antigen, special care should be taken in analyzing the sequence of tissue cross-reactive epitopes in order to avoid possible future side effects [9].

We agree with Razim et al., and we feel that our own findings that 21 out of 50 tissue antigens had moderate to strong reactions with the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are a sufficiently strong indication of cross-reaction between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and a variety of tissue antigens beyond just pulmonary tissue, which could lead to autoimmunity against connective tissue and the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems.""",,,1610260847,{},giqp0yj,False,t3_ktukox,False,False,t1_gip2mxi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ktukox/autopsy_concludes_that_womans_death_was_not_due/giqp0yj/,1610307199,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

As such I apologize as no, I don't have proof about her driving ambulances either in training or as a subaltern and should not have implied that she did so without evidence beyond staged photo ops.

With regard to the proof of what she was doing between completing training and VE day, the only reliable evidence would be her military records which aren't available,  however even if they were they can be patchy.

So, yes. I plan to get it. One of my family members already has.

Unless we start seeing tens of thousands more deaths, there's no reason to think the vaccine is even comparably as risky as covid. If we started seeing that kind of rise in deadly reactions then I'd re-weigh the pros and cons again.

BUT

It would take 500,000 more deaths to be caused just by the vaccines that have already been distributed to match the covid death rate.

Not to mention the fact that if you get covid you could infect others leading to more death, sickness, mental health issues, and economic issues. Prolonging the pandemic and spreading more sickness and death. A vaccine reaction isn't contagious.

I understand being concerned with new discoveries like this vaccine.

Given everything they should be well over 400k per day by now.

At the same time the positivity rate has gone from around 8% to 14% and deaths have continued to climb at a swift rate, even shifting by a month.

Upshot, it looks like the US testing cannot keep up, and the death rate isn't slowing, just some covid deaths aren't being recognised properly. My guess is the true current death rate is probably at least 4.5k per day, and will be over 5k by the end of this month.

Nothing looks to be happening over the next x weeks to change anything.

Besides the real lockdown that everyone knows has to happen, the US really needs to go in for a mass testing program of everyone in the US, with the immediate 'lateral flow Innova' test to sift and separate those with the disease within the society. The UK is throwing $130bn into mass screening to try and get ontop of the spread there. It's a viable way for the US to gain back control they haven't had for many months now - everyone gets an immediate test, and everyone found to have the disease is ordered, with prosecution if they don't do so, to isolate from society. Cut the transmission and uncontrolled spread.

It's not gouging: You need to take the existing maker of the thing and have them clear out the line's schedule of anything else... and all their suppliers too... all the way up the supply chain of dependencies, then you need to run all the constraining lines 24/7 with a 100 hour work weeks ( big time overtime/bonus/ + care for all their dependents) and have them make 2x more than you really need to account for sloppiness. All that costs big-time money - but it's worth it if it actually can work.

I can actually speak to this! My company is in both the Pfizer and Moderna supply chains. It's not my area of expertise, I'm not in sales or customer service, but it's been the talk of the office the past few months and company leadership has been communicating with the entire team pretty constantly since it's something of interest.

Basically, when we do work for pharma it is already pretty marked up. They require a lot of us, from record keeping to inspections, to immense quality standards. Something that might be perfectly fine for another company will result in an entire order being rejected by a pharma company over a superficial variation (we once had a battle with a pharma customer because we used 18"" stretchwrap on a pallet when our spec said we used 20"", thats how anal they are). Because of this, we charge 2-5x what we would for comparable product to a different industry.

The current demands of us for COVID related projects is interesting. They want more for less, which is atypical. They are typically perfectly content to pay whatever we ask. We are being asked to keep prices and costs under control, while at the same time turning on a dime to meet insane delivery dates and shorter than normal lead times with zero opportunity to be late or push deliveries. To be clear, we understand the challenges and have worked to move mountains to do our part. We have had several all hands on deck days where we have been in on nights and weekends with everyone, including office staff and executives, on the production floor. 

I obviously can't speak for anyone else in the supply chain, but we aren't the hold up and have already been doing what we can to prioritize the vaccine effort. I honestly believe others are as well. We all want to go back to normal. For that reason, I don't think it's as simple as paying a premium to clear out lines and push other orders. From our experience, we are basically already doing that. They have been asking that of us since August, and to help the effort and maintain our relationship we have been doing it without any extra premium (we are essentially breaking even on vaccine related stuff, even though pharma is generally our biggest moneymaker). For us, and maybe for others too, it would be a HUGE premium to scale up because it wouldnt require pushing orders, it would require new production lines entirely. Getting those online would usually take months or years, plus however long it would take to get them certified by the customer. There are some orders we could push on the existing lines, but that would be disruptive for other life saving projects we work on, including things like other vaccines and cancer drugs.",,,1610264122,{'gid_1': 1},giqswmu,False,t3_ktysdz,False,False,t1_gipzn2l,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ktysdz/pfizer_ready_to_release_millions_of_doses_each/giqswmu/,1610309992,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

According to David Harrington, who works at the NHS in London, the case involved a 78-year-old man with significant underlying health conditions, but with no history of immunosuppression.

The man presented with fever while undergoing haemodialysis on April 2 and tested positive for COVID-19, but was discharged home and had an uneventful recovery. He continued to be routinely tested while undergoing haemodialysis and tested negative 22 times between May 5 and December 1. Antibodies were detected on 6 occasions between May 5 and December 1 with no evidence of antibody waning.

The patient developed shortness of breath in mid-December and he was rushed to hospital on December 14 when his condition worsened. “He was brought in by ambulance in extremis, very short of breath and unable to talk, with severe hypoxia, leading to emergency intubation,” Harrington said. The man was admitted to ICU with severe pneumonia, which was complicated by a heart attack. The man’s current condition has not been released.

“The [whole genome sequencing] results confirm reinfection with a different lineage 8 months after initial infection in the absence of significant immunocompromise. The reinfection was with the ‘new variant’ VOC202012/01,” Harrington said. He noted that the variant has raised questions about possible immune escape and vaccine evasion, but emphasized that more research is needed.

—————————-

I’m very interested that this person tested positive for antibodies pretty much up until he was reinfected.

by the time they have given shots to the high risk people it's going to be pretty damn clear that it's a good vaccine (even for those who wrongly don't think it is right now), so that said, if i was a jerk i'd ask them what their odds of dying from covid were and their odds of dying from the vaccine, if they can actually quote reasonable numbers i'd listen to them, but if they are repeating facebook drivel i wouldn't talk to them.",,,1610308929,{},giske2o,False,t3_kuaet0,False,True,t1_gis74yo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kuaet0/daily_discussion_thread_january_10_2021/giske2o/,1610350802,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The US population in 1918 was 103M compared to 330M today.  Using raw numbers for a comparison is disingenuous since by simple virtue of our growing population and stagnating life expectancy, every year should be expected to be a record-setting year for deaths.  

&gt;Indeed, the age-adjusted death rate dropped about 1% in 2019, and life expectancy rose by about six weeks to 78.8 years, the CDC reported.

The age-adjusted death rate rose from 2275.9 per 100k in 1917 to 2541.6 in 1918.  Life expectancy fell from 50.9 to 39.1. [Source.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-visualization/mortality-trends/index.htm)  

That life-expectancy part is very important.  When life-expectancy rises even though the death rate also rises, that means a majority of the dead people were statistically close to death.  It would be excellent if nobody died of COVID, but it's not heartless to say it's less deadly than the Spanish flu.

I fear that if we ever had a pandemic like the Spanish Flu, people literally wouldn't know how to handle it.

While I'm otherwise healthy and currently am not experiencing any cardiac or respiratory issues, I am highly susceptible and I am someone who would likely have a higher chance of fatality if I caught Covid. 

Generally, even when I get sick with something like the common cold, it tends to be more severe for me and lasts longer that it does for other, otherwise healthy people.

Doctor basically said that, with my condition, most of the known side effects from the vaccine, while unpleasant, would be exponentially safer for me than risking Covid. 

In summary, vaccine is less likely to kill or permanently maim, whereas Covid is risking death or exacerbating my disability.

In terms of friends/family/colleagues, I received a lot of similar input and concerns. My husband was a Navy Corpsman and then a paramedic for a while once he got out, so we have a lot of friends and acquaintances who are medical professionals. 

He keeps up with a lot of friends who stayed in medical fields, including someone who is currently a physician's assistant in a NYC hospital (she has some pretty intense horror stories of things she's seen on the Covid ward--listening to her speak of some of the deaths she's attended is just unreal). She is adamant that everyone who can take the vaccine should take it.

So, he and I spoke at length about his worries for my health and safety, input and advice he's received from people he trusts, and again weighed the risks of vaccine side effects vs. covid. Vaccine wins every time.

Additionally, I'm a therapist (LMFT) and have contacts who provide mental health services in hospital/medical settings.

Basically everyone I know working in these settings have been briefed on risk vs. reward, and it just seems like at this stage in the vaccine development and implementation, concensus is that it's incredibly safe. 

One of my former colleagues' father is an immunologist (and she does clinical psych. research at our local university) and she sent out a pretty detailed breakdown of the vaccine trials and findings. 

Basically, the Moderna vaccine trial consisted of over 30,000 individuals and severe side effects occurred in less than 3% of individuals enrolled in the trial...so, just under 1k people out of 30k, and those side effects generally persisted between 2 and 3 days. 

Looking at those numbers, and considering the vaccine offers about 95% immunity against Covid, and pending research is suggesting the vaccine will also likely be effective against the mutating strains, it really all just made sense to bite the bullet and go for it. 

So I did.

## Abstract

While several clinical and immunological parameters correlate with disease severity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infection, work remains in identifying unifying correlates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can be used to guide clinical practice. Here, we examine saliva and nasopharyngeal (NP) viral load over time and correlate them with patient demographics, and cellular and immune profiling. We found that saliva viral load was significantly higher in those with COVID-19 risk factors; that it correlated with increasing levels of disease severity and showed a superior ability over nasopharyngeal viral load as a predictor of mortality over time (AUC=0.90). A comprehensive analysis of immune factors and cell subsets revealed strong predictors of high and low saliva viral load, which were associated with increased disease severity or better overall outcomes, respectively. Saliva viral load was positively associated with many known COVID-19 inflammatory markers such as IL-6, IL-18, IL-10, and CXCL10, as well as type 1 immune response cytokines. Higher saliva viral loads strongly correlated with the progressive depletion of platelets, lymphocytes, and effector T cell subsets including circulating follicular CD4 T cells (cTfh). Anti-spike (S) and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG levels were negatively correlated with saliva viral load showing a strong temporal association that could help distinguish severity and mortality in COVID-19. Finally, patients with fatal COVID-19 exhibited higher viral loads, which correlated with the depletion of cTfh cells, and lower production of anti-RBD and anti-S IgG levels. Together these results demonstrated that viral load – as measured by saliva but not nasopharyngeal — is a dynamic unifying correlate of disease presentation, severity, and mortality over time.",,,1610308487,{},gisjhyn,True,t3_kulibz,False,False,t3_kulibz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kulibz/saliva_viral_load_is_a_dynamic_unifying_correlate/gisjhyn/,1610350303,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Something like monitored movie theaters, arcades, and bowling alleys where people can do activities with masks on. Food and drinks will be prohibited, reservations will be required, and social distancing, sanitation, and masks will be enforced. Offer outdoor gathering pods spaced 10 feet apart with caution tape where the number of people can be more controlled. This way people have a safer outlet and can do something instead of resorting to private indoor gatherings where masks, distancing, and gathering limits can’t and won’t be enforced.
- __Selfish Reasons to Stay Home:__ If the state/city thinks the risk is too high to open up anything, then you need to provide a selfish reason to stay home and not gather (ie. money), more enforcement to make sure people don’t gather, and things to do while people are at home.

Viruses mutate more quickly than bacteria, and if vaccinated people are careless they could easily be exposed to a variant with a protein spike mutation that ignore their immunity. If the vaccinated community is careless as a whole, it could quickly spread through the group.

Why wouldn't they be paid? Every hospital gets reimbursed to put shots in arms. I think it's like $28 per shot. The average nurse can inject a shot every 5-10 minutes. That should be more than enough revenue.

That being said, it's especially shitty that your position is nurses can enjoy getting first dibs on life-saving vaccines and then turn around and take plenty of time off as thousands of others die and vaccines pile up on shelves. Tons of people have been asked to make serious sacrifices due to Covid. I expect the medical community to join in making sacrifices, and I don't think that's unreasonable.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Venezuela’s official Covid-19 death toll currently stands at just 329, one of South America’s lowest. By contrast more than 110,000 people have died in neighbouring Brazil and more than 26,000 in Peru, which has a similar-sized population to Venezuela.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the scenes playing out inside the University hospital – where two of nine floors now host coronavirus patients – suggest the true situation may be far worse.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The government says everything is under control but that’s not true,” one employee told the Guardian, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of being persecuted by Venezuela’s authoritarian regime. “We have between six and eight deaths a day.”  
&gt;  
&gt;In one recent three-day period in July, 26 patients reportedly died of Covid-19 there but none was included in the official count.  
&gt;  
&gt;The investigative website Armando.info claimed the hospital’s doctors had counted 216 patients who died with Covid-19 symptoms – even though the official death toll for Zulia state at that point was just 63.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We all know what is happening at the University hospital,” one worker said. “But if we speak out they’ll lock us up.”

[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/aug/25/venezuela-coronavirus-covid-death-toll-maracaibo](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/aug/25/venezuela-coronavirus-covid-death-toll-maracaibo)

A few more choice quotes.

&gt;Outside the capital, the most affected region is Zulia state, of which Maracaibo is the capital, with its Chavista governor, Omar Prieto, also among those infected. Prieto reportedly sought treatment in a private clinic and has recovered.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most patients are less fortunate and end up in a public health system broken by years of corruption, mismanagement and underinvestment, where the agony of illness is compounded by chronic shortages of medicine, supplies and basic sanitation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Today, with Venezuela and its health service in ruins, the hospital has no functioning toilets and often lacks water to bathe or clean. Patients have reportedly been forced to defecate on lunch trays and throw their waste from the window. To reach dialysis, patients with kidney disease must trek through the floors housing Covid-19 sufferers because the lift is broken.

The COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) is a novel virus meaning a virus that has never been previously recorded. And since March everyone has been fighting it and gathering as much data possible and giving insight on prevention and trying to reduce the spread.

I have worked on multiple medical studies at a leading hospital - people dress up all sorts of *bullshit* in the word “could”.

I think you and I probably agree on a lot more than we disagree. Very nice to find someone who is so well thought out in their opinions. I’m not going to get super verbose here, but I’d just say that while I am thrilled to have a debate with someone who can actually have it without just turning it into an argument ... I just see the futility in wasting time on someone who is so set into their viewpoint, that a challenge to their views will only force them to dig their feet deeper into the ground on their position. With someone like you, I’d absolutely love it if we found something we disagreed on, and had a debate that resulted in one of us changing our opinions (or at least expanding our opinions).

As far as the regular stream of black guys approaching me with those sorts of conversations — I actually enjoy the conversations, and I don’t mind the idea as you describe it as “Since I can figure out within a few sentences if the person is capable of having a real discussion, why shouldn’t other people” ... What concerns me is that I get it on a cold approach, as the opener. I’m wondering how I am sending off signals like that without even talking.

Honestly, I’d love to continue the conversation perhaps more directly — feel free to send me a DM.

The copies continue the process in other cells, and the immune system overwhelms itself trying to prevent the process, causing a viral disease, in this case, COVID-19. The vaccine morphs certain cells into replicants of the protein and the body stacks them. When the real virus - SARS-COV-2 - enters the body, the body is trained to obviate those proteins, and the virus can't invade a cell, ergo you cannot get COVID-19.

Historically, RNA vaccines have been developed in months. They were introduced in 1990 by Hungarian immunologists, and literally a few months later, several successful RNA vaccines had been engineered against diseases found in rats.

No, I am not talking about just California, I am talking about the national level of government in the U.S.

Second, when it comes to the level of vaccination needed in the span of time that we need, it really requires communication between local, state, and national levels of government. So, if you have a state government that refuses to communicate/work with it's national or local level, that state will do worse than other governments that do work together. In the case of the U.S. we have a national government that refuses to do it's best to coordinate a national vaccination campaign. 

Finally, in regards to mass vaccinations. I would love to see mass vaccinations as long as it is reasonable with the available with current supply chain limitations. But, right now, we are following a style of vaccination where there are teirs of who gets vaccinated.
Think of it like when you are boarding a plane. People who need extra help board first, family board second, and everybody boards later (or some kind of order like that). In this case, I think front line workers get vaccinated first, and the elderly get vaccinated second, another group gets vaccinated, and finnaly the mass public has access. This makes sense especially with people who work in hospitals and people who live in community homes.

Essentially, there are many factors when it comes to vaccine role out. Many that I personally don't understand.

Yes, you have to base the decision on conjecture or assumption. This is true no matter which way you decide. If you support double-dosing and are rational, then either:

(1) since safety is not in question, you have implicitly conjectured that single-dosing has very low expected or average-case efficacy over a few months.

To be fair, more people know you now than they have the whole rest of your career.

Oh, yeah. It's the Da Vinci Code, for sure. I have no idea how you could have ever anticipated that during an epidemic that is killing 3-4,000 people per day, that people would want a vaccine that could reduce that chance by \~100%. How could you have EVER known??? 

*""You’re dealing with traffic issues, because you have 2,000 people showing up at a rec center.""*

 Right! You'd think they would car-pool or take public transportation, huh? Geez. How selfish can these people be? They are absolutely killing the environment. 

This guy manages a $1.8B budget and \~2500 employees; he should have been able to make some kind of plan. His county has several stadia for minor league baseball teams - did they really have to use a rec center??? Wouldn't a minor league parking lot be able to accommodate 5000 cars over the course of an 8-hour day??? It should have pretty good access to major roads. 

My parents live in Florida and their county handled it much more smoothly. Internet sign-up, two-hour windows for appointments, both of my parents made it on the first day available. It took them a total of 30 minutes from the time they arrived to the time they exited the lot (it was a drive-up center); half of that was waiting 15 minutes after the injection.

https://ibb.co/R0gzFjp

We know that an infection is counted as when they show symptoms and test positive. So honestly the true infection date was probably 5 to 7 days before the date they tested positive. So when we look at this table from Moderna, we see that 14 days after the first dose but before the patient got their 2nd dose, there were 2 infections in the vaccine group and 28 in the placebo. 30 total infections is actually quite a bit and using that we can have a confidence interval of vaccine efficacy of 68.8% to 99.1%. This means we are 95% confident that we are AT least 68.8% effective after 2 weeks from dose 1, with our best guess being 92.1% effective.

On the other hand I've made a personal commitment to not get mad about 'other people' getting the vaccine. I don't even care about canadians getting it in florida, because trying to verify ANYTHING other than age will just slow stuff down. At the end of the day, we're going to end up with excess vaccines because we ordered more than we need and plenty of people won't get the shot anyways. 

All i want out of this is for the states to show improvement over time getting this vaccine out and a simplification of rules is a big part of that. Florida is doing it, Cuomo just had his hand forced by deblasio. Looking back it was foolish to think that we could microtarget vaccinations and do it extremely fast, but we're learning. 

For example: it turns out that threatening fines for vaccinating people out of order doesn't speed things up- lesson learned! we should move on and other states should avoid that. 

The ONE thing that worries me about bidens plan is federalizing distribution sites. I hope he means there will be some federally run sites, or sending a federal coordinator, or something other than what a lot of people here are asking for- feds running the whole thing. States and counties running this thing is the right call because its the ONLY plan that is doable. Federal emergency response works because its usually needed at a localized disaster, but this effort is entirely uniform across the US, when adjusted to population density. We're just starting to get our legs under us, the last thing we need is to change everything. The federal government should be mostly writing checks, giving guidance, and looking at easing or making exemptions to regulations to make this go faster.

I have several ancestors who spent a lot of time kicking their heels and waiting to be deployed,  many who were merchant navy so were never military, and a few who couldn't get into the army due to medical reasons but still volunteered as firefighters and air raid wardens, etc. Fuck we've even found a deserter, and my personal favorite,  the army lifer who was constantly in trouble for drinking or reading the paper on guard duty. 

The women in particular seem to have their contributions dismissed, even by themselves, which infuriates me when they all lived in cities destroyed by the blitz and yet were supposed to pretend that was no big deal. In the meantime  one of their male  RAF relatives had a cushy number out in Canada for the duration and never saw combat in his life, yet he was a ""hero"", while they were just civilians.

*Note - he was actually an awesome human and never held those views himself, its just something I've hit up against when researching the family.*

So if I am willing to argue that my grandfather, who was not in the forces due to medical unfitness, should still be considered as serving because he was a fireman in the blitz (he would pick up and extinguish incendiaries during air raids despite not being able to run), or my great-grandfather who was merchant navy for both world wars but never saw active combat (although he did survive a ship being torpedoed), or the great uncle who was invalided out of basic training for a preexisting condition  *yet was still awarded a medal for his service*, my grandmother who worked as a nurse in a major city hospital during air raids, then I have to consider QE2's time as service as well, otherwise I can't defend my stance on all of the above having served their country, too.

I absolutely accept your point that her service is exaggerated,  but in this case I do think she would have happily taken deployment but her father wouldn't allow it. In her defense, my great-aunt had the same problem and she was pure working class, but what dad said was law so she had to work in a factory instead.

You are also right about the ambulances thing, I was wrong to have assumed it to be true based on other units, and even if I have respect to QE2 for joining up, it's wrong for people to be given the impression she was driving around in air raids or rescuing people in the East End while evading nazi spies hell bent on kidnapping her.

It doesn't pick a random identifier, it picks many, and the autoimmune disease you're referencing hasn't been seen with any of the Covid vaccines.  

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use the same sequence of mRNA (iirc), and it's the entirety of the spike protein, plus a few things.  Individual mutations may change a spot or two on the spike, but too many mutations will make the virus unable to enter human cells.

So if you get vaccinated, your immune system makes antibodies for the entirety of the spike, but not the neucleocapsid portion of the virus.  If there is a mutation that doesn't change the spike much, that virus will still be targeted by your immune system.  Even if say, 12, 15, or 20 changes happen on the spike, there are likely more kinds of antibodies ready to go do their thing.

I am not confident this can be accomplished sitting on doses to ensure second doses.  I don't think it is a matter of just looking at short term gains, we are guilty of this, but in this situation it is a moot point.

At the very least the most at risk populations and health care workers need to have vaccines in arms as fast as possible as it is unlikely that you will not be able to recoup the supply needed for their second doses over 21 days since they are numerically small enough compared to the projected vaccine that in the supply chain over that period of time.

After those populations are fully protected and deaths brought down and hospital staffs less in danger of being incapacitated, we can afford to be more cautious as you suggest.  The larger and younger the vaccination group, the more the concerns you raise could outweigh the benefit of maximizing vaccination speed.  

The dangers of out of control infection rates leading to more mutations still makes me lean toward expediency of at least limited protection being the way to go if only to get those infection rates down.

That's true for everything that tends to affect the elderly; a minority of younger people will also die. That's true for cancer, Alzheimer's, the seasonal flu. It tends to affect the elderly, but being younger is no guaratee you won't get it. Covid is not unique in that regard.

&gt; that's a significant hit to people in the work force

Yeah, unlike those lockdowns.

&gt; businesses aren't going to be operating properly

See my previous point.

That is actually happening despite strict lockdowns. In fact I have a hunch it is *because* of lockdown. I think the virus is naturally evolving to become better at spreading in a lockdown environment.

&gt; not getting basically tortured to death while completely alone.

Again, that's what lockdown does. 

The one valid point here was the potential to overwhelm the health service. To which I say; that's their problem. If the health services cannot handle a health crisis then they're incompetent.

 - One was that hospitals would need lots of masks &amp; they feared a shortage.

 - A third reason was that some highly educated people arrogantly mocked the masses for any suggestion that the virus would become pandemic or cause any problems worldwide. Some people simply just felt convinced that most other human beings on earth are dumb as dirt and that only themselves had what it takes to not panic over ""a little flu"".

In essence, with the UK variant, public health has the opportunity to demonstrate that it can manage a second, more severe pandemic using the lessons it has learned from the first one. Because this variant is different enough to constituted a completely different level of challenge. There remain too many unknowns, just as there were in February.

&gt;This uncertainty in understanding the variant’s exact mechanisms means  that we don’t know if our existing tools—masks, distancing, and  disinfecting—are as effective as they were compared with an identical  scenario with the regular variant. To be clear: The variant is still a  respiratory virus, so the basic tools will not change, and they will all  continue to work. In fact, they have become more important, but we may  need to be stricter—less time indoors, better masks, better ventilation,  more disinfection of high-touch surfaces—to get the same bang for our  protective buck.

I'd like to add the following.


The current problem is vaccine administration.  Approximately, only one-third of distributed vaccine doses have been given to people.

https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations


Part of this is vaccine hesitancy, seen even among healthcare workers and first responders.

https://www.modernhealthcare.com/providers/vaccine-rollout-hits-snag-health-workers-balk-shots


CVS and Walgreens will take until Jan 25, before they even get the first dose to all nursing homes.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/06/cvs-says-it-expects-to-finish-first-round-of-covid-vaccines-in-nursing-homes-by-jan-25.html


Florida has made vaccinations available to anyone 65+. Public demand has been overwhelming, with the elderly waiting overnight. The state can't keep up with public demand, and have appointments booked into February.  However per CDC, a lot of doses remain unused.

Florida: 1.36 million doses distributed

400,000 people vaccinated.

https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/07/us/florida-coronavirus-vaccine-rollout/index.html


There are already many more vaccine doses on the way.  Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna plan to produce 200 million doses combined by the end of March. Johnson &amp; Johnson will possibly be approved in February.

https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/us-could-be-using-a-one-shot-covid-vaccine-by-february/ar-BB1cmqMc 


Okay, maybe developing effective avenues for administration takes time.  Perhaps if J&amp;J is approved, the ability to be stored in refrigerators will help.  So, what can we do in the meantime?


Well-established and proven public health strategies are being used successfully by other countries, such as education, clear communication, increased testing, financial support, countering false information, increased mask production, etc. These include countries such as Liberia, Senegal, Uganda, India, Colombia, and South Africa.

https://archive.is/L6NZn


Let's say we want to release more vaccine doses anyway, but what if this ends up delaying the second dose?  There is some data on effectiveness for AstraZeneca-Oxford. There is no data for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n18


All vaccines are not the same.  We cannot extrapolate AstraZeneca-Oxford data to Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. They don't even have similar mechanisms or efficacy.   


For some vaccines, it is necessary to restart from dose 1 if the second dose is delayed.

https://www.who.int/immunization/policy/Immunization_routine_table3.pdf


If delaying the second dose results in lower effectiveness, can't we just administer booster doses?  Well, there is some research that suggests vaccines could possibly lose effectiveness with repeat doses.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11296-5


https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/topics/respiratory/influenza/repeat-influenza-vaccination-yields-reduced-antibody-response/


https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29186468/

Frankly I think this is gaslighting by the government. Covid is being marketed as a once in a century crisis, and it's just not. Yeah it might be the final nail in your coffin if you were already half in it, and that's sad, but that's the thing about life; it ends.

You mentioned the media coverage and my mother was texting me about the dangerous of covid because the news reported that a man in his late 30s (my age) died from it. I had to explain to her that yeah someone in their 30's dying from it is so rare it makes national headline news.

Funny you should mention ""excess deaths"" because I actually have the numbers here I was looking at this yesterday. This is from the Office of National Statistics UK. I can post them here and keep the formatting.

1	2001	1229.9	100.00%

9	2020	1038.1	84.41%

20	2019	908.9	73.90%

So what I have done here is take ""deaths per 100,000"" grouped by year, and ranked them by deadliest to least deadly year (I normalised the deadliest year as 100 so you can see relative ""deadliness""). On this scale the year 2020 ranks 9th!

Annual mortality rates have been trending down pretty consistently for the last 20 years, and then tick up a little in 2020 (to be expected) but that only gets it to 9th in the rankings. Ah I hear you say, but the lockdowns saved us. Well I ran those numbers. The most pessimistic estimates were 500,000 dead in the UK. So let's split that over 2 years (unlikely the pandemic would naturally burn itself out in 1 year) and assume that 100% of those deaths were completely avoidable i.e. they aren't people who were just due to die anyway, but rather these are extra purely covid deaths.

That would put 2020 and 2021 roughly 3rd and 4th in the ranking here. So, had we done nothing and just let the virus rip throw society, we would see death on a scale not witnessed since...2004???

So this isn't the Spanish Flu, it's not the Black Death, and it's not the T-virus. We didn't have lockdowns in 2004-2005, we don't need them now.

EDIT: OK when I hit submit it screws up the formatting, so for clarity I've removed them all except 2001, the deadliest year, 2019, the least deadly, and 2020 which is the one we're interested in and would be 9th place if I'd left the other entries in.",,,1610298967,{},gis14oi,False,t3_ktmtm5,False,True,t1_girkjw3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ktmtm5/daily_discussion_thread_january_09_2021/gis14oi/,1610339504,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

(Assume no ventilation). Are there any cases of someone walking into a room 15, 30, 60, 90 minutes afterwards and getting COVID? 

The number I often see as an upper bound is ""3 hours"" but as far as I know that's [based on this study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmc2004973) which *ended* after 3 hours, seeing ~1log decrease.

This would be true except that we typically vaccinate 3M people a day with the flu vaccine (10x the current pace). We can't use some of these exact channels because of the cold storage requirements of the mRNA vaccines. So approving Astrazeneca would allow us to use our existing vaccination channels. So you can keep giving the mRNA vaccines as fast as possible, but also through different channels Astrazeneca.

In addition, the peak vaccination target should probably be something like &gt;10M doses manufactured for the US per day. This is beyond the manufacturing capacity of Pfizer and Moderna (which combined are targeting like 2M per day for the US).

I am hoping the Biden team comes in and really asks hard why all these other countries can use this tool and have safely rolled it out to hundreds of thousands (or millions by that point), but the US has it banned.

It is indeed quite strange if it is handled like that.

How it should be done:

1. You would constantly maintain a stock of doses guaranteed to have the second dose ready to go for those people that need it.
2. At the same time you would keep bringing even more vaccine in the stock to start the vaccination process with the first dose for those people who need it.

Pretty simple, really.

what's better? 

100M at 80%

or 50M at 95%

&amp;#x200B;

yes, 80 y/o are high risk for severe disease,

but young doctors are not, but they are **exposed**.

so they get the shots first.

&amp;#x200B;

exposure risk is part of prioritization - because of spread.

I agree, and if you're my age you might remember this in the news: the Satanic Panic. If you don't know what this was this was late 80s/early 90s there was scandal after scandal about daycare workers/centres using the children in Satanic rituals, black masses etc. Proper Rosemary's Baby stuff, and it got really dark and really depraved. 

Lots of people went to jail for decades over this, and it was all fake. It was complete nonsense it was mass hysteria and (quite literally) a witch hunt. One kid has a nightmare which the parents take far too seriously, then the police get involved and through questioning end up gaslighting kids into believing they've been physically and sexually abused and it just spiraled from there into a nationwide mania.

I think this is much the same. Legitimate concern that your children are safe in daycare spirals into rampant paranoia and witch burning.

The problem with lockdowns is that restricting indoor dining, bars, etc. doesn't help if those activities just are occurring at people's houses instead. I'm pretty sure that's what's going on in CA.

Kwong’s fourth-floor lab was too crowded for McLellan, so he set up a workspace within earshot of Graham, and they became friends. “It didn't take long for him to come to me and say, I’d like to work on something other than HIV,” Graham recalls.
Past unsuccessful attempts to neutralize RSV with a vaccine had focused on the virus’s class 1 fusion protein, or F protein. In the wild, this protein is a shapeshifter, “like a Transformer toy,” Graham says. It can look one way before the RSV virus infects and enters a cell, and another way after the virus multiplies and escapes. These Jekyll-and-Hyde identities are known as the “prefusion” and “postfusion” states, and all vaccine attempts up until this point had focused on the latter.
To make matters trickier, the prefusion form is extremely unstable: It can irreversibly and spontaneously snap to its other state in an instant. Graham and McLellan hypothesized that they might create a more successful RSV vaccine if they could lock in the prefusion state. But no one knew what the prefusion protein looked like; they just knew it was a trickster.
So, McLellan used x-ray crystallography—a technique that uses x-ray beams to determine the structure of proteins—to capture an image of the prefusion protein for the first time. Some researchers would later say the prefusion F protein looked like a lollipop. McLellan thought it looked like a Nerf football. “You’re one of the first people in the world to see what this protein looks like,” he says. “It’s pretty cool.”
The work of Jason and Barney and others revolutionized the field.
Ruth Karron, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
By examining the protein at this atomic level, McLellan found a way to bioengineer it to take away its shape-shifting power. In other words, he stabilized it.
When Graham tested this new molecule in animals, it acted as an antigen and stimulated the immune system to fight disease. It had 50 times more neutralizing power against RSV than anything he had tested before. On the flip side, they also showed a postfusion version of the protein takes on an identity that can bypass the immune system’s defenses.
Their accomplishment won runner-up recognition in Science’s 2013 Breakthrough of the Year, and their work carved the way for new RSV vaccines that are showing great promise, Graham says.
“The work of Jason and Barney and others revolutionized the field,” says Ruth Karron, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the director of the Center for Immunization Research and the Johns Hopkins Vaccine Initiative.
The lucky last step
Five years ago, a postdoctoral fellow in Graham's laboratory returned from a trip to Saudi Arabia with a respiratory infection. Everyone assumed the fellow had Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), caused by a dangerous coronavirus that had arisen in the country two years earlier.
That emergence happened around the same time that McLellan launched his own lab at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. McLellan and Graham had been trying the prefusion trick on MERS, given that coronaviruses feature spike proteins that are also shapeshifters and are used to break into our cells. When Graham's lab tested the postdoc's nasal secretions, they found a related germ—and an opportunity that would pave their final steps toward a COVID-19 vaccine.
The postdoc had an older coronavirus: HKU1, a mild cold-causing bug that was discovered in 2005. The Graham-McLellan partnership decided to pivot their focus to HKU1 because MERS required extra safety precautions, and their research on the latter had hit a wall.
To capture a 3D picture of HKU1, McLellan would need a different method for taking atomic-level pictures. X-ray crystallography saturates proteins in a salt bath solution until they form crystals akin to rock candy. But due to their physical nature, coronaviruses don’t crystalize well. Cryogenic electron microscopy, or cryo-EM, is a technique that allows scientists to view proteins frozen in a thin layer of ice, bypassing the need for crystallization.
Proteins are so small that you can't use a regular light microscope to take a picture
… Read More Images by Daniel Wrapp, University of Texas at Austin
In 2015, structural biologist Andrew Ward was one of the leading cryo-EM experts in the U.S., so McLellan emailed his lab at Scripps Research in San Diego to ask if he had any interest in studying coronaviruses. Coincidentally, Ward had a postdoctoral fellow with a hankering to examine coronaviruses. They ultimately took thousands of images of HKU1 proteins.
McLellan used this 3D readout of HKU1 to make educated guesses at how to stabilize the spike proteins from its viral cousins, MERS and SARS. McLellan and Nianshuang Wang, his postdoctoral fellow, discovered that by adding two prolines—rigid amino acids—to MERS’s spike protein, they could prevent it from changing shape.
They called the tweak a 2P mutation and filed a patent for it in 2017. Around the same time, Graham’s lab partnered with biotech company Moderna to design an experimental mRNA vaccine for MERS. The two had worked together a year prior on a similar but separate project to combat the Zika virus—as part of a new movement for more comprehensive preparations against global outbreaks. The concept hinged on the detailed study of a prototypical member of a viral family—such as HKU1 or MERS—to build defenses against all future troublemakers from the same family like SARS-CoV-2.
Ultimately, experiments in animal models showed the MERS vaccine was successful, says Kizzmekia Corbett, a postdoctoral research fellow in Graham’s laboratory, and created a “portfolio of data” that the scientists knew they could apply to the new coronavirus.
The road to salvation
On January 6, 2020, just minutes after he took that phone call at the ski shop, McLellan messaged Wang and Daniel Wrapp, a graduate student, on WhatsApp.
“Barney is going to try and get the coronavirus sequence out of Wuhan, China,” McLellan wrote to them. “He wants to rush a structure and vaccine. You game?”
The two labs worked in concert with one another, determining the virus’s structure in about two weeks and using the 2P mutation to stabilize its proteins. Graham’s lab partnered with Moderna, and Corbett designed and executed clinical assessments to immunize mice with an mRNA vaccine made with the modified proteins starting in February. “When we got the first results from the mice, and they had a great antibody response, it was so gratifying,” Corbett says. By March 4, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had greenlit the Moderna vaccine for human trials.
At about the same time, Pfizer and BioNTech spoke with Graham about using the 2P mutation in their vaccine. Because their work was patented and widely published, other drugmakers—including Novavax and Johnson &amp; Johnson—also based their candidates on the design. Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine would become the first authorized in the U.S. after it showed an impressive 95-percent efficacy rate. Moderna’s vaccine was 94-percent effective.
(Related: Here’s the latest on COVID-19 vaccines.)
Further tests would be needed to judge how much the 2P mutation contributes to the overall efficacies of the frontrunner vaccines. Phil Dormitzer, Pfizer’s chief scientific officer and vice president of viral vaccines, says it’s “absolutely clear” that stabilizing prefusion proteins led to remarkable advances with potential RSV vaccines. “I’m very glad we picked those mutations to move forward,” he says, referring to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.
Graham doesn’t quite know how to answer when asked how it feels to have decades’ worth of work contribute to rapidly developed vaccines that could save hundreds of thousands of lives amid a harrowing global pandemic. “That's not the way we usually think about it,” he says. “I don’t think you really think that much about your feelings until you get to certain milestones.”
But the question—posed using the phrase “such a time as this”—makes Graham hearken back to the biblical tale of Esther, a queen who was made a royal for “such a time as this.”
“I have kind of felt like my whole career has been lining up for ‘such a time as this,’” Graham says.",,,1610236768,{},gipjf1j,False,t3_ktqe5w,False,False,t1_gioag8h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ktqe5w/they_spent_12_years_solving_a_puzzle_it_yielded/gipjf1j/,1610279248,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Long before anyone knew of SARS-CoV-2, a small band of government and university scientists uncovered a prototypical key that unlocked life-saving immunizations.
December 31, 2020
Jason McLellan was wandering around a ski shop of Utah’s Park City Mountain Resort, waiting for his new snowboarding boots to be heat-molded to his size-nine feet, when his smartphone rang. It was Barney Graham, deputy director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Vaccine Research Center.
Two days earlier, the World Health Organization had announced that several unidentified pneumonia-like cases had been reported in Wuhan, China. People were fatigued and feverish, with dry coughs and headaches. These symptoms weren’t unusual for early January, but some people were short of breath, and a few felt like they’d been hit by a train.
Graham told McLellan, a structural virologist at the University of Texas at Austin, that the ailment appeared to be a beta-coronavirus, meaning it fell into the genus of viruses that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). He asked McLellan: “Are you ready to get back in the saddle?”
This duo was part of a small band of government and university scientists who had spent more than a decade cracking a complex viral puzzle—and their skills were needed once more. Their years of sleuthing and innovating ultimately contributed a microscopic but critical piece to the most promising candidates for COVID-19 vaccines. Two already authorized in the U.S. use their discovery, as do at least two other top contenders.
Their solution? Tweaking a shape-shifting protein to make it sit still.

This wilderness crown jewel is opening for oil drilling. Why is industry interest so weak?
By the time McLellan landed in 2008 at the Vaccine Research Center in Bethesda, Maryland as an early-career researcher, Graham had been working on a little known but highly contagious disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus for more than 20 years. Both the cold-causing RSV and the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, feature genomes made of RNA. Although the two sit on distant branches of the evolutionary tree, they share a common physical trait that would yield the first key to McLellan and Graham's journey toward beating COVID-19.
Attempts to design an RSV vaccine had been riddled with hiccups since 1966 when a clinical trial inadvertently enhanced the illness in volunteers—and even caused the death of two infants. Graham wanted to understand why this drug candidate had failed so terribly.
Similar frustrations hovered around another germ under study at the Vaccine Research Center: HIV. McLellan had arrived at the center to train with Peter Kwong, a structural biologist tinkering with the structures of viral proteins in the hopes of engineering a vaccine that would stop AIDS. HIV rapidly mutates, so the researchers tried several structural biology tricks to develop vaccine candidates but ultimately failed to create one that elicited an immune response.

Also, this goes way beyond saving some people who are about to die anyway as you say.  According to CDC numbers about 20% of deaths are below age 65, so that's a significant hit to people in the work force, not to mention the hospitalizations and severe cases that would go on top of the deaths.  There are also wide-ranging and unpredictable effects to letting a disease spread uncontrollably through a community; businesses aren't going to be operating properly when all the employees are out sick at the same time, the health care system might get overloaded, more dangerous mutations might develop, and who knows what else.  Most of us probably aren't smart enough to even begin to comprehend the possible risks of leaving something like this out of control.

Finally I'd add that even when people are dying of covid at the age where they'd die naturally, they should actually be dying of natural causes with loved ones able to visit them, not getting basically tortured to death while completely alone.  A lot of people seem to forget this when they say ""but they were going to die anyway!""",,,1610253999,{},giqf9fo,False,t3_ktmtm5,False,True,t1_gipjkjb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ktmtm5/daily_discussion_thread_january_09_2021/giqf9fo/,1610299911,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Until now, mostly young people got Covid-19 in this wave. In Japanese television they give often the count of each age group. Because there are more young people infected, the deaths are so low, I think.

If this continues, it could get worse.

However my hunch is that far more are already dying but they are underreporting. The reason for my assumption is: I read that only very severe cases get admitted into hospitals. Everyone else should isolate at home but some people died at home because of this too. They are found later dead in their homes.

If this counts as a Covid-19 death or not, I don't know. Also testing is still expensive.

Pfizer themselves didn't do an analysis on 14 days after dose 1,  but the data they do have has mirrored moderna almost exactly, coupled with that graph that flattens around day 14, it's pretty obvious Pfizer gets nearly full immunity around day 14.

Whether that results in a large workforce that can’t just sit at home and work, or receive stimulus and the health care system is inadequate and poorly funded.  Testing has also been limited, so the numbers are much worse in reality than being reported.  Additionally, I wouldn’t trust the government to report accurately either.  To give you an idea of the trust level Mexicans have for officials, over 90% of crimes go unreported.  The police, military or government are not trusted by the vast majority of citizens and for good reason. 


The government has also been completely useless at best, but I would argue they made the situation much worse through inaction.


Another main factor is that a lot of the population doesn’t have the ability to work from home.  Especially the poorer parts of the population that need to go out and work or sell stuff to be able to afford to live.  Many shops just can’t afford to or have access to tech solutions that the richest countries have access to. Things like using ubereats or selling online or offering curb side pick up just isn’t a reality for most businesses.


There are a ton of other reasons, but the main thing to know is that it’s impossible to expect a country like Mexico to handle the pandemic the way rich nations can.

&gt; The new variant’s genetic changes appear to have increased its transmissibility by about 56%, according to the new research, though it could be as low as 40% and as high as 70%.

&gt; With this competitive advantage, it will quickly become the most commonly encountered strain in any region where it gains a toehold. As it does so, coronavirus infections — and the increased illness, hospitalizations and deaths that result — will blow up.

&gt; “The bottom line is it will be harder to control this new variant if it takes over,” said Ira Longini, a University of Florida infectious disease modeler who was not involved in either of the British studies.

&gt; And it will take over, he added.

In the 50's and 60's the US added regulations prohibiting certain materials in clothing that easily caught fire like rayon. In 1975 this expanded to children's pajamas. This was a big crisis at the time and everyone was unanimous in their support for the issue.

However statistically it was very rare and the subsequent decline in children being burned in fires probably had a lot more to do with a decrease in people smoking in their houses and having lighters and matches and candles. But nobody wanted to be on the other side of the issue -- arguing in favor of something that might harm children. So everyone lined up on one side of the issue in the name of caution.

Sound familiar? I don't think this phenomenon is a deliberate conspiracy or anything but is just group think human nature. I think the same thing is happening with Covid. Nobody wants to present or even entertain any argument besides the consensus that this is an out of control pandemic.

That said I do think that the world experienced significantly increased mortality especially in the March-July time frame. One thing I find interesting is that the amount of excess has been steadily declining even as reported cases and fatalities have been increasing. While the virus is clearly very dangerous and lethal to a lot of people, the number of excess deaths is just not keeping up with reported fatalities. So there is some kind of gap there. I suspect this is because of how the deaths are tallied. I think a majority of the fatalities are a zero sum game, the person died of Covid but was going to die of something else within a year or two anyway.

All of that said I don't think the concern is all fiction or that there is zero cause for alarm, but I do think that it is widely misunderstood. When everyone in the world suddenly agrees on something then you know that there must be something wrong with the data and reasoning.

You might also find this interesting.

Not directly, but the HEK-293 cell line was used in testing the Pfizer vaccine and the AstroZenica vaccine. HEK-293 was established from an embryotic kidney aborted in 1973. When i say that they tested on fetus cells, i'm not saying that they hit up a Planned Parenthood for fetal cells and tested the vaccine on the sludge. They used HEK-293 to propagate the virus and then test the vaccine against it. And even though the HEK 293 cells that were used are not the *same cells* that the fetus once grew, and even though these cells are not *inside* the vaccine, Catholics do not want anything to do with something related to an abortion. Hence why the Pope made a statement on the morality of the vaccine, telling people that they were not sinning by taking it. 

Here's a statement on the controversy from December, from the Offices of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: [https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/it/bollettino/pubblico/2020/12/21/0681/01591.html#ing](https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/it/bollettino/pubblico/2020/12/21/0681/01591.html#ing)

 ""The fundamental reason for considering the use of these vaccines morally licit is that the kind of cooperation in evil (*passive material cooperation*) in the procured abortion from which these cell lines originate is, on the part of those making use of the resulting vaccines, *remote*. The moral duty to avoid such passive material cooperation is not obligatory if there is a grave danger, such as the otherwise uncontainable spread of a serious pathological agent\[3\]--in this case, the pandemic spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19. It must therefore be considered that, in such a case, all vaccinations recognized as clinically safe and effective can be used in good conscience with *the certain knowledge that the use of such vaccines does not constitute formal cooperation with the abortion* from which the cells used in production of the vaccines derive. It should be emphasized, however, that the morally licit use of these types of vaccines, in the particular conditions that make it so, does not in itself constitute a legitimation, even indirect, of the practice of abortion, and necessarily assumes the opposition to this practice by those who make use of these vaccines.""",,,1610314638,{},gisw9eq,False,t3_kudwj1,False,True,t1_gispymk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kudwj1/pope_francis_calls_opposition_to_covid_vaccine/gisw9eq/,1610357295,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
