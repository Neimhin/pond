I'm leaning against costochondritis myself because of the specific symptoms and popping feelings I've felt in certain positions. I had a second doctor rule it out for the time being since they literally checked nothing else beforehand and the main symptoms weren't lining up. It's still possible though, but the fact that the one doctor that was subbing for my normal doctor that day came in, told me I had it and that there is nothing they can do besides maybe give pain killers, which I turned down because I don't want anything like that, kind of left me pissed off since besides an x-ray where they saw nothing, they only did an ultrasound of my organs. No checking for anything else.

All I'm certain of is that it started right after a jerking injury at the gym that made me twist hard and fast. And I've been able to ""pop"" that area a ton since then in very certain positions.

&gt; More than 30 antigen tests have been developed in the U.S. — but just six companies have authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for over-the-counter use. No rapid tests have full FDA approval. Two rapid molecular options, made by Lucira Health and Cue Health, also have emergency use authorization.

&gt; ""As long as these tests are regulated as medical devices, the FDA has to regulate them not as critical public health tools, but as medical tools, with all of the onerous clinical trials that slow everything down 100-fold,"" Mina said on Twitter.

&gt; With only a handful of rapid tests on the market, it is harder for companies that haven't yet gotten FDA authorization to catch up and, in turn, drive the prices down, said Michael Greeley, a co-founder and general partner at Flare Capital Partners, a venture capital firm focused on health care technology

At first it was to prevent, now it's to reduce. First it was to never be able to spread the virus, now you can still spread the virus. 

Take a hard look at how ""effective"" the emergency vaccines are. How effective is the 3rd shot? How effective will the subsequent 4th &amp; 5th shot be as the virus continues to mutate as it harbors in your vaccined bodies. 

Additionally, from all of the above, the misinformation we were given by the government &amp; political pushers, now anything negative said about the vaccines get shunned or get you banned from speaking on it.

Both times I was asked, it seemed more that it was for documenting purposes, rather than policing things, though I'm not sure - because it was affiliated with my health network, I don't know if they had access to see my list of diagnoses and medications.  

There was another woman there for her third dose who told me that she has diabetes and she's getting it even though that's not on the list of reasons.  She seemed to get her dose with no issue.

I got 3rd dose Moderna.  My first dose I had a sore arm and that was pretty much it.  My second dose I had a sore arm, fatigue, and one night had a night sweat.

A really big issue is how poorly women are treated by the medical system. A lot of OB/GYNs don't seem to understand what informed consent is and this is undoubtedly turning people away from seeking actual medical care. Historically, doctors treat the person giving birth as disponible and have done a lot of things that hurt them to make their lives easier (i.e. routine episodemies, husband stitches, ""Don't push until the doctor is here,"" ""We're doing a c-section so I can watch the game tonight,"" ect.). If you go to, for example, r/TwoXChromosomes, there are a ton of stories of doctors just treating women like garbage.  
  
Doctors routinely lie to and gaslight women about how painful procedures are and what kind of side effects they can expect. It only takes a couple ""Yeah so we're going to burn a hole into your cervix but I, a man, personally know that it isn't painful so you're just a dramatic cry baby... That didn't hurt so stop crying and get out"" for people to lose trust in doctors. I feel like this is especially true with pregnancy/birth where it's still pretty taboo to talk about it as anything other than puppies and rainbows when, in reality, it's a bloody and traumatic process.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I always read arguments like: 

* Usually, long term side effects imply long term exposure. E.g. you need to take some medication for 10 years but that medication takes it's toll on some organ =&gt; You die because the medication fucked up your organ. Or whatever.
* We know vaccines very good. There was never a vaccine with a long term issue. All issues showed in 3 weeks at max. We are way past that.

Now while those seem to make sense, people usually counter the first one with: How do you know that's the case for a absolutely new technology like mRNA vaccines? Who says that I won't get some issue 2, 5 or 20 years from now?

and the second one with: All previous vaccines were based on different technologies, e.g. protein based or ""dead virus"" based. Not mRNA based.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of those people wait for protein based vaccines (e.g. novavax) because then, those two points become valid again.

&amp;#x200B;

They are trying to get it down to zero prior to vaccination getting to a certain level. It's literally the stated aim despite your blathering, mate.

&gt;It’s true that it can still be passed around by vaccinated people, but the amount of severe illness and hospitalisations are far less when vaccinated and when the majority are.

That's obvious to everyone, but still doesn't have anything to do with the strategy and if anything makes a zero or near-zero policy even sillier.

&gt;You can’t make assumptions or draw conclusions only related to the knowledge of how things work where you are. A place with all the vaccines necessary and more.

Nothing stopped NZ or Australia from procuring vaccines. They just made a public health decision that was lauded at the time but the shortcomings of which are becoming apparent. Somewhat balanced out by the fact that deaths have been minimal, but plenty have written about how the exit plan is extremely compromised by Delta potentially running through a population with near zero immunity the moment you open up even slightly, and even with strong vaccination coverage; see Singapore.

&gt;Until they can get all the vaccines they need it is the obvious strategy. And you are bonkers for running your mouth about things you have no knowledge of. Mate.

It really isn't, and unfortunately you'll see it the moment any sort of border reopening happens, but I can tell many Kiwis take any criticism of their policy far too personally and get defensive now that it's clear that they won't be able to travel well into 2022 while the rest of the world has been for months.",,,,1631533838,{},hcohrr6,False,t3_pn9y4t,False,True,t1_hcogxkn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pn9y4t/auckland_lockdown_extended_for_at_least_another/hcohrr6/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,9614213d8e603dcab63262d865de9306a79e6b53,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1631533850.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Things seemed to work out fine so we made the right choice. 

According to this article - the CDC didn't issue firm guidance until Aug 11th after she had been hospitalized.

If it's been known for a while, why did the CDC wait? Who do we listen to? The CDC? The WHO? Our personal care physician? The attending nurses (which to our horror in the delivery ward were not all vaxxed? ) The internet? CNN? Fox News? Your sister in law?

75% of adults are vaccinated, that's just over 51% of the population. But a lot of the population is ineligible for a vaccination. The vast majority of those that are eligible got the jab. Have we reached herd immunity? How far do we have to go? Do we know? No we don't know.

There's a lot that's not known. It's as much a guessing game or a ""wait and see"" as it is science. Remember when it was impossible to have a vaccine as quickly as we did? Then we did. Many of those that now say go get the jab, were cautioning against it not too long ago.

The lack of empathy and sanctimony from the vaccinated towards those that are not is stunning. Sure some people are idiots that'll never get the vaxx no matter what.

The reason we have so many breakthrough cases is the emergence of a new dominant variant, Delta, to which antibodies (for Wuhan-Hu1) have 8 times less  affinity. Your antibodies from the 3rd-dose might not stop infection from the next variant.

&gt;While Covid vaccine **effectiveness against mild disease may wane over time**, protection against severe disease may persist, the scientists said. That’s because the body’s immune system is complex, they said, and has other defenses besides antibodies that may protect someone from getting seriously sick.


I guess the question really becomes: do we want to use booster shots to limit the effectiveness against mild disease or not?

I assume by effectiveness against mild disease, they mean actually catching covid.

The main point of the vaccines was to protect against severe/death - it ended up being a bonus that they protected against catching covid too.  But now that we have vaccines that DO protect against catching covid - I am of the opinion we should be boosting people to keep that protection going.

NZ at least has plenty of vaccines now. It's only a matter of getting jabs in arms as fast as people can queue up.  We have already gone above the peak daily rates of the US, UK and Canada.  A total of 76% of the eligible population has made their vaccine appointments, with 66% having had their first jab now.  In Auckland where the outbreak is numbers are even higher, with close to 3% of the population getting a jab each day in the last week.  

The hope in NZ is to hold off on opening the border until kids can be jabbed, which would give us much higher vaccination rates than in Singapore right now.  There is also the possibility boosters in Q1 2022 will provide better protection, as Israel is experimenting with now.  NZ has Novavax already lined up for boosters in early 2022.  

There is no doubt we will have a big wave of Covid when the border relaxes even a little.  The only question is how long can we hold that off.  If we have Delta breaching MIQ every month, we will probably give up elimination by the end of the year.

One of the results of previous pandemic threats like SARS or the Swine Flu was that public health shouldn't necessarily wait for the science when it comes to a new virus that they're needing time to study. Many of the reports I read during the spring of 2020 recommended that public health should adopt the precautionary principle, essentially that they should assume the worst case scenario until they had good data to the contrary. That would be that they should have assumed SARS-CoV-2 was an airborne respiratory virus, and implemented precautions for that, including universal masking.

It took the better part of a year to get good data on masking, and only in the last 6-8 months has the fact that it *is* airborne really started being accepted.

Oh look you own link debunks your assertion that “exercise is a no-no if you want to avoid long covid.” We just watched you deflect from your goalposts and try to commandeer mine. 

From your own link:

&gt; The truth is, the disease can affect everyone differently,” says Dr. Schaefer. “Anyone, including young athletes, could experience a severe case or have long-term damage, which is why it’s so important to take this seriously.”

&gt; This is especially true with active individuals, as it can be difficult to tell what long-term effects someone is going to have after they recover from the virus. Some people might fare just fine and will be able to jump back into their old training regiment, while others will find that their athletic performance just isn’t what it used to be.

&gt; **For the majority of athletes and active people, returning to activity will likely be a slow process and will require patience. You should work with a healthcare provider to make sure you’re progressing appropriately and monitoring your symptoms.**

Thanks for the link!

For his efforts, he was pilloried by the far right (which is about 80% of the people who vote Republican in Idaho). The Lt. Governor smelled blood in the water and started her push to run for his office. Since Idaho did not see a New York City level event Idahoans began to believe idiotic ideas like,"" Well maybe we're just healthier here than in New York and live a different life and we just had silent spread in the fall of 2019."" \[no, I am not kidding\]. At the same time Amon Bundy was running around being the asshat that he is.

Gov. Little now knows that any push to force lockdowns or *any* kind of mandate will result in severe and immediate pushback from the far right in the state. Worse, the insanely dumb Lieutenant Governor will almost certainly be a shoe-in for governor. So, he's been trying to ride the edge.

The high risk people who were vulnerable got vaccinated and it's helping those individuals. Admittedly some very few of them do end up in hospitals but their outcome look way better than unvaccinated. We're getting 30-50 year old unvaccinated; stlil rarer but more frequency of 18-30 y/o as well. Some look a little overweight. Some look regularly fit and healthy/skinny and athletic. They still need oxygen therapy. Some recover with just high flow nasal cannula. Others require more intensive O2 therapy by using nonrebreather and on the list of o2 masks until finally despite how many support we throw at the patient, they keep desatting to critical levels that we intubate them.

I'm not sure how it is in other ICUs but in one ICU wing here, there's 10 beds for patients and 2 of those patients are overweight and 1 morbidly obese. The rest are actually within pretty good BMI. I can't say if these 10 patients typically live a physically active life but at the very least being that they aren't obese or have health conditions due to weight, they are healthy. But we're getting younger patients as higher frequency, higher frequency of cases where comorbidity isn't really a major factor rather than the disease of covid itself. Obviously this doesn't mean comorbidities are no longer a factor; but it does highlight that people who were not within the vulnerable risk group will need to be careful and take caution.

There's no magic treatment plan to cure covid. Hospitals are basically supporting your body so that it can heal on its own. The vaccine is THE breakthrough that people have been waiting for in dealing with covid.

&gt;The outbreak affected one in five of the fully vaccinated residents of the facility and also included two who were partially vaccinated -- they had received one dose of the two-shot Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine -- and one who was not vaccinated, the data showed.   
            
&gt;Of the 17 total residents infected, eight developed severe illness, two were hospitalized and one -- the person who had not been vaccinated -- died.  
                
&gt;All of the cases involved the Alpha, or ""U.K.,"" variant, researchers said.  
              
&gt;At the time of the outbreak, 70 of the 74 residents were fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, while two were partially vaccinated, meaning they had received one dose of the two-shot vaccine.  
        
&gt;Two of the nursing home residents were not vaccinated, according to the researchers.  
        
&gt;Along with the outbreak among residents, 12 of the 102 facility staff members also were infected, the data showed.  
       
&gt;However, only one-third of the staff was fully vaccinated at the time of the outbreak, the researchers said.  
       
&gt;Of the 12 cases, nine occurred in unvaccinated staff members, according to the researchers.

This is exactly what I was talking about. Letting a hysteric population without adequate knowledge deplete mask stocks at gouged prices while healthcare workers cannot access them is definitely detrimental to public health.

&gt;“There’s no evidence that wearing masks on healthy people will protect them,”

This was definitely correct at the time, and this statement is not something that indicates incompetence. The basic principles of evidence based medicine dictate that nothing should be administered without having conclusive evidence that it works in the specific setting and context of use, in the absence of a highly probable and large net benefit, which was definitely not the case in early 2020.

&gt;They wear them incorrectly, and they can increase the risk of infection because they’re touching their face more often.”

This is still true, however there is now a large body of evidence that does conclusively indicate that *public usage of masks* is beneficial regardless of this.

Anyways, I got my first dose in March, tested positive for COVID three days later, and then got better and got my second dose on time in April. I'm the only person I know who got COVID between doses.


My psoriasis got really really bad a few months back, so I went back on the injections. Because of them I was advised to get the third booster which I did about 3 weeks ago.


So.... I have 3 vaccine doses and had COVID all within the past 6 months. But I have a very suppressed immune system and the studies are only now coming together on effectiveness of the vaccine with immunosuppressants.

The goal is for people to start receiving a COVID-19 booster shot beginning in the fall, with individuals being eligible starting 8 months after they received their second dose of an mRNA vaccine (either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna). This is subject to authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and recommendation by CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). FDA is conducting an independent evaluation to determine the safety and effectiveness of a booster dose of the mRNA vaccines. ACIP will decide whether to issue a booster dose recommendation based on a thorough review of the evidence.""

In the area, antisemitic incidents doubled in a single year (2020). Racism is way up, but to be frank, it’s always been like this. It was just more carefully hidden. My mom had to stop going to church when I was four because people kept harassing my Jewish father. Another incident involved fans of my high school football team shouting antisemitic chants at a rival during games, which I wasn’t there for but I did learn about growing up. There were plenty of other incidents growing up, but I still didn’t really hate Ohio till the pandemic. Even though there were many bad incidents, the good truly outweighed the bad. I honestly forgot about many of these incidents, and I generally focused on the good. The pandemic was a process that truly made me hate Ohio. It’s a shame because there are a lot of great people in the area. My best friends, my family, and my sweet dog still live there. I’m off to college right now, but I still want to visit to see my dog, family, and friends. I’m fine with Ohio for a blue moon or two, but I can’t live there again. It’s weird because I did a total 180 on living in Ohio after the pandemic. To be fair, I grew up in a place that truly was on the fringe of the Cleveland-Akron area (I was near the borders of Summit, Portage, Cuyahoga, and Geauga counties in a development that used to be farmland and still contains a few farms). It’s interesting because frankly I blame Trump for everything. He nurtured this culture of hate and brought it straight to the surface. You have to remember that the Northeast Ohio area is one of the spots that took the hardest turn right during the Trump years. I’m sorry if this isn’t the clearest telling of why I no longer like Ohio, but this is as good as I can get it. It truly is a shame, and I’m glad you never got the memories that I have from it. I think everywhere you live creates a history of good and bad memories. Usually, the good outweighs the bad, but I guess circumstance has flipped that for me. I wish I didn’t have my first year of college online, because maybe then I wouldn’t have seen all the crappy things people did during the pandemic. The earlier incidents were quite minor to what I saw during the pandemic. Maybe I could’ve have kept the image of a sweet and kind Ohio in my mind if I wasn’t here through more than a year of pandemic.

That being said, there's some faults I find in their methodology, and the scope is very limited (and the paper is too new to be replicated) The CD147 receptor was confirmed as a secondary viral entry point. The authors in the study below used knock In mice with hCD147 and showed viral entry in that platform, given no other receptors

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-020-00426-x

They point to the ""rather low"" ACE2 percentage in the lungs I. The introduction however, that's a bit misleading when you can't remove the fact that the majority of studied human cases and hospitalizable cases occur in individuals trend generally above the mean age of 32. The mean age for hospitalization Is somewhere around 60 or so, and they would have overwhelming amounts of ACE2 in their lungs, not just CD147. ACE2 is also available in overwhelming quantities in the Pericytes. So to point out that CD147 mediated viral entry contributes to inflammation in the heart, I believe it. But to make the claim its ~leading ~ needs a lot more evidence. I don't discount it though. 

In the study you linked they described it in the condition of just the spike protein. Even in the serological tests. They identified it as a non infectious route in vitro which is not supported by other in vivo studies

They also used the Sera only to show S protein was present in seroconverted blood, but what they did not used pericytes  from those individuals though which would have been very different 5-10 days post infection, having already been infected through the ACE2 entry pathway. They point to the mechanism of pericyte damage caused by release of interleukins and cytokines, which In an in vivo disease model would have been free floating in the Sera and would have already been causing apoptosis in the heart, especially from pericytes infected through ACE2.

They also normalized spike concentration data by age, and instead it would have been better to used a weighted normalization based on the national median age of infection,  or the median age of cardiac failure due to covid inflammation.

The other thing, and one variable they admit to in the discussion section is the inability to properly distinguish Spike without any other structures in the sero samples. Which would not be ~JUST~ spike in vivo. The in vitro study does suggest that their proposal for binding does occur in their recombinant cells though using homemade spike, which they support through a citation to likely be using the S1 subunit which would be in closed conformation. Which is definitely some good new information. 

So you pointed out some faults in my initial understanding, but a lot of what I read still supports the other stuff I've read. Since this study is super super limited in scope, their implication that pericyte inflammation is more specifically mediated by cd147 than other entry points is a bit misleading in the lack of other variables accounted for, but is supported under the specific scope. 

This has less Clear implications during covid infection, and more so implications outside of coivd infection with lasting heart inflammation after the virus has cleared, given that is when the soluble S protein in concentrations lower than replicating virus would be present and be the more likely cause of inflammation in those cases.

Or this how I've interpreted the study, science is interpretable, and you can gather lots of different perceptions from the same text.

I don't really understand? All countries always have laws that can get broken constantly every day by a lot of people - like speed limits in trafic.

A law about not saying false things this would work like speed limits work in most countries I guess. A lot of people would get away with breaking it, and then habitual breaker would get a fine once in a while.

It also depends how the law is made. Maybe you'd say ""you're not allowed to say false things and claim it is the mainstream scientific view."" But you would be allowed to say ""I have no scientific basis for this but I think that..."" Probably this could never be illegal.

A court can have to decide about where it was unsafe practice to use some technological gizmo in a car. Judges and lawyer's aren't car engineers, so they call in experts, hear them out and make a decision. 

To decide if masks are a good idea are not is probably much easier than some of the stuff they get.

As regarding to courts disagreeing - this happens already I guess, and then there's a whole system of appeals and so on. I don't know the US system very well, but I think it just ends up at the supreme courst if the issue is very thorny?

&gt;So something suddenly becomes a fact once you cross state lines? You don’t see any issues with that?

I think it's like this already? Again I don't know the US legal system so well.

I think its saying that all of us have a spike protein in our blood that's a lot like the spikes on COVID. I don't mean we've all gotten it recently, I mean, like probably for hundreds of years humans have had this protein in their blood. It just happens to be a doppleganger for COVID's spike. They get mistaken for twins all the time when they run into each other at the grocery store.

We also have an anti-spike protein in our blood that causes swelling.

Before COVID, if your body was in balance, non-COVID friendly spike proteins would interact with the friendly anti-spike proteins throughout your body and change them into something else that doesn't make the area swell. This would suppress the anti-spike proteins everywhere and there wouldn't be any swelling.

When you catch COVID, the immune system identifies anyone wearing spikes as a ""bad person"" and orders all of them executed. For some people, one of two things is happening: 1) the immune system executes a ton of friendly spikes, too, or 2) the blood isn't getting enough new friendly spike replacements after COVID is under control. This throws the balance off and allows the friendly anti-spikes to go bananas, at least in some areas. This causes lots of swelling, and I think this triggers another immune system response. This appears to be the mechanism causing long-term COVID.

The article doesnt say this, but the people who defeat COVID fairly easily must be doing something different. maybe protecting their friendly spikes, replenishing them well to keep the blood in balance, or their immune system undergoes a shift post-infection to stop attacking friendly spikes. maybe something else more complicated.",,,,1631498160,{},hcn3d3s,False,t3_pn44x6,False,False,t1_hcmqmhl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pn44x6/arkansas_researchers_find_possible_cause_of/hcn3d3s/,1631609148.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This Week in Virology is the best source for current information on Covid, as well as other pathological viruses. The host Vincent has been teaching Virology at Columbia University for years, and he wrote the textbook on Virology that's used everywhere. I have the textbook. Give it a try, you spend one hour listening to them and you will not regret it. He has a panel of other virologists as well as immunologists. I have about 500 journal articles in my pdf files but most of them are older. 

 I don't know what other commenter is talking about, with natural immunity is 6x greater. I haven't heard that. Last episode they were talking about the natural immunity for people who got the original variant, which primes the system to create antibodies that can be used against different variants, while the vaccines haven't been able to do that so far, but they think that some months after vaccination, some of this type of flexibility will occur. They also think that the vaccines would have worked better if they had more time in between them, i.e., they would be lasting longer, but with a raging pandemic they had to get 2 into people as quickly as possible. This is why they think the booster will really boost the immunity a lot more, because it will be months after the last dose. The natural immunity, they say, will wane also, and they think that will happen much quicker than the waning of the vaccines, unless someone had a severe infection. They doubt that people who had very mild infections initially have very strong immuniy, especially if a lot of time has gone by.
So there are all kinds of other factors, and then there is immunity from T and B cells which is not measured by antibody tests. 

They conclude for now that vaccines are much better than natural immunity because they are more of a known quantity, and even thouh they are wearing off, that waning when be greater in a natural infection. And of course,they don't want to suggest that anyone just remain unvaccinated so they will get a natural infection. People can't rely on having been infected last year, because they may have had a mild infection, and in any case that immunity would be wearing off by now.

&gt; Production and purification of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein 

&gt; SARS-CoV-2 S protein was expressed in insect cells and purified as described previously.(33, 34) 
Briefly, the S construct encoded amino acids 1 to 1213 (extracellular domain) fused with a thrombin 
cleavage site, followed by a T4-foldon trimerisation domain and a hexahistidine affinity purification 
tag at the C-terminus. The polybasic furin cleavage site was mutated (RRAR to A) to increase the 
stability of the protein for in vitro studies.(33, 34) S protein was expressed in Hi5 cells using the 
MultiBac system.(35) Secreted S protein was harvested 3 days after infection by centrifuging the cell 
culture at 1,000g for 10 min followed by another centrifugation of supernatant at 5,000g for 30 min. S 
protein-containing medium was incubated with HisPur Ni-NTA Superflow Agarose (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) for 1h at 4ºC. Resin bound with S protein was separated from unbound proteins and medium 
using a gravity flow column, followed by 30 column volume wash with wash buffer (65 mM NaH2PO4, 
300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.5). Finally, the protein was eluted with a step gradient of elution 
buffer (65 mM NaH2PO4, 300mM NaCl, 235mM imidazole, pH 7.5). Eluted fractions were analysed 
by reducing SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing the S protein were pooled and concentrated using 50 kDa 
MWCO Amicon centrifugal filter units (EMD Millipore). During concentration, proteins were buffer-
exchanged in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.5. Concentrated protein was aliquoted, flash frozen 
in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80ºC until use.",,,,1631505659,{},hcnhskv,False,t3_pmszpf,False,True,t1_hcne4os,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pmszpf/covid19_spike_protein_binds_to_and_changes_cells/hcnhskv/,1631616151.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The French Laundry dinner got more press than it should have, it was one time, he admitted the wrong, and apologized. I wish it hadn't happened, but it wasn't as egregious as certain political parties want to make people think. There are lots of other governors that did far worse, either in actuality or by non-action. I don't love him, but this recall is a ridiculous dog and pony show that's costing $276m  dollars to replace a guy who is literally up for re-election in a year. The frontrunner to replace him is every R talking point (on the pandemic and otherwise) rolled into one. I am not a healthcare professional so I can't speak to OP's comment about quitting, but I can understand the general frustration that any gains we've made (and we are doing better on the covid front) could be instantly undone with Larry Elder as the governor, even for just the remaining year or so of the term that he is 'running' to replace Newsom for. Elder has campaigned on actively undoing mask mandates, vaccine progress, and any common sense covid restrictions. LA's current spike began slowly trending down when the mask mandate was reinstated. We're getting there. We saw how bad it was when we jumped the gun last year, and even the rising vax numbers couldn't hold off Delta enough to keep us from spiking again when we removed the masks. I'm not suggesting anything close to a lockdown, nor do I think that would work. All I want is a governor not actively working against the progress that has been made.  
  
Again, I don't love Newsom and would be the first to vote against him in next summer's primary in favor of a good challenger. But that's just it. The election to replace him legitimately is so close. I'd rather punish him then than fuck up any progress we've made with Covid and a bunch of other things. At best the recall is an unnecessary distraction.

[],,paperbackgarbage,,,[],,,,text,t2_jbyda,False,False,[],"**The U.S. is falling to the lowest vaccination rates of the world’s wealthiest democracies.**

Japan initially struggled to get its Covid-19 vaccination program into full gear, but now that it has, the percentage of its population that has received at least one dose has edged past the level achieved in the United States — leaving Americans last for that category among the world’s seven wealthiest large democracies.

The turning point came on Thursday, when Our World in Data, a project by the University of Oxford in England, reported that 62.16 percent of Japanese people were at least partially vaccinated, compared to 61.94 percent of Americans.

For the moment, the United States retains a slightly larger percentage of fully vaccinated people than Japan, 52.76 percent compared to 50.04 percent, according to Our World in Data, ranking sixth out of the Group of 7 nations, after Britain, Canada, France, Germany, and Italy. But the United States appears all but certain to fall to last place among the Group of 7 nations shortly, given the rapid pace of achieving full vaccinations in Japan and the extremely slow rate in the United States.

Between July 24 and Sept. 9, the full vaccination rate in the United States grew by around 4 percent, while in the same period Japan lifted its level by 25 percent, a jump that doubled the size of its fully vaccinated population. Using doses made by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, Japan is administering more than a million vaccine doses per day, some 300,000 above the U.S. average, even though the U.S. population is more than 2.6 times the size of Japan’s.

In Japan, new cases have fallen sharply from a peak of 23,083 on Aug. 25 to 11,347 on Friday, though Japan did confront a dramatic rise in new cases in July and August, coinciding with the Olympics. In the United States, cases spiked starting in early July.

Canada leads the G7 countries in vaccination rates, with almost three-quarters of its population at least partially vaccinated as of Thursday, according to Our World in Data. France, Italy and Britain follow, with percentages between 70 and 73. Germany’s rate is just ahead of Japan’s, at around 65 percent.

The U.S. vaccination curve has leveled dramatically since an initial surge in the first half of this year, when the vaccine first became widely available. In a push to vaccinate the roughly 80 million Americans who are eligible for shots but have not gotten them, President Biden on Thursday mandated that two-thirds of American workers, including health care workers and the vast majority of federal employees, be vaccinated against the coronavirus.

Cases are rampant in those age 0-18, but illness and death is rare, and that group has a very low level of vaccination. So when you see a ""case"" it depends a LOT on the age. 

Many people are very worried about their kids getting covid but statistically there is almost nothing to worry about, to the point that some areas do not even recommend vaccinating kids.

Admittedly it's a small study with only 90 volunteers, but that's normal for Phase 1.

It's a misconception that vaccines need to be tested for years for long-term effects - there are no recorded cases of any vaccine ever causing delayed effects that aren't apparent within the first few months after vaccination, nor is there any plausible mechanism for how they could possibly do that. mRNA vaccines are not that different, and we do have the Zika trial from 5 years ago.

[],,PaintingWithLight,,,[],,,,text,t2_805zo,False,False,,"I mean I’ve pondered the thought, though relative to the particular points in time in the covid timeline numbers, what number we are really at. This is one thing I have looked deeper into; when someone dies, and had covid months before but “recovered,” and they die of a heart attack, embolism, pneumonia, it’s definitely not marked as a covid death right?
I understand I can go look up excess deaths for each mortality cause and refine the estimates in my head. But could it already be 1 million due to covid technically? 

Not because hospitals were full, but because covid caused some ripples even after “recovery,” to some people. 

If for example, things we’ll likely never know, x amount of deaths that weren’t going to happen due to heart attack, or stroke, or embolisms, or any other cause of mortality, but did because covid caused it down the line.  What could that number possibly be? Probably will never find out. 

I’ve always had a fear from the beginning of longer term issues, or stuff after “recovery,” and it didn’t help that a friend, who’s healthy, an athlete, in his early 30s, was double vaxxed, has no family history of heart problems, had a minor heart attack recently some time after a covid infection.

Out of 569k unvaccinated cases, there were 35k hospitalized

Out of 46k vaccinated cases, there were 3k hospitalized

These numbers are from the period while delta was ramping up it's prevalence. It's probably actually worse than that in a mostly delta scenario like what the UK is experiencing. 

The interesting thing is that what you're saying about reduced hospitalization for vaccinated persons isn't shown in these numbers, in both vaccinated and unvaccinated about 6% of people with a confirmed COVID case are hospitalized. Obviously far less cases in the vaccinated people, but they're still catching it quite regularly. 

In the UK, 6% of the unvaccinated (at 80% Vaccination) means 6% of 13 million, or just shy of 800k people unvaccinated will be hospitalized. 

If that same 6% applies to vaccinated people as they catch it, that means 6% of the total population will be hospitalized, which would be 3 million people hospitalized . Even if you assume only 10% of vaccinated people catch it, that's another 100k or so fully vaccinated people ending up in hospital. 

You've already had about 500k people hospitalized for COVID over the last year and a half, which has stressed the system significantly and cancelled lots of routine medical work. You'll have to do the same again at the bare minimum, and potentially 2-3 million people if vaccinated people start catching it in larger numbers due to waning personal protection choices and vaccine effectiveness drop off.",,,,1631518191,{},hcnz8go,False,t3_pn3ynp,False,True,t1_hcnwvkn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pn3ynp/singapore_shows_australia_that_80_per_cent/hcnz8go/,1631625141.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

There may be *both* increases in miscarriage from covid, and fetal death from covid, but the body reacts differently at different points of pregnancy so it's important to be clear. 

Typically most miscarriage happens prior to 12 weeks, at a rate of approximately 20% of known pregnancies. Rates of miscarriage with the vaccine were in line with this. It's an often misquoted part of the vaccine study that ""20% of vaccinated pregnant woman miscarried"" yes - and 20% of the control group miscarried. 

Typically after 20 weeks the stresses on the women's body increases (although the first 12 weeks nausea can be very intense) with changes in the mother's body as it supports a larger and larger fetus. Maternal death is skyrocketing as well. 

While viability increases every week it's possible a fetus can live outside it's mother sometime around 24 weeks. Most fetal deaths are able to be diagnosed,  miscarriage however is often not diagnosed as it's sometimes spontaneous, and it's so damn common they won't even investigate why you miscarry unless you have 3 or more. 

Either way, covid outcomes are far worse than possible complications being vaccinated for the baby and mother.

The vaccines pretty much take death of the table for everyone who goes to or works at the University.  They dramatically reduce the odds of hospitalization.

Right now, masks are necessary, in part to protect those with young children at home.  That will no longer be true soon.

So what’s  the justification for going online?  Trying to get cases to zero? That’s never going to happen and not a rational goal.

As a final comment, competitive schools will absolutely not be able to do this.  Their students and alumni won’t accept it, especially while other schools are fully in person—which they will be.  There’s no way Yale goes remote, for example.  They have a mask and vaccine mandate, and they test everyone weekly.  That plan will work.

There's also the big fiasco where it took forever for anyone to admit that covid was airborne despite ample examples of it traveling through ventilation or across restaurants, etc. And enough people believed them that the damage has arguably been done permanently.

And that's understating the problem. If governments have the right to decide what is or is not publishable misinformation, the problem gets even worse.

All the more reason for those who can get vaccinated to do so. However we aren't talking about those who can't medically get vaccinated, were talking about individuals who refuse to get the vaccine based on nothing more then superstition, anti-social behavioral traits, and those steeped in conspiratorial thinking, and yes those who are acting very immaturely. 

Those individuals are responsible for the increase in deaths and infections, as physicians and hospitals across the country attest. The vast vast majority of those dying are unvaccinated. There is more than enough vaccine in countries such as the United States to effectively end this pandemic. The longer the hold outs last, the more likely we are to see variants, and while most won't be worse then delta, there is still a chance one could immerge. 

So far there has been nothing that has convinced those skeptical of the vaccine. Some have watched family members suffer and die and still refuse to be vaccinated. Others have taunted those who have lost loved ones and have turned to advocating for vaccinations. The behavior has been as described, it is no insult to refer to this behavior and be honest about what it has amounted to. 

The bottom line is that there is not reasonable or logical reason to resist vaccinations if you are a healthy individual. What would you call someone who refuses to listen to doctors, refuses to listen to the facts, and continual peddles conspiracy theories, and not those who have devoted their life to the study and treatment of disease? ""ignorant"" is an accurate description. 
Ignorant: 

1. lacking knowledge or awareness in general; uneducated or unsophisticated.

2. lacking knowledge, information, or awareness about a particular thing.

3. discourteous or rude.

All of these definitions describe these individuals accurately. IF you wish to see that as an insult or a personal attack then that is on you.

Impressive when you consider a lab mix up actually killed children in the rollout and caused a full stop of distribution for a while.

You’re just being silly if you thought I meant athletes would become obese if they are excess calories. That’s not what I was talking about and that should’ve been pretty dang obvious. Stop being silly.

I’m also not trying to take the reductive viewpoint in this considering in my very first paragraph I said that the government needs to get a handle on this by forcing manufacturers and growers to make the healthy options the easy options. Everything I said after that is based upon that thought. My second paragraph was more a statement about how it isn’t as hard as people make it out to be, just less enjoyable. But it truly isn’t that hard if you make it a habit. 

Having access to the food is one thing and that was what I was trying to cover in my first paragraph. Sorry if that point didn’t come across clearly.

My last statement of “this country needs to do better” was also talking about the government and companies, not everyday people. Something needs to be done to get people healthier. Right now the company I work for will give you savings based on going to the gym, doing activities to improve your lifestyle, and other things. It obviously doesn’t work, but it’s a first attempt. The next attempt should build on that, money seems to drive people so it seems like a reasonable option.

Personally, I’m all for universal healthcare, UBI, and a plethora of other policies that would make this easier for people moving forward, but we aren’t in a position as a country to do any of those things.

Average length of hospital stay has remined consistent for the last several months around 6 days.  If we take today's admissions and multiply that by 6 we get around 8,200.  This is another indicator that hospitalizations are trending down. Note Kentucky looks particularly bad using this metric as their current daily admission support a total hospitalized rate 71% above where they are currently at.  It could get ugly there.

The Hospitals also report deaths daily.  Caveat would be that these deaths have not yet been vetted as due to Covid and these numbers would also not pick up people who died at home.  The 7 day average of Covid deaths reported by hospitals peaked last week at around 280 per day.  The last four days saw deaths reported of 223, 240, 220, 236. So slowly trending down but still way too high. Based on how the deaths over the last month  ramped up we will likely see an average of around 200 deaths per day for the next month in Florida.  This will add an additional 6,000 deaths to the state increasing the total deaths by 12% in just one month. 

For reference note that Florida hospitals reported 18 Covid Deaths on July 1, 81 on August 1st, and 274 on September 1st.

In the 2020-2021 flu season, as of March only 1 child had died of flu (same article).  Keeping kids out of school, masking, social distancing, etc reduced the risk of flu that much.  

In the last year and a half, 400+ kids died from Covid.  That's even though schools were closed, kids were wearing masks, parents were not in offices, people were not traveling, etc. And that was mostly before Delta, which is more transmissible than the original strain.  Yes, 400 is a small number, relatively. Yes, probably more children die in a normal year on school buses or in swimming pools (I did not look that up, I am taking your word for it).  But it's 400 in a time where we were taking great measures to mitigate risk.  

Now we are stopping a lot of those measures. Parents are back in offices, kids are back in schools, and much less effort is going towards masking and distancing.  Some parents and teachers are vaccinated, so that helps a little, but many are not  And we are facing Delta, which spreads more easily. The circumstances are vastly different. Why would we expect the risk to remain the same?  You can say we don't have enough information to know what will happen, and that is true, but that cuts both ways.

I think we need to be realistic about the way vaccine uptake is going in the U.S. There are an ever-hardening group of people who are unwilling to get the vaccine now, and probably unwilling in the future. The triple-shot approach may be the best we can do in such a situation. If we have additional immunological protection, it could serve to reduce community transmission and healthcare burden against anti-vaxxers. I don't have data or sources to back that up. 

Then again I don't entirely know what will happen or what new information is coming down the pike. I do know that I'm not in a panic to get my booster. I also know that I'm worried about the resiliency of the small hospitals that serve my area.

Furthermore, some of those at high risk are hospitalized to seek antibody therapies that need to be delivered intravenously, still using up hospital resources.

Lastly, a covid positive patient, even admitted for other reasons, still poses a strain on hospital resources as they require closer monitoring and must be kept isolated from other non covid patients that may be at higher risk of covid infected.

So think about it. Say that breakthrough cases are 1 in 10,000 and you're 10 times more likely to get it if you are unvaccinated, so that is 1 in 1,000. Say that you have a population that is 75% vaccinated. The ratio of unvaccinated to vaccinated cases is about 4:1. So even though the vaccinated people are protected, because there are more of them, there are a significant number of cases.

Or look at it another way, the vaccinated population in the US is about 180 million, at a breakthrough rate of 1 in 10,000 that's still 18,000 cases. Or if you give 1 million vaccinations in a day, statistically 100 of those will still get the virus. Even if the virus is far more common among the unvaccinated, it is still present among the vaccinated.

But another variable is that transmission is far higher among the unvaccinated. At 25% of the population there are enough unvaccinated people to keep the virus alive and spreading which is really what is driving the cases. The more you cut into that the fewer cases anyone has.

Keep in mind this guy was only 45 years old and his only pre-existing condition was hypertension. 

Step by step breakdown of the progression as I understand it. 

Started with usual symptoms of feeling flu-ish, began having mild breathing problems so we went to the hospital, spent a couple days like that with just doctors monitoring him. Breathing issues began to worsen so he was given oxygen, eventually he took an experimental medication which didn’t help but also caused a blood clot in his leg. His condition worsened more and he was intubated, a few days later his kidneys began to fail and he was put on dialysis. He was then put on life support but a day later his body shut down and drs couldn’t revive him with CPR. 

My uncle also passed away a month ago and had basically the same progression but they were able to revive him three times. By the third time my dad made the call to stop trying because the dr said he’s basically going to be living on life support and have major brain damage if they continue.

From another article.

&gt;It envisages a seven-step path to a “more normal” testing system, beginning with not testing vaccinated and asymptomatic people, and moving on to discouraging testing of children under 13 with mild symptoms.  
  
Then, vaccinated people with mild symptoms would stop under the plan, followed by asymptomatic and unvaccinated people. After this, testing of all people with mild symptoms would be excluded. Testing would be restricted to when it was requested by a doctor, and as part of “sentinel” surveillance systems to spot approaching waves of disease. There are multiple exceptions, and public health experts believe testing will remain part of daily life for the foreseeable future. But what the paper outlines is a step-change.  
&gt;  
&gt;Testing, Cormican writes, is not without its own costs. “Medicalising daily life” has social consequences, and risks delaying access to healthcare for those with asymptomatic infection or residual traces of virus in their systems. It “undermines” years of work on self-care of respiratory infections, while the social and economic impact of a positive, asymptomatic test “may undermine confidence in the benefits of vaccination in preventing the disease”. Swabbing is uncomfortable, inconvenient, and has associated social and financial costs. Meanwhile, a focus on Covid-19 “that is disproportionate to its clinical and public health impact can result in diagnostic tunnel vision/confirmatory bias”.",,,,1631496092,{},hcmyzxi,True,t3_pn5dv2,False,True,t3_pn5dv2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pn5dv2/ireland_coronavirus_testing_regime_may_be_scaled/hcmyzxi/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,e82c58d083a6cf42fe9378fbfe8379ca70ffca4f,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1631496108.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

[],,thezerothmisfit,,,[],,,,text,t2_kbxu7,False,True,[],"So my company actually makes these kinds of vaccines. Adenoviruses have a lot of uses. Basically here, the virus that we use as the vaccine itself doesn't have spike on its outside, it's just a package for the RNA for the spike protein. Basically the mail man. Even though the RNA codes for the full length, unfused version, in order for it to bind to something it has to have an ACE2. Which the muscle cells in your arm where you got your shot doesn't have a lot of. Now In the example of the study that this post was originally about, they were talking about the CD147 receptor which is another major receptor for spike. Thing is, it's also not expressed at super high levels in your arm muscle. 

Vaccines work systemically because your immune system is everywhere. But the vaccine only lives locally. There is always the risk of some spike spilling into the blood stream and traveling to wear it could bind. But it's not likely to be a whole lot. Which likely wouldn't cause too much of a change overall.

That and because the full length spike protein isn't necessarily not stabilized. It's binding requires a lot of other mechanics. The spikes being expressed here start out as closed conformation just like all the others. Because we aren't regularly injecting people with just wild spike protein, we can't say for sure that they could even unfold on their own to attach to receptors. 

In the paper this post was citing, they were talking about the left over bits of virus that are in your blood after natural infection, which is never just a spike protein, it'll be whole pieces of envelope with other proteins as well, so it's hard to say for a fact that it was just the spike itself In a vacuum that would cause any sort of toxic response",,,,1631483635,{},hcm7lze,False,t3_pmszpf,False,False,t1_hcm1x84,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pmszpf/covid19_spike_protein_binds_to_and_changes_cells/hcm7lze/,1631593700.0,18,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the delta variant being so infectious, it's quite possible that we'll all need booster shoots and/or infection-gained immunity in addition to the regular vaccine schedule before the pandemic is over. Perhaps an annual vaccine as well as Covid becomes endemic. 

My concern with claims that natural immunity is superior is that it edges on to the territory of anti-vaxx rhetoric. (I'm also not convinced that it's actually true, but like you said, there are a lot of nuances to such a comparison.) I can easily imagine vaccine-hesitant individuals using that claim as an argument to avoid vaccination and embrace the possibility of exposure instead (e.g. ""why would I get a vaccine when natural immunity is better?"") or to claim that they've already been exposed and therefore don't need to be vaccinated because they're already protected. 

The latter is the most common argument against vaccination that you hear in my native Bulgaria (the least vaccinated country in the EU). Everyone vaguely claims to have already had Covid-19, even if they never experienced the characteristic symptoms, so they can claim to already be protected. Of course, even if that were true, vaccination would only improve their immunity, but not everyone is interested in those kinds of subtleties. The claim that natural immunity is superior could easily become a rallying cry for many anti-vaxxers if it starts to circulate in the general public, so it's a claim worth scrutinizing very carefully.",,,,1631536651,{},hcomgjh,False,t3_pn01kq,False,True,t1_hcnimr4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pn01kq/covid19_infection_almost_inevitable_for_the/hcomgjh/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,782352030c93857c778d3d4437d65588d54624c0,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1631536663.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Yesterday I posted about how if we have mandatory testing, we should know the severity of cases reported (as the vaccine doesn’t prevent infection but reduces the severity of cases), and got downvoted for that. We’ve heard for a long time that the important metrics post-vaccination are be hospitalizations and deaths, not raw cases. There was yet another post about testing today, and someone got downvoted to oblivion for suggesting that the vaccine largely prevents serious outcomes, and no longer a major threat to the vaccinated. And in response people were saying like they still don’t want to spread it to their family, etc, and how even with the vaccine, why go around spreading the virus when you could stay home? But a question that’s been asked many times now is, if a vaccine can’t get us back to normal life, then what will? We always have to accept a certain level of risk in our lives.

I guess they do have a point tho, the covid situation is really bad rn with the Delta variant, hospitals are getting overwhelmed in some parts of the country, so there’s still a need for vigilance. However, it almost seems like they totally negated the point of the vaccine and are acting like it’s March 2020. And just to add, I have been following restrictions closely since the virus hit, got vaccinated as soon as I can, and am 100% in support of vaccine mandates to get us back to normal.

Honestly I’m afraid these people get us back to remote again. Mandatory testing will probably produce a lot of cases, but the point of the vaccine is not to prevent infection.

""SAVIO BEERS: So one of the things that we think about, you know, every vaccine, every medication has a potential side effect. And so does the risk outweigh the important benefit that this particular therapeutic can bring? So, for example, we know that COVID-19 can be an incredibly serious illness, so it's important to make sure that we protect against that. Now, we also know that for younger children, the risk of severe COVID infection is less. And so what we have to do is weigh, is the risk of the vaccine less than or greater than the risk of COVID infection to children? And I think it's very clear to us that the risk of COVID in children far outweighs any potential risk of the vaccine.""

“I understand people are free to choose, but to me it’s a problem when it affects other people,” Dr Linda Marraccini, a South Miami family physician, told NBC Miami.  
“When it comes to the safety of others, when it comes to a global health problem, community health problem, at this point I really say, ‘This is where it draws a line in the sand for me.’”  
She recently sent out a letter to patients, 10 to 15 per cent of whom she estimates don’t want to get the vaccine, that they would need to get the jab by 15 September to keep seeing her in person.  
“We will no longer subject our patients and staff to unnecessary risk,” the letter reads. “This is a public health emergency — the health of the public takes priority over the rights of any given individual in this situation. It appears that there is a lack of selflessness and concern for the burden on the health and wellbeing of our society from our encounters.”  
Dr Marraccini has said her office will continue offering telemedicine to unvaccinated people, as well as making referrals to other physicians for patients who won’t or can’t comply with the rule.

I will say tho: online places are great for prescription safety and sunglasses!

[],,zenon_kar,,,[],,,,text,t2_9fi18rm0,False,False,[],"How do I say this respectfully. Almost 2 years ago we were meant to quarantine in order to eliminate the virus. But we didn't commit to quarantine, and everywhere on earth played by different rules and elimination became impossible and then they started pretending elimination was never the goal. But instead suppression and control of the virus, for which we had to stay isolated and adopt protective measures, but without official support and without mandates to ensure it actually happens. Instead ""personal responsibility"" knowing that most wouldn't do it.

I'm not complaining about the calls for isolation and protective measures, they were necessary for the public health and if everyone had done them things would have been better. But there is a cost to this, lack of social connection is as bad for you as not exercising. Plus it's hard to exercise in a tiny apartment. And if you were single at the start of the pandemic following these guidelines means you're still single and have been very much alone alone for 18 months. 

Summer 2020 saw reductions in cases and people started ""returning to normal"" as states went against advice to control the disease. Then, predictably the autumn-winter devastation happened and hundreds of thousands died in a short period of time. Some restrictions were put back in some places, some countries went back into quarantine, entire regions had totally full hospitals and it seemed like things were just going to keep getting worse. 

Then vaccines came out and the rollout was faster than expected but still took months on months. And very prematurely people who got the vaccine were told they could return to normal, when only a few weeks later they were then told they couldn't return to normal because the virus (predictably) changed and now we are several steps back from where we were. And now we are talking about boosters when most of the world still isn't even vaccinated, when are talking about vaccine hesitancy because half the people in the US have decided they don't want the pandemic to be under control enough for the acute phase to end, and it seems like things will still get worse before they get better.

Media and some health professionals so much touted the 90+% efficacy against death, that people thought the vaccine would mean they were safe. But long covid can happen to people who are even asymptomatic, and Delta had cut in half or more the ability to prevent asymptomatic infection based on early and sparse data. Protective measures being those to protect the community rather than yourself, not knowing if you have covid and potentially being a vector means that you're still isolating and taking other measures despite the vaccine.

People are upset and unhappy about getting yo-yoed around, having public messaging changing over and over. Having inconsistent and ever changing official guidance, rules, and laws. Many people have done everything they are supposed to despite the significant mental and emotional cost of doing so, and they were repeatedly told this would help end the pandemic and get things to a good place. But things are only getting worse, and those who don't follow the rules have been pretending everything is over since may of 2020. And unless they get severe covid or long covid their lives were actually better for it.

So yes, they want the vaccine which is the only real tool they have any control over, to protect them completely so that they can stop making daily sacrifices. Of course they do. It's only human. We have asked a lot of people over the last 18 months, and not given them anything in return. And the ones who have given all they've been asked have suffered more than most of those who ignored that call. They want something to be stable and they want something they have some control over.

He made the order during an online working session with leaders of the Mekong Delta provinces of Kien Giang and Tien Giang on measures to push back the pandemic on September 13.  
  
The PM pointed to a number of gaps in pandemic prevention and control activities.

He requested the localities to stick to directions from central agencies, especially the policy of considering communes and wards as “fortresses” and people as “warriors” in the fight against COVID-19, and taking the people as the centre and subject of pandemic prevention and control activities.  
  
The Government leader asked the provinces to set specific goals when applying social distancing measures, and make the utmost efforts to put the pandemic under control by September 30 at the latest.  
  
He reminded sectors and localities to strengthen communication activities to provide the people with information and knowledge in pandemic prevention and control.  
  
Regarding vaccine issues, the PM held that together with efforts to buy and import vaccines, it is crucial to speed up the research of home-grown vaccines as well as the transfer of technology for vaccine production inside the country.  
  
He urged the Ministry of Health to continue allocate vaccines based on the real situation in localities, while ensuring safe and effective vaccination. The ministry should also prepare vaccines for following years as well as vaccines for children, he asked.  
  
At the session, Deputy PM Vu Duc Dam, leaders of ministries, sectors and medical experts gave their opinions on the current pandemic situation and proposed more support for medical workers including improving their capacity, especially in COVID-19 testing and treatment. They stressed the need to speed up vaccination for people with high risk of infection. ./.",,,,1631545919,{},hcp6e4n,True,t3_pnhepp,False,True,t3_pnhepp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pnhepp/vietnam_pm_requires_preventing_corruption_vested/hcp6e4n/,1631649202.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The best available data on breakthroughs, as it has been for months, is the UK's dataset, which you can view here: [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/1014926/Technical\_Briefing\_22\_21\_09\_02.pdf](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1014926/Technical_Briefing_22_21_09_02.pdf)

Hospitalization and deaths skew even more to the vaccinated (2 to 1 vaccinated), which is what you want if you want lower deaths and hospitalization, as the elderly are overwhelmingly at risk, and overwhelmingly vaccinated.

But don't bullshit yourself. Breakthrough infections aren't rare at all.

[],,Synonyms26,,,[],,,,text,t2_10wdsu,False,True,[],"HÀ NỘI — The environment sector in many localities, especially those severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, has strengthened measures to protect environmental workers from being infected with coronavirus when collecting waste.  
  
In Hà Nội, Tống Việt Dũng, deputy director of the Urban and Industrial Environment No 13 Joint Stock Company, said the company provided enough protective equipment for its environmental workers to ensure their safety.  
  
The company had also constantly disseminated regulations on pandemic prevention and control, he said.  
  
Lê Thị Linh, an environmental worker of the company, said she was always equipped with protective clothing when she did her job. Linh added that she had already received one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.  
  
In HCM City, Huỳnh Minh Nhựt, director of HCM City Urban Environment Company Limited, said the company not only equipped personal protective equipment but also instructed environmental workers on how to obey regulations on anti-pandemic prevention in each location that they had to collect waste.  
  
The company allocated over 300 environmental workers to collect waste in lockdown areas three shifts daily, he said.  
  
The environmental workers had to work very hard to ensure all the waste would be transported to treatment areas in order to minimise the risk of cross infection in lockdown areas, he said.  
  
However, because the amount of waste was large and the collection sites were far away from each other, this put great pressure on the environmental workers, he said.  
  
Nguyễn Văn Thiền, chairman of the Board of Directors of Bình Dương Water Supply Sewerage Environment Ltd., said the company’s waste treatment branch had about 800 employees.  
  
Thiền said waste transported to the company would be treated by specialised machines and an automatic disinfecting and burning system.  
  
The most dangerous stage was when workers had to collect waste from lockdown and quarantined areas, he added. Therefore, the company had provided protective clothing to environmental workers to ensure their safety during waste collection.  
  
The company also periodically conducted COVID tests for environmental workers.  
  
The company has applied the ""three on-site"" model, which involves eating, sleeping, and working without leaving and aims to keep operation and production going while meeting COVID-19 control and prevention measures.  
  
Under the model, the company arranges accommodation for environmental workers at the company. The accommodation is disinfected three times daily to ensure safety.  
  
Phùng Chí Sỹ, director of the Environmental Technology Centre, said environmental workers who directly collected waste in areas where COVID-19 patients lived or were treated, played an important role in controlling and preventing the spread of the pandemic.  
  
So, they needed to be classified as a frontline group and given priority for vaccination, he said.  
  
Sỹ also said that waste in areas with cases of COVID-19 infection as well as lockdown and quarantined areas should be carefully sorted to reduce pressure on environmental workers and treatment plants.  
  
Nguyễn Thượng Hiền, deputy head of the Việt Nam Environment Administration under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, said environmental workers had to collect and transport waste daily.  
  
They were a very-high risk group for COVID-19 infection, he said.  
  
Therefore, the ministry already proposed to the Government that environmental workers should be given priority for vaccination as well as regular tests to ensure their safety.  
  
More waste discharged  
  
In Hà Nội, the total amount of waste has increased by about 30 per cent, equal to 7.5 tonnes per day, compared to pre-pandemic levels.  
  
The company has sharply increased the frequency of waste collection in quarantined and lockdown areas.  
  
The company’s waste treatment factory now operates eight hours daily instead of five as before. The waste is transported to the factory for treatment following a route that avoids going through residential areas to minimise the spread of the pandemic.  
  
In HCM City, the local Natural Resources and Environment Department said the amount of waste discharged in field hospitals and quarantined areas was 78 tonnes daily.  
  
In Bình Dương Province, the amount of waste discharged in field hospitals and quarantined areas is about 70 tonnes daily.  
  
In response to the situation, the environment ministry has cooperated with the Ministry of Health to issue technical guidelines to instruct localities on how to treat waste related to SARS-CoV-2 right after the pandemic hit the country. Such waste will be treated as hazardous.  
  
In July, the ministry continued sending document 4119/BTNMT-TCMT to ask localities nationwide to strengthen measures to deal with waste related to COVID-19.  
  
The ministry also sent the localities the list of 80 facilities nationwide that are eligible for hazardous waste treatment. — VNS",,,,1631545802,{},hcp642x,True,t3_pnhddo,False,True,t3_pnhddo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pnhddo/vietnam_environmental_worker_protection/hcp642x/,1631649048.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,Synonyms26,,,[],,,,text,t2_10wdsu,False,True,[],"HÀ NỘI — The Ministry of Health held an online training conference on Monday on a project to enhance the supply and use of medical oxygen for facilities treating COVID-19 patients.  
  
The conference saw participation from more than 1,000 locations in 63 provinces and cities.   
  
The conference aims to prepare, respond proactively, promptly and effectively in terms of medical oxygen for emergencies and for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.  
  
Speaking at the conference, Deputy Minister of Health Trần Văn Thuấn emphasised that investing in the medical oxygen supply system would be an investment for the long term.   
  
""The investment, expansion of production scale, supply network and technical infrastructure of medical oxygen at medical examination and treatment facilities is not only for the COVID-19 pandemic but also for the future,"" he said.  
  
In some southern provinces and cities, the number of new cases of COVID-19 along with the current number of cases and the need for medical treatment for other diseases has resulted in an increasing demand for medical oxygen. The percentage of COVID-19 patients who have the need for oxygen ranging from mild levels such as oxygen masks, oxygen therapy glasses and high flow oxygen to severe levels such as non-invasive and invasive ventilation, ECMO, accounting for about 9.5 per cent of the total cases.  
  
According to Nguyễn Minh Tuấn, Director of the Department of Medical Equipment and Construction, Ministry of Health, in Việt Nam, the supply capacity of oxygen across the country is about 1,200 tonnes of liquid oxygen per day and can be increased by 50 per cent to 100 per cent as needed.   
  
Regarding the status of medical oxygen technical infrastructure in medical facilities, it basically meets routine medical care, but there are still some limitations when the number of COVID-19 patients increases.   
  
In fact, many medical facilities at the district level do not have a central oxygen system; lack oxygen containers (such as bottles, flasks, tanks); and do not back up the number of containers when they have to be rotated, or used for support for home treatment and emergency transportation. Establishments in remote areas often have difficulty accessing oxygen supplies, while the ability to coordinate and mobilise oxygen has not been prompt in intensive situations like natural disasters (storms, floods, power outages, etc.) or the pandemic.   
  
To increase the production, supply and ensure medical oxygen for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, on September 7, 2021, the Minister of Health issued Decision No. 4308/QD-BYT on strengthening the capacity to supply medical oxygen for facilities treating COVID-19 patients. The main objective of the project is to guide localities to proactively develop plans and organise a close connection between supply and demand in order to exploit resources for producing medical oxygen in the country; prepare medical oxygen infrastructure to treat COVID-19 patients according to different pandemic scenarios.  
  
Deputy Minister Trần Văn Thuấn pointed out four groups of solutions that provinces and cities need to conduct urgently.  
  
First, reviewing and evaluating the current status of medical oxygen technical infrastructure at medical facilities at all levels and developing a plan, based on the guidance of the Ministry of Health on medical oxygen demand at all levels, to improve the technical infrastructure of medical oxygen systems at facilities treating COVID-19 patients.  
  
Secondly, localities should assess the ability to produce oxygen, the network of oxygen suppliers, to plan and expand the scale of oxygen production and supply to ensure that demand can be met.  
  
Thirdly, provinces and cities should implement effective connection and coordination among stakeholders: producers, suppliers, transporters and users of oxygen to ensure that emergency needs are met without interruption in various situations.   
  
The deputy minister requested that localities assign a vice chairman of the people's committees to be the head of the department, the leader of the Department of Health acting as deputy permanent member of the unit in charge of medical oxygen coordination. Localities should also strengthen IT application in the management and coordination of medical oxygen, and at the same time properly control the price of medical oxygen in the locality to ensure that the price is not a barrier when the demand for oxygen increases.  
  
Localities are asked to continue to implement the motto ""four on the spot"", proactively prepare, be ready and promptly respond to medical oxygen needs in emergencies and COVID-19 treatment: planning the procurement of medical oxygen containers and other necessary supplies and equipment; simultaneously, continuously expanding training for doctors, nurses, medical staff at all levels on medical oxygen therapies in treatment suitable to all levels. — VNS",,,,1631545751,{},hcp5zq0,True,t3_pnhcse,False,True,t3_pnhcse,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pnhcse/vietnam_health_ministry_to_deploy_oxygen_supply/hcp5zq0/,1631648983.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,Synonyms26,,,[],,,,text,t2_10wdsu,False,True,[],"HCM CITY — HCM City authorities have announced an extension of the lockdown until the end of September from mid-month as instructed by the Government, and delayed a plan to issue COVID ‘green cards’ until further notice.  
  
Speaking at a meeting on Monday, Dương Anh Đức, vice chairman of the city People’s Committee, said that the city would even impose stricter social distancing measures in some high-risk districts.  
  
Low-risk areas like districts 7, Cần Giờ and Củ Chi, where the pandemic has been basically controlled, could ease measures, he added.  
  
Directive 16 requires people to stay at home except for essential tasks like buying food or medicines.  
  
Nguyễn Văn Nên, secretary of the city Party Committee, said the city was unlikely to contain the outbreak by September 15 as required by the Government last month, and was likely to do so by the end of the month.   
  
He said the city would also delay issuance of COVID green cards.  
  
It would continue to consult medical and economic experts to further tweak the green card system and its requirements, depending on the pandemic status, he said.   
  
Đức said, “The city will place safety first before it gradually opens the economy.”  
  
Earlier authorities said the city would gradually ease isolation measures based on risk assessment, epidemiological surveillance data and the response capacity of the health sector to reopen the economy, provide essential services and ensure distribution and transport of goods.  
  
Classification of industries and units based on certain criteria would be carried out in order to gradually restore their operations.  
  
It would work with the ministries of health and information and communications to use a single application to automatically check people’s information across the country.   
  
One of the criteria for issuing green cards is receiving two shots of vaccines.  
  
Đức said under the green card model social distancing regulations could be relaxed for people meeting certain requirements. ""Vaccinating the population quickly is important for reopening the economy,"" he added.  
  
People who have fully recovered after getting COVID would be exempt from vaccination for six months but could go to work just like those who have received their second shot.   
  
Issuing green cards is one of seven proposals made by the Department of Health.  
  
The others are universal vaccination, raising public awareness, community-based care, improving treatment, epidemiological surveillance, and consolidating the healthcare system.  
  
The city targets giving all adults aged 18 and above their first shot by September 15 and second shot by the end of the year.  
  
Children who have underlying diseases or are obese will be immunised first when more vaccines are available.  
  
As of September 12 more than 7.8 million adults have received their first shots (85.2 per cent of the population), and 1.3 million have received both shots.  
  
HCM City is the country’s pandemic hotspot with nearly 300,000 cases since late April.

I also think for me this pandemic has highlighted how media and most of public can’t just hear certain statistics and be trusted to understand them.

I live in a predominately Spanish-speaking neighborhood in NYC. Something like half of the people there were born outside the US. It's a relatively low-income community, and kind of insular. This neighborhood also features some of the lowest vaccination rates in all of Manhattan.

A few times over the past few weeks I've noticed a giant vaccination bus parked on a major street in said neighborhood (with its attendant ""post-vaccination monitoring"" bus right behind it). Each time I saw it, there were long lines of people patiently waiting to get the shot. It was evident that tons of people were just walking by when they impulsively decided to get vaccinated. Having Spanish-speaking nurses there surely helped.

What this tells me is that for some of these communities, the way to reach them is: actually try to reach them. Bring the vaccine right to them. Speak to them in their own language.

they cite CDC data for their reasons, which arguably isn't that good.

  
here, lets take a look at what CDC data tells us:

  
https://twitter.com/MCSlab\_uiuc/status/1436423893833691138  
oh, it tells us that when the CDC tells you the vaccine reduces your risk of hospitalization by 10X!!!! it's because it actually reduces your chance of being infected by 5x, and if you do end up being infected, it merely reduces your chance of hospitalization by 2x.    if you're over 65, your risk of hospitalization ONCE INFECTED goes from 20% to 10%.  this is real, this is verified everywhere the data is available.

  
these data rapists are simply inflating the protection against severe disease to justify letting your grandma die so they can save some people we're probably going to drone strike eventually anyways.

I mean the whole thing is talking about how of course people want a vaccine that keeps them completely safe because the minority who follow the rules have been isolating themselves for almost 2 years really just want to be able to live their lives. Because isolation is a sacrifice that they have made for the common good. 

But because so many people never followed the rules or stopped doing so early, and because governments abandoned the people by removing mandates and not giving support to stay at home, that sacrifice feels like it was for nothing. And because so many didn't do the right thing it makes this situation way more complicated, because there can't be an end to covid and we can't figure out how to pay back the people who sacrificed in vain for people who put others at risk in the name of selfish gratification.

Isolation is not about your individual risk calculus. It's about the community public health. Your individual self is not really important on this scale. The individual cannot always trump the community. That's a completely self destructive way to organize the world. You accepting the risk for yourself is meaningless because this is a question of you imposing risk on others without their consent. And, to be clear, covid carries a 40% risk of long term disability. That is not something people accept on a daily basis. That is not a normal situation. We should not normalize accepting that. 

But, if you have been following the rules, I understand that you are frustrated and you want this all to end because you have been doing the right thing and others are spitting in your face about it, and the government and media and your employer are all yo-yoing you around about it. I also want this to end. But I can't give you an end date because so many are pathologically resistant to doing the right thing and extraordinarily committed to believing in some right to risk the health of everyone around them as if it's their choice to make. 

I can't tell you when things will be able to go back to normal. If you've followed the rules for 18 months I understand if you're slowly starting to isolate less and less because it is destructive to your mental and physical health to do so for that extreme stretch of time.

An extreme example of this is Ebola, where you get so ill so quickly that transmission is very limited. So obviously there's normally evolutionary pressure for viruses not to make you too ill, because then that increases their opportunities to be passed on.

However, this Coronavirus avoids all that by being transmissible in the presymptomatic phase.

Because ACE converts angiotensinogen into angiotensin (which binds to their specific receptors to increase blood pressure) the idea of blocking that action is logical to think it would protect patients from the hypertension caused by the disease. But they found it actually did the opposite.

ACE2 is responsible for breaking down angiotensin, so that it's no longer active, thus no longer increasing BP. But when there's no Angiotensin  to bind, it leaves many more free to be infected by viruses. So they found that using ACE inhibitors specifically for a covid treatment was a bad idea cus it sped up the infection process. 

That being said, this is very different from having to take it regularly to control existing hypertension. It's never a good idea to go off your meds, and even in the case of disease these will help you compensate a bit, because your receptor profile is very different from a healthy patient who just got hospitalized. If you were to go off them, your blood pressure would raise and it would double the affect of the disease.

But it is still possible that significant in-school transmission this fall could force many school buildings — or even the entire system, if virus case numbers rise substantially — to shut down temporarily.

&gt;City schools saw remarkably low virus transmission in their buildings last year, but most schools were at significantly reduced capacity. Even with a transmission rate of 0.03 percent as of the end of last year, quarantines were still a regular occurrence.

&gt;This year, at least some level of disruption is inevitable, with the city’s newly announced quarantine policy almost certain to lead to frequent short-term classroom closures.

&gt;In elementary schools, where children are still too young to be vaccinated, one positive case in a classroom will prompt a 10-day quarantine, and a switch to remote learning, for that entire classroom.

&gt;In middle and high schools, only unvaccinated students will have to quarantine if exposed to someone with the virus, meaning that unvaccinated students could have a much different school year than their vaccinated classmates. More than 60 percent of New York City children eligible for the vaccine have received at least one dose, but the city does not know how many of those children attend its public schools.

&gt;While the city’s quarantine protocol is more conservative than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends, New York’s school testing plan is more modest than the C.D.C. calls for, alarming some parents and public health experts.

&gt;A random sample of 10 percent of unvaccinated students will be tested in each school every other week; the city was testing 20 percent of people in all school buildings weekly by the end of last year. Experts have said that the city’s current testing plan will almost certainly be too small in scope to stop many outbreaks before they start.

&gt;New York has gone further than most districts in the country by implementing a full vaccine mandate for all its educators, along with all adults who work in school buildings. The mayor has said he believes that the mandate, along with increasing vaccination rates for eligible students, will help keep schools as safe this year as they were last year.",,,,1631549188,{},hcpebdw,True,t3_pnig2k,False,False,t3_pnig2k,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pnig2k/some_disruption_to_the_school_year_in_the_city/hcpebdw/,1631653627.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the clip, Dr Fauci says “There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you’re in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it’s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. And, often, there are unintended consequences — people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.”

UNION COUNTY, N.C. — The Union County Public School Board voted Monday morning to end COVID-19 contact tracing and quarantining for non-positive students and staff.

That means students can go to school even if they have come in close contact with someone who is COVID positive. The only people who have to stay home are those who have tested positive or have symptoms.

The decision is effective immediately.

Union County schools do not require masks for students and staff.

The Union County Board of Education met in emergency session on Monday morning, and COVID-19 protocols were the main focus. Later Monday, the school district issued the following statement:

“At the Sept. 13 Special Called meeting, the Union County Board of Education voted effective immediately, to halt all staff responsibilities regarding contact tracing and quarantining for students and staff, except as required by law. The statutory authority of managing contact tracing and quarantining is that of Union County Public Health.

“As required by law, school nurses, administrators and school staff will continue to address positive, presumptive or confirmed cases of COVID-19. All students and staff who do not have a positive COVID-19 test or symptoms, should return to school or work immediately.

“If students or employees have the following symptoms: fever or chills, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting, headache, they should stay home, stay away from others and call their health care provider.

“Students and employees who have been isolated due to a positive case or COVID-19 symptoms, should not report to school or work until they have completed 10 days of isolation, symptoms have improved and fever free for 24 hours without fever-reducing medication.

“Face coverings are still optional for students and staff in Union County Public Schools.”

Union County Public Health Director Dennis Joyner sent a letter on Friday to the county school district with COVID-19 recommendations. The letter was sent as cases and the number of students and staff members quarantined continue to rise in Union County.

**As of Friday, 479 students and employees had tested positive for the virus, and 7,285 were in quarantine.**

**Union County Schools is one of only five districts in North Carolina where masks are optional.** In the letter from Joyner, he advised that masks be required. He also said a 14-day quarantine is the best option to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

“Without a universal mask requirement in Union County public schools, a 14-day quarantine period remains the best option to provide for the protection of student, teachers, staff and members of the community,” the letter said.

Many parents have been in favor of choice because they believe COVID-19 rarely harms children. Dr. Benny Joyner, who is the vice chair for safety at the Department of Pediatrics at the UNC Children’s hospital, said they are wrong.

“I would say they need to come into my ICU. I’ve got six, now five, critically ill pediatric COVID patients. Two of them have breathing tubes inserted to basically breathe for them. Two of them are infants,” he said.

“What I would say, the delta variant has really made the respiratory phase of the illness much more prominent than before,” Joyner said. “We have young men and women who are just struggling, gasping to breathe, unable to complete sentences. We have little babies on breathing machines who are heavily sedated from COVID -- it’s a challenge.”

**The school board has heard from many parents on the issue but, so far, the freedom to choose side has won out.**

“I think it’s important to everyone to be able to tell their kids what they can wear and what they can’t wear,” parent Eric McCorkle said. “It’s bad when we get to a place in society that a little bit is taken away, each time just a little bit here and a little bit there and before you know it, it’s a whole lot.”

“To keep everybody safe, it should be mandatory that we wear masks,” parent Samira Maske said.",,,,1631556832,{},hcpwv2t,False,t3_pnkwrf,False,True,t3_pnkwrf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pnkwrf/with_20_of_its_students_in_covid_quarantine/hcpwv2t/,1631663583.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Can you give me some additional information on this? I was under the impression that asymptomatic transmission hasn't been observed, but it sounds like you might be talking about presymptomatic (or they mean they same thing, I don't know).

This has been a hotly discussed item in my friend group, and I'm on the side that ""simply not being symptomatic doesn't give you a pass to do whatever"" because you can still be spreading.

Source 'against' Asmpytomatic Spread: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/4/20-4576_article

&gt; In this cluster of COVID-19 cases, little to no transmission occurred from asymptomatic case-patients. Presymptomatic transmission was more frequent than symptomatic transmission. The serial interval was short; very short intervals occurred.

&gt; The fact that we did not detect any laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatic case-patients is in line with multiple studies (9–11). However, Oran et al. have speculated that asymptomatic cases contribute to the rapid progression of the pandemic (12). Some studies may be prone to misclassify presymptomatic cases as asymptomatic, leading to heterogeneous reporting of SAR of asymptomatic cases, because of different case definitions or differential duration of follow-up. In our study we used a very sensitive case definition for symptomatic cases that did not require specific symptoms (e.g. fever) to be present. Also, timing of our study would have enabled detection of late onset of symptoms, which gives us confidence in our classification of exposure groups.

This is directly from the CDC...

WHO on the other hand (for asymptomatic spread) (https://www.who.int/vietnam/news/detail/14-07-2020-q-a-how-is-covid-19-transmitted)

&gt; Can people without symptoms transmit the virus?

&gt; Yes, infected people can transmit the virus both when they have symptoms and when they don’t have symptoms. This is why it is important that all people who are infected are identified by testing, isolated, and, depending on the severity of their disease, receive medical care.  Even people confirmed to have COVID-19 but who do not have symptoms should be isolated to limit their contact with others.  These measures break chains of transmission.

&gt; This is why it is always important to stay at least 1 metre from others, cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze with a bent elbow or tissue, clean hands regularly, and stay home if you become unwell or if asked. In areas where there is widespread transmission, it is also important that people wear a fabric mask where physical distancing and other control measures cannot be implemented.

I don't expect a 3rd dose of Pfizer's vaccine against wild-type will offer me much absolute additional protection against either hospitalization or death. Just continuing high-quality masking will be better.

But for the elderly and immunocompromised, there's perhaps a real benefit that rises above the noise. And so long as governments (even in the US) are footing the bill for hospitalization, then there's probably an age and comorbidity threshold at which total projected costs are lower with boosters. For Israel, 3rd shots were initially rolled out for those over 60.

I've been most disappointed that we're not seeing announced phase III trials with vaccines against the now dominant strains, like Delta. Easy adaptation to new strains is supposedly one  of the benefits of mRNA vaccines, another being they don't provoke immune responses to adenovirus vectors that could impede boosters. If we're going to live indefinitely with virus sloshing about our population (due to the opposition of many to NPIs), then I'd really like my booster to reflect the current dominant strain (s), as whatever immune evading future variant will most likely arise from this genetic background.",,,,1631563166,{},hcqci5p,False,t3_pnfp6c,False,True,t3_pnfp6c,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pnfp6c/data_shows_covid_booster_shots_are_not/hcqci5p/,1631671692.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Right now the virus is chewing through a population which still has a lot of completely immune-naive ""susceptible"" people in it.  As the fraction of the population that is susceptible drops though the virus necessarily needs to optimize for transmission (which also increases virulence/lethality).  This is similar to how the 1918 H1N1 pandemic got worse as time went on when it came to the pandemic strain.

Eventually though near enough to 100% of people will be vaccinated or recovered, and the game will change for the virus, and it will do better to try to achieve immune escape.  This should come at a cost to fitness/transmissiblity/virulence as the collection of mutations that produce enough immune evation to start epidemics in recovered people will likely no longer be able to be optimal for transmission.  We can sort of see this now where there are more immune evasive strains out there like mu, but they're outcompeted by delta so far.  This is similar to how the 1918 H1N1 pandemic strain eventually just became seasonal influenza (spreading every year until 1957 when it was displaced by H2N2).

So the point is to avoid getting infected by delta and give it another year or two, and then the endemic strains should carry less risk going forwards.

&gt;Coronavirus cases are nearing record levels  in West Virginia, and the state’s schools are closing and its hospitals are choked with patients stricken by the perniciously infectious Delta variant.  
        
&gt;Just seven months ago, as the Covid vaccine was still being rolled out, the state was a [national](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/us/west-virginia-vaccine.html ""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/us/west-virginia-vaccine.html"") leader. By late June the state’s governor, Jim Justice, a Republican, had [removed a statewide mask requirement](https://governor.wv.gov/Pages/Statewide-Indoor-Face-Covering-Requirement.aspx ""https://governor.wv.gov/Pages/Statewide-Indoor-Face-Covering-Requirement.aspx"").  
             
&gt;But West Virginia has since fallen far behind, and its pandemic status has deteriorated, a situation shared with other states with large unvaccinated populations. Just under 48 percent of West Virginia’s 18 and over population is fully vaccinated, the lowest of any state, [according to federal data](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html ""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html"") compiled by The New York Times.   
      
&gt;The latest surge has enveloped West Virginia with a ferocity the virus had not shown before there, said the official running the state’s coronavirus response, Dr. Clay Marsh.  
      
&gt;“The rapid rate of growth and the level of severity of illness has really been much greater than we’ve ever seen before,” Dr. Marsh said.  
          
&gt;West Virginia’s seven-day average of new reported cases has neared record levels for all of September, hovering above 1,500 per day for most of the past week, according to [data compiled by The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/west-virginia-covid-cases.html ""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/west-virginia-covid-cases.html"").

If I could recommend one single subject to focus on to understand modern life, it would be cults and cult indoctrination. The book *Cults in our Midst* is totally worth your time if you're trying to understand modern America, and perhaps the most important concept it introduces is a spectrum where on one side sits ""Fundamentalism,"" and on the other side sits ""Proteanism.""

Proteanism is flexibility, openness to change and new ideas, and feeling secure enough to experiment and be wrong. Fundamentalism forms from a place of deep insecurity, and is characterized by a belief in one single Truth, tribalism, black-and-white thinking, us-vs-them thinking, and the wholesale rejection of anything that challenges one's current worldview. My therapist, a man with two PhDs and four decades of experience, says that Fundamentalism is the last defense a person has against psychosis. In other words, their tight grip on their beliefs is the only thing keeping them grounded in reality. And they will defend that grip to the bitter end, because without it, they lose their mind.

The way to save these people, by the way, is to make them feel more secure. Give them other things to hold onto, so they can let go of the nonsense. A nice home, a well-paying job, a (non-toxic) community, a (non-toxic) church, etc. can go a long way. For some, though, they're responding to a profound trauma from long ago, and so in some ways are already experiencing psychosis. Meaning that no matter how good their life is around them, part of them is still stuck in the source of their trauma, and will make them behave as though they are still insecure and still in danger. These people are extremely hard to reach; it takes family, friends, and usually some kind of major crisis to drag them back to earth. Catching covid will be that crisis for some.

This is just one angle of a *very* complex picture. Probably every response you get to this comment will be correct, even if they conflict. The human mind does not yield to any single explanation. But if you get enough angles see from, enough lenses to look through, you start to feel how this works.

Once more data came out (well before the regular population in US could get vaccinated), more agile countries changed their interval to 10 or 12 weeks.  This had two great effects:  (1) Better immunity for the recipient, (2) Allowed supply to go towards first shots for more people ASAP.  First doses first (FDF) gets more people up to ~70%+ immunity and protection from severe illness, before bumping them up another 20-30% from the second shot.

I got my 2nd shot after 12 weeks and had no side effects.  The 3 week interval is likely the cause of the extreme immune reaction too, and thus also the cause of myocarditis and other (relatively minor) side effects we're seeing from vaccination.

The main difference between the UK and USA right now is that the USA has a lot more unvaccinated people, and a ton more unvaccinated elderly. This is making the usa's severe results worse, especially in the south and Midwest.

If the Northeast was testing in the same way, it'd have similar results, but states only release percentages by vaccination rate haphazardly. All of the most popular distributed statistics have taken the entire population as a denominator, which is ludicrous.

These breakthrough rates are likewise confirmed by Israel. You'll see increasing breakthrough rates based on the dumb denominator, steadily increasing wherever there are higher vaccination rates, for instance in the northeast.",,,,1631547266,{},hcp9ng7,False,t3_pndtw5,False,False,t1_hcp6tvc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pndtw5/nearly_74_of_eligible_americans_have_at_least_1/hcp9ng7/,1631651028.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why should a company waste doses mailing them all over the globe just to expire, when instead they could be used for useful booster doses? 

2. The patent argument is very stale. The reason the parents aren’t all given away is to guard against distrust in vaccines. Vaccine maker A may not trust anyone but themselves and makers B and C to produce and distribute their product. If they allow John Doe in Country M to just randomly begin production of their vaccine and it doesn’t go well - it’s contaminated, improperly produced/stored etc. - then that can quickly result in distrust for vaccination efforts.

The whole thing is incredibly improbable - i checked around my bedroom to see if there were any visitors and there's nothing dead or alive in there, and the odds that a confused bat would find its way in and out through the same gauntlet are very very very low.

From your own link:

&gt; The truth is, the disease can affect everyone differently,” says Dr. Schaefer. “Anyone, including young athletes, could experience a severe case or have long-term damage, which is why it’s so important to take this seriously.”

&gt; This is especially true with active individuals, as it can be difficult to tell what long-term effects someone is going to have after they recover from the virus. Some people might fare just fine and will be able to jump back into their old training regiment, while others will find that their athletic performance just isn’t what it used to be.

&gt; **For the majority of athletes and active people, returning to activity will likely be a slow process and will require patience. You should work with a healthcare provider to make sure you’re progressing appropriately and monitoring your symptoms.**

Thanks for the link, btw! 

Peace out, fren.

There are tons of variants in existence right now but many are super similar or haven't quite gotten every number on their lottery ticket just right so they haven't earned the VOI, VOC, or VOHC designation. It's a huge evolutionary balancing act that determines whether one will be more transmissible AND severe AND evasive. Because if it kills or incapacitates you right away you probably won't be walking and coughing among your community for high spread, but if it's super mild in its hosts it will be quietly spreading around but not kill as many of them.
