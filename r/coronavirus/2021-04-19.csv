To be fair, some of these folks have lost ones they knew to COVID, and they were at least honest with the ""I don't care what the odds are"" mentality, recognizing it might not be the logical way to think.

Still, the number of folks who think things like 90% efficacy means 10% chance of infection or the ""Wait, we could still transmit it even after vaccination!"" takes have me shaking my head.

I understand that the nature of science is one of careful evaluation before declaration, and even then with some caveats of ""we aren't certain"", but there really should be more of a push back against the ""little to nothing changes after a vaccine"" narrative that's set in. If we end up stalling out at 55-60% vaccinated because we were hedging our bets too much on how well these vaccines work, that's not really better than the alternative of being too ""reckless"".

* 776 COVID deaths in women ages 18–29
* 2,062 COVID deaths in women ages 30–39
* 5,491 COVID deaths in women ages 40–49 (one of the original six reported cases was a 48-year-old woman)

I believe two more cases were reported in an older woman and a man as well. Even if you look at just this lowest-risk age group, women ages 18–29, we’re talking about 776 COVID deaths and counting; there are about 25 million women in that category ([https://www.populationpyramid.net/united-states-of-america/2020/](https://www.populationpyramid.net/united-states-of-america/2020/)). Right now it’s believed that the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine caused one death due to blood clots in &gt;7 million people who received it (although it’s certainly possible more cases will turn up), which means we would expect about 3.6 vaccine deaths if every woman age 18–29 received the vaccine vs. hundreds and hundreds of COVID deaths.

And remember, no one’s forcing anyone to get a vaccine, or this particular vaccine (the issue of vaccine passports aside)…what the FDA did is ban *anyone* from receiving it, even if they and their doctor are aware of the risks.

I don’t think he actively opposes background checks, but he wouldn’t be interested in repealing any sort of background check that currently exists or implementing new ones, either. He was against the no fly list ban.

His problem with guns is more stupidity and idiocy with users than people having them in general. Most of the injuries that he sees are related to kids taking guns from parents and thinking they are hard or issues with mishandling of guns (he refuses to call them accidents because they could be prevented via education and actions, which I disagree with, but yeah).

I think he also privately wants to promote a culture shift that supports gun safety. If he thought that banning guns would solve the problems, he would probably support it. He doesn’t think it would fix things and above all else he wants kids to stop getting hurt.

&gt;  
&gt;As restrictions slowly begin to be lifted in Ireland in tandem with increased vaccination, the question on everyone’s lips is this: when will this pandemic be over?  
&gt;  
&gt;As Covid fatigue dominates everyday conversations, what – if any – are the signs that will offer us a sense of safety and allow things go back to normal?  
&gt;  
&gt;The first and most obvious sign will be declining numbers of people admitted to hospital with Covid-19 or, more specifically, declining numbers in intensive care units (ICUs) and fewer people dying from the disease.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Results from Covid-19 vaccine trials in Scotland and Israel have found that the vaccines are 100 per cent effective against hospitalisation and mortality in the over-65s,” says Dr Eoghan de Barra, infectious disease consultant at Beaumont Hospital and senior lecturer in the department of international health and tropical medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. In other words, nobody over 65 ended up in hospital or died from Covid-19 following vaccination.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, most of these vaccine trials took place before the new Covid-19 variants appeared and concerns have already been raised about whether some of the current vaccines will work against the newest strains of Covid-19 circulating. For this reason, vaccines against newer strains are already in production.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr de Barra says that while mortality rates will decrease significantly in the over-65s following vaccination, Sars-CoV-2 \[the virus which causes Covid-19\] will remain in circulation and many vulnerable individuals will continue to be at risk of severe disease or death from Covid-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;International studies have confirmed that over 90 per cent of deaths from Covid-19 occur in those over 65. In Ireland, 1,992 people 85 and over died from the disease between March 2020 and March 2021. A total of 1,585 people aged 75-84 and 720 people aged 65-74 died here from Covid in the same period. This represents about 92 per cent of all deaths from Covid-19 in Ireland.   
&gt;  
&gt;According to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, 86 per cent of those who died from Covid-19 had an underlying condition. And, significantly, the so-called case fatality ratio (deaths per number of cases) dropped from 1.88 per cent of cases in March 2020 to 0.03 per cent in March 2021 in the entire population.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Acceptable mortality**  
&gt;  
&gt;“We have to ask ourselves what will be the acceptable mortality rates for Covid-19. The WHO has defined the infection/fatality rate for under-70s as 0.05 (50 people in every 100,000) but we must remember that we still have a large proportion of the global population susceptible to Covid-19,” says Dr de Barra. An average flu season in Ireland results in a death rate of approximately two people in every 100,000.  
&gt;  
&gt;In Ireland, the under-65s represented 8 per cent of all deaths (368 out of 4,667) from Covid-19 in the first year of the pandemic. Yet, Dr de Barra points out that when society opens up further, there will still be a significant number of people vulnerable to serious illness from Covid-19 who don’t even come under the radar of the health services.  
&gt;  
&gt;And for some of these people, Covid-19 might prove fatal. “Firstly, you’ve got to consider that while obese individuals (defined as those with a body mass index over 40) only accounted for 342 of all cases, almost half of them were admitted to hospital, one-third of them were in ICUs and one in 10 of them died. There are young people in Ireland with undiagnosed hypertension and diabetes and obesity who will be vulnerable to Covid-19 when society opens up,” says Dr de Barra.  
&gt;  
&gt;And consider that while the risk of dying from Covid-19 might be very low (nine in every 100,000) for a young man or woman in their 20s, that person can still transmit the virus to a more vulnerable person who might not have yet been vaccinated.  
&gt;  
&gt;Add to this the potential that current vaccines might not work for variants which haven’t even arrived in Ireland yet – and you begin to understand that we are further from the end of the pandemic than it might seem.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most infectious disease specialists, virologists and epidemiologists now agree that Covid-19 is likely to become endemic in society. In a survey of scientists in Nature journal, 89 per cent said that Sars-CoV-2 was either very likely or likely to become an endemic virus. This means that it will never completely disappear but will continue to circulate in populations where many people are either immune to it through natural infection or from vaccination. Influenza and four other human coronaviruses that causes common colds are also endemic but a combination of annual vaccines and acquired immunity means that societies tolerate these seasonal deaths and illnesses they bring without requiring lockdowns, masks and social distancing.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Fatality rate**  
&gt;  
&gt;“Other pandemics such as Sars or Mers burned out because they had a higher fatality rate. Only two infectious diseases – smallpox and rinderpest – have been completed eradicated. Some have been eliminated from a geographical area – for example Covid in Australia – but it will come back when restrictions ease,” says Dr de Barra.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Covid-19 has partly become a pandemic because there is a low fatality rate, particularly if you consider that studies in China  found that 82 per cent of people didn’t have any symptoms,” he adds.  
&gt;  
&gt;Once a significant proportion of the population has been vaccinated, the future level of circulation of Sars-CoV-2 is expected to decrease but not disappear. “The herd immunity \[threshold\] depends on the reproductive rate of the virus and the B117 variant has a higher reproductive \[transmission\] rate. So, a higher percentage of the population – more than 70-80 per cent – will need to be vaccinated if variants are circulating,” says Dr de Barra.   
&gt;  
&gt; “Getting the last 15-20 per cent of the adult population vaccinated is the hard bit. Vaccination is for preservation of life and the prevention of transmission. The ongoing circulation of the virus will reinfect those who the vaccination doesn’t work for or those who haven’t got the vaccination,” he says.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Vaccine-resistant variants**  
&gt;  
&gt;So, arguably, tracking down the virus will become even more important as case numbers decline. “When ICU and hospital admissions with Covid-19 are low, that’s the time to identify the five to 10 cases a day,” says Dr de Barra. In other words, testing, contact tracing and isolating those with the virus will need to be continued even when a high percentage of the population is vaccinated.  
&gt;  
&gt;So this means that vaccination will not be the panacea to end the pandemic that some might have thought. “It will require work to keep the virus at a tolerable level. The virus is unpredictable. We’re likely to have active genomic surveillance of vaccine-resistant variants. Europe is likely to contain the virus to a tolerable level but it will take a lot longer for the rest of the world to get to that point and we may need a vaccine booster in the next 12 months,” says Dr de Barra.  
&gt;  
&gt;Public health experts have pointed out that the behaviour of the public will be what will bring a fourth wave of Covid-19 to Ireland or allow us to become a low Covid country going forward.  
&gt;  
&gt;So, these are the questions we have to ask ourselves. Will we continue to prevent the spread of the virus with all the infection control measures we have become familiar with? Will mask-wearing and social distancing outside our immediate family circle become a longlasting habit to prevent new variants of Covid-19 taking hold? Will we continue with coughing and sneezing etiquette and hand-washing next winter when Covid-19 is likely to join flu as a chronic seasonal illness? Will we work from home if we are feeling sick? Will vulnerable people avoid crowded places and travelling to far-flung destinations?  
&gt;  
&gt;And, in the long term, will our children build up natural immunity to Covid-19 as they do for many other endemic viruses? Or will they too need to be vaccinated with the rest of the population on an annual basis?

I'm not a doctor and my basic understanding of biology is pretty sketchy so take what I'm saying as someone who has tried to gain a basic layman's understanding. I'm also not a Covid denier. I think it's real but I do think there is a shit ton of money in vaccines for it and that effective treatments would derail that. I also have an understanding of how Pharma companies have used their influence to keep nicotine reduction from being implemented in tobacco products for the past couple decades in order to keep people smoking. That doesn't even touch on their role in the opioid epidemic in the US or how the FDA looked the other way for more than a decade after they realized there was a problem. So call me cynical. 

Ivermetrin is an anti-viral that even has it's own sub-reddit. I was a lot more skeptical at first thinking they were trying to plug the stock. However, I've seen doctor after doctor pushing it as an early treatment and a judge in Wisconsin even ordered a hospital to continue with treatment after a seemingly terminal patient showed surprising results after two treatments. They didn't give a reason why they quit but the family took them to court to get them to continue. 

Nicotine, I was following this pretty closely last year following the anecdotal evidence in France that smokers were four times less likely to be hospitalize for Covid than non-smokers. There were five studies around the world including giving front line workers nicotine patches.

Also, the ""95% efficacy rate"" of the Pfizer vaccine refers to the *relative* risk reduction and not absolute risk reduction.

Among approximately 37,000 subjects with at least 2 months follow up, 170 had confirmed COVID-19 (8 in the vaccine group; 162 in the placebo group). This represents infection rates of 0.04% and 0.88% respectively, and a *relative* efficacy &gt;95%. In other words &gt;95% of confirmed infections occurred in the placebo group. The absolute difference between groups is 0.84%, thus the vaccine prevented one COVID-19 infection for every 119 people vaccinated. ([Source](https://www.thennt.com/review-covid-analysis-2020/))

Also, the Pfizer study did not test asymptomatic people, nor were there enough severe cases of COVID in the study population (there were only 4 severe cases *total*) to determine the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing cases of severe disease.

Some countries will be easier than others, but I guarantee you the government has already sorted out getting military personnel and ambassadors and staff vaccinated. Just put in a little more effort and let American citizens get vaccinated.

Honestly, people make such a huge fuss about DC and Puerto Rico statehood and representation, but completely ignore Americans living abroad. Yeah, they technically get representatives in Congress based on the last place they lived in the US, but those representatives don’t give two shits about the unique set of issues Americans abroad face, and are never going to start thinking through how their legislation affects them. And so shit like this is a constant issue. There are more Americans abroad than in DC and Puerto Rico combined, and Congress consistently neglects to consider the unique issues they face. If Puerto Rico and DC are being considered for statehood, maybe at the very least Americans abroad could get non-voting representatives in Congress the way PR and DC do currently.

Yes I can, especially when it is much much much more likely, AND we're ignoring the rest of the impacts of COVID. If you're someome that can get the vaccine right now (either 55+ or with chronic disease) getting COVID is pretty likely to be bad news of some form even if you don't die.

1/1000 people dying from a disease is a terrifying number, and several magnitudes above the likelyhood of being hurt by the AZ vaccine, which is itself magnitudes less likely than dying from many other things those vaccine snobs are doing in their lives. So if I can't blame them for being ridiculously overly careful, I sure can blame them for their inconsistency and for doing it on the one decision that could end up hurting them in the short term and will hurt society's immunity as a whole.

I mean I had a lady physically come IN my pharmacy today to ask what vaccine we carried because she's at risk of clots or something. You know, the pharmacy? The place where sick people go? The idea of calling us instead didn't cross her mind. Coming to the pharmacy is, again, much more likely to result in catching COVID and dying. People don't get numbers.

A lot can happen in a few weeks in this pandemic. A handful of people that COULD have had the AZ vaccine but decided to wait will die, this is a fact.

I'm not sure I'd agree. Here in the UK we have less vaccines than you guys do (or will do shortly), yet over 95% of those over the age of 50 have had at least 1 dose of a vaccine, compared to 80% in the USA.  


Why does that matter, well the difference between 20% unvaccinated and 5% unvaccinated in at risk groups is quite large, you can see that the UK currently has about 5 times less deaths per capita per day at the minute, in large part due to higher vaccination rates in older people as this is by far the most important aspect of the vaccination campaign. 


&gt;  Once it's in their pharmacies and doctor offices, a lot of that fifth will slowly be vaccinated.   


But the question is why weren't these groups targeted to start with, older people are overwhelmingly the ones at risk from the virus. Why aren't public health officials going down a list of all seniors, sending them letters, calling them up, going around to their house ect. to give them the jab. Why are younger more tech savvy people able to outbook older people for the jab. From a public health perspective it is your job to reach the seniors not the other way around.

Russia on the other hand has done nothing mitigationwise since June. At this point I trust Chinas numbers way way more that Russia.

With that being said, there is an incorrect notion that the vaccines not only prevent disease, but are 100% effective against reducing death and hospitalization if you happen to get sick.  This is incorrect, and I believe it comes from the trial which saw very few hospitalizations in the vaccinated cohort.

The real world numbers show something different.    74 dead out of 6000 cases is 1.2% case fatality rate, and 396 hospitalizations equals 6.6% hospitalization rate.    Both are in-line with those that are not vaccinated.   That means that the data shows that you are protected against getting COVID after being vaccinated, if you happen to become sick, you can still get very sick and can still die.  Right now, the vaccine absolutely protects you from getting sick (\~95% protection), but it may not protect against serious illness and death if you are the 5% that still gets infected.

The rate in J&amp;J is 4 in 4.5 million or roughly 1 in 1.1 million people.

For comparison the AZ rate as of the EMA review date of 22nd of March was 86 in 25 million or 3.44 per million, so it is a lot lower than AZ. The 4.5 million people given J&amp;J are mainly young people in the US, whereas the AZ has been given to older people as well as younger people (most notably in the UK) but the rate seems higher among younger people so the rate in younger people may be higher than the 3.44.

The pilots, one in his 50s and the other in his 60s, are both men, CECC spokesperson Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥) said at a press briefing in Taipei.

The pilots, as well as another crew member, were on board a cargo flight to the U.S. on April 14 and stayed at a hotel there until they returned to Taiwan on April 16, Chuang said.

As is required of all flight crew members, they stayed in quarantine for three days after their arrival and were then tested for COVID-19.

The pilots' results came back positive on Tuesday, though the other crew member was negative. The third crew member and one other person the pilots came into contact with in Taiwan have been instructed to quarantine, while 129 other contacts have been asked to follow self-health management protocols.

After testing positive, one of the pilots told health authorities he had an itchy throat during quarantine, and the other experienced an itchy throat and general soreness.

The CECC is currently investigating how the pilots became infected and is looking into whether they broke any rules or if there are loopholes in the current disease prevention measures, Chuang said.
CECC regulations stipulate that flight crew are not allowed to leave their hotel room when they travel to other countries on assignment.

They are also required to wear a mask at all times on their flights, except when drinking water or having meals. No two crew members are allowed to have their masks off at the same time.

To date, Taiwan has recorded 1,078 cases of COVID-19, 960 of which have been classified as imported. Of the total, 1,038 have recovered, 11 have died and 29 are in hospital, according to CECC statistics as of Tuesday.

Globally, COVID-19 has infected over 141.6 million people in 193 countries and regions, with more than 3 million fatalities, CECC data shows.

Even just having a local bank account and not reporting it correctly (it’s a totally separate submission from the regular tax form. Many people only learn about it several years after moving abroad, and would be totally fucked it they got randomly audited) can have serious repercussions, so even the expats who owe zero taxes each year often end up paying a few hundred dollars every year to tax preparers just to be sure the IRS isn’t going to f__k them over and possibly put them in prison. I’ve even heard of people paying $1000 dollars a year to file their taxes only to pay the US government 0 dollars. People with relatively low income, mind you.

If the tax contribution from expats is so incredibly negligible as you all say, take this burden away from them and implement residence based taxes. It shouldn’t cost the government anything if, as you say, expats are paying nothing to begin with.

Either treat them as if they’re in a low tax bracket, because if they earned more they’d pay more. Or, tell them they don’t owe taxes, period.

The chart here illustrates how much faster the current spike is compared to the first wave: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/india-coronavirus-cases.html

While cases have been rising since early March I suspect this is a time when both the government and people were less cautious due to having lived with the virus in some form for over a year, the promise of a vaccine, etc. It seems like new controls/lockdowns have only just been imposed. Only a couple of weeks ago people were holidaying. Combine this lower caution with the new variant and things just took off. I think it's going to keep rising.

The important detail is that it is *only* a 5M a month plant.  

This does nothing to change the fact that AstraZeneca must have known by September 2020 they were going to be a minimum of three months behind schedule and would have a notable probability they would not be able to make their delivery targets by a significant margin using the facilities as stated in the original contract.  

The fact they didn't go cap in hand to the EU either informing them of the likely delay in delivery and offering them the chance to provide additional funds to build up other plants to mitigate some of the shortfall could be the behaviour that opens them up to failure to honour the 'best effort' clause because just going ""whelp that's all me can manage with what we said we'd set up"" ignores that they could have asked for more money to set up more facilities like they are now belatedly doing. They're not the first government contract to go over budget, they're not even the first vaccine manufacturer to come up short on delivery for this pandemic.  

The fact that AstraZeneca were importing doses from the US to the EU should have sent loud warning alarms sounding within the EU that something was up with their EU production. And all the arguments about who had rights to the UK plants production only served to obfuscate the real issue, that it was a fundamental production problem and not a temporary delivery shortfall.

[Because last week we were singling out white people.](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/05/984322992/love-your-neighbor-and-get-the-shot-white-evangelical-leaders-push-covid-vaccine?force_isolation=true)

Different groups have different reasons they are hesitant and are going to have their mind changed by different methods.  White evangelicals couldn't give a flying fuck about what Obama has to say about the vaccine.  He's speaking to black people because he's got a much higher impact on them than other groups.  There's nothing wrong with acknowledging this.

Your article seems to be busted, btw.  It's just taking me to a main page with a load of different articles.

[I assume it's this one](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/covid-19-vaccine-hesitant-black-communities-singled-out-1137750/)

I pretty much hate the article.  A. It's a month and a half old at this point.  Access is a completely different world. (Not to say that it still isn't an issue, though) B. It starts out with this half baked notion that the media isn't taking lack of access seriously and the Tuskegee study explains every bit of vaccine hesitancy, and to prove this, they link an article with this as the subheader:

&gt;Communities are taking steps to remove obstacles, including distrust of the medical system and **unequal access to healthcare**

They have the entire world of news media out there in which to make the point that no one talks about access and they link one that puts the word access right in the subheader.

They talk about how it's not just the Tuskegee and how ""the media"" is focusing on that one thing and **only** that one thing, but the first linked article includes these quotes:

&gt;‘It’s not just the history, it’s the lived reality of everyday life that people experience in racism that makes the hesitancy come through.’

and

&gt;But she believes it has become a “condensed symbol” for racism and mistrust in medicine that is rooted in experiences that extend to the present day.

or

&gt;The lack of Black representation among physicians is an indictment of the medical system’s “baked in racism,”

Their very first link does an incredible job of absolutely obliterating their premise that the media is creating a ""myopic"" view of vaccine hesitancy and distrust of the medical community.  The Consumer Reports article and the Rolling Stone article actually contain a very similar structure in that latter half.  They have the discussion about Tuskegee acknowledging it as a strong root, but then bring other examples forward that are more modern and have continued the distrust while also addressing the access piece.

Yes, access is a concern, and [I believe that governments are taking steps to address it.](https://www.stanleymarketplace.com/happenings/covid-vaccine-equity-pop-up-for-all?force_isolation=true)  Obviously a little pop up clinic isn't the end all be all, but I link it to show that state governments know this is an issue and are working to address it.

But that doesn't mean we shouldn't have people addressing hesitancy within the black community.  It's obviously still an issue even if it's a bigger issue in other communities (Evangelical Whites, for instance).",,,1618928452,{},gv7d44i,False,t3_mu5wn5,False,True,t1_gv60cze,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mu5wn5/obama_shaq_and_barkley_urge_communities_of_color/gv7d44i/,1618929438,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_b4npv,False,False,,

According to EU reports quite a lot. They are unlikely to lie about it when it is both embarrassing &amp; destroys their US export ban mantra.

Having read the article it was a scathing indictment of the EU. They tore apart the EU's argument that the Americans banned exports.

The EU than turned around &amp; pretended it was EU production &amp; subject to export controls. Along with documenting how the EU has been scrambling for non EU production. 


They hit AZ for promising more than they could deliver. However the main thrust of the AZ ""attack"" is their production &amp; supply chain is a mess.

&gt; Texas A&amp;M University researchers have identified a new COVID-19 variant that originated in the state.

&gt; Scientists at the Texas A&amp;M Global Health Research Complex (GHRC) identified the variant — called BV-1 after Brazos Valley, where it originated — from a saliva sample taken from a student as a part of an ongoing testing program. Researchers believe it’s related to the United Kingdom variant.
&gt; 
&gt; The student with the confirmed case showed mild flu-like symptoms for nearly a month, suggesting this new variant may cause a longer than normal infection in young adults.**Although only one mild case has been confirmed, researchers are worried that the variant shows resistance to antibodies.**

&gt; “**We do not at present know the full significance of this variant, but it has a combination of mutations similar to other internationally notifiable variants of concern,**” GHRC Chief Virologist Ben Neuman said in a press release. “This variant combines genetic markers separately associated with rapid spread, severe disease and high resistance to neutralizing antibodies.”

&gt; There have been five COVID-19 variants confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but researchers across the world have identified thousands. According to the CDC, the UK variant is now the most common strain in the United States.

So they don’t know anything about this new variant. Variants aren’t scary.

[],,HatchSmelter,,,,,,[],"The only 2 vaccines being given right now in the US are mrna, so that's why I focused on that

No, they are not clinical trials. Trials were completed. All 3 vaccines given eua in the US went through all three normal stages of clinical trials as usual. Things were sped up by reducing the time between trials and moving the vaccines to the front of the line when their results arrived at the fda. My understanding (as a layperson) is that the eua cut out more of the bureaucratic process and red tape, not the testing. Those vaccines are currently in the normal process for approval, and likely to be formally approved within a few weeks. 

I have not participated in clinical trials, but, as someone with a rare medical issue, I have definitely been interested and applied to several in hopes of getting help with my own issues or helping others with the same. It just never worked out. Also, covid is by far the most serious public health issue in my lifetime, so even if I hadn't been willing before, I'd definitely be willing now. I can't do much else to help. I stay home as much as I can, wear masks, etc, and also, since I've still been working, I try to spend money in my community to help keep the economy going.

It's actually overblown.  If (that timing) were critical, in a clinical sense, then they'd be close or identical in other countries. The U.S. clinical trials were designed with expedited second dose schedules, but it's highly unlikely that it's the optimal period.

It's common in vaccinology that longer periods between the first dose and re-challenge provide improved protection, and the best available information is that, with regard to COVID-19 vaccines, the same dynamics occur.

&gt;The second dose may actually be more effective when it's delayed. ""Generally, a longer gap between vaccine doses leads to a better immune response,"" Andrew Pollard, director of the University of Oxford's vaccine group, told The BMJ. He pointed to the HPV vaccine, where a one-year gap between doses yields stronger immunity than a one-month gap. He also pointed out that in the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine trials, the immune response was about three times greater when the second dose was given at 2-3 months versus 4 weeks. Similarly, a multinational study found that the first dose of the Moderna vaccine had 80% efficacy and that a delay of 9-12 weeks ""could enhance the program effectiveness and prevent additional infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, compared to a 4-week interval between the doses.""

The duration, as is, was chosen for public health reasons (trying to head off the curve accelerating given the recent rise in the alternate strains.)

My mom was heavily against the covid vaccine. She would basically say what many folks say, “they came out with this too fast”, “we don’t know what’s in that stuff, “I don’t trust them...they’re test it out on us just like with the Tuskeegee experiments (we’re black)”, etc.
With her (because I know her pretty well), I didn’t argue too much. I offered what I knew, and spoke to why **I am taking the vaccine**, not why she or anyone else should take it. 

Leading up to my vaccine, I would say little things here and there, expressing my excitement about it and how eager I am to live life again. She would say “just because you get the vaccine, doesn’t mean you can just go back to all that! The virus is still here!” Funnily enough, she’s someone who was simultaneously anti-vax and very cautious about covid. Always masked up and cleaned things and used sanitizer religiously. I, again, wouldn’t really argue. Just offer what I knew, but assured her I would still wear masks wherever it’s required. 

She saw me get the first shot and would check in with me after, and saw that I was fine.

Two weeks after that, she asked me to book her an appointment. It was kinda funny, just as she was about to leave my place, she said “you know, I’m starting to feel kinda funny, like my throat or something (it was allergies lol)...maybe you should see if I could get a vaccine...?” I said “sure!” And she said “but I only want the same exact one you got!! Nothing else!!” Luckily, the one I got was most prevalent in our area anyway, so I didn’t argue or anything. Got her an appt for that weekend. 

She got the shot, but she was still very much like “we still need to be super careful!!”. This was almost two weeks ago (her second shot is this weekend). 

And then today, she said to me “I’m thinking we gotta hop on a plane and go somewhere after I’m done getting vaccinated.” And that shocked me, considering how serious she has been about all of this. I said “yeah? You’d be okay with getting on a plane?” And she said “well I mean, all my friends are in some sort of medical job and they all got vaccinated early and have been traveling everywhere. I mean, it’s wild but, I guess when I’m vaccinated, I might as well.” I chuckled a bit and agreed with her.

Lol, she really came full circle. I’m so happy.

Just goes to show the power of peer pressure and patience, I think it’s even more beneficial than arguments or even offering facts, for that matter. And picking and choosing battles, like for instance, the fact that she only wanted a specific vaccine. Sure, we all know that all the vaccines are good. But if someone is already a skeptic, and the vaccine that they want is the one that is easily available to them anyway, why argue? I had to swallow my tongue and realize that. I’m really happy she’s gonna be fully vaccinated soon.",,,1618884005,{},gv5m2d4,False,t3_mtv2x4,False,False,t3_mtv2x4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mtv2x4/daily_discussion_thread_april_19_2021/gv5m2d4/,1618894165,33,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_17gy7p17,False,False,,True

I'm a homebody. I am fine with wearing a kn95 mask to go out to get groceries once a week, and diligent with washing my hands and such. And avoid close encounters with neighbors and whatnot. I am also fairly young and WFH. So my risk factor should be low.

Now why would I possibly delay? Key word delay, not skip. Simply because so many professionals and experts claimed getting a vaccine ready in a year would be improbable because of the difficulty. Despite already getting my first shot along with millions of others, I still have concerns that there might be unforseen issues. The J&amp;J vaccine is kinda proof of that, statistically perfectly safe, so I'm not caught up in a handful of deaths out of millions, but still a big enough issue that this got through and the FDA is concerned enough to pull the plug on it for now.  The upside though is with so many millions of people getting vaccinated, there will be a big response to trying to fix any possible issues that come from a vaccine.

TLDR; My concern is that there is a possibility of finding out a bigger issue with one or more of the vaccines in the next 6 months.

Vaccine Diplomacy would really be the best way: pumping vaccines into the distribution system already in place, and letting the Americans stand in the same line as the rest of us. Anything else...and I'm not saying this is good, merely a reality...will cause trouble. One politically motivated twitter rant and...rocks will fly. Just a prediction.

Also, as the average American immigrant here is a retired person, most would be at the front of the line anyway.

I don't recall the specifics, but a year ago, when this country was among the hardest hit in the world, the USA did organize evacuation flights for it citizens. So there's that. Many left, and I guess the ones that stayed elected to ride it out with us on our terms.

Honestly, I worry about the friends I have in the American immigrant community. I suspect that for many of them, they are facing a very different situation than the one they chose when they came here. The economy is in shambles, the nice restaurants they liked so much are all closed, crime is up, tension and stress is through the roof. I reject and condemn xenophobia in every sense, but I admit it is rising. If our lives don't improve soon, or at least stop getting worse, I fear for them: lashing out at foreigners in desperate times is...well, predictable. And the family and community roots that sustain us here are not available to them. But hey...no one has it easy, right?

On another note, and risking injecting geopolitics into this, but China is currently winning the Vaccine Diplomacy race here.

2. I do not claim that the German Government handled the pandemic perfectly. The vaccine rollout started slow and the conferences between federal states and the government have been an nothing short of an embarrassment. That however does not change the fact that when looking at the actual numbers, Germany has handled the pandemic better than most demographically compareable countries (death rate, economy, unemployment rate, excess deaths etc). So if government has blood on his hands you should be talking about countries like the U.S.

3. The vaccine rollout admittedly has been slow at the start. Its speed has increased significantly now and will likely finish not far behind the U.S and maybe even before the UK. Without selling pations data or pursuing a Germany first policy. Furthermore, delays are mainly to blame on the EU which as most people seem not to understand, is entirely different from the German Government, and the ridiculous failure of Astrazeneca to deliver the promised doses.

4. As someone who has been in the UK during the first lockdown, I can tell you first hand that in most European countries stricter lockdown measures have been in place for the most part of the pandemic.

[],,Xyonik,,,,,,[],"Do you think extending the interval between vaccine doses is a good idea?

It's interesting that the FDA explicitly states that extending the interval between Covid vaccine doses hasn't been studied and therefore strong recommends against it because it could be ultimately counterproductive to public health if the depth or duration of protection is reduced when given at intervals up to 12 weeks, as currently being done in the UK, or for 6 weeks, and as is being done in Germany.

What happens to people in the UK if you request your doses to follow the studied regimes (quoted below)? This seems convincing enough to me that I would try to push for it given at 21 or 28 days, respectively for Pfizer or Moderna. I'm in Germany, but I fear that no one will care and offer me doses at 6 weeks (or more) or nothing, but I want them at the same interval as prescribed.

&gt;The available data continue to support the use of two specified doses of each authorized vaccine at specified intervals. For the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, the interval is 21 days between the first and second dose. And for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the interval is 28 days between the first and second dose.   
What we have seen is that the data in the firms’ submissions regarding the first dose is commonly being misinterpreted. In the phase 3 trials, 98% of participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech trial and 92% of participants in the Moderna trial received two doses of the vaccine at either a three- or four-week interval, respectively. Those participants who did not receive two vaccine doses at either a three-or four-week interval were generally only followed for a short period of time, such that we cannot conclude anything definitive about the depth or duration of protection after a single dose of vaccine from the single dose percentages reported by the companies.    
Using a single dose regimen and/or administering less than the dose studied in the clinical trials without understanding the nature of the depth and duration of protection that it provides is concerning, as there is some indication that the depth of the immune response is associated with the duration of protection provided. If people do not truly know how protective a vaccine is, there is the potential for harm because they may assume that they are fully protected when they are not, and accordingly, alter their behavior to take unnecessary risks.  
We know that some of these discussions about changing the dosing schedule or dose are based on a belief that changing the dose or dosing schedule can help get more vaccine to the public faster. However, making such changes that are not supported by adequate scientific evidence may ultimately be counterproductive to public health.

2) driving risks are ongoing. COVID risks will go drastically down over time with vaccines and reduced spread. Short-term mitigation factors can have a bigger impact because of that.  Driving mitigation factors have to keep going in perpetuity to keep helping. 

3) driving is more of a necessity than stuff like eating indoors or working in an office for people who could just work from home.

 I recently analyzed the Oxford study on Cerebral venous thrombosis post-COVID-19 and post-vaccination ([https://osf.io/a9jdq/](https://osf.io/a9jdq/)).

Taken in conjunction with EMA and CDC data, their findings are quite surprising to me.

**(Study)** ***Incidence of CVT or PVT after COVID-19 Infection:***

* Incidence of CVT: 39.0 per million people.
* Incidence of PVT: 436.4 per million people.

**(Study)** ***Incidence of CVT or PVT after Administration of Pfizer or Moderna mRNA Vaccine:***

* Incidence of CVT: 4.1 per million people.
* Incidence of PVT: 44.9 per million people.

**(EMA)** ***Incidence of CVT and PVT after Administration of Oxford/AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 Vaccine\*:***

* Incidence of CVT: 5.0 per million people.
* Incidence of PVT: 1.6 cases per million people\*

**(CDC)** ***Incidence of CVT and PVT after Administration of Jannsen vaccine:***

* Incidence of CVT: 0.88 per million people.

*\* EMA technically looked at cases of Splanchnic thrombosis, but it is comparable to PVT, with 53 cases out of 34 million people.*

Based on this data, it seems as if the incidence of **PVT is \~30x** more prevalent in the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines than in Oxford/AstraZeneca's vaccine.

Mask policies affect your individual risk but they affect group risk much more. So yes, I’m fully vaccinated. I’m not going to panic and avoid all interaction, but I’m still going to wear a mask if I ride public transit, if I go indoors anywhere but my own home, or if I come into close proximity with a group of people for an extended period *unless I know with a fair degree of certainty* that everyone around me has also been fully vaccinated. A small maskless event with the neighbors or extended family is fine. But I’m going to keep wearing masks in places open to the public until we have a steady decline in cases over multiple weeks and local vaccination rates exceed 50%. I may have a 0.005% chance of getting sick myself and probably a 0.1% chance of transmitting it to someone but my normal routine before COVID involved a lot of public spaces. Wearing a mask isn’t that bad and if me wearing a mask in public spaces means one less person a week contracts COVID, that’s worth it. I used to routinely take public transit when it was standing room only. I’m definitely not going to do that without masking any time soon. Other people have commented on movie theaters and how people immediately take masks off when the movie starts so I’m not going there for a while either.

They seem to have botched the vaccine roll-out (exporting more than they administered until recently, not ordering enough or investing in domestic capacity), they're very hesitant to enforce further lockdowns like they did last year because it'll devastate the economy (many have slid back into poverty over past year), the nationalist government isn't stopping large Hindu religious gatherings in order to placate the base, they're under-reporting deaths and not testing enough (leading to 20%+ positive rate in some areas), and there's some evidence that stronger variants are emerging (they're calling the Maharashtra variant a 'double mutant').

I think this is the main issue. You can shit on me all you want but if you have something to offer that'll benefit me, I'll take it. Consider your middle aged/young TS. They are mostly correct in believing that covid most likely won't affect them due to their age, if protection from covid (basically the only incentive cdc is offering with vaccines) is the only perk, it now becomes far easier to justfiy not taking it with mrna concerns. If you offer the removal of personal restrictions, something *every* American hates, a lot of them will take it with the reward increased exponentially of not having to mask or distance. We have a pretty good idea that vaccinated people don't spread, even if it costs say a 100 lives from the 0.01% that do spread, thousands will be saved in the long term by the millions of extra people willing to take the shot. 

Bonus: minorities are a pretty vaccine hesitant block too of the population. How about instead of encouraging their fear that the medical establishment is out to get them, we treat them like adults instead of children. No, a few experiments conducted decades ago literally has nothing to do with a shot that's going into the arms of millions. All the old rich white guys are falling over themselves to get this shot, they wouldn't be doing that if it was some effort to screw y'all over. We have to call a spade a spade here, these concerns are frankly ridiculous in this context. We're not asking them to even join a trial, much less an all black one, just take a shot millions of people before you take. By simping for the extremely logically flawed concerns, you're doing a disservice to those communities. 

We have to figure out what we want to do here. Do we want to make ourselves feel warm and fuzzy inside by jerking ourselves about systemic racism and applying it to places that has nothing to do with it, decreasing acceptance for a lifesaving vaccine? Or do we want to save as many lives as possible in these communities, even if it hurts their feelings to pick apart their concerns and diminishes our own credentials as warriors for equality? TS somewhat have logic in their arguments abt this being the first widespread mrna vaccine.

If you are looking for an example of mRNA from outside the cell causing protein production, the [SARS-CoV-2 virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2) itself and other [+ssRNA viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-strand_RNA_virus) (e.g. rhinoviruses that cause the common cold) are good examples.

The delivery mechanism of the RNA is different in these viruses (i.e. using the virus instead of lipid nanoparticles) but the effect is the same -- making your cells produce proteins it will otherwise not produce. The difference here is of course that the proteins from the viruses get assembled into new complete viruses, which multiplies the amount of viruses in your body, while the single spike protein made from the mRNA vaccine can't.

Your immune system will recognize both the virus and the spike protein as foreign bodies and generate an immune response to get rid of it. However, the virus is replicating at the same time as your immune system is generating a response, while there is only a fixed amount of spike proteins that can be produced by your cells (mRNA itself has a short half-life before breaking down).",,,1618876217,{},gv56v3m,False,t3_mtv2x4,False,False,t1_gv51306,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mtv2x4/daily_discussion_thread_april_19_2021/gv56v3m/,1618886297,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_8cwss,False,False,,

High risk amongst the vaccinated population, but extremely low risk compared to non vaccinated. You still have the same risk factors as previously. The difference is your chance of death from covid is almost non existent now.

If it makes you feel better you are much safer than any unvaccinated group. There is a risk however miniscule but I really wouldn't worry about it. Being in the high risk group myself the over 99.99% protection from death is great.

They were advising based on two metrics--severe PPE shortages for healthcare workers and uncertainty about the efficacy of masks of non-medical grade for the general public. 

Dr  Jerome Adams, the former surgeon general, is an anesthesiologist. He is not an expert on disease progress, epidemiology, or public health. He was unqualified for the role and unqualified to advise the nation on coronavirus or any pandemic, really. 

My feeling is that public health officials, Dr. Fauci included, followed the known science while also protecting our already overwhelmed healthcare system. And people still stockpiled and selfishly over bought supplies, including PPE. Can you imagine if the message was maybe masks don't help, maybe they do, but please leave them for healthcare workers? That would not have worked. 

There is no lie and it is confusing to me why you and others are insisting there was. And people refusing to now wear masks or follow any public health directives or get a vaccine because they felt ""betrayed"" is an argument that holds no weight. It's petulant, as other users have pointed out. It's disappointing and it's depressing.

Probably best to call a doctor if you're concerned about it, but if it makes you breathe easier, rashes can be a vaccine side effect. Mike Osterholm mentioned this in his last [Covid-19 podcast](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/podcasts-webinars/episode-51) (in the broader context of people being concerned about side effects):  


&gt;Now, I do want to point out, though, that there is one thing that's happening right now that has concerned people, and I can understand why, but it, too, is really, truly a minor reaction to the vaccine. And this is what's become really known as the covid rash. It usually often occurs first around the injected arm where you first got vaccinated. But some people actually see it become a much more widespread type of rash across the body. And even some people report it kind of feeling it inside their mouth. I have to say, Dr. Esther Freeman and colleagues in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology just published last week an entire series of cases of these rashes that resolved on their own, but could be assisted with either basically using steroid creams and antihistamines. Their bottom line conclusion if this happens the first time, go ahead and get the second dose anyway because of those who had it with the first dose, half of them didn't have it with the second dose at all. And those that did get it had a much milder case of it. And this isn't surprising because the ACE2 receptors, which are those receptors critical for the virus basically attaching to, actually are very, very frequently found in skin. And so you would expect to see these kinds of reactions possibly happen. But I want to reassure everybody, this is not a big challenge. So don't be surprised if you need to use steroid creams or antihistamines. Still, go ahead and get your dose. These are not at all an indication your vaccine response was inadequate or it was too much, it's just a reaction that happens with some people.",,,1618923903,{},gv73t9p,False,t3_mukr9x,False,True,t1_gv6k743,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mukr9x/daily_discussion_thread_april_20_2021/gv73t9p/,1618923950,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_8gee2,False,False,,

India and Brazil are incredibly concerning and all we need is another month or two to know if this brand new vaccine is going to provide decent efficacy against a virus that's going through a lot of mutations and changes due to rapid spread.

Also, death is actually the very least of my concerns. Death is inevitable, and can come at any time, for any reason. Quality of life, on the other hand, is something entirely different, and can be worse than death if it deteriorates too much. 

COVID is a blood disease and contracting it is rolling the dice on how it's going to interact with your particular makeup. We don't know, yet, what it is about a particular person's biology and immune system that leads to such a wide variety of outcomes. You could have almost no reaction...or you could be committing yourself to months, if not years, of sickness. There's just too many cases of ""long COVID""; losing your sense of smell/taste (absolute hell for someone like me, which cooking is a main hobby), chronic fatigue (I'm very active), brain fog (I'm a developer, I need my wits about me), headaches. The list goes on and on. We know a guy in town who had to lose his arm due to blood clots. Our neighbor is on oxygen 4 months later. Another friend had to move out of town because it ravaged her lungs and she needed lower elevation (couldn't breathe well here any longer).

You do you and be casual about the masking, but there's not a single activity that I need to do so badly where I'm going to increase my risk of contracting this Russian Roulette of a disease, if at all possible. I'm going to see how the vaccine rollout does, and in the meantime keep my distance, keep my mask on and keep things lowkey until we know more and I see the community spread drop to very low transmission levels.

Personally due to the data on transmission prevention being inconclusive thus far, I'm gonna wait until the vaccines have completed fase 4 clinical trials OR that they conclude that the vaccines prevent transmission.

Because no matter how you twist and turn it, there are some risks involved with taking any medicine, and we simply don't yet know what the long term risks are with these novel vaccines. Although I ultimately believe that the vaccines are safe and effective, I think that healthy people who don't actually need the vaccine should consider waiting it out for a while until we have seen how people respond in the long term.

So it goes full bore against it, in a way that it never would have naturally known to do if you had actually caught real COVID.

My understanding is that the vaccines don't prevent you catching Covid but that the symptoms are significantly reduced, so vaccinated people might not even know they have Covid, let alone report it.

So if 10,000 unvaccinated people caught Covid, we might have previously seen say 5,000 of them having strong enough symptoms that they get tested. 1,000 of those are hospitalised and 20 of them die. Where as now 10,000 vaccinated people might still catch Covid but only 100 of them have significant symptoms that they get tested. 50 of them might need hospitalisation and 1 of them dies. In both cases it's still 10,000 underlying people catching Covid but the significant difference is 5,000 unvaccinated people have strong enough symptom to get tested versus 100 vaccinated people having strong enough symptoms to get tested.

So you're looking at those 100 tested vaccinated people and saying, ""But one of them died so CFR = 1%"" But in realiy the CFR = 1 out of 10,000.

So you can only fairly compare the CFR if you know the true number of cases. We don't know that figure for vaccinated people because so many of them don't even know they have Covid now.

https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/04/why-the-us-still-cant-donate-covid-19-vaccines-to-countries-in-need

TLDR is that the contracts Trump signed with Pfizer and Moderna stipulated that the vaccines would only be used in the US. US bought more than needed, of course, because at the time nobody knew if Pfizer or Moderna would fail, so buying more meant that if one failed they’d still have a decent supply (not sure if the article said that, but I remember that part from when it was happening). So now the US is stuck with a surplus of vaccines that they’re not legally allowed to sell or donate due to Trump not giving an F about global health. Biden has been trying to find a workaround ever since he took office (article mentions a January 26 memoranda). They’ve tried to renegotiate the terms with Pfizer and Moderna, who refuse to change the terms to let the vaccines be used outside the US. (presumably because they want to be able to produce more and sell to the other countries directly, for more profit)

So, basically the US is hoarding because Trump, Pfizer, and Moderna are selfish greedy pigs who don’t care about the lives that are at stake. And so this whole question of “what about Americans abroad?” is kind of a moot point because the vaccines are stuck where they are until Biden can fix Trump’s mess, and there’s a good chance they’ll expire before that can happen.",,,1618911832,{},gv6n7u6,False,t3_muafdw,False,False,t1_gv5us0n,/r/Coronavirus/comments/muafdw/the_americans_who_still_cant_get_vaccinated/gv6n7u6/,1618913203,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_6g1jo0ga,False,False,,

there is also some other evidence that natural infection may provide better immunity because your body has been trained to respond to the whole virus, whereas the vaccines focus solely on the spike protein part, so some have argued natural immunity offers more broad protection compared to other variants.

[],,Viewfromthe31stfloor,,,,,,[],"&gt;A mix of vaccinations, continued mask wearing, people already having immunity and the weather warming up has slowed down the spread, said Diana Cervantes, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at UNT Health Science Center.

&gt;”I think they took some gambles and it paid off,” she said.

…

&gt;Vinny Taneja, Tarrant County’s Public Health Director, agrees with Cervantes. On Tuesday, he was worried about the uptick in the virus’ spread. As of Friday, every infected person was transmitting the virus to at least one other person, meaning the spread was increasing.

&gt;Taneja is also worried that the rapid decline in cases, positivity rate and hospitalizations had slowed, which could indicate that something is brewing. He cautioned COVID-19 is still in the community and people should continue to follow safety protocols.

&gt;Cervantes believes, in general, most people have taken the virus seriously and not ditched safety measures. If anything, lifting the mask mandate made people want to be safer. On March 10, people didn’t immediately take off the masks and go back to pre-pandemic times, Cervantes said. Most large businesses like Walmart, Target, Kroger, HEB and others are still requiring mask and other coronavirus protocols.

[],,throwoutupandover,,,,,,[],"If you’re not protected by the vaccine from infection, it follows that you’re more likely to be in a demographic that has immune deficiencies, or were otherwise unable to create a protective response. These people for the most part were excluded from the trials though many of them are now eligible. It makes sense that Covid is still dangerous for these people. It’s essentially a false CFR, as the vaccine has a massive protective effect for the general population, but not as strong for immunodeficient folk. 

You also have, like we did before vaccination especially in the early days, a visibility problem- it is extremely likely that there are significantly more breakthrough infections than the ~6000 the CDC mentioned in accordance with the ~92-97% efficacy the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines have. But many of those undetected cases, because of the vaccine, have massively reduced severity, to the point of feeling like a weak cold or being asymptomatic. I’ve been fully vaccinated for a couple months and have not had a test in that period. It could well be at some point I would have tested PCR+, especially since my behavior has become more “risky” since then (I now see friends maskless, take public transportation [masked], and have recently begun going to the gym, things I would not have considered prior to vaccination). And while I would get tested if I felt any symptom whatsoever, the average person, especially if they experience allergies, will likely not. So these cases fly under the radar, and the visible ones end up being the most severe. This is similar to the situation early in the pandemic, when the fatality rate seemed much higher because it was only severe cases being tested. 

There is no mechanism by which a vaccine, if it fails to grant you protection, makes it easier for the virus to give you a more severe infection, save ADE, which has yet to be demonstrated, either in the trials for the vaccines currently in use or otherwise. Maybe the CDC results open that question up to a researcher, and I fully expect a preprint exploring the possibility of ADE, as any society with a culture of vigorous research would, but for now, if you are immunosufficient, the vaccine is protective on all levels all of the time.

[],,MrRiski,,,,,,[],"&gt;I have not participated in clinical trials, but, as someone with a rare medical issue, I have definitely been interested and applied to several in hopes of getting help with my own issues or helping others with the same. It just never worked out. Also, covid is by far the most serious public health issue in my lifetime, so even if I hadn't been willing before, I'd definitely be willing now. I can't do much else to help. I stay home as much as I can, wear masks, etc, and also, since I've still been working, I try to spend money in my community to help keep the economy going. But if I could get involved in trials for medications, yes, absolutely, I would at least look into it. This is more than serious enough of an issue to warrant deeper involvement.

I can respect that. Personally I would have a hard time but I'm healthy and don't want to risk that personally. 

&gt;No, they are not clinical trials. Trials were completed. All 3 vaccines given eua in the US went through all three normal stages of clinical trials as usual. Things were sped up by reducing the time between trials and moving the vaccines to the front of the line when their results arrived at the fda. My understanding (as a layperson) is that the eua cut out more of the bureaucratic process and red tape, not the testing. Those vaccines are currently in the normal process for approval, and likely to be formally approved within a few weeks.

Of course now I can't find anything but I have seen videos and people who have shown that when you get the vaccine the paperwork you sign says right on it that it is a clinical trial. Admittedly those could have been faked by anyone with a word processor and a desire to get their 15 minutes of Fame.

Going back to the original question, it is definitely possible for someone to test positive for Covid, not experience symptoms early on, but have serious symptoms months later, so that fact that the vaccines are having such a strong effect in preventing serious disease at onset does not necessarily mean they will prevent serious symptoms in the future.

But no matter where the fault lies, the situation is what it is.

How do you think they’d react if the US donated surplus vaccines to countries (as they’re already considering doing) but with the stipulation that some amount is reserved to be prioritized for US citizens? Like, here’s enough to vaccinate your healthcare workers and some of your highest risk citizens, and also here’s enough for the US citizens living in your country. Just don’t go giving the vaccine to lower risk people before offering it to the US citizens. Like, the US citizens get to be in a priority group before the average joe, but after the vital cases.

My main issue is that the US taxes Americans abroad, but then starts giving away vaccines without even considering millions of Americans. Like, fine, do that, but then don’t make them pay taxes. And don’t go proudly talking about how all Americans are eligible for the vaccine and stuff when millions have absolutely 0 access and no hope of getting access any time soon. That’s just blatantly false, and insulting to say that, as if they’re implying that Americans abroad aren’t real Americans, or aren’t citizens. Instead, just fucking say “all US residents now have access”. Hell, it’s more accurate, because they’re letting immigrants in the US get vaccinated, too.

I guess I could sum up my position as Taxes = provide for taxpayers before donating “surplus”, no taxes = let the country of residence handle it.

The end of all restrictions depends on whether vaccinated people infected with the South African variant can still spread the virus in significant amounts. Data from Israel suggests that infection with the South African variant happens more often in vaccinated people than infection with other variants, but at the same time the share of people in the total population infected with this variant remains constant.

To me, this looks like the efficacy towards all variants is high enough to stop transmission, but more data is hopefully coming.
In the worst case scenario we'll have to continue to wear masks and ban large events until we have enough people vaccinated with a variant-specific booster shot.

[],,BusyBusyBizzy,,,,,,[],"&gt;Kayvan Bozorgmehr highlighted the need to bring ethical reflections into the debate about guidelines on managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, Bozorgmehr poses questions about the medical and moral pertinence of the public health policy implemented in Germany since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly concerning the management of migrants. According to Bozorgmehr, **mass quarantine was imposed in almost 70% of refugee centres with the assistance of police, private security companies, or the army. The refugees are staying in unsanitary conditions that do not meet various guidelines, least of all the primary rule of physical distancing. If these allegations are true, this policy is an immense ethical issue, but not the only issue at stake.**  
&gt;  
&gt;It is important to remember that ethics are not morals and do not apply standards or values; ethics address questions about the feasibility and desirability of actions to benefit society. Seemingly in Germany, and probably also in other countries, **the interests of migrants were not sufficiently considered during the development of these guidelines**. Moving forward, governments and administrative agencies need to think about what will happen after the COVID-19 pandemic, which is far from over, to prepare for any possible pandemics in the future.  
&gt;  
&gt;Health-care providers and research institutions worldwide should engage in a veritable reflection of practical ethics to adapt their guidelines to the clinical and scientific reality during this time and to improve the experience of doctors and scientists. Over the past few months, these specialists have been confronted with an entirely new situation that merits the development of an ethical vision of actions. The legitimate needs and fears of populations also need to be factored in, without forgetting the constraints inherent in an increasingly globalised world.  
&gt;  
&gt;**This reflection should lead to the embodiment of practical ethics that can mediate tensions between health and economics, and between individuals and the community, by distinguishing cultural and temporal aspects.** Indeed, identifying identical solutions for all countries and transforming heterogeneous health systems is difficult. A practical, pragmatic, and rational ethical reflection is therefore needed to include these different elements.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was time to act and apply guidelines. Almost a year later, the goal is to define an ethical vision capable of bringing countries together, while considering their specific characteristics. Now is the time to call into question the subsidiarity of health at a worldwide level to arrive at useful functional coexistences between systems on the basis of different standards and cultural values.",,,1618934176,{},gv7qkuc,True,t3_mutbhq,False,False,t3_mutbhq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mutbhq/covid19_time_for_ethical_reflection/gv7qkuc/,1618937655,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_a3mtomme,False,True,,

&gt; People can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 through contact with surfaces. However, based on available epidemiological data and studies of environmental transmission factors, surface transmission is not the main route by which SARS-CoV-2 spreads, and the risk is considered to be low 

'Low' in this case is relative to other routes. It's much more than zero and is multiplied by the number of people touching surfaces. The source clearly describes how it can be hours on surfaces. I don't know your gym but if 100 people touch the door handle per hour, unless everyone one of them sanitizes before/after that door handle then you're spreading it about.

I'm not sure about the number in the second source as I'd need more info on how it was determined but anyway like I said, the risk could be zero for vaccinated people and it wouldn't affect my point.

You last quote says that the benefits *may* outweigh the risks. So not only is it saying that there is a small and non-negligible risk, it's saying it's high enough that it can't even clearly say the mental health benefits challenge it. By the way, if you have to go to the gym once a fortnight for your mental health then fine, but don't take the attitude of 'I'm vaccinated so I can hit the gym like normal'.

I appreciate the effort you went to to find sources but this is far from the '  basically 0 risk' you claimed.

[],,hyprsloth,,,,,,[],"I truly believe that a flu vaccine caused me to have a nerve reaction in my lower back that lasted for many years, like beyond 5. 

I was also sick once with the flu, and for YEARS afterwards I felt tired all the time and after many many doctor visits discovered it was a disease called Hashimoto's.  I was previously labeled with CFS.  

Hashimotos is a thyroid disease that can cause anxiety/panic disorder, lethargy (sometimes severe) and all sorts of other strange symptoms especially during the early onset.  Modern medicine didnt have a good grasp of it (still doesnt) and no medication really helps.  The thyroid replacement therapy is to stop the body from attacking the thyroid, which hasimotos is an auto immune disease.  

Something got into my thyroid that the body didnt like and it non stop attacks it.   The thyroid regulates so many things in the body and it puts a strain on your brain as well.  

Japan is on the forefront of studying hashimotos (that's where it was discovered and named).   There is a growing list of evidence that vaccines (well some of the ingredients that were used and still used today) are the cause.  The thyroid takes in the particulate foreign matter and cant release it, the body attacks it, the thyroid grows. So for me was it the vaccine or the illness.  I tend to think my body has the ability to fight off illnesses, but vaccines are relatively new in the sense of how long humans have been around.  In fact, if you opened your eyes for ten minutes straight, and blinked as fast as you could, your blink would still be 100 times longer than we've had modern medicine in comparison.  Modern medicine is complacent and the belief is that they've got a great understanding, until they realize Opps we dont we just learned something new.

Sounds crazy but look up nuclear radiation and what they tell people to take. Iodine.  Once enough iodine is in your body, your thyroid 'consumes' this and will take NOTHING else into the body. 

The body is complex, and modern medicine is still in the stone age.  We think it isnt now but in 100 years our grandkids kids will look at us like we were apes.",,,1618935926,{},gv7uqur,False,t3_muhpwd,False,True,t1_gv78v2e,/r/Coronavirus/comments/muhpwd/children_make_up_nearly_21_of_new_covid19_cases/gv7uqur/,1618940190,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_3dupog0r,False,False,,

However, I can not understand how anyone can honestly believe that thousends of people without masks standing in close proximity to each other, screaming, singing, etc for several hours and travalling in groups to the location of the protest by organised bus tours etc does not pose a significant infection risk. This recent study [(link)](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/223/4/550/6009483#228745193) published in the Journal of Infectious Deseases which includes a comprehensive overview of various studies regardings the risks of outdoor transmission of Covid-19 whil arguing that the risk of outdoor transmission is substantially lower concludes that the risks of outdoor transmission are still largely unkown and cannot be neglected.  ""Factors such as duration and frequency of personal contact, lack of  personal protective equipment, and occasional indoor gathering during a  largely outdoor experience were associated with outdoor reports of  infection."" This statement from the study sounds a lot like the conditions at a Querdenken protest. 
2. Maybe the U.S. sould give some of their stockpile of AZ to other countries then. The fact is that at the start there were limited vaccinie supply. Decisions of any Government do NOT magically increase that supply. In fact Germany has both invested very large sumes in vaccine production and produced tons of vaccines. Its just a matter of attribution. Unlike the U.S. in the EU has exported vaccines. So maybe some ""German"" deaths could and should have prevented with a more ego-centeres rollout, however in gerneal I am happy to live in a country that does not embrace an ""our-country frist"" mentality.
3. Here some actual reasons why the vaccine rollout was slow: poorer countries were against expensive mRNA vaccines and lobbied to buy AZ and other low cost vaccines; curevac was slower than expected; France wanted the EU to buy tons of vaccines from Sanofi which massively failed in the development of their vaccine; same with AZ - where is the German influence in that?
4. As I already stated, Germany handled the pandemic better in almost any metric you can look at; I for myself am happy that I have been able to go hiking pretty much all throughout the pandemic etc; how can you claim the German approach is the worst of both worlds if Germany is doing better than most countries in any measurable metric; this buT mY feeLinGs arguments from someone who has not even experienced the lockdown here is beyond me; sure there was lots of room for improvement - just like in any other countries and in this latest stage of the pandemic the federal system has proved to be ineffective; however, this is just a small part of the overall picture.
5. I am not supporting banning peaceful protest. These protest would be allowed if the protestors would show any signs of being willing to comply with the restrictions that are designed to protect the LIVES of other people which btw is also a human right; so its a matter of balancing these rights; for example, protests are allowed to take place in curfew hours as the time of the protest does not correlate with the infection risk; however, protestors are not allowed to endanger the live of other people by spreading a virus by not complying with the minimum requirements they are asked to obey which is just standing apart and waer masks - no German court would forbid protests if there was any sign that protestors intend to comply with these rules.",,,1618935906,{},gv7up2v,False,t3_mu6bto,False,True,t1_gv7p8c2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mu6bto/german_courts_ban_querdenker_antilockdown_demos/gv7up2v/,1618940162,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_8capewl,False,False,,

The CDC's study showing 80% single-dose efficacy was tiny - about 4k participants (and they were young-ish healthcare workers). The UK and Israel ran much larger studies (24k in the UK one, and a huge 1.2M in the Israeli one.)

The UK found 72% efficacy three weeks after the **first dose**; Israel found 66%.

For one week post **second dose**, the UK found 86% and Israel found 94% efficacy.

This doesn’t have to do with general co-morbidities for covid, but specifically for people with rare problems with their immune system. For example, someone undergoing chemo might have a compromised immune system that won’t react to the vaccine or virus and thus are still at high risk of both catching and dying from covid.

That small population is magnified in the death stats of “people who caught Covid despite having the vaccine” precisely because of how the vast majority of people with normal immune function are eliminated from the pool and so those who would still catch Covid despite the vaccine are more likely to have some immunology-abnormality that makes death from Covid more likely.

Hypothetically, if such a group makes up just 1/100,000, they could reasonably account for all Covid deaths of those who had previously been vaccinated. The point is that for people with relatively normal immune functions who react to the vaccine and make antibodies, the risk of death is even lower than the stats indicate because the low prevalence of breakthrough infections is concentrating the effect of very rare situations within the stats of people who die after getting infected despite the vaccine.",,,1618916201,{},gv6s3w0,False,t3_mubh4f,False,True,t1_gv69vq4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mubh4f/cdc_says_fewer_than_6000_americans_have/gv6s3w0/,1618916212,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_f4iyb,False,False,,

Obviously government policy plays a role here, but if you compare the US to the US, NYC to the Dakotas, for example.  Populace areas clearly have a much more extreme spike in cases and deaths.  It's just dumb to pretend otherwise.  You can sit there and say that if everyone locked themselves in their house for 2 years that cases would be lower, which is true, but logically nobody should comply with that because the risk of leaving your house and contracting the virus doesn't equate to the loss of 2 years of the 80 that you get to live for.

It really hasn't helped that the media - up until recently - latched on to the narrative that vaccinated people could still easily contract and spread COVID. The data coming out now says that's not at all true (which would be in line with what we know about vaccines overall, not just this one), but I think a lot of people still have this in their minds - that vaccines prevent serious illness but absolutely nothing else, so even vaccinated people are ""at risk"" after a COVID exposure.

Public health is not the same thing as individual health. If they tell you that it’s 95% effective and people go back to life as usual before the pandemic before most people are vaccinated, that may not be a big individual risk but it’s still a huge social risk 

Just consider a typical commute from a transit user: 65-passenger bus, 40-minute rides with 10 people replacing each other every 10 minutes, total exposure: 105 people each way. That’s 1,100 people exposed to just during a commute for a week. I’ve simplified the numbers but 95% efficacy does *not* mean the risk is gone before herd immunity is established. That’s still 55 transmission opportunities on average. Of course, there’s no reason to believe everyone will be exactly average so there will be clusters where people claim the vaccine isn’t working

There is no reason to extrapolate that we can just snap back to pre-pandemic habits and expect things to go back to normal while COVID is still widespread based purely on individual risk. The mask advisories always emphasized *social* risk over individual risk and saying that the CDC must abandon that position now or they’re hypocrites because of the risks for the vaccinated *individual* is misconstruing their guidance 

It needs to happen gradually so we can actually assess how things are going, acknowledging that positive test results are a lagging indicator of transmission because of the incubation period

In fact, one struggles to think of a man, who's as supportive of women's rights, as Trump.

I still remember that press conference in 2016, where Trump so compassionately listened to, and gave a chance to speak, to all the women, who were sexually assaulted and raped by the husband of the woman who was a Democratic presidential nominee...

[https://time.com/4524362/donald-trump-bill-clinton-accusers-debate/](https://time.com/4524362/donald-trump-bill-clinton-accusers-debate/)

That vile woman never addressed her husband's victims, never offered to listen to their stories, never apologized to them. But Trump was there to support them, full stop.

Or that other first in the struggle for women's rights, the time Trump not only fucked a whore, but made her pay 300K to him for the privilege.

- Maybe the number being recommended by scientists is super extreme - like 0 cases for a week. 
- Maybe scientists can’t agree on the number (some referring to flu like numbers, some much closer to where we are, etc). None of them want to be the most relaxed (not caring about lives). 

I have heard 1 new case per day per 100k pop (7 day average). 

Flu cases are 292 cases per 100k but that is seasonal and Covid is more deadly. Flu is 1 out of 1000 die vs Covid at 1 out of 58. 292 / 58 is 5. So potentially 5 is a good number. The flu is seasonal so matching average is not accurate. 

Another number could be true “herd immunity” where there are few enough cases that when we find a case (from a traveler) we can track down all the contacts and isolate them if they were not vaccinated and in like 2 weeks the cases are gone. That would be when most places have 0 and a few cases come and go at different places. Probably much lower than 1 per 100k.

It’s become increasingly clear that even healthy people with mild cases of COVID-19 can battle a constellation of symptoms that worsen over time—or which sometimes disappear only to come right back. These symptoms are part of what’s called “[Long COVID Syndrome](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2021/01/19/trying-to-make-sense-of-long-covid-syndrome/).”

Now, a new study of relatively young, healthy adult healthcare workers in Sweden adds needed information on the frequency of this Long COVID Syndrome. Published in the journal *JAMA*, the study found that just over 1 in 10 healthcare workers who had what at first seemed to be a relatively mild bout of COVID-19 were still coping with at least one moderate to severe symptom eight months later \[1\]. Those symptoms—most commonly including loss of smell and taste, fatigue, and breathing problems—also negatively affected the work and/or personal lives of these individuals.

These latest findings come from the COVID-19 Biomarker and Immunity (COMMUNITY) study, led by Charlotte Thålin, Danderyd Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm. The study, launched a year ago, enlisted 2,149 hospital employees to learn more about immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.",,,1618926948,{},gv79uuf,True,t3_muquo6,False,True,t3_muquo6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/muquo6/study_finds_1_in_10_healthcare_workers_with_mild/gv79uuf/,1618927481,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,

I've heard on this forum that no one is checking residency in Texas.  All states are now open to the general population, so no age, job, or health limitations.

Analyzing the spread of tweets with the hashtag #AstraZeneca, the authors of the study distinguished 10,728 cases of coordinated action involving 1,137 unique Twitter users. Of these, 616 accounts were linked to automatic bots.

It found that the largest network of links and coordinated dissemination of alerts was in Bangladesh and was linked to vaccination in that country with the AstraZeneca vaccine produced under license in neighboring India. The texts praised the prime minister of the country for the vaccination campaign, using the hashtag #ThankYouPM (thank you Prime Minister). The same hashtag is used for the prime minister of neighboring India, which is one of the largest vaccine producers with Bangladesh being the main recipient.

Automatic accounts were used to duplicate entries in Bangladesh. ""Automated bot accounts distribute identical or very similar texts in order to increase the reach of political message, in this case - vaccine diplomacy,"" say Jemielniak and Krempovych.

The second largest network for the coordinated dissemination of AstraZeneka alerts existed in Europe. This action included tweets that echoed the official position of the European Medicines Agency's Pharmacological Risk Assessment Committee that AstraZeneca was safe and effective. The authors of the analysis concluded that it was a network composed of the accounts of employees and high-level officials of the European Commission, of which 35% were they considered the accounts as bots.

""It can be safely assumed that this network conducted a centralized communication campaign for health, coordinated by employees of the European Commission in response to increased criticism of AstraZeneca vaccines"" - write scientists from Kozminski University.

## Kennedy junior: Bill Gates has invested in AstraZeneca

Well-known people have also been spreading disinformation about AstraZeneca. The authors of the study give as an example Robert Kennedy Jr. - a well-known anti-vaccine and anti-vaccine guru in the USA, among others also in Poland. (He is the son of Robert Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy who was murdered in 1963). Kennedy Jr's most retweeted post on the Astra Zeneca vaccine was one in which he discredited the product - reported that the vaccine was controversial, that it was ""heavily invested in by Bill Gates"", that it was ""rejected out of widespread fears.""

Example, a friend of mine became ""fully vaccinated"" a few days ago (two weeks after his second dose). He's counted in that number of someone who is fully vaccinated and didn't get COVID because of it.

Which makes no sense. Lets assume that he got COVID the very second that he was considered ""fully vaccinated."" Well, he would still count as someone who was protected from getting COVID, because two days is not long enough for the symptoms to show, then get tested, and for that result to be counted. And again, that's if he got infected the very first moment.

Obviously, the short time scales we are looking at haven't allowed a lot of people to get COVID even if the vaccine did nothing. Most people who are fully vaccinated haven't been so for very long, due to the time that it takes to become fully vaccinated and that daily vaccination numbers are higher now than a few months ago.

And that's not even taking into account other stuff like that the demographics of people who got early vaccines are different than the general population, etc.

In short, the better indicators of the efficacy of the vaccines are the trials themselves plus the big studies done in places like the UK and Israel.

Here are the key points from the article:

* The study was done in the city of Kragujevac which is the 4th largest city in Serbia, from the 1st of January from March the 31rd. 28.630 people were included in the study who were vaccinated and over 100.000 people who weren't vaccinated.
* Out of all these people, 8.11% of unvaccinated people got sick, 2,03% were vaccinated, 1.17% were revaccinated, and 0,57% got sick three weeks after revaccination.
* The risk of getting pneumonia is three times less for people who got the first dose, six times less for people who were revaccinated and over 15 times less for people who got revaccinated after a period of three weeks has passed.
* Percentage of people who had to be hospitalized: 1.23% unvaccinated, 0.16% who got their first dose, 0.06% revaccinated and only 0.02% of revaccinated people after 3 weeks.

When comparing the people who got sick, even though they were vaccinated, the statistics are as follows:

2,3 % who received Astrazeneca got sick (disclaimer: Astrazeneca revaccination in Serbia is in three months after the first dose and so far nobody has been revaccinated with it); 2,2 % who received the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine got sick:, 1,8 % Sputnik V; 1,1 % for Pfeizer.

Pneumonija has developed in:

* 0,7 % people who got the Chinese one;
* 0,3 % for Sputnik and Astrazeneca
* 0,1 % for Fajzer.

Hospitalization rates:

0,2 % of people who got the Chinese vaccine; 0,1 % for Sputnik V NOBODY who got Astrazeneca or Pfeizer was hospitalized!

The study concludes all vaccines are very effective, Pfeizer develops immunity the fastest and the Chinese Sinopharm is the slowest (three weeks after revaccination), especially in men over 80.

One woman I know, 27f. Had not had COVID, however knows around a dozen people who have. From that dozen, most only felt a slight cold, and otherwise felt fine. Some of them only knew from taking a test due to an exposure but were otherwise asymptomatic. Along with that, the majority of people she knows who got the vaccine had miserable side effects. It wasn't long, and of course they're fine, but still. For her, she just doesn't want to be sick and miserable from the vaccine compared to possibly nothing from actually getting COVID. Of course she knows some people her age die from COVID and lots of people (including myself) didn't have any side effects from the vaccine.  She says she will still ""probably get it, maybe"", but doesn't have a lot of excitement, and maybe a little anxiety. It's like getting fillings for a cavity that isn't bothering you. Not a lot of expediency.

It doesn't have anything to do with conspiracy theories, or not believing the virus exists, or the current/former administration, or things like that just... side effect reluctance.

The other person I know had COVID and was miserable with it. 2 weeks of being sick. Nothing serious, but just miserable from having it. He's fine now, and no lingering effects. He isn't in a rush to get the vaccine since he has decent antibodies now from having it previously, and doesn't feel a strong need to rush out and get it, especially since he might (or might not) feel miserable from the side effects. He probably will eventually, but is enjoying not feeling miserable at the moment.

And people still stockpiled and selfishly over bought supplies, including PPE. Can you imagine if the message was maybe masks don't help, maybe they do, but please leave them for healthcare workers? That would not have worked. 

You literally just proved the point. If ur a public health official ur word and honesty matters. They decided it was a calculated lie to encourage ppl to not wear masks in case of a PPE shortage. Public health should not be lying to the public for their own means , their job is public health. Imagine if u were on a flight and listened to their advice that masks don't work? 

You cant empathize with Fauci and then be surprised if ppl don't really take his word seriously. He told us last year that a cloth mask was just enough but now is wearing 2 masks and encouraging that. Is that also due to PPE shortages? If u did ur homework u knew that cloth masks are only good to protect others from urself. 

Your literally supporting Fauci lying to the public for the greater good after u find out it's a lie. That's my issue. Ppl in the government know that it's a calculated lie but the people don't.

Yes, although the fearmongers will tell you there are new strains, or that antibodies only last 8-9 months. T Cell immunity can last years. It really does puzzle me that we're treating this like its the first virus ever to plague humanity.

If getting covid does not provide immunity, then we should be seeing reinfection cases all over, and that's simply not the case.

The EU placed more than enough orders for a variety of vaccines and still ended up short due to failed candidates (Sanofi), delays (Curevac) and production fuckups (AstraZeneca), so that's not a magic bullet either. And still ~50% of the doses produced in the EU were exported, both to buyers as well as to less wealthy countries via Covax.

Getting as many vulnerable groups vaccinated worldwide is - from what I understand - the best way of fighting a global pandemic. On the other hand you can argue that the primary role of the state is to protect it's citizens, and in the short term that would definitely mean to use all production domestically first.

2. The difference with the US is that their massive deaths came before there was a ready means out of this (vaccination). Since vaccination has become available, their death numbers have consistently dropped, while Germany's have gone up, undoubtedly due to the horrible vaccination progress. 
3. Yes, the European Commission is not part of the German government, but it's completely dishonest to pretend as if Germany does not have a large amount of political influence within it; it was well within the power of the German government to, if not stop, at least call into question the EU's poor decisions. There are also other arguments that could be made about how the EU itself was not prepared to handle COVID, and how Germany is partly to blame for this. The UK seems much smarter now for having left.
4. It is true that many European countries had harsher restrictions at various points. Germany seems to have taken a path that is the worst of both worlds: having harsh enough restrictions to interfere with people's quality of life without being smart enough about those restrictions to actually slow down the rapid spread of the virus. Also, it is one thing to have restrictions in place as temporary emergency measures due to an unprecedented thread. It is another matter entirely to leave them in place indefinitely, when we are well over a year into this crisis. It is very possible that Germany would no longer need these restrictions if they had made smarter decisions regarding vaccination, and it is precisely because of that that I find the government's current actions so reprehensible: it is *their fault* that cases are out of control, yet they want to get the people to shoulder the blame instead. It's really quite disgusting.
5. I am not a German citizen so obviously do not vote in their elections. I agree with you that the people who want to take away all rights from the refugees are crazy and are threats to human rights. But you, who supports banning peaceful protests, are just as much of a threat to human rights. And don't try and give me the false equivalency of ""the law says it's fine.""

How so? 90%-95% effective against serious symptoms means 1 in 10 or 20 people can still get serious symptoms from COVID. Lots of offices have 20 people. 

People always seem to forget that the most important way that vaccines protect people is by reducing the spread of the virus, meaning that even if you are that 1- in 10, you are further protected by not coming into contact with it.  But this person described a scenario with a good change of long exposure to it.

I'm always amazed by this analogy because we take all sorts of precautions to lessen the danger from driving. licensing, testing, seat belts, air bags, speed bumps, stop lights, stop signs, DUI laws, insurance points, eye tests, speed limits, safety engineering, safety recalls, speed limits, road engineering, and so on.

That's especially true here in the US.. where we've pretty much all but given up on ""people taking sensible precautions"" and moved to ""vaccinate as many people as possible"" (which in itself has problems since a large percentage of people are refusing to be vaccinated).. I think we only recently hit 50% of the population has at least 1 shot. Will we even get to ""herd immunity"" ?. .I have serious doubts. (at least not through vaccination)

This was still being investigated as late as May last year, if I remember correctly.

Now, it didn't take *that* long to determine that disinfecting groceries wasn't an efficient use of time, and it was a shame that so many offices decided to declare themselves COVID-safe because of hand-washing stations and lots of surface cleaning while packing people into open office settings and not requiring masks.  (So stupid!)

But being cautious during the period when the virus was new and we didn't have a firm grasp of how it spread was not dumb.

That's just not how medical science works.  Even if some early results suggested as much (and I was aware of those!), you wait for reproducibility before becoming confident.

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

They also recently stated that for medical privacy reasons, vaccines may not be discussed at work. You may not ask if a coworker is planning on getting the vaccine or if someone is already vaccinated, and refrain from mentioning your own vaccination status if it can be construed as pressuring someone into revealing theirs. 

I sort of get the reasons for both guidance but I think the idea that emergency rooms are ordering N95 masks from the same places I do is absurd — they have their own supply chain and only a small fraction of N95 masks are actually suitable for healthcare workers and we are past the point where HCWs are desperately scouring eBay for 3M paint sanding masks to use at a hospital.",,,1618931553,{},gv7kbe1,False,t3_muqahf,False,False,t1_gv7hgex,/r/Coronavirus/comments/muqahf/some_dealing_with_reentry_anxiety_as_covid/gv7kbe1/,1618933838,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_wyaw2,False,False,,
