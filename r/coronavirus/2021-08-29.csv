It's damned if you do, damned if you don't. If Fauci, the CDC, and the administration had largely ignored the unvaccinated, there is some difficult to quantify number of people (just like those people that look at the news two weeks before elections before they vote, the ""undecided"" ignorant voter, that is more focused on their own daily life), that would not have ultimately gotten vaccinated. And unfortunately, similar to the game of chicken we are playing with climate change, we can't get this pandemic under control *without* getting largely everyone vaccinated. We can't do it-- so long as a large part of the population remains susceptible and unvaccinated, the number of people spreading the virus is just too great. And it also creates tinder for the virus to be able to mutate, thus raising the odds that it escapes our vaccines. So don't blame the administration for pushing *everyone* to get vaccinated. Thinking that we can have a group of vaccinated people for whom the pandemic is completely over needs to stop-- and that kind of messaging can certainly be placed squarely on the Biden administration (eg.

&gt; A child is more likely to die in a car accident.
If you could vaccinate against car accidents, would you?  I sure as hell would.  My kids wear seatbelts, we drive safely, and I regularly avoid highways if slower roads involve similar travel time.  Cars are dangerous and are one of the top causes of death for humans.  Why would you act like it's no big deal?

Also important is that death is poor metric for covid outcomes.  Children have many direct, negative outcomes from covid besides just death.  The kids getting MIS-C aren't dead.  The kids with long covid aren't dead.  The kids out of school for weeks aren't dead.  The kids in the hospital on ventilators aren't dead.  The vaccine prevents ALL of these things, yet you're acting like death is all you need to worry about with covid?

Furthermore, vaccination is about protecting others as well.  Kids with covid bring it home and infect their older, diabetic parents.  They infect their elderly, immune-compromised grandparents.  Vaccinating children prevents illness and death to others, not just to the kids themselves.

&gt; why would we want to vaccinate children against a virus that provides more immunity by catching it than the vaccine?

Vaccination first, then (inevitably) exposure second.  The vaccine prevents severe illness while maximizing immunity more than either vaccine or exposure would give alone.

TL;DR - Incompetence

Longer version:

Victoria had to undergo a 112 day lockdown last year to get an outbreak from hotel quarantine which peaked at 700+ cases/day to zero. It was an incredible sacrifice for the rest of us.

NSW nailed their mast to we don't lockdown because our contact tracing's so good unlike specifically case in point Victoria (though they did have to do a lockdown in one corner of Sydney due to a breach though luckily for them it was an area with about only three ways in and some very well off people in the northern area who actually prefer people not coming in - guess who got stuck in the southern part with them for Christmas last year?).

Anyway, NSW kept rolling the dice on contact tracing until they lost (you're only as big as your last success) and they lost big time. Having learned nothing from every single time this happened previously with some variation of hotel quarantine and/or flight crews somewhere in Australia ...

Car driver transporting overseas FedEx crew was somehow not vaccinated (and it wasn't mandated), wasn't tested daily - or at all (and it wasn't checked that this was happening) and wasn't wearing a mask (claims he was but a lot of us are sceptical).

Caught Delta from the flight crew and then superspread it all over Eastern Sydney (guess where I live the other part of the week). NSW ulimate arbiters dithered for 9 days (because they're not Victoria and we don't lock down like them) but because Delta this time, contact tracing got totally overrun by the speed of it. Once it got into Western Sydney with more people per home in higher density and less able to work from home it was all over red rover in terms of stamping it out. The long delay didn't help either (it's why Victoria's hanging on for now and NSW ultimately saw an explosion in cases).

Didn't at least protect regional NSW (because once again not Victoria) and now NSW has lost control and they're trying to gaslight the rest of the nation about 'you can't keep it out and have to learn to live with it'.

Given that every other state except Victoria (I'll get to them in a moment), left and right have either kept it out for now (or squashed their mostly at least from this NSW spectacular failure seedings), I think they're telling us all to in effect get bent, we'll open up in our own time and schedule.

Victoria got contaminated by NSW and I'm livid about that especially because of what they went through last year but they're still hanging on with under 100 cases/day (while NSW is over 1000).

I'm also livid because I had to evacuate my parents (legally after checking with the authorities) back to our regional NSW home town after they came down to Eastern Sydney for their vaccinations and got trapped in their apartment from June to August (after most of 2020) and they only left twice when I took them for Pfizer 1 and Pfizer 2 (now have been isolating for 2 weeks and getting Covid tested today - if someone brings it to my home town, it's not going to be us - one of the neighbours did call the police on us but luckily our paperwork was in order - also the only person my parents have seen in months is me and I get tested every week now because of work - so we'd have to be really unlucky).

Anyway, TL;DR - NSW individuals running the show who were bragging they were the gold standard etc dropped the ball and dropped to last place and are now trying to pull the we have to learn to live with it and vaccinate etc but the rest of the country said they're still at zero/got to zero and we're good thanks PS: we're in effect locking you out.

Addendum: New Zealand slammed shut from one confirmed case (sourced from NSW) because as they said in effect ""We're not NSW"" (They said 'Australia' but everyone knows who they mean) which was fortunate given they just might pull off elimination again - being Delta, it'd seeded a lot at the time they picked up the first case.

I think a number of other parts of Australia have in effect being using NSW as an example of what not to do eg: the ACT which is totally surrounded by NSW slammed shut after almost 400 days of no cases the moment they found one Delta case and it hit dozens at one point. I think they'll also eliminate it from this outbreak eventually.

While that may turn out to be true once the courts become involved, it's not functionally true right now.  

I believe both LAUSD and Hoboken, NJ have mandated the vaccine for 12+ students.  I suspect lawsuits to follow, since it was only fully approved for 16+, but who knows.  

Upon reading the article, it appears Hoboken will  allow students to enter with a negative PCR test each week. Either that or proof of vaccination.

A couple of things - 

Fearlessness is often reckless and sometimes  selfish.

Nobody knows whether they fear death or not until they are faced with it.  Lets see how you are doing when you can't breathe and they are putting you on a ventilator and into an induced coma and you don't know if you're ever going to wake up. 

Self-proclaimed fearlessness of death is not a measure of toughness. Neither is calling people pussies for their own fear of death.   In my experience the people who talk the most about their fearlessness are often some of the biggest cowards when the shit hits the fan. 

Fear of death is an integral part of a human's survival instinct.  It's literally Darwinism.  Survival of the fittest is not survival of the fearless.

So at some point, SARS-CoV-2 will most likely be endemic even in New Zealand and you **will** catch it (unless you're close to death now and won't live long enough to catch it).

So it might theoretically make some sense to delay getting the vaccine for a few months or maybe even years now, depending on NZ strategy going forward. However, you will have to be on your toes to get it immediately once it looks like New Zealand is about to lose control over Covid-19. And even then it might be too late to get the second shot before you catch the disease (and if you're unlucky and vaccine demand skyrockets for a couple of days, you could catch it even before getting your first shot).

The vaccines would not qualify under reasonable. Of course I do recognize reasonable is a very subjective terminology.

Your argument was to mitigate this with more precautions, but they are already taking as much precautions as they can. So there isn't much if any, that healthcare workers can do.

Sending them to school with a fake teacher in a room full of unvaxxed kids?  Why am I risking my child's life for a fake education?

I don't believe kids should be in the classroom, but the governor has made it clear that's not an option.

I couldn't find the study, or any articles saying it was published. The [NY Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/19/health/coronavirus-johnson-vaccine-booster.html) a couple weeks ago that the results were announced at a news conference, and that ""the data have not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal"".

J&amp;J's earlier study against earlier variants found it was 93% effective against hospitalization after 14 days, and 100% effective against hospitalization after 28 days, so the new data could be seen as a drop in efficacy.

A preprint of an independent laboratory study from NYU found ""significantly decreased neutralization"" titers of serum antibodies from individuals immunized with Ad26.COV2.S (J&amp;J), compared to BNT162b2 (Pfizer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), against Delta and Delta Plus.^(1) IC50 titers of J&amp;J against Delta and Delta plus were 30 and 41, while mathematical modeling predicts 50% efficacy would correspond to an IC50 titer of 69 or higher. But that's a lab study, not a real world study.

[],,Synonyms26,,,[],,,,text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,[],"H√Ä N·ªòI ‚Äî Local people need to be equipped with essential skills to cope with natural disasters, especially those in the mountainous, remote and ethnic areas, as more storms and floods are expected during the rest of this year, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control.  
  
In the context of natural disasters and complicated developments of the COVID-19 pandemic, the committee has issued an official document, asking provinces and cities to prepare response plans and scenarios for disasters and raise awareness of local people about survival skills.  
  
Since early this year, Vi·ªát Nam has had 53 light earthquakes, 105 hail storms and thunderstorms, 11 downpours and floods and 21 landslides.  
  
Between January-May this year, natural disasters have claimed 21 lives, injured 29 people, damaged over 4,300 houses and destroyed over 32,000 hectares of rice and crops.  
  
The economic loss due to natural disaster events amounted to about VNƒê119 billion in this period.  
  
According to the National Centre for Hydro-meteorological Forecasting, it is likely that 12-14 storms and tropical depressions will occur in the South China Sea area, of which five to seven will have direct impacts on the mainland.  
  
Floods in rivers in Y√™n B√°i, Ninh B√¨nh and from Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh down to B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n provinces will be at Warning Levels 2 and 3. Floods and landslides in small rivers, streams and upstream areas along with inundation in urban areas are likely to happen, according to the centre.  
  
Natural disaster events are more likely to happen and tend to be more unpredictable, causing increasingly serious damage to production activities and people's lives.  
  
This requires us to pay more attention to the natural disaster prevention, response and impact mitigation work in the coming time, especially in the context of the complicated developments of the COVID-19 pandemic in many localities, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control.  
  
In order to proactively respond to the ‚Äòdouble disasters‚Äô of natural disasters and COVID-19 pandemic, the Vi·ªát Nam Disaster Management Authority has developed documents guiding localities to develop plans to respond to natural disasters.  
  
The authority has issued a handbook for natural disaster prevention in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, detailing specific response scenarios and plans for each region to ensure local authorities and people are aware of the safety instructions and skills needed to cope with the natural disasters amid COVID-19.  
  
It also cooperated with other agencies to develop communication materials and publications including Infographic, television and radio programmes to help local people easily access information.  
  
According to deputy director of Vi·ªát Nam Disaster Management Authority, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Ti·∫øn, localities should integrate COVID-19 prevention and control measures into response plans for natural disasters as well as manage to limit mass evacuation.  
  
He said vaccinations should be prioritised for people tasked with natural disaster prevention, control, search and rescue work and people in high risk places.  
  
Localities should also raise awareness of the public about the knowledge and skills to respond to natural disasters with special attention being given to remote, ethnic, border, and island areas.  
  
Survival skills  
  
The steering committee and the State Committee for Incidents and Disaster Response, and Search and Rescue recommended people regularly follow the situation of natural disasters and COVID-19 pandemic in their area (including announcements about safe shelter sites), prepare necessary items in case of having to evacuate in the event of a natural disaster (including mask, food and sanitiser).  
  
In case of evacuation, people need to save important phone numbers such as the number of the commune‚Äôs People's Committee and local health and rescue agencies to contact in case urgent assistance is needed.  
  
To ensure safe evacuation, people follow the instructions of the authorities and people in charge. When evacuating in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, people need to install the Bluezone application to update news and check the status of people they have contacts with.  
  
Upon arriving at the evacuation site, if people have signs of fever, cough, loss of taste, or fatigue, they should immediately notify people in charge and shouldn‚Äôt share food, drink, or utensils with other people as well as regularly wash hands with soap, or use alcohol sanitiser. People are also advised to avoid gathering with others.  
  
Vaccinated people still have to comply with the 5K regulations of the Ministry of Health, and only leave the evacuation site when allowed.  
  
Families with young children need to ensure that children are always accompanied by an adult, always keep children in sight to make sure they are not getting lost. Adults need to remind children to stay with their parents and family or need to know where their family is in case they are not together.  
  
They are also recommended to teach their children to memorise their parents' phone numbers and contact information in case they are lost or in an emergency situation.  
  
Families should also ensure their children wear a mask as well as have mental and emotional support for them as children can easily feel insecure during the evacuation. Adults also must pay attention to preventing accidents and injuries to children when natural disasters occur, especially drowning.  
  
For those who don‚Äôt have to evacuate, steering committees need to instruct local people to reinforce their homes and store important furniture and items in dry and high places, turn off electricity sources to avoid having equipment damaged by high water levels.  
  
Each family should also prepare drinking water for five to seven days and instant food, flashlights, kerosene lamps, phone chargers, among other necessary devices.  
  
In the post disaster period, people should be supported in stabilising their life and environment cleaning as well as ensure they have clean water. ‚Äî VNS",,,,1630304206,{},hawdj6c,True,t3_pecdjk,False,False,t3_pecdjk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pecdjk/vi·ªát_nam_prepares_for_natural_disasters_amid/hawdj6c/,1630386440.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The request was made by the Advisory Council for the Registration of Circulation of Drugs and Medicinal Ingredients after a meeting held late Sunday evening.   
  
The council said in a press released they and relevant units had carefully considered the application, adding that the dossier had been appraised by the Legal Subcommittee under the National Institute for Control of Vaccines and Biologicals twice; by the Quality Subcommittee four times, and by the Pharmacology and Clinical Subcommittee three times.  
  
The Advisory Council acknowledged the results obtained for the application for a certificate of circulation of the Nano Covax vaccine which had been appraised by the expert subcommittees, and accepted by the Ethics Council.  At the same time, the Advisory Council requested the company continue to supplement and clarify some content regarding application quality and pharmacological and clinical records.   
  
Regarding pharmacological and clinical records, the council asked for more information regarding safety, immunogenicity and protection effect.   
  
Specifically, the enterprise needs to add and update data on safety for all subjects who have been vaccinated with at least one dose of the vaccine up to the present time and clearly explain the cases of serious adverse events (SAE).   
  
The council also asked for more data according to the latest amendment protocol approved by the Ethics Committee, including: assessment of immunogenicity on new strains (for example Delta strain, UK strain, and others) and sample size for immunogenicity assessment should be carried out in accordance with the approved research protocol.   
  
Regarding the protection effect, it is required that the enterprise coordinate with the research team to analyse and discuss the relationship between the immunogenicity of the vaccine and the protection effectiveness of at least 50 per cent (according to the guidance of the World Health Organization).  
  
Last week, the results from Nano Covax's phase 3a clinical trials involving about 1,000 volunteers were given the green light from the National Committee for Ethics in Biomedicine Research.  
  
Some volunteers reported typical side effects like pain at the injection site, itchiness, nausea, light fever after receiving the vaccine. Two suffered from shock reactions but have completely recovered.  
  
The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of the antibody among the injected volunteers evaluated by PRNT50 tests on Wuhan strain is at 63.5, while GMC for those given placebo is at five.  
  
On day 42, the seroconversion rate reached 99.2 per cent.  
  
Nano Covax, a recombinant spike protein vaccine, is the forerunner in the race for domestically produced COVID-19 vaccine, followed by COVIVAC from the Institute of Vaccines and Biologic Medical and mRNA vaccine ARCT-154 (by Arcturus and VinBioCare) just starting phase 2 trials. ‚Äî VNS",,,,1630304133,{},hawdfuh,True,t3_peccxe,False,False,t3_peccxe,/r/Coronavirus/comments/peccxe/vietnam_nano_covax_producer_asked_to_provide_more/hawdfuh/,1630386395.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

I bought my ticket a long time ago as the show was supposed to be in 2020 but I thought the pandemic would be over in october 2021, that's kinda what a lot of people said but did not happen, sadly. 

Maybe they'll reschedule the show again LOL, that would fix my problem so I ask you this:

Now, I thought Europe wasn‚Äôt a monolith? That Hungary (no medical bankruptcies), France (no medical bankruptcies), and Sweden (no medical bankruptcies) are all different countries? Why don‚Äôt they each issue a different ruling with regards to their individual national assessments of the situation?

Oh right, the EU. That kinda monolithic geopolitical and economic entity. Almost forgot about that. Yes, there has been variance in the responses. Every country you mentioned has a massively more robust welfare system and social safety net than the United States despite being far poorer and far smaller. 

And every response was better than ours. Where that can be debated (for example, Sweden last year), a comparatively massive social safety net exists.

You say that the learning loss isn‚Äôt sustainable for another year. I think it‚Äôs not sustainable for another decade. CoVID is endemic. Go back and look at my posts from seven months ago; I made the same argument. We have to rethink and refigure American politics in a serious fashion to address this new reality. If kids get infected with CoVID once a year for a decade and two of those instances are serious, then they‚Äôve just dropped from gifted to on-level or on-level to needing serious support. I‚Äôve had a parent break down crying when I showed her pre and post-infection essays from her daughter. I am far-sighted enough to see that isn‚Äôt going away just because we insist on pretending that opening schools in-person without exception, wearing ineffective masks, and no enforcement of policy is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. You say that your politics are ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù‚Ä¶how so? You have minimized or avoided every aspect of my perspective and experience despite asserting yours to not only be better, but denigrating mine by sole dint of my lack of overseas travel and refusal to countenance the idea that just sending kids back into school is a viable solution to an endemic disease. 

I have observed the decline in dozens of long CoVID students firsthand, as I teach at the AP level. I have to assign twice the homework and spend a part-time job a week after school for tutorials on what I would have considered remedial topics two years ago. I don‚Äôt want kids in school declining like that without an end in sight. That will happen if we just reopen everything like the kids can‚Äôt collectively decline worse in their cognitive abilities with each successive wave of the virus. CoVID has to be confronted, not avoided. If we‚Äôre going to keep schools open, as you insist, it is criminal to just throw the doors open and leave it at that. There were already teachers‚Äô strikes across the country in 2019 before CoVID came onto the scene. The profession has hemorrhaged educators over just the last year, and things will get worse if they are not addressed (which people as you seem content to do). The schools must open, to hell with the teachers and their increased demands and workload. 

Teachers are increasingly drawing a line in the sand. Schools are so important‚Ä¶but everything else including college football games, professional football games, bars, and Applebees will be open; no safety measures will be enforced within or outside the school, no vaccinations will be required, and oh by the way - no increase in pay despite skyrocketing inflation in rents and cost of living. Nope. Something has to give. As the virus continues to evolve and spread, the cost of addressing it will increase. 

You say that your politics are progressive, but you have not once addressed the most pressing concerns I have raised - rising student infection and community transmission, teacher attrition, students‚Äô cognitive loss, teacher retention, total absence of anything resembling a safety net in the United States and lack of advocacy for such from said progressives, teacher compensation, millions of evictions. You skated right past all of those to say that - and correct me if I‚Äôm mischaracterizing your response you - **a Black teacher supporting immunocompromised family has no understanding of education and no understanding of international politics because he asserts that schools are not safe and support systems must increase during an unprecedented resurgence of a severely worse variant.**

What about your statement, exactly, reflects progressive values? Is it the willingness to listen to the perspective of a minority on the ground in situations more adverse than your own? Or is it the lack of socioeconomic condescension evinced in your mocking of my alleged lack of passport, which is punching down in class?

I'm not saying kids aren't dying from this. Or that they're not dying at a higher rate. Just that it's nowhere near the adult rates and still not bad enough to risk hitting kids with this vaccine. 

But this is where the media fucks us all. 

Ok. So I run a story saying ""Delta Variant Kills More Children Than Previous Variants"". The first thing that happens is that article gets a fuckton of views. Good thing, right? Wrong. Most people don't read much past the headlines, but a few do. And surprisingly, I know, the antivaxxers actually do. That's just the kind of article they zoom in on because it's obviously sensational and will invariably have holes. And they will find those holes. So while Delta does kill more children than other variants, it's still a very low number. Any child death is bad. 400 is horrible. Next to any of usual causes of child death? 400 is nothing. Once these people see those numbers compared, the argument is over. Nothing to see here. Just the sensationalist media scaring people off the couch so they can root for pennies under the cushions.

And they're not all that wrong, man. Really. The media has a longstanding and very well deserved credibility problem. And they have that problem specifically because they're just trying to make money. I mean, in what weirdassed alternate universe does a ""fair and impartial"" news channel have a core demographic? Shouldn't all humans be their core demographic? Why go specifically for one group? People see that shit. Most of them aren't smart enough to articulate it, but they see it and they don't trust it. The central pillar of any democracy is a well informed public. We don't have that. We have a media environment comprised almost totally of biased corporate media sources and idiot assholes on Facebook.

&gt;In an interview with ""Face the Nation,"" Gottlieb said Pfizer will be in a position to file data with the FDA at some point next month, and then submit its application to expand its emergency use authorization for its vaccine in children 5 years and older as early as October. 

&gt;""The agency will be in a position to make an authorization, I believe, at some point, late fall, probably early winter,"" Gottlieb told ""Face the Nation. ""And probably they're going to base their decision on what the circumstances around the country, what the urgency is to get to a vaccine for kids.""

&gt;The FDA in May authorized Pfizer's two-dose vaccine for emergency use for children ages 12 to 15, and the company has been conducting clinical trials of its COVID-19 shot in children ages 2 and older.

&gt;Gottlieb said the data on children 2 to 5 years old will be available in November. If the FDA authorizes Pfizer's vaccine in kids between the ages of 5 and 11 in November or early December, ""that, again, puts you on a timeframe that you could start rolling out these vaccinations before the end of the year.""

&gt;Allowing younger children to get vaccinated against COVID-19 would be crucial in the nation's efforts to combat the highly contagious Delta variant. Kids in the South have already returned to in-person school, and the Northeast will open its classrooms next month.

&gt;Gottlieb said there are roughly 300 kids being hospitalized each day with COVID-19, and infection rates among children have spiked with schools reopening.

&gt;The two ""best things"" schools can do, he said, is testing students twice a week and keeping them in geographic or social pods to cut down on intermingling among the full student body.

&gt;""Those two elements alone, according to the literature, are probably the two most effective steps schools can be taking,"" he said.

&gt;Gottlieb also advocated for students to wear face masks and schools to improve ventilation, as well as getting children who are eligible vaccinated.

&gt;""About 50% of kids who are eligible to be vaccinated have been vaccinated,"" he said. ""So, there's still a lot of work we can do there, getting parents more information, trying to encourage parents to vaccinate their children.""",,,,1630292761,{},havuzt7,True,t3_pe9p6y,False,True,t3_pe9p6y,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pe9p6y/dr_scott_gottlieb_former_head_of_the_food_and/havuzt7/,1630377019.0,16,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,grammeofsoma,,,[],,,,text,t2_fded9,False,False,,"I grew up in a physically abusive household so I constantly felt like my life could be ended by the irrational emotions of people around me. 

The reasons that this pandemic has been easier on me than my childhood is that firstly, when I was growing up, I could tell NO ONE. It was like I was fighting a war that no one but the walls of my house could see. Yes, only 50% of the country may believe the same thing you do in regards to the virus, but that's still 50% of humans believing in your reality. You can still talk about your feelings with lots of people. That's HUGE! 

**Step 1: Be thankful for the friends you have. Cultivate those friendships and if you don't have friends, get some.**

Secondly, I have the ability to drive a car now. A child is stuck in the house all the time and can't leave. Yeah, we were in covid lockdown, but for most of it, you could still go for a walk and not have to ask anyone for permission and be back by a certain time. I swear, being able to ride my bike and sit under my favorite tree and daydream is what kept me alive in high school.

**Step 2: Get connected with nature.**

Thirdly, when I found out in my late teens that I was diagnosed with mental illness (go figure) I got help. I would absolutely not have made it without being under the care of a trained professional. It took some time to find the right person. If I could go back in time and give myself advice, it would be don't wait. Get help now. A lot of therapist offices are booking out at least a month right now and the shortage of mental health professionals is only getting worse. Set a date. The first session isn't even going to be them helping you as much as it is you giving them your history, family basics, health basics, etc. It will likely take several sessions before progress starts to be made. Just make a damn appointment. You can always cancel, but if you wait until you're having panic attacks daily or you're suicidal it's to the hospital with you because you can't wait four weeks at that point.

**Step 3: Seek professional help.**

Once you get a therapist, you actually have to do what they tell you to do. If you don't you're just throwing money away. If they give you ""homework,"" whether that's journaling, doing an activity, or whatever, you owe it to yourself to give it a try. Even if it doesn't work, then you can say you've tried and they can adjust their suggestion accordingly.

**Step 4: Learn coping skills by doing what the therapist says.**

Just throwing it out there, when I was growing up, I just assumed, ""Ok, life is like this. I'm under constant threat and I'm gonna survive."" It wasn't until later that I learned life could be any other way. The fact that we're in survival mode is ok to me because it feels normal. **No one ever promised you a life without a pandemic.** So why worry about it? We're here. The best we can do is

**Step 5: Practice acceptance**

and 

**Step 6: Be grateful for all that we have**

Anxiety is the ""what if"" disease. It's not about something that's actually occurring right now. It's ""How am I gonna feel if \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ happens."" To deal with anxiety, accept that you feel awful in the present moment. ""Ok, the world fucking sucks with this pandemic. It sucks that people are dying. It sucks that people deny this and it sucks, it sucks, it sucks and I feel sad/miserable/hopeless etc. What makes you feel worse is saying, ""I feel sad/miserable/hopeless but *I shouldn't* feel this way because I never was this way or the world was never this way. Don't ""should"" on yourself. It's not helpful. It's ok to feel bad. Don't feel bad for feeling bad. It's natural to do, because your brain is trying to get you out of the state of feeling bad, but in this situation, your brain's ""get me outta here"" program isn't gonna cut it because you're not running from a bear. The pandemic characterizes your entire world. You can't escape. 

Accept that you can't escape. Don't make the goal escaping. Make the goal riding it out until the environment changes. That's what I had to do, wait and wait and wait until I was 18. People are upset that they feel like they lost two years of their life. I'm like two years?! I wish my life were only at risk for two years as a child. That woulda been awesome. You are stronger than you think. If a kid can deal with life threatening stuff and zero power to affect outcome, you totally got this. I promise you.

And back to gratitude, find it anywhere you can. Can you imagine living in the black plague with no indoor plumbing? Next time you flush the toilet say ""Thank you. My G-d! I'm so happy I don't have to deal with this shit.""

That pre-print study has been getting a lot of attention lately in spite of its many flaws and misrepresentations.

&amp;#x200B;

# Misrepresentations

You have two coupons, one for 98%-off, and one for 96%-off.

You use the first coupon to purchase a $1 candy-bar (tax free, from a Girl Scout)... that purchase costs you 2 cents.

You use the second coupon to purchase a $1 candy-bar (tax free, from a Girl Scout)... that purchase costs you 4 cents.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

After applying each coupon, you see that the second candy bar cost you twice as much as the first (4 cents compared to 2 cents)... buuuuut... this factor of two is not what describes the relative savings between the two coupons.

To see how much better then 98% coupon is compared to the 96% coupon, you'd do:  
(98%-96%)/96%  
and would find that the first coupon was, unsurprisingly, a little over 2% better than the second... so... not a factor of two, a factor of 1.02.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This study is acting like the 98% coupon is twice as good as the 96% coupon.

This study sees 191 symptomatic infections among the vaxxed, but only 8 symptomatic infections among the unvaxxed who'd previously been infected by covid... they then divide 191 by 8 to determine that previous infection is 27 times better at avoiding symptomatic infection... it's comparing the post-coupon prices.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

To make a fair comparison, we'd need to know how many symptomatic infections there would've been among people who'd gotten infected for the first time without a vaccine.

The CDC is currently estimating that 85% of infections are symptomatic, so, that's our starting 'price' for a candy-bar.

After using only the previous infection coupon, only 0.05% of infections were symptomatic... a savings of 84.95%.

After using only the vaccine coupon, only 1.18% of infections were symptomatic... a savings of 83.82%.

We then compare their savings:

(84.95%-83.82%)/83.82% = 1.3%

Immunity from previous infections were seen to be 1.3% more effective than the vaccine.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Flaws

47% of the vaccinated group had comorbidities vs 39% in the other group.

There were hundreds more people in the vaccinated group who had cancer, hundreds more who had diabetes, hundreds more who were immunocompromised. There were literally twice as many people with cancer in the vaxxed group than in the other group; and 2.5 times as many people in the vaxxed group who were immunocompromised.

The vaxxed group had 1,303 more people who suffered comorbidities, yet they only ended up with 7 more hospitalizations, and only 183 more symptomatic cases.

The vaxxed group had 20% more people with comorbidities than were in the other group... so... their situation was worse, but their outcomes were only a little worse.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

... another thing is... the 16,214 people in the previously infected group are the ones who survived from a group of 16,249 people from which 35 died, about 158 were hospitalized, and about 13,782 experienced symptomatic infections... not a good trade for (what isn't even) 1.3% better outcomes the second time than first-time outcomes for the vaccinated.",,,,1630276422,{},hauxkpi,False,t3_pdqk36,False,True,t3_pdqk36,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pdqk36/daily_discussion_thread_august_29_2021/hauxkpi/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,e325c72ef1ed61905583cb583ae2b6c493f14d70,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1630276436.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Let's take an entirely hypothetical example: let's assume for one second that you live on a tiny island with zero Covid cases and zero contact to the outside world. Then, by default, taking the vaccine is always more risky than the risks of complications from a Covid infection.

So the risk-benefit-analysis of a vaccine changes with the likelihood of getting infected with Covid. Which means that the result of any analysis might mean that getting Astrazeneca is too risky for a 35-year-old in county A, but highly recommended for a 35-year-old in country B.

Everyone keeps believing conspiracies that are debunked over and over and over again, yet they continue. We learned basic knowledge of how viruses work in high school or earlier, and it‚Äôs like when Covid started, everyone threw that knowledge out the window.

-Fauci said it‚Äôd only take two weeks to stop the spread. People bring this up all the time. But he said this under the assumption that everyone would do what they‚Äôre supposed to. But because hardly anyone did, it takes a hundred times longer. People don‚Äôt seem to understand this.

-Masks work. But it has to be more specific. That fucking bandana on your face really isn‚Äôt going to do shit compared to something like an N95 for example. If everyone wears bandanas then good luck trying to stop the spread.

-The vaccine isn‚Äôt deadly. Yes, people have died from it, but only a minute number. And usually, the companies behind the vaccines are looking into these deaths. It‚Äôs due to how these people‚Äôs bodies handle it, not the vaccine itself. And even then the companies are trying to figure out how to reduce these chances regardless. But people act like it kills millions and millions of people for some bizarre reason. Hell, even Tucker Carlson on Fox once told the story of some guy who took the vaccine and died 24 hours later. What he didn‚Äôt bring up was the guy was hit by a truck.

-The reason there‚Äôs breakthrough cases is because every time a virus mutates, vaccines become less effective. Thanks to everyone letting it spread, we‚Äôve now got several variants that the vaccines don‚Äôt work against. But people act like the vaccines intentionally don‚Äôt do anything to begin with, so they can make us take more booster shots in the future.

-People didn‚Äôt want to take Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine because it wasn‚Äôt FDA approved. Well guess what, it‚Äôs FDA approved now. Are people taking it? Nope, because now they‚Äôve decided that they can‚Äôt trust the FDA. They‚Äôre going to continue building this judgement every time something like this happens.

Just shit like this. I‚Äôm so tired of it. And every time I‚Äôve tried to have a civil discussion and ask for sources, they instead want to insult me and stuff like an immature child instead.

[],,toss77777777,,,[],,,,text,t2_3dvlc8im,False,False,,"Here is my guess as to what this incorrect report is saying.

The risk of dying from Covid approximately doubles with every 7 years of age. So someone that is 70 is about 32x more likely to die if they catch covid.

Meanwhile the vaccine reduces the chance of death by 95% or 1 in 20. However, this doesn't offset the 32x increase because of age. So a vaccinated 70 year old is still more likely to die than an unvaccinated 35 year old.

You could twist this around and say that getting vaccinated increases your chance of dying but that is not correct.  The vaccine still reduces the chance of death by 95%+ despite the above facts.

Here's a longer explanation.

Unfortunately it seems that this is not quite the case. It seems that if you correct the numbers for age then what we are seeing is the effect of differnet vaccination rates in different age groups. You are making a statistical error in your interpretation of the graphs. Further more, many people have continued to socially distance to a large degree over the summer. Even worse vaccine efficacy is waning. If you read broadly across recent research, there is a definite risk that this winter and spring in the UK will have a massively higher case load and a similar number of deaths as last year. Time will tell I suppose, but I have shifted to a much more pessimistic position having seen the newest research over the last 3 weeks.

&gt; but the pandemic ends when society says it ends

I see. So semantics it is then I guess. Let's make up another word. Let's call it ""large numbers of excess deaths"" instead of ""pandemic"". And write that again:

&gt; ‚Ä¶ [T]he district‚Äôs new policy allows staff to keep the unmasked students in school, rather than suspending the student out of school, as it complies with a Travis County order requiring face coverings in schools.

&gt; ‚ÄúIf a student does not wear a mask indoors on school property (including buses), campus staff and administrators will begin to address this in various ways, including providing and offering masks to students, reminders about wearing masks, addressing the issue confidentially, and having conversations with families,‚Äù the district said.

&gt; If a student still refuses to wear their mask, the unmasked student will be separated from the students who are wearing masks.

&gt; The separated, unmasked students will be supervised and given classwork in a new location away from those who do comply with the policy. Those learning environments could include classrooms, offices, libraries or common areas, according to the policy announcement.

&gt; While this would be in place of a suspension out of school, the district said it would still be considered an ‚Äúin-school suspension‚Äù and a ‚Äúdisciplinary consequence.‚Äù

&gt; ‚ÄúWe are aware of the strong emotions connected to mandating masks,‚Äù the district said in the release. ‚ÄúOur goal is to provide a safe, stable educational environment for all students so they can continue uninterrupted in-person learning.‚Äù

&gt; The policy varies slightly for elementary students (grades K-5) and secondary students (grades 6-12).

&gt; ‚ÄúWe acknowledge children under the age of 12 do not currently have access to the COVID-19 vaccine and our implementation is designed with that in mind,‚Äù the district said.

&gt; Unmasked elementary students will be provided an ‚Äúalternative recess,‚Äù and they will have lunch away from the complying students, the district said. Lunch for unmasked secondary students will depend on how many students are not complying with the enforcement policy. The secondary students can continue to participate in instructional and extracurricular activities when masks are not required.

ELFA means Enzyme-linked Fluorescent Assay, this is the technology the assay uses. 

Vidas is the company which manufactures the assay. They are a subsidiary of the massive biotech company BioMerieux. 

SARS-COV-2 S1 RBD IgG means they are detecting IgG antibodies against the S1 region of the Remote Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV2 virus. The II at the end means this is Vidas 2nd generation SARS-COV-2 assay. 

BAU/ml means Binding Arbitrary Units per mL. Basically an arbitrary unit used to help enable quantitation. In this case, their cutoff is 20.33 BAU/ml. 

Your result of 40 is significantly lower than his 900 but that doesn't mean you aren't necessarily protected. To explain what I mean, one analogy I have heard compares the protection to gas in a gas tank. If you need to drive 100 miles, then you may need at least 3-4 gallons of gas in the tank. Having 30 gallons in the tank doesn't necessarily help you much. As for what value means protected, I have no idea, I am not familiar with this particular assay.

After adjusting for comorbidities, we found a statistically significant 13.06-fold (95% CI, 8.08 to 21.11) increased risk for breakthrough infection as opposed to reinfection (P&lt;0.001). Apart from age ‚â•60 years, there was no statistical evidence that any of the assessed comorbidities significantly affected the risk of an infection during the follow-up period (Table 2a). As for symptomatic SARS-COV-2 infections during the follow-up period, 199 cases were recorded, 191 of which were in the vaccinated group and 8 in the previously infected group. Symptoms for all analyses were recorded in the central database within 5 days of the positive RT-PCR test for 90% of the patients, and included chiefly fever, cough, breathing difficulties, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell, myalgia, weakness, headache and sore throat. After adjusting for comorbidities, we found a 27.02-fold risk (95% CI, 12.7 to 57.5) for symptomatic breakthrough infection as opposed to symptomatic reinfection (P&lt;0.001) (Table 2b).

Also, there're a few people who're unfortunately allergic to the components in all approved vaccines; sometimes their allergies are severe enough that they shouldn't take it.  But, they should talk with their doctors.

There're also a few people in such fragile health that the immune response from the vaccine could put their lives at risk.  Unfortunately, in that case, avoiding the vaccine and getting COVID could also put their lives at risk - so my only advice for them would be to talk things through with their doctors.

Also, traits that are ""hidden"" from the host immune system (e.g., proteins *inside* the virus's envelope) might evolve more slowly simply because those systems are less likely to be clobbered by antibodies from the host.

The article here (https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25133462-800-myocarditis-is-more-common-after-covid-19-infection-than-vaccination/) talks about the cases per million being 77 for vaccination and 450 for the virus and comes to the conclusion that you're 6x more likely to have myocarditis after the vaccine.  If we take the lowest estimate I found of 2 per 100k, that's 20 per 1M.  So you're talking 57 cases of vaccine-caused myocarditis vs 430 cases of virus-caused myocarditis, a 7.5x rate.  If we take a low estimate but not the lowest of 4 per 100k, you're talking an 11x rate.

Of course that's just the myocarditis, which shouldn't by youre biggest concern.  I couldn't find good statistics on deaths vs cases for age groups for the country, but California is a pretty big sample size (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-19-Cases-by-Age-Group.aspx).  For the 5-17 age range, there were 24 deaths in 467,048 cases, or a death per million case rate of 51.  That's about the myocarditis rate of getting the vaccine.  For the 35-49 group, which you consider a minute risk of death, 3618 deaths in 985,380 cases is 3,672 deaths per million.  3672/57=64x the rate of dying if you get infected vs the rate of myocarditis if you get the vaccine.  If you are 35-49 and you have a 2% chance of catching COVID at some point, you are more likely to die of COVID than get myocarditis from the vaccine.  Which will likely clear up if you do get it.

&gt;This may be their biggest victory yet.

&gt;According to data from the NYC Test and Trace Corps, 50.82% of city residents who identify as Latino have gotten at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as of mid-August. That compares with 49.52% of city residents who identify as white.

&gt;The statistics reflect a dramatic shift in the demographics of vaccination. At the beginning of June, just over a third of Latino residents had gotten a shot. White people were nearly ten points ahead.

&gt;But in the two and a half months that followed, the white vaccination rate increased by only about 5 points, while the city‚Äôs Latino vaccination rate jumped nearly 15 points.

&gt;‚ÄúWe have some great news today. We see vaccination rates among certain Latinos, all ages, going up. And that‚Äôs due to a lot of work within the communities,‚Äù said Dr. Judith Flores, Team Leader for Community Vaccination Engagement at the city‚Äôs Health and Hospitals Corporation.

&gt;But Flores cautioned, there is much work to be done ‚Äì because the pace of vaccination is still lagging in clusters of predominantly Hispanic zip codes ‚Äì especially in The Bronx, Upper Manhattan, and pockets of Queens and Brooklyn.

&gt;‚ÄúRisk is very local. So if you look at your risk, look at your zip code. Look at people around you. L

&gt;Why are some Hispanic neighborhoods still lagging in vaccination numbers?

&gt;Public health leaders lay much of the blame on Spanish language social media, where anti-vax messages are plenty.

&gt;Last month, New York Attorney General Letitia James joined the Hispanic Federation, calling on social media platforms to better police vaccine misinformation that circulates in Spanish.

&gt;Frankie Miranda, President of the Hispanic Federation, said too often social media companies claim success when they take down a piece of vaccine misinformation in the English language - but allow a Spanish language falsehoods to persist.

&gt;‚ÄúThere are myths that have been debunked in English and social media has been able to stop the spread of this information that has been repackaged and targeted into our community,‚Äù Miranda said.",,,,1630295122,{},havzfgv,True,t3_pea9yb,False,True,t3_pea9yb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pea9yb/in_nyc_latino_residents_just_passed_white/havzfgv/,1630379313.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although yes, most people not being allowed to leave their homes is exactly how lockdowns worked around the world in the height of the pandemic before any vaccines were available.

Air travel was stopped. Roads were closed to anything except essential traffic and food deliveries. Personnel at hospitals, farms, factories and infrastructure slept at their place of work in temporary barracks. By limiting the number of new interactions people had with each other it brought the virus under control and stopped the spread.

With a coordinated government effort, financial support and a population willing to make a small sacrifice it would have been entirely possible to completely eradicate Covid within the first few months of emergence.

We could have done this in May 2020, had a lockdown for 14 days, isolated all the pockets of infection, tested and contact traced - and completely eliminated Covid before the end of summer 2020.

&gt;The influx of patients is straining hospitals and pushing health care workers to the brink as deaths have risen to an average of more than 1,000 a day for the first time since March.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hospitalizations nationwide have increased by nearly 500 percent in the past two months, particularly across Southern states, where I.C.U. beds are filling up, a crisis fueled by some of the country‚Äôs lowest vaccination rates and widespread political opposition to public health measures like mask requirements.  
&gt;  
&gt;In Florida, 16,457 people are hospitalized, the most of any state, followed by Texas, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the surge pummeling the nation and overwhelming hospitals, a shortage of bedside nurses has complicated efforts to treat hospitalized coronavirus patients, leading to longer emergency room waiting times and rushed or inadequate care.  
&gt;  
&gt;This month, one in five American I.C.U.s had reached or exceeded 95 percent of beds full. Alabama was one of the first states to run out, and the crisis is concentrated in the South, with small pockets of high occupancy elsewhere in the country. As cases and hospitalizations surged, the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville on Thursday requested assistance from the National Guard.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything quite like it,‚Äù said Dr. Shannon Byrd, a pulmonologist in Knoxville, who described local hospitals filled to capacity, noting that the vast majority of I.C.U. patients in the region were unvaccinated. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bringing whole families down and tearing families apart. They‚Äôre dying in droves and leaving surviving loved ones with a lot of funerals to go to.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;As in previous surges, hospitals have been forced to expand capacity by creating makeshift I.C.U.s in areas typically reserved for other types of care, and even in hallways or spare rooms. Experts say maintaining existing standards of care for the sickest patients may be difficult or impossible at hospitals with more than 95 percent I.C.U. occupancy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hard-hit communities in Oregon and elsewhere are asking for mobile morgues to store the dead.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Ijlal Babar, the director of pulmonary critical care for the Singing River Health System in coastal Mississippi, said the influx of mostly unvaccinated, younger Covid-19 patients was hampering care across the system‚Äôs hospitals.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúBecause a lot of these patients are lingering on, the ventilators are occupied, the beds are occupied,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd a lot of other patients who need health care, we can‚Äôt do those things, because we don‚Äôt have the I.C.U. beds, we don‚Äôt have the nurses, we don‚Äôt have the ventilators.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Like many health care workers, Dr. Babar voiced frustration at the refusal of many residents to get inoculated, even after they had lost an unvaccinated family member to the virus.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThe families, you don‚Äôt see them going out and talking about the benefits of vaccine,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNobody brings it up, nobody expresses any remorse. It‚Äôs just something that they absolutely do not believe in.‚Äù",,,,1630326642,{},hax6gfs,False,t3_peh3l7,False,True,t3_peh3l7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/peh3l7/the_us_reaches_100000_average_daily_covid/hax6gfs/,1630400404.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Letting the vaccine-hesitant reap the consequences of their choices is probably the best thing for society at some point.

Permanent masking may slow the virus down, but will not stop it, and as long as hospitals aren't being overrun, you'll end up in the same place anyway as far as final body count with or without masking.  Continued limitations on gatherings will do long-term damage not just to the economy, but to the inter-personal interactions that fundamentally form the basis of society itself.

The only delay to reopening that I think would be reasonable is to give time for the vaccines to be approved for kids, but since the regulatory agencies are deliberately taking that process very slowly, even that would generate a high cost.  I suspect it's going to take decades to understand just how badly poor and disadvantaged kids were hurt by not being able to attend school in person.

Can you clarify? 

From the article: 

&gt; **The new variant has more mutations than other variants of concern (VOCs) or variants of interest (VOIs) detected worldwide so far**, the researchers said.

Granted, it‚Äôs a preprint that hasn‚Äôt been peer-reviewed, so I wonder how much of it might change if/when it‚Äôs published. 

&gt; According to the yet-to-be peer-reviewed study posted on the preprint repository MedRxiv on August 24, C.1.2 has mutated substantially compared to C.1, one of the lineages which dominated the SARS-CoV-2 infections in the first wave in South Africa.

&gt; The new variant has more mutations than other variants of concern (VOCs) or variants of interest (VOIs) detected worldwide so far, the researchers said.

‚Ä¶

&gt; According to the study, C.1.2 lineage has a mutation rate of about 41.8 mutations per year, which is about twice as fast as the current global mutation rate of the other variants.

&gt; Over half of the C.1.2 sequences have 14 mutations, but additional variations have been noticed in some of the sequences.

Broad means the immune system has had chances to both analyze various surface features of the virus, like spike, but with current COVID-19 variants there are 29 proteins, not just the spike protein used in mRNA vaccines, and time to develop the programming to respond to the various proteins, like antibodies, memory cells, t cell responses. Ideally you get a very broad and robust (more troops) response each time you're challenged (infected) and that broad response ideally protects you even against new variants your immune system hasn't seen yet because at least some of the proteins are still recognized despite mutations elsewhere in that current/new virus.

So, with many other viruses, including other known coronaviruses, it takes at least months for the immune system to do that memory based broader response development, and studies indicate the immune system needs the same type of time between infections or challenges (vaccines are a type of challenge) to fully develop a broader and more robust response. That means just getting a booster right after your second dose likely isn't the most beneficial method of training your immune system, that time is required between them to let your system develop its more complex programming for a more complex response to better handle potential mutated variants. So Israel might have done a disservice by not waiting longer, it's not necessarily about when your antibodies dwindle, antibodies dwindle after ALL infections that produce a successful immune response, that's what memory based responses are there for, to ramp back up production of defenses like antibodies and t cells so your blood stream isn't just overloaded with antibodies from all the infections you get daily. Your immune system gets challenged by various lesser pathogens all the time, so our bodies developed a hack to efficiently produce responses only when needed. Pfizer released last week a study that showed antibodies begin to dwindle at 4 months after full vaccination, and don't go down to 50% until the 18 month mark, so it's likely you're still well protected at both the 5month mark where Israel is boosting, and the 8 month mark where the United States currently is boosting. What's different between the two may be how well the immune system builds a complex and robust response to mutated variants based on how much time in-between challenges (vaccines) is allowed.",,,,1630332390,{},haxhykw,False,t3_peg4pa,False,False,t1_hax6njv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/peg4pa/israel_doubles_down_on_booster_shots_as_daily/haxhykw/,1630406144.0,21,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

A counterpoint is if we don‚Äôt worry about it until we know *for sure* it‚Äôs a thing and exactly how to qualify and quantify it (which there isn‚Äôt even a medical consensus for PVS). It‚Äôll be much too late to take any action to mediate the impact on the community.

It‚Äôs kinda like the wash your hands and don‚Äôt wear a mask early in the pandemic.

The point is - maybe try not to get Covid. Infections don‚Äôt have a binary outcome - perfect health or perfect death. There‚Äôs a lot of grey where people - even young people are experiencing long term effects. Plus the ‚Äúwhataboutism‚Äù that other illnesses cause the same or similar effects shouldn‚Äôt be an argument against ‚Äúlong Covid‚Äù it‚Äôs actually a much stronger case that it exists either as PVS or it‚Äôs own distinct manifestation.

I prefer to order inside rather than thru drive-thru, even if I'm doing it for takeout rather than drive-thru.  Tend to get faster service, order is more likely to be correct (drive-thru order accuracy sucks), and most importantly I can use the restroom.    
  
But I have found the majority of places, the doors are locked -- even if I'm staring at a huge ""Dining Area Now Open!!"" sign plastered next to it.    
  
Thing is, I get it.  I can see that long line of cars queued up waiting to order.  I know that the workers inside are almost always understaffed and never seem to get a break from the endless lines, all for shit pay.  I can understand closing the lobby when they need to focus on a bajillion drive-thru customers, rather than dopey me trying to walk in and order.  So I don't get mad, I don't get frustrated, just accept that's the reality of the situation and deal with it.    
  
I have found this paradigm shift in how people order/eat at fast food places interesting, and wonder how much of it will be a permanent change.  I suspect that on-site dining for many fast-food places (particularly on the lower price end of the spectrum) is largely over - and some fast food places are looking at redesigns that cut out indoor areas (in some cases completely).",,,,1630339148,{},haxxpzw,False,t3_pef923,False,False,t3_pef923,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pef923/mcdonalds_others_consider_closing_indoor_seating/haxxpzw/,1630414428.0,17,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We'd make even more progress if we could do more to address childhood abuse, mental illness, and lack of solid positive long-term relationships in many people's lives, all of which feed into addiction and homelessness.

Without stable communities to protect and care for the vulnerable, we're left reliant on government bureaucracies, which, while vital, aren't conducive to caring about people over numbers and measurable outcomes, whatever those happen to be.

&gt; The numbers of covid cases, hospitalisations, and deaths are continuing to rise across the UK, the latest figures have shown. In England, 200‚Äâ705 people tested positive for covid-19 in the week to 18 August, up 5% on the previous week and the highest figure since the week to 21 July, figures published by NHS Test and Trace on 26 August showed.1

&gt; In Scotland‚Äîwhere schools have restarted after the summer holidays‚Äîa record 5021 daily cases were recorded on 25 August.2 ‚ÄúUndoubtedly the gathering of people together in schools will have fuelled that to some extent, and you can see that in the proportion of younger people who are testing positive,‚Äù said John Swinney, Scotland‚Äôs deputy first minister.

&gt; Overall cases of covid-19 have been rising across the UK as restrictions on mixing have eased since June, from a seven day average of 2000 cases in May to a peak of nearly 48‚Äâ000 in mid July.3 Cases then fell to 26‚Äâ000 a day but have since climbed to a seven day average of 32‚Äâ000 on 17 August.

&gt; The rise in cases comes as the UK‚Äôs Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation is reportedly set to announce a roll out of covid-19 vaccinations for 12-15 year olds in the coming days.

&gt; In England, Public Health England‚Äôs weekly surveillance data for the week ending 22 August showed that covid case rates were highest in those aged 10 to 19, with a seven day rate of 616.5 per 100‚Äâ000 population.4

&gt; Alicia Demirjian, incident director for covid-19 at Public Health England, said, ‚ÄúCases of covid-19 are still high, especially among young people. We will be closely monitoring how the start of term impacts the number of new infections and review recommendations accordingly.‚Äù

&gt; Public Health England‚Äôs data showed that hospital admission rates across all age groups were 7.74 per 100‚Äâ000 population, up from 6.75 per 100‚Äâ000 population the previous week.

&gt; Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that in the week ending 13 August, the UK as a whole registered 652 covid related deaths, an increase of 6.7% on the previous week and the highest weekly total since March this year.5 Anne Cori, a mathematical and statistical modeller at Imperial College, London, said that the upward trends were likely to continue over the coming weeks as children across the UK return to school and more adults go back to the office and mixed more indoors as autumn approaches.

&gt; ‚ÄúIn most scenarios we have modelled, cases, hospitalisations, and even deaths continue to rise for a few weeks,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut when and how high the peak is is very hard to anticipate. This is because we still don‚Äôt know exactly the extent of protection given by vaccination or by previous infection, or how long this protection lasts.‚Äù

&gt; Figures from Public Health England showed that between 1 February and 15 August 2021, almost half (183‚Äâ133 of 386‚Äâ735) of sequenced and genotyped delta cases in emergency departments in England were in people who were not vaccinated. Over half of overnight inpatient admissions with delta (4033 of 7285) and a third (390 of 1189) of delta related deaths occurred in unvaccinated people.

The existing vaccines are clearly much safer than catching covid.   They're clearly safer than being unvaccinated in an area with nontrivial levels of community spread.

There's a point where, at a very low level of COVID prevalence -- likely unattainably low in the current world for the forseeable future -- the vaccine would do more damage than the disease and it would not longer make sense to proactively immunize everyone.

Just to make up a hypothetical, if there was no measurable benefit from a booster shot after 8 months in males aged 16-25, and the same risk of myocarditis as from Pfizer or Moderna shot #2, it likely wouldn't make sense for ACIP to recommend giving a booster to everyone in that age group.",,,,1630340895,{},hay1yr5,False,t3_pecwea,False,False,t1_haxxyzm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pecwea/daily_discussion_thread_august_30_2021/hay1yr5/,1630416748.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

While I will agree that writing up scientific material for consumption for the general public is a special skill (actually pretty close to the scientific technical writing I do for part of my income), the press release linked below by another user is not so bad insofar as medical info. Though I will grant it is rather heavy going in describing the bureaucratic (in the literal, non-pejorative sense) process for approval and EUA authorization, which I assume is in there because they are on the defensive. In more normal and less politicized times how often do these organizations need to explain a drug approval to anyone but experts? Basically never. But I‚Äôm with you that these are not normal times and we could wish for a little more agility on this front.         
I‚Äôll also cut them a little slack when they are publishing things quickly (nobody is going to be patient for an extra week while they have their writing team make the Dick and Jane version) that are intended for doctors, community health leaders, and press. Those groups should be able to handle the verbiage. But maybe the time has come for these organizations to have a wing that presents the more technical documents to the appropriate audiences and another that creates just items for the general public. Though, as I mentioned, may mean the public has to wait a little for either the press/local officials to release a user-friendly versions or for the organizations themselves to do so.  Ideally, these versions could be drafted somewhat in parallel, as I expect they know in advance what is the expected result and can get most of it together and approved beforehand and just add in the final details at the end.

If vaccine B is 95% effective at blocking symptomatic infections, and

vaccine C is 90% effective at blocking symptomatic infections...

How would you describe how much more effective is B than C?

\- I think it'd be (95-90)/90; about 1.056 times as effective.

&amp;#x200B;

If I'm right about how to compare the efficacies of vaccines B and C, then I think the following analysis of a recent [Israeli pre-print](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1) should be spot-on:

The conclusions of the Israeli pre-print strongly disagree with general consensus on vaccine efficacy.

For instance, that pre-print study suggests that convalescent immunity (aka 'natural immunity') is 27 times more effective than vaccine-induced immunity against symptomatic infections.

So, IF convalescent immunity were 100% effective at symptomatic infections, that 27-fold efficacy ratio would set an upper-bound for the efficacy of vaccine-induced immunity at 3.7%... waaaaay lower than seen in every other study.

""Up until now, the understanding was there was no need because protection against severe disease was holding,""Offit said.

In fact, at last week's CDC advisory panel meeting, the data pointed to that conclusion, including in Israel, he said.

""What you were waiting to see (Wednesday) is new evidence to suggest there was erosion (in severe disease protection). But that wasn't the case. The rules changed,"" Offit said.

In addition, the White House being the source of the announcement was uncomfortable for some experts.
""The admin is getting out over its skis in having a big press conference on boosters,"" said Dr. Walid Gellad, director of the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh.

""I'm not sure why there is a push now to talk about this when FDA has not even evaluated safety of such an approach or ACIP [the CDC advisory panel] hasn't evaluated,"" Gellad said, adding, ""The 'Israeli data' we keep hearing about is not as convincing as people imply it is, yet.""*

To re-use an analogy that I've spread far and wide...

A 98%-off coupon doesn't save twice as much as does a 96%-off coupon... but if you looked at just the final prices, you would conclude that the 98% coupon was twice as good.

As far as I can tell, that study has done exactly the same analysis needed to mis-determine that a 98% coupon saves twice what's saved by a 96% coupon.

&amp;#x200B;

What they needed to do was somehow include 16,215 individuals who hadn't been vaxxed or infected before June 2021 as a baseline against which to compare the efficacies of convalescent and vaccine-induced immunity.

From there, they'd need to look at the relative reductions in all types of infections compared to the baseline.

For example, if 540 out of 16,215 naively immune folk got infected over the same time period, we'd do:

540 - 19 = 521 infections avoided via convalescent immunity

540 - 238 = 302 infections avoided via vaccine-induced immunity

From there, 521/302 would describe the relative efficacy ratio of convalescent v vaccine... 1.73 times as effective at avoiding infections.

I've never seen any paper that compared 'interventions' against one another without normalizing first to a control group. (where 'interventions' are the vaccine and pre-infection).

The problem is they also turned it into a fucking advertising platform so it cycles ads.

You can also pay to play terrible phone games on their tablet that are cheaper to just download onto your own phone to play.

[],,bradster24,,,[],,,,text,t2_1kxybx2r,False,False,[],"The current vaccines available for Covid-19  were made to be effective against the Alpha version, not the Delta's - which are far more transmissible and much better at evading Coronavirus Antibodies that can be generated after the vaccines are given.

This is why third ""booster"" shots are being given in Israel. Their data shows that they are increasing resistance by up to 280% (or 2.8 times less the likelihood of Hospital admission or death). It is a temporary (and for now, effective) solution until the updated vaccines can hit the market.

The good thing about the mRNA (ie: Pfizer, Moderna, etc.) vaccines is that they can easily and quickly be modified to be more effective with the newer Coronavirus variants that we have now (like Dellta, and Delta Plus). Their competition (AstraZenica, etc.) will take much longer to develop and produce any updated vaccines.

The mRNA story is fascinating. It has been used since the 1990's (so in a way, it is ""new"" but nearly 30 years old), and ""untested"" on a GLOBAL scale but the science is groundbreaking and has been tested successfully for other things.

For example, Embryonic Stem Cell research caused so much controversy in the early days because back then, they could only be harvested from discarded embryos, but with mRNA - Scientists could now TELL the body WHAT proteins to make so it could PRODUCE Stem Cells, etc.

It can be used to repair Heart muscle and other things in the body. It is truly amazing what now can be done.

The city also expects young intensive Covid cases from October. The reason is the delta variant with a sharp increase in new infections and the waning willingness to vaccinate
&gt;
&gt; In general, the occupancy numbers in intensive care units are still at a low level despite the recent increase: 33 Covid cases required an intensive care bed in Vienna on Monday.
&gt;
&gt; According to the city, no child under the age of twelve who is actively suffering from Covid has had intensive medical care in Vienna since the beginning of the pandemic. With the delta variant, the sharp increase in the number of new infections and the waning willingness to vaccinate, this could change in autumn. This is what City Councilor for Health Peter Hacker (SP√ñ) is assuming.
&gt;
&gt; In order to be prepared for this possible scenario, 25 corona intensive care beds for children will be prepared for autumn, as a Hackers spokesman told STANDARD on Monday. The staff will be trained accordingly and the infrastructure will be adapted.
&gt;
&gt; Unvaccinated people dominate infection processes
&gt;
&gt;The background to this precautionary measure is that the infection rate is dominated by unvaccinated people: Of the 5,135 active corona cases in the federal capital on Monday, according to information from Hacker's office, 81 percent were unvaccinated and a total of 87 percent were not fully immunized. Around twelve percent were vaccinated twice.
&gt;
&gt;Vaccination has not yet been approved for children under the age of twelve. At the same time, the start of school in eastern Austria is just around the corner next week - with corona tests, but also many contact options. In Hacker's office, it is expected that more new infections in children will become noticeable in intensive care units for the first time in the fall.
&gt;
&gt;In general, the occupancy numbers in intensive care units are still at a low level: 33 Covid cases required an intensive care bed in Vienna on Monday. On August 23, there were 18 people, so that means a significant increase in the weekly comparison.
&gt;
&gt;Of the 18 people in intensive care beds at the time, according to the city's detailed weekly evaluation, 16 were not vaccinated. One person was partially immunized, another was fully immunized but immunosuppressed. The average age of the corona cases in the Vienna intensive care units was 54.7 years.
&gt;
&gt;Peak expected for mid or late October
&gt;
&gt;City councilor Hacker expects the fourth corona wave to peak in mid or late October, as he said in an interview with the German newspaper ""Welt"" : ""We are preparing to have to keep the hospitals fully occupied again in the fourth wave."" Vienna is currently still very far from that. In mid-March 2021, the city hospital operator Wigev announced that around 150 corona intensive care patients would have to postpone operations that are not essential for life. In mid-April, the highest number of corona intensive cases was recorded.
&gt;
&gt;On Monday, in a 24-hour comparison, a further 419 new corona infections were recorded in Vienna. The number of active corona cases increased to 5,135 people: It is noteworthy that - mainly due to the vaccination of the older population - the average age of those people who deliver a positive test is getting lower and lower.
&gt;
&gt;In Vienna, for example, seven percent of positive cases fall into the age group zero to nine years. 17 percent are between 10 and 19 years old, 25 percent between 20 and 29. On the other hand, only six percent of the currently active cases in Vienna are older than 60 years.

&gt;To recharge a mask, the group sandwiched it between two metal plate electrodes, then zapped the masks with an electric field strength of 800 volts per millimeter.

[],,MDCCCLV,,,[],,,,text,t2_nklge,False,False,[],"""LOS ANGELES ‚Äî As hundreds of thousands of kids return to class in the nation‚Äôs second-largest school district, they‚Äôre participating in what amounts to a massive public health experiment unfolding in real time: Every single student, teacher and administrator in the Los Angeles public schools must get tested for the coronavirus every single week ‚Äî indefinitely.

Even the fully vaccinated are required to get tested. Those who test positive stay home for at least 10 days. And those who decline to get tested can‚Äôt come at all.

Along with multiple other protocols the Los Angeles Unified School District is implementing ‚Äî including masking for all and mandatory vaccines for teachers and staff ‚Äî it amounts to by far the most aggressive anti-coronavirus campaign undertaken or announced by a major school district in the United States. And it comes as classrooms nationwide struggle to return to in-person learning amid the delta variant surge, with some governors trying to block mask mandates even as outbreaks have shut down schools or delayed planned re-openings in Florida, Texas, Iowa and elsewhere.

In Los Angeles, by contrast, the vast majority of parents, teachers and students are embracing or at least tolerating the stringent measures the district has adopted, with fewer than 3 percent of the district‚Äôs 450,000 K-12 students opting for remote learning instead. And while it remains to be seen whether L.A.‚Äôs ambitious approach will prove successful in keeping the district‚Äôs approximately 1,000 schools open for the entirety of the school year, local leaders and public health experts say the district is raising the bar in a way that‚Äôs being watched closely and could influence educators nationwide.

‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre setting the standard on reopening schools safely in 2021,‚Äù said Smita Malhotra, the district‚Äôs medical director. ‚ÄúWhat our district has done is really quite amazing.‚Äù

To pull off the daunting task of administering some 500,000 coronavirus tests weekly across the sprawling district, L.A. Unified has contracted with two medical companies that provide around 1,000 licensed health-care practitioners. These health workers travel from school to school with mobile units conducting and overseeing nasal-swab tests ‚Äî the PCR tests that produce the most accurate results. The tests are flown twice-daily to a lab in Northern California that aims to turn around the results in 24 to 36 hours. The price tag is hefty for the chronically underfunded district: around $350 million. L.A. County is paying for about $80 million of that sum, and the district is trying to get the federal government to cover the rest.

School started Aug. 16 for students in L.A. Unified, and by the end of the second week the district was reporting nearly 3,000 active positive cases among students and others. The number was rising by the day, but only seven cases had been linked within a school setting, all at an elementary school in Hollywood that ‚Äî like the rest of the district‚Äôs schools ‚Äî remained open. Anyone testing positive was sent home to quarantine, and close contacts were identified and also required to quarantine unless they‚Äôre vaccinated and asymptomatic. Some students and parents reported long lines or other logistical problems that were preventing everyone from getting tested weekly as intended, which the district said individual schools should address. Experts say it will become clear within a few months whether the program is working as intended ‚Äî and if it does, other districts should take note.

‚ÄúIf you can do it with half-a-million kids, teachers and staff in the district once a week, it just takes away the excuse for others that ‚Äòit‚Äôs too big, too complex, we can‚Äôt do it,‚Äô ‚Äù said Andrew Sweet, managing director of the Rockefeller Foundation‚Äôs covid-19 response initiative. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like an education Marshall Plan for a specific district.‚Äù

L.A. Unified‚Äôs approach largely aligns with what a number of public health experts have been recommending for months, but goes significantly beyond what other major districts are planning. New York City is requiring vaccinations for school staff, and both New York City and Chicago will be conducting screening tests for a portion of the student body, but not weekly for everyone. Baltimore has announced weekly tests for high school students, but vaccinated students are exempted and lower grades are being tested using a pooled model in which results are produced for a classroom or group of students, not individually.

In the immediate D.C. region, some districts and charter schools plan to test students and staff weekly, including using the pooled testing model.

What to know about school masks, vaccines and quarantine rules in the D.C. area.

One much smaller district in Southern California ‚Äî Culver City ‚Äî has gone further than L.A. Unified, announcing a vaccine mandate for all eligible students.

California State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond said he would like to see all districts follow Culver City‚Äôs lead, something that L.A. Unified is not yet contemplating, according to Malhotra. But Thurmond heaped praise on the many steps L.A. Unified is taking to combat the virus.

‚ÄúI see our largest district in the state, second in the country, taking the kinds of precautions that make sense for the highest results that you could hope for in terms of keeping everyone safe,‚Äù Thurmond said.

On the other end of the spectrum are the fights taking place in Florida and Texas, both led by Republican governors who are attempting to ban school districts from issuing mask mandates. In both states, the governors have lost court fights over the issue even as coronavirus outbreaks and school closures pop up all over.

For some in California, which has been aggressive overall in its response to the coronavirus, the outbreaks happening now in schools in other states stand as evidence that L.A. Unified is on the right track.

‚ÄúThe efforts we can take and the money we‚Äôre spending are well worth it if we can keep our students in school in a safe environment,‚Äù said Robert J. Kim-Farley, a professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.

Kim-Farley and others cautioned that no matter what there are almost certain to be multiple outbreaks in L.A. Unified, given the size of the district and the spread of the highly contagious delta variant. The hope is that the measures the district is taking will contain any outbreak and limit the number of kids forced into quarantine.

For some students and parents in Los Angeles, the weekly testing mandate is a welcome relief, providing a comfort level and confidence that schools will stay open after a year-and-a-half when kids were mostly stuck at home navigating remote learning. L.A. Unified‚Äôs school body is majority Latino, with many students from lower-income families. Parents need their kids in school so they can go to work. The kids themselves are happy to be back at school with their friends, and some say it‚Äôs no more than a minor inconvenience to get pulled out of class to take a quick coronavirus test.

The weekly tests haven‚Äôt rolled out without some controversy and questions from parents, some of whom have complained about a lack of transparency by district officials. The district reports positive tests publicly, but initially did so only for individual schools, without aggregating the figures. A local school advocacy group called Parents Supporting Teachers took it upon themselves to create an Excel spreadsheet laying out the figures, while criticizing the district for not doing it themselves.

One of the leaders of Parents Supporting Teachers, Jenna Schwartz, also questioned shifting quarantine protocols from the district and called for a vaccine mandate for all eligible students.

‚ÄúI think that LAUSD has some of the best safety measures in place of any district in the country, I really do,‚Äù said Schwartz, who has two middle school students. ‚ÄúHowever that doesn‚Äôt mean that that‚Äôs enough ‚Ä¶ when it‚Äôs your own children you can see what still needs to happen.‚Äù

One of Schwartz‚Äôs own kids, a sixth-grader named Oliver who attends Walter Reed Middle School, was told to quarantine toward the end of the second week of school after being in proximity to a student who had tested positive. Oliver and the rest of Schwartz‚Äôs family ultimately tested negative, and Oliver said he was happy with the way his school handled the situation.

‚ÄúI feel like my school did a really good job controlling it and I think the overall process was good,‚Äù Oliver said. He said he had to wait for 45 minutes in a hot quarantine tent after being called out of class, but praised school staff for bringing him ice water.

Elise Furlan, a scientist with children in L.A. Unified elementary and middle schools, questioned whether weekly tests would disrupt learning and amount to overkill, since it‚Äôs impossible to eliminate all risk or catch every infection immediately.

Still, ‚ÄúI think for kids it‚Äôs so important to be around other kids, so if they have to wear masks, if they have to test weekly, it‚Äôs okay with them,‚Äù Furlan said.

Furlan‚Äôs fourth-grade daughter, Julianne, said the testing did give her a feeling of safety, although ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of like annoying because you have to do it every week.‚Äù She also said that the tests take ‚Äúa long time,‚Äù defining this as ‚Äúabout 15 minutes.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have to say I‚Äôm so happy to be part of the school district right now,‚Äù said Andrea Richards, whose daughter is a fourth-grader at a public school in the Silver Lake neighborhood. ‚ÄúI can send my kid to school every morning and feel good about it.‚Äù""",,,,1630282857,{},havayix,True,t3_pe75xs,False,False,t3_pe75xs,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pe75xs/in_los_angeles_price_for_admission_at_nations/havayix/,1630366535.0,23,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nobody who is a scientist or a medical professional can say that, because there is always a remaining risk, how every small that may be. There may be genetic factors at play as well.

And from my personal, non-scientific POV: the greatest risk to your health is still delay. People do not get tested, because the Delta symptoms are more unclear, and because they feel they could not possibly have Covid (especially when they are vaccinated); and when they get sick, they do not immediately call a doctor, because they feel ""not sick enough"". People can suddenly get worse. And getting to a hospital three days earlier or three days later still makes a hell of a difference in term of severity.

The *true* Covid case numbers for the US are currently 1:100 per week. And that is the average for the entire country. So if you are in a heavily-hit area (Florida, Texas, etc.) the numbers are far far higher. With numbers like these the reality is that, if you live in such an area, every time you leave your house to go shopping, etc., you are very likely to run into at least one person who is infected. That is the reality you have to live with for the time being, and you have to adjust your behaviour accordingly. Quality N95 masks for starters, when indoors with strangers (supermarket, etc.).

The UK has very high levels of vaccination, and while cases are rising, their deaths and hospitalization rates per case are a fraction of what they were before the vaccines.  If that‚Äôs not enough to reopen society, what is?  

The risk level will not go back to what it was pre-crisis for quite some time, we are simply going to learn to live with an increased baseline of deaths from this new disease for at least a few years.  We can‚Äôt keep society in a state of caution and fear for that entire time.  In the long run, the number of deaths will decrease as people gain immunity through further vaccinations or infection, and that‚Äôs going to be the endgame whether or not we keep obsessing over it in the meantime. 

But variants!  To that, I‚Äôll say that the Delta variant is better controlled by a vaccine we developed 18 months ago than the typical flu strain is controlled by vaccines developed 4 or 5 months before each flu season.  If, and it is an *if*, a vaccine-breaker rises, we‚Äôll make a new vaccine, and the mRNA tech means we can start making millions of doses within weeks.  With how slowly Coronavirus mutates, it‚Äôs actually fairly easy to stay ahead of this thing with vaccines.

But Long COVID!  There‚Äôs almost no distinction in the studies between ‚ÄúLong COVID‚Äù where somebody can barely breathe for months, and ‚ÄúLong COVID‚Äù where someone feels snotty for months.  Also, most people do eventually recover even if they have a hard time of it.  Long before COVID, I had a cold that I couldn‚Äôt fully shake for a few months.

Regarding your last question, no one should care about what makes intuitive sense. Obviously you think it makes sense intuitively, and yet you'd be wrong in all of the below cases:

&gt;Of interest, a few vaccines induce a better immune response than natural infection:

&gt;Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine¬†‚Äî The high purity of the specific protein in the vaccine leads to a better immune response than natural infection.

&gt;Tetanus vaccine¬†‚Äî The toxin made by tetanus is so potent that the amount that causes disease is actually lower than the amount that induces a long-lasting immune response. This is why people with tetanus disease are still recommended to get the vaccine.

&gt;Haemophilus influenzae¬†type b (Hib) vaccine¬†‚Äî Children less than 2 years old do not typically make a good response to the complex sugar coating (polysaccharide) on the surface of Hib that causes disease; however, the vaccine links this polysaccharide to a helper protein that creates a better immune response than would occur naturally. Therefore, children less than 2 years old who get Hib are still recommended to get the vaccine.

&gt;Pneumococcal vaccine¬†‚Äî This vaccine works the same way as the Hib vaccine to create a better immune response than natural infection.

&gt;So, in summary, vaccines afford us protection with lesser quantities of virus or bacteria and the control of scheduling the exposure.

[],,gBoostedMachinations,,,[],,,,text,t2_cp98ie3n,False,True,[],"I think order probably matters to an important degree. Because first being exposed to the virus creates a broader immune response, anything that boosts that response will boost that broader response. If you're vaccinated first and then catch the virus, it might only boost the narrow response, especially if that narrow response is easily able to fight off the virus. The important thing to remember is that if the narrow response isn't enough, *the immune system will just broaden its response* and the damage done from the breakthrough infection will be far lower. 

So, I think people who are infected with the virus first and then vaccinated later will have the strongest resistance to new variants. However, the *costs* of becoming infected when you're naive are huge. Yes, you get that nice broad response, but you could also die or get injured in the process. Getting vaccinated first might mean that you're more vulnerable to infection from new variants in the future, but the costs are more like the costs of catching the common cold.

In sum, getting infected first probably means you get strong/broad immunity quickly, but the costs of that immunity are bodily damage, the risk of permanent disability, and the risk of death. Getting vaccinated first may indeed mean that broad immunity builds more slowly over time, but it also means you get through the pandemic without ever experiencing anything worse than a cold. Bodily damage from a breakthrough is superficial and trivial, the risk of disability is infinitesimal, and the risk of death is infinitesimal.",,,,1630356942,{},haz4qou,False,t3_pcovvy,False,True,t1_hanv6y5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pcovvy/previous_covid_prevents_delta_infection_better/haz4qou/,1630438797.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. The FDA approval for under 18s is still only an emergency use authorisation
2. The risk of any severe complications from Covid itself is far lower for children than in adults. The risks are on a similar order of magnitude as they are for the vaccine itself (although all data indicates that it's still a lower risk)
3. The data on long Covid in children is limited. Certainly data suggests that it has a far lower prevalence than in adults and that over a longer period of time it might not be too dissimilar from lasting symptoms from other illnesses

IMO children _should_ get vaccinated as they're safer and protect others around them.

The decision was made after a meeting on Saturday between Deputy Prime Minister V≈© ƒê·ª©c ƒêam and city leaders about the shopping needs of residents during the strict social distancing period.  
  
From today (August 30), delivery will resume in Th·ªß ƒê·ª©c City and seven districts including 8, 12, G√≤ V·∫•p, B√¨nh T√¢n, B√¨nh Th·∫°nh, B√¨nh Ch√°nh and H√≥c M√¥n.  
  
Only shippers who have been vaccinated with at least one dose (starting from August 13 or earlier, as protection does not start until two weeks after the injection) can work in these very high-risk areas.  
  
Shippers are only allowed to move within one district or Th·ªß ƒê·ª©c City and cannot go to another.  
  
Companies employing shippers have submitted lists of qualified delivery staff to the Department of Industry and Trade.  
  
Every day at 5-6am shippers in extremely high-risk districts will undergo rapid tests at medical stations operated by the military in city wards, and if results are negative, they will be allowed to operate.  
  
Shippers in the remaining districts of HCMC will be tested twice a week.  
  
According to city leaders, COVID-19 testing for shippers will be free for one week, and after that the city will adjust the plan to suit the current situation.  
  
The city has directed its Department of Health to monitor testing of shippers, and the city‚Äôs Police Department was told to ask all district police to apply technology to closely monitor shippers' operations.  
  
Phan Th·ªã Th·∫Øng, vice chairwoman of the municipal People‚Äôs Committee, said that goods and food were being transported to supermarkets and convenience stores citywide, but there was a shortage of delivery workers.  
  
The city had previously banned deliveries in extremely high-risk areas, beginning on August 23 when strict social distancing began.  
  
More than 12,510 delivery workers have been working in other districts in the city. However, with the new decision to allow deliveries in all districts, the number of shippers working in the city will increase to 25,000.  
  
According to the city‚Äôs Department of Trade and Industry, each shipper can deliver 20-25 orders per day. If 25,000 shippers are mobilised, they will be able to serve the needs of about 500,000-650,000 households. ‚Äî VNS",,,,1630334599,{},haxmzni,True,t3_pejh5f,False,True,t3_pejh5f,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pejh5f/vietnam_delivery_services_now_available_in_very/haxmzni/,1630408697.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not be at risk of ""overwhelming hospitals.""

That's always been the most important factor in restrictions.  We thought we were there this spring as vaccines were being administered in mass and cases were dropping.  There was the concern about those not getting vaccinated, but it looked like it wouldn't be a big deal and COVID would just slow-churn through those folks and we'd continue to slowly vaccinate the hold-outs.

Then we saw what Delta did elsewhere and realized we couldn't just roll through without continued protections or we'd overwhelm hospitals.  And some states did just push through and they're calling up the National Guard, requesting various levels of federal assistance, contracting out of state nurses, cancelling/delaying elective surgeries and a myriad of other ""emergency"" or ""surge"" levels of support.

I don't want that shit happening in my state so it's probably not time to drop all protections.  I'm cool with my kid wearing a mask at school.  I wish they'd mandate vaccines for teachers. I'm not going indoors at a fast food chain to eat.  Am I locked inside my house?  No.  There's a balance.  Took the kids to see Paw Patrol yesterday in theatres and had a blast.

[],,pjb1999,,,[],,,,text,t2_4fi1p,False,True,[],"Late last month, researchers in Israel released some alarming new Covid-19 data. The data showed that many Israelis who had been among the first to receive the vaccine were nonetheless catching the Covid virus. Israelis who had been vaccinated later were not getting infected as often.

The study led to headlines around the world about waning immunity ‚Äî the idea that vaccines lose their effectiveness over time. In the U.S., the Israeli study accelerated a debate about vaccine booster shots and played a role in the Biden administration‚Äôs recent recommendation that all Americans receive a booster shot eight months after their second dose.

But the real story about waning immunity is more complex than the initial headlines suggested. Some scientists believe that the Israeli data was misleading and that U.S. policy on booster shots has gotten ahead of the facts. The evidence for waning immunity is murky, these scientists say, and booster shots may not have a big effect.

After returning from an August break last week, I have spent time reaching out to scientists to ask for their help in understanding the current, confusing stage of the pandemic. How worried should vaccinated people be about the Delta variant? How much risk do children face? Which parts of the Covid story are being overhyped, and which deserve more attention?

I will be trying to answer these questions in the coming weeks. (I‚Äôd also like to know what questions you want answered; submit them here.)

One of the main messages I‚Äôm hearing from the experts is that conventional wisdom about waning immunity is problematic. Yes, the immunity from the Covid vaccines will wane at some point. But it may not yet have waned in a meaningful way.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a big difference between needing another shot every six months versus every five years,‚Äù Dr. David Dowdy, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, told me. ‚ÄúSo far, looking at the data we have, I‚Äôm not seeing much evidence that we‚Äôve reached that point yet.‚Äù

Simpson strikes again

At first glance, the Israeli data seems straightforward: People who had been vaccinated in the winter were more likely to contract the virus this summer than people who had been vaccinated in the spring.

Yet it would truly be proof of waning immunity only if the two groups ‚Äî the winter and spring vaccine recipients ‚Äî were otherwise similar to each other. If not, the other differences between them might be the real reason for the gap in the Covid rates.

As it turns out, the two groups were different. The first Israelis to have received the vaccine tended to be more affluent and educated. By coincidence, these same groups later were among the first exposed to the Delta variant, perhaps because they were more likely to travel. Their higher infection rate may have stemmed from the new risks they were taking, not any change in their vaccine protection.

Statisticians have a name for this possibility ‚Äî when topline statistics point to a false conclusion that disappears when you examine subgroups. It‚Äôs called Simpson‚Äôs Paradox.

This paradox may also explain some of the U.S. data that the C.D.C. has cited to justify booster shots. Many Americans began to resume more indoor activities this spring. That more were getting Covid may reflect their newfound Covid exposure (as well as the arrival of Delta), rather than any waning of immunity over time.

‚ÄòWhere is it?‚Äô

Sure enough, other data supports the notion that vaccine immunity is not waning much.

The ratio of positive Covid tests among older adults and children, for example, does not seem to be changing, Dowdy notes. If waning immunity were a major problem, we should expect to see a faster rise in Covid cases among older people (who were among the first to receive shots). And even the Israeli analysis showed that the vaccines continued to prevent serious Covid illness at essentially the same rate as before.

‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs data proving the need for boosters, where is it?‚Äù Zeynep Tufekci, the sociologist and Times columnist, has written.

Part of the problem is that the waning-immunity story line is irresistible to many people. The vaccine makers ‚Äî Pfizer, Moderna and others ‚Äî have an incentive to promote it, because booster shots will bring them big profits. The C.D.C. and F.D.A., for their part, have a history of extreme caution, even when it harms public health. We in the media tend to suffer from bad-news bias. And many Americans are so understandably frightened by Covid that they pay more attention to alarming signs than reassuring ones.

The bottom line

Here‚Äôs my best attempt to give you an objective summary of the evidence, free from alarmism ‚Äî and acknowledging uncertainty:

Immunity does probably wane modestly within the first year of receiving a shot. For this reason, booster shots make sense for vulnerable people, many experts believe. As Dr. C√©line Gounder of Bellevue Hospital Center told my colleague Apoorva Mandavilli, the C.D.C.‚Äôs data ‚Äúsupport giving additional doses of vaccine to highly immunocompromised persons and nursing home residents, not to the general public.‚Äù

The current booster shots may do little good for most people. The vaccines continue to provide excellent protection against illness (as opposed to merely a positive Covid test). People will eventually need boosters, but it may make more sense to wait for one specifically designed to combat a variant. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know whether a non-Delta booster would improve protection against Delta,‚Äù Dr. Aaron Richterman of the University of Pennsylvania told me.

A national policy of frequent booster shots has significant costs, financially and otherwise. Among other things, the exaggerated discussion of waning immunity contributes to vaccine skepticism.

While Americans are focusing on booster shots, other policies may do much more to beat back Covid, including more vaccine mandates in the U.S.; a more rapid push to vaccinate the world (and prevent other variants from taking root); and an accelerated F.D.A. study of vaccines for children.

Remember what the purpose of antibodies are: they're the ""front line"" of the adaptive immune response.  Very, very generally speaking, their objective is to prevent infection.  To prevent the virus from even gaining a foothold in your body.

But all the data we have, *both* with vaccine-conferred immunity or convalescent immunity, seems to point to the inexorable fact that antibody immunity wanes over time.   So no matter what, it seems, your antibody protection from infection is going to decrease over time.

But that doesn't mean that you get sick and die whenever your antibodies fail to prevent infection.  Vaccination and convalescence ALSO train other lymphocytes in your adaptive immune system: T-Cells, B-Cells, memory cells, etc. to detect and mount a response.  These generally kick in after your antibodies fail to prevent an infection.  Putting it simply, these cells come in to help ""clean up"" a virus that already has taken a foothold in your body, and will prevent virus from making you seriously ill or killing you. They may even prevent you from ever experiencing a single symptom.

So with that in mind, let's revisit the question: what purpose does it serve a person to infect themselves on purpose?  Remember, the whole *point* of enhancing antibody response is to prevent *infection*.  Purposeful infection is therefore innately counterintuitive.

Secondly, we don't *know* that convalescence is superior to vaccine immunity when it comes to training those *other* memory/T/B cell ""clean up"" crew to do their jobs.",,,,1630344435,{},hayajfw,False,t3_pekpsw,False,True,t1_hay5tub,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pekpsw/having_sarscov2_once_confers_much_greater/hayajfw/,1630421655.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

If risk is defined as the reduction in risk between unvaccinated and vaccinated, and naive and previously infected, first of all you'd have to have a group of 16,215 unvaccinated and naive people and figure out how many of them become symptomatic, I am not sure they have that. But you could say that the vaccine reduced 16,215 to 199 and the infection reduced 16,215 to 8 so you are comparing 98.8% to 99.9% which is maybe not 27x. But the big variable is that you don't know how many people were exposed or any kind of baseline.

But the first approach is analogous to what they did in the original trials. Like you have two groups of say 15k people, one vaccinated and one not, and you compare how many cases you have in the two groups, and you get 100 and 10, you say that the vaccine is 90% effective, by comparing the two counts of number of cases.

But to me this data is compelling. Even if the protection of the vaccine and previous infection were equal that would be big news. Even if thy are off by an order of magnitude and the protection is 2.7x as good, that is still big news. This question hasn't received enough attention, but at this stage in the game with an estimated 20-40% of the world's population having been exposed, whether or not they are immune and for how long is a key question and drives overall vaccination strategy. If those people really are immune, then we need to double down on vaccines for the ""naive"".

To roughly work out how they reached the 27-fold number: 
they had a group of 16,125 vaccinated people, out of 191 had a symptomatic breakthrough. In that group, the odds of a breakthrough would be 191 (those getting a breakthrough) / 15934 (those not getting a breakthrough), or 0.0119 or 1.19%. (We could actually do the calculation with just probability here and get essentially the same results, but the method they use calculates odds so let's use here too.)

The previously infected group also had 16,125 (they matched the groups), but only 8 breakthroughs. The odds are 8 / 16117, or 0.0004 or 0.04% 

The odds ratio, then, would be (191/15934) / (8/16117), or 24.1 - the odds are 24 times higher. It's not exactly the 27 they reached, because their model also adjusts for comorbidities with logistic regression, but pretty close.

How would you work out vaccine or immunity efficacy from these numbers? You can't, there was no never-vaccinated-never-infected-group.

I've actually got some exposure to macro and microeconomics now because I opted to take a software management course as a part of my Masters because I got the brilliant idea I'd might want to move into management or found my own company. 

The margins of most companies are actually fairly narrow, unless you have a mass balance towards E &lt; 1, meaning the economies of scale (E) work in your favor and you've got a situation where you are getting 2:1, 3:1, of output to every employee or project. Most businesses are lucky to get E = 1, meaning economies are balanced,.and a great number are E &gt; 1, where they are in what's known as diseconomies of scale. They're still perfectly capable of making a profit, but they're mired in inefficiencies and externalities. And in the case of software, commercial off the shelf or open source software libraries and programs are the only reason a lot of them even survive because it reduces the amount of man hours for development and maintenance. 

To your point, the small and medium businesses are operating around E=1 if they are lucky. You need massive bandwidth, markup opportunities, and production redundancies to get E&lt;1.

Alcohol is that markup and redundancy for restaurants. I can go out on my own and buy a six pack of Goose Island for $10-$12 by me. That's roughly $2/beer.

Pretty good, considering the population skews old, obese and gregarious. Cases are slowly dropping further, and I'm sure the booster will be offered soon.

There are very few restrictions: 

* masks indoors for everyone over 3 years old - high compliance during the day and in places like the supermarket; not so much in bars after 9pm.
* the unvaccinated should wear masks outdoors. I've seen some people do it but I'm not sure how well it is enforced.
* limits on number of people at seated events (hundreds).
* no standing events allowed but this is ignored (events are advertised as sit-down only but everyone dances).

[],,e_sandrs,,,[],,,,text,t2_f2h8q,False,False,[],"Looks like we're getting back into definition issues. Do you want the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of Deaths per diagnosed Cases? or the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) of Deaths per Estimated Total Infections? The number quoted by /u/Worms_sg looks like an IFR number or a ""snapshot: today to today"" number as I describe below. If you want ""full pandemic"" CFR numbers by country a few from [Worldmeters](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) are below.

|Country|Cases|Deaths|CFR (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|USA|39,668,541|654,696|1.65%|
|UK|6,731,423|132,437|1.97%|
|New Zealand|3,519|26|0.74%|

These CFR numbers have been (slowly) trending down as treatments and vaccine uptake improves. If you want more of a snapshot in time you could look at Cases from either 21 or 28 days ago (choose a ""typical"" Case diagnosis to Death window) and Deaths from ""yesterday"" (last full day available). 

**August 8 Cases to August 29 Deaths (using 7 day averages)**

|Country|Cases (7 day avg)|Deaths|CFR (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|USA|114,671|993|0.87%|
|UK|26,956|114|0.42%|
|New Zealand|2|0|0.00%|

Depending if Cases are trending up or down, looking at Today's Deaths against Today's Cases looks different. Since Cases are recently up, these numbers lower the CFR %.

**Today's Cases to Todays Deaths (7 day averages)**

|Country|Cases (7 day avg)|Deaths|CFR (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|USA|135,067|993|0.74%|
|UK|34,143|114|0.33%|
|New Zealand|64|0|0.00%|

The study shows the benefits of natural immunity, but ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt take into account what this virus does to the body to get to that point,‚Äù says Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington, Seattle. COVID-19 has already killed more than 4 million people worldwide and there are concerns that Delta and other SARS-CoV-2 variants are deadlier than the original virus.  
  
The new analysis relies on the database of Maccabi Healthcare Services, which enrolls about 2.5 million Israelis. The study, led by Tal Patalon and Sivan Gazit at KSM, the system‚Äôs research and innovation arm, found in two analyses that never-infected people who were vaccinated in January and February were, in June, July, and the first half of August, six to 13 times more likely to get infected than unvaccinated people who were previously infected with the coronavirus. In one analysis, comparing more than 32,000 people in the health system, the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 was 27 times higher among the vaccinated, and the risk of hospitalization eight times higher.  
  
‚ÄúThe differences are huge,‚Äù says Th√•lin, although she cautions that the numbers for infections and other events analyzed for the comparisons were ‚Äúsmall.‚Äù For instance, the higher hospitalization rate in the 32,000-person analysis was based on just eight hospitalizations in a vaccinated group and one in a previously infected group. And the 13-fold increased risk of infection in the same analysis was based on just 238 infections in the vaccinated population, less than 1.5% of the more than 16,000 people, versus 19 reinfections among a similar number of people who once had SARS-CoV-2.",,,,1630338515,{},haxw6gg,True,t3_pekpsw,False,True,t3_pekpsw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pekpsw/having_sarscov2_once_confers_much_greater/haxw6gg/,1630413601.0,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you've no further wish to humor me; no harm, no foul.

One thing that still bugs me is that the relative risk metric, alone, leaves so much room for interpretation... especially when it leaks into the public sphere where ignorant folk like myself abound.

For instance, the relative risks of a 99.9% effective vaccine and a 99.999% effective vaccine would be 100... identical to the relative risks of a 99.1% effective vaccine and a 10% effective vaccine.

Given just the relative risks values (as is the case in many headlines related to this study's findings), there's no way to see the difference in efficacies, and people could jump to wild conclusions.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Another thing that bugs me about the relative risks metric is that it seems like it could lead to totally bogus conclusions; for example, if the nominal risk of infection were 3/100, and some study compared two interventions, one of which led to 4/100 infections, and the other 2/100 infections, the relative risk would just say that the 2/100 intervention was twice as good as the 4/100... but only the 2/100 would actually be helping... and people might choose the one that does harm (if given no additional info beyond relative risks).

My guess is that relative risk studies are rarely performed before independent studies on each intervention had validated some benefit; so maybe I'm just worrying about a situation that wouldn't ever arise in the real world. Or maybe I'm just bracing myself for some bogus reports pumped out by some jerk who's trying to make a quick buck on their bogus product.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

As far as I know, symptomatic infection is relatively well estimated to be around 85%. [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html); hospitalizations are estimated to be around 5.16%.

It should be possible to compare intervention outcomes with na√Øve outcomes regarding symptomatic infections and hospitalizations, and I believe finer-grained estimates per age-group exist as well.

Regarding the confounding issues you listed; I don't see why they would be more relevant for the previously uninfected and unvaxxed folk than they are for folk in each studied bin.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, it's not the fault of the researchers who did exactly what they're supposed to do, it's the fault of fools like me who try to play couch-epidemiologist that such studies get misinterpreted.

We've known for a while that its Delta is worse, causing more hospitalization in both vaccinated and unvaccinated. The vaccines being less effective against Delta doesn't mean boosters would solve the problem: you need an additional study showing up hospitalization decreases with a booster. 

There really has not been much data on the effectiveness of boosters against Delta. We've only just started getting preliminary data. And for most age groups, 2 doses still is pretty effective at preventing critical illness. If you don't care if younger people spread the disease to immunocompromised/elderly/unvaccinated people and produce immune escape variants, then the position against boosters makes sense.

2. Vaccine effectiveness has always been measured by prevention of severe illness, not preventing infection. Countries like Iceland and Denmark are the better examples to look at, not Israel. Both Iceland and Denmark have much higher levels of vaccination than Israel and despite experiencing ongoing Delta surges, Iceland has averaged 0 deaths for months while Denmark basically just declared the pandemic to be over in their country.
3. The media in the US has managed to spin the aim of vaccines away from preventing severe illness to preventing infection, which was NEVER the aim. Now that antibody counts are seen to be dropping and infection of vaccinated individuals is possible (although still unlikely), the media is sounding the alarm. But B-cell and T-cell responses remain strong and protection against severe illness is as robust as ever. Hospitals are only being overrun as a result of people refusing to get vaccinated.

Yes, there's some risk that it will get out of control again, but society can't continue to be in a constant state of fear.

It's not enough to just say ""hospitalizations are rising"" to justify continuing restrictions.  If you have zero hospitalizations one week, then one hospitalization the next week, then hospitalizations are technically rising, but the absolute numbers matter very much.  And right now the absolute numbers show that hospitalizations in the UK are less than 25% of what they were at their winter peak, and the seven day average of hospitalizations is increasing very slowly.

Obviousy my example of 1 hospitalization is an extreme hypothetical, but it's meant to push the question - ""what increased baseline of hospitalization are we willing to live with?""

Not sure if this is the name of the test but it says ""SARS COV 2 S1 RBD IgG II"". It says ""ELFA / VIDAS"" as a method.

We both took the second dose \~3 weeks ago and we are both in late 20s.

My result was \~40 (vaccinated with Sinovac).His result was \~900 (vaccinated with Pfizer)

Can somebody explain to me what this difference means for our protection? Is he more protected than me? Am I protected enough?

Should we re-take the test in a few weeks to check for any difference (even if it is just for fun)?
