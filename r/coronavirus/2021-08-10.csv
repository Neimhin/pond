I swear this fucking virus is *perfect* at punishing humanity's inability to work together, look out for each other, etc. And its not just the assholes who get hurt- its the people trying to do the right thing too. 

And let me challenge you just a bit more: consider poor assholes in TX or FL. Their schools can't mandate masks (at least in many places- only some places which are willing to be fined).

""TL;DR: **Yes people in the phase 3 trial got pregnant after vaccination. There was no difference between the rates of pregnancy in the vaccine or placebo groups**. No one in the vaccine group had any trouble with their pregnancy over the course of the study. They also tested it on female rats and did not find any problems, either with fertility or pregnancy.

The Pfizer vaccine FDA report doesn't give a nice summary like this, but they do report 23 people became pregnant during the trial. They report 2 adverse events related to pregnancy, both in the placebo group.

Both companies say they will continue to monitor pregnant people. In general, there is no know reason why a vaccine would affect fertility. I don't believe any ever has before. While mRNA technology is new-ish, it's not so radically different that there would be any reason to believe fertility would be affected. On the other hand, there is growing evidence that covid-19 does affect fertility.""

&gt;What they're saying: The study found the Pfizer vaccine was only 42% effective against infection in July, when the Delta variant was dominant. ""If that's not a wakeup call, I don't know what is,"" a senior Biden official told Axios.

Here is the current version of the underlying study which is still not peer reviewed and the abstract from that paper


[Comparison of two highly-effective mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 during periods of Alpha and Delta variant prevalence](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.06.21261707v2)


&gt;Abstract

&gt;Although clinical trials and real-world studies have affirmed the effectiveness and safety of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines, reports of breakthrough infections and persistent emergence of new variants highlight the need to vigilantly monitor the effectiveness of these vaccines. Here we compare the effectiveness of two full-length Spike protein-encoding mRNA vaccines from Moderna (mRNA-1273) and Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) in the Mayo Clinic Health System over time from January to July 2021, during which either the Alpha or Delta variant was highly prevalent. We defined cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals from Minnesota (n = 25,589 each) matched on age, sex, race, history of prior SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, and date of full vaccination. Both vaccines were highly effective during this study period against SARS-CoV-2 infection (mRNA-1273: 86%, 95%CI: 81-90.6%; BNT162b2: 76%, 95%CI: 69-81%) and COVID-19 associated hospitalization (mRNA-1273: 91.6%, 95% CI: 81-97%; BNT162b2: 85%, 95% CI: 73-93%). In July, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization has remained high (mRNA-1273: 81%, 95% CI: 33-96.3%; BNT162b2: 75%, 95% CI: 24-93.9%), but effectiveness against infection was lower for both vaccines (mRNA-1273: 76%, 95% CI: 58-87%; BNT162b2: 42%, 95% CI: 13-62%), with a more pronounced reduction for BNT162b2. Notably, the Delta variant prevalence in Minnesota increased from 0.7% in May to over 70% in July whereas the Alpha variant prevalence decreased from 85% to 13% over the same time period. Comparing rates of infection between matched individuals fully vaccinated with mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2 across Mayo Clinic Health System sites in multiple states (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arizona, Florida, and Iowa), mRNA-1273 conferred a two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough infection compared to BNT162b2 (IRR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.39-0.64). In Florida, which is currently experiencing its largest COVID-19 surge to date, the risk of infection in July after full vaccination with mRNA-1273 was about 60% lower than after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (IRR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.24-0.62). Our observational study highlights that while both mRNA COVID-19 vaccines strongly protect against infection and severe disease, further evaluation of mechanisms underlying differences in their effectiveness such as dosing regimens and vaccine composition are warranted.",,,,1628674060,{},h8ikhjo,True,t3_p29ll3,False,False,t3_p29ll3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p29ll3/new_data_on_coronavirus_vaccine_effectiveness_may/h8ikhjo/,1628753852.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,IronDoges,,,[],,,,text,t2_amhzm3h2,False,False,[],"&gt; Well we know that fully opening the economy doesn't lead to overwhelming of the health services with a adult population that has high levels of vaccination. UK and Israel prove that. 

Israael hospitalisation rates are rising rapidly. Restrictions are being implemented however minor. Israel furthermore is racing to give everyone they view as vulnerable boosters to prevent spiraling death rates. 


The UK has reopened and our hospitalization rates are rising. Combined with an expected crush from winter respitory infections we'll have less capacity to cope with covid. The NHS is on it's knees already, it can't cope with much more before we are back to last winters hellscape. Finally the waiting backlog is 5 million and is expected to hit 14 million. Every covid patient ties up resources that are over burdened already. 


&gt; And the Indian example is rubbish 

Rubbish, we don't know if we need the doses. India thought they didn't got hit hard. We don't know if we need them for boosters. No one has been here before and winter is coming. Either we roll them out or roll the dice and hope they aren't needed. We rolled the dice on lockdown or containment until it was impossible not to. The UK was rewarded for the procrastination with one of the highest deaths per capita rates in the world. And the NHS failed to cope, hence our massive backlog for treatment of other illnesses and diseases.


&gt;talking about prioritising 3rd doses over 1st doses for humans.


We are talking about protecting our health system from collapse. The UK populace will not accept another lockdown when we have doses at hand to prevent it. All options suck but I sure as hell rather some one else locks down this winter than the UK. Every wave has resulted in differed treatment for non covid related illness. People died because they could not receive treatment or where told to delay. People failed to be screened for cancer when they had symptoms because there was no capacity.


&gt; Western nations will be selfish but more pressure should be applied on them - especially for nations that have already vaccinated their population. 


Fact is we do not know whether or not those boosters are needed. We have not fully vaccinated our populations anywhere in the world. Under 12s globally are not being vaccinated and in the UK only 16 and up. We do not know if a booster is required, we do know by the time we are sure it will be to late.


It is not selfish to prioritize ones own safety in a pandemic where the disease has proven to be much harder to defeat than expected. 



&gt; Hence why the person in charge of the oxford vaccine is saying export doses, not give people who are already protected more.


Ethically &amp; morally it is easy to say send the doses where they'll do the most good. Politically it is impossible to do anything but roll out boosters. If you get it wrong you are condeming your nation to another hammering. The professor can howl in the wind all they like no one is listening. Fact is the booster scheme will happen, globally those who can will roll out boosters. Those without will have to lockdown, social distance, mask up and get on with it.




TL;DR

Either the NHS takes the hit or some one else doe's. As a resident of the United Kingdom I rather be able to have my complex health issues treated. I had to wait a 6 months to receive treatment and that has been cancelled in the past due to covid. The waiting list is massive and contunues to grow, with an expected 14 million next year. Winter will see a massive wave of respitory illneeses requiring hospital capacity. Covid boosters will hopefully ease the burden on a NHS that already struggled during winter in the pre covid days. 


If the NHS had capacity to cope with all the pressures it would be different.

Now, the delta is rt rate of 5-7, so those Asian countries cannot control, but China has higher vaccine coverage, which will reduce rt rate back to 2-3.  So that's why China can control but other Asian countries cannot.

Fair enough. Although I would say you and others were rather quick to issue judgement on my position. But let‚Äôs not go backwards here.

Accepted. I‚Äôm glad we have at least arrived at a point where we can understand where the other is coming from. 

&gt;But if you truly believe in a vaccine mandate, then I continue to assert that you should have very little concern about private health information, 

I care about both. I want what is best for everyone. Those who CAN get vaccinated should get vaccinated. The small number of people who CANNOT get vaccinated, at the very least, deserve some privacy and sympathy. And to bring it back full circle, To protect those who cannot get vaccinated, everyone else in the profession should be mandated to get vaccinated.  

&gt;since everybody would be vaccinated except any former teachers, and there would be **no legitimate reason for schools to discuss the private health information, including vaccination status, of former teachers.**

No disagreement here, I think what you said still applies even if they are still employed depending on the strength of the mandate. 

&gt; If you want to show support for teachers no longer able to teach in your school due to their inability to comply with the mandate, write them glowing letters of reference and continue to advocate for implementation of public health measures such as vaccines and masks, so that we can (hopefully) eventually reach herd immunity, giving reason for optimism to vulnerable people who are unable to receive the vaccine for medical reasons, as well as to everyone else

In England and Scotland delta growth went negative when the school year ended, but is now positive again after social gathering limitations were dropped.

Floridas Rt has been [decreasing](https://covidestim.org/us/FL) since the middle of July, but it's easy to see a spike/increase in cases now because cases lag behind from the time a person is infected, becomes sick, reports the case, becomes hospitalized, etc. 

The patterns we are seeing now (if as many are suggesting that Rt was at it's **highest** in the middle/end of July, which all data points to that being the case) then it would make sense for where we are now with seeing a rapid spike.

I live in one of the few states that is listed as ""stable"" on that chart (NY) and our Rt has also been [decreasing daily](https://covidestim.org/us/NY) since the middle of July. Your suggestion that it just ""hasn't spread to us yet"" doesn't really make sense because you *aren't* taking vaccination rates into consideration. A state like Florida is sadly in a horrific state because their vax rates are/were so low, whereas a state like NY can thwart off the worst of it because we're going to hit a 70% (adult) vax rate by next week, objectively high.

If you click on literally any state you will see a decrease in Rt since mid July or a little later. Remember when Missouri was all over the news last week? [Their Rt](https://covidestim.org/us/MO) is now one of the lowest in the country.

Living in an Australian state that has had a handful of cases all year gives a different perspective of China's numbers - we see too clearly here, that either you aim for and maintain zero, **or** the exponential factor gets it out of control.

There's no stable middle ground where they have thousands of cases, but not tens/hundreds of thousands in a very visible way where the US state dept can produce footage of what's ""really happening in China/their hospitals"". That the US has never produced such footage, not even under Trump when you just understand how dearly he would have wanted to, leads to me believe their narrative here.

Another thing you learn living in Australia is that *many* people pick it up in transit, as transiting is one of the riskier things you can do in a pandemic.

[],,KingGiroux,,,[],,,,text,t2_gwf98,False,False,[],"&gt; As I have said previously, it has not been clear what motivates your persistence regarding concern about teachers having to share their private health information with parents.

What motivates me is that I think it‚Äôs wrong. Go way back to very first post I commented on. The tone of the comment just doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. 

&gt;You are the only person in the thread talking about it (not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with that) and you have remained steadfastly fixated upon it throughout, 

I remain fixated on it because people keep responding to my posts and making assumptions that are false or completely miss what I am actually arguing for. See below about my 2 core points as well. 

&gt;to the relative exclusion of other points which others (such as myself) find more salient, like public health during a pandemic.

I have said multiple times that I agree with mandating vaccines for teachers. I have said I have done my part and gotten vaccinated. Certainly we can talk about the finer points in all of this potential decision right? 

&gt; I believe that I agree with you on both points (although I‚Äôm not precisely certain on the second point since it seems to be worded a bit wonkily). 

I want to go back to where you said I was fixated on my point about privacy. We‚Äôve been going back and forth all night (at least where I am) and we don‚Äôt even disagree on my core points. We‚Äôve been talking past each other for the most part. I have been responding to others in this thread who are probably in the same boat as you and I are here but some have chosen to call me names and add insults. You can imagine my frustration. 

&gt;However, we seem to disagree on what mandate means. I am operating under the assumption that mandate means that if a teacher is not vaccinated for any reason that they will consequently be unable to teach within the given entity, and therefore will have to seek employment elsewhere or perhaps apply for disability benefits (obviously different municipalities, counties, or states could have different, less restrictive mandates). There would clearly be no legitimate reason for the school to disclose to parents or anyone else the former teacher‚Äôs vaccination status or any other health information, but if the school or other entity decides to allow for medical exemptions to the mandate, they may be leaving themselves open to liability if it can subsequently be shown that the exempted teacher was the source of infection. As far as the ADA is concerned, I believe the legal requirement is ‚Äúreasonable accommodation‚Äù, which may be to require the teacher to teach only remotely, and again the school may choose not to explain to parents why said teacher only teaches remotely. 

Not much disagreement here. However strict mandates are, we know that at least initially, there will be a small number of teachers who will not be vaccinated. 

&gt;Leading, I suppose, to your concern that parents will speculate as to the reason. This would be unfortunate, but it is outweighed, in my opinion, by the greater good.

I may sound like a broken record at this point but we don‚Äôt disagree about the greater good. While I have been arguing for a small minority of teachers, I know it is in everyone‚Äôs best interest for a vaccine mandate and I fully support that. I just want to show a little bit of support for those people who would be negatively effected by this decision. The only thing I will add here is that I don‚Äôt think speculation is a strong enough word for what I am worried about.",,,,1628655603,{},h8hxguv,False,t3_p1tn9s,False,True,t1_h8ht35m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p1tn9s/fauci_says_teachers_should_be_required_to_be/h8hxguv/,1628742547.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I honestly think I put a crack in her a(R)mor today when I asked her to name 1 single vaccine that has caused adverse long term effects after 6 months of usage.  I had already told her how under Trump, the FDA expedited the approval of several of the vaccines being used.  Largely that it was red tape cutting and having a historically large volunteer group for the clinical studies.  She replied back that we won't know what the consequences are 5 years from now.  I asked her to name one vaccine that has had unexpected long term adverse effect after 6 month of usage, and I received silence.  Finally, I convinced her to talk to the doctor.  

Case are about to get lit on fire in my area of America that has a 35% full vax rate and only another 2% (800 extra people roughly) having been recorded as only having 1 shot.

Our case load is already 83 people per 100k, and our county fair started Saturday.  I was there Sunday.  It was crowded like a rock concert and I saw exactly 2 more Confederate flags than I saw people wearing masks.  That because I saw 2 Confederate flags at a vendor's stall and I did not see a single mask.  None.  At all.  Its 35% vax rate here, and I imagine my county fair is mostly going to have people from my county here.   The county fair is probably the biggest youth event of the year, so were gonna mix everyone together real good just in time for school to start next week.

JFC.  Fear last year was of the unknown.  Now we know and have the testing available to monitor it, and a tool to fight it, and instead I have to watch this trainwreck around me.

We just had a rural car wreck that sent 7 people to the hospital.  We have 13 out of 20 hospital beds full for the only hospital in the county here, and we don't have an ICU.

I thought I stayed pretty up-to-date on things like this, but I do admit that after I got vaccinated I dropped the ball a little bit because my whole family was vaccinated at the same time, and at the time things seemed promising so I guess I missed this one. 

Anyway, does anyone know what this means for PA? I read the amendment to the PA Constitution about this and everything- does this mean that Gov Wolf can no longer issue Proclamations of Disaster Emergency without PA House and Senate approval? Because if that's the case, then WTF do we do in PA now?? If not for this, Gov Wolf would have likely extended the Proclamation because of the rise in cases. Now what for schools in PA??? My university doesn't give a choice and I have to go back in person. But now with all of this, it just doesn't make any sense- if you want to argue that students *shouldn't* be required to get the vaccine, then I *shouldn't* be *required* to go back fully in-person if I don't want to. They're purposely not providing as many online options so that we have no choice but to go back in person.

1. You're old enough to die for your country at 18.
2. You're old enough to vote at 18.
3. You're not old enough to smoke or drink until you're 21.
4. You're not old enough to rent a car until you're 25.

Personally, I think 18 should be it. Bam, you're an adult. You can drink. You can rent a car. You can go to Vegas and waste your money, etc.

On the flip side, as an \*older\* person I think:

After age 70 you should face recurring driving tests. Sorry, but if you can't see or react to traffic situations, you shouldn't be driving.

I'm not sure how many people with dementia vote, but I think few who truly have dementia are capable of getting to the ballet box. Having said that, I believe that it shouldn't be unnecessarily difficult to vote. Making old people wait in line for 8 hours is wrong, just wrong.

The mRNA vaccine (Pfizer and Moderna) doesn't contain a live or attenuated virus. It doesn't contain any virus whatsoever. That's what I believe is so cool about it.

The AZ &amp; JJ contain a virus, so called an adenovirus that is harmless. It is genetically modified to instead of replicating it produces information to your body how to produce the spike protein. After that it's very similar to what mRNA vaccine does.

About the first paragraph: If this your definition of free choice, everything will limit it to some degree. But these are the compromises one will have to make in order to live in a society with other people. Unvaccinated people present a substantial health risk to the public in general and to people, who can't get vaccinated (for medical reasons), in particular. To minimize this risk, a negative test ist often required. They were (and rightly so) free for a long time (at least in Germany), but now that there's a free and safe solution for the individual and a more cost effective way for the health-care System, people should pay, if they choose not to get vaccinated. It's the same for many activities. For example you have to get a driver's license and mandatory insurance in order to drive a car. It's your choice to drive one, bit of you choose to, we have to make sure it's as safe as possible and shield other's from the risk. 

About the second paragraph: Why should you be free from consequences if you infringe on other people's rights? Everybody has a right to be healthy. You may choose to endanger yourself, but if you endanger other people in the process, we as a society have to mitigate that risk. A negative test is a way less effective stop gap solution, so incentivizing people (in this case with a stick) to get the more effective solution (vaccine), is the right way to go.",,,,1628668717,{},h8ielqd,False,t3_p207b3,False,True,t1_h8ic6m5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p207b3/germany_will_stop_paying_for_virus_tests_for/h8ielqd/,1628751016.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Ministry of Social Affairs, the district and the police have informed the public about the extent of the scandal.

&gt; ""It is about a total of 8,557 people who may not have received full or partial vaccination protection, although they assume that they have,"" said Friesland's District Administrator Sven Ambrosy (SPD) on Tuesday in Jever. The affected people would now be written to by the district to make up for their possibly missing vaccination. In addition, a citizen hotline under the number (0800) 0 00 51 60 and a FAQ info page are switched. A staff member at the Friesland Vaccination Center allegedly injected saline instead of vaccines. ""We have reasonable suspicion for a danger,"" said Peter Beer, deputy head of the police inspection Wilhelmshaven/Friesland, at the press conference. During witness interviews from mid to late June, he said, there had been concrete indications of further cases. Beer did not give details on this.

&gt; Seniors, care personnel, educators and physicians concerned
With the concerning it is to concern primarily over 70 years old humans, who visited the inoculation center Friesland in Schortens Roffhausen between 5. March and 20 April. However, employees of hospices and mobile care services, educators and doctors were also vaccinated during the period in question.

&gt; Crisis staff: Repetition of the inoculation is unproblematic
&gt; In Hanover, the Lower Saxony Corona crisis team commented on the incidents on Tuesday. As the deputy head Claudia Schr√∂der said, those affected can now book appointments for the vaccination centers Friesland, Wilhelmshaven, Ammerland and Wittmund. ""Since we don't know if, how many and who is specifically affected and we are talking about a period of seven weeks, we have offered everyone to do a repeat vaccination,"" said Schr√∂der, who stressed, ""A repeat vaccination is advisable and unproblematic even if the vaccination was successful. It would not increase protection in that case, but it is completely harmless. And so that's the tool of choice now."" The president of the state health office, Matthias Pulz, also said additional vaccinations are harmless to health.

&gt; Vaccination centers remain available to those affected
&gt; ""We actually stop the operation of the inpatient vaccination centers on September 30. For this group of people who are affected here, we will definitely organize a second vaccination on site,"" Schr√∂der continued. The district has already ensured this. And: The vaccination certificates of the affected persons remain valid, according to the information.

&gt; District: Antibody tests this time not useful
&gt; At the end of April, the case had become known - at that time, however, it had been assumed that only six syringes had been filled with saline solution. Those possibly affected were tested for antibodies and, in the absence of antibodies, vaccinated again. This time, however, antibody tests are not useful, the district of Friesland informed: ""Since the vaccinations carried out now already lie months back, the antibody dynamics can not be assessed individually with certainty. Thus, antibody tests do not provide a good orientation in the current situation,"" the district's website states.

&gt; Many questions, but the defendant does not provide answers
&gt; Right now, it's completely unclear how many of the 8,557 potential cases actually involved saline injections. ""The fact is, we don't know how many of those are unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated,"" said crisis team leader Heiger Scholz. ""It may be that only one in three injections was tampered with, it may be that there are no other cases. Unfortunately, the woman is not cooperating with the police, she is silent.""

&gt; Political motive under investigation
&gt; When it came to light that the suspected employee had injected six people with table salt instead of the Biontech active ingredient on April 21, the woman stated that she had wanted to cover up the fact that she had dropped an ampoule. A four-eye principle was subsequently introduced in the Lower Saxony vaccination centers to avoid such cases in the future. The woman was dismissed after the case became known. However, the number of people affected grew, casting doubt on the account. Police found that the nurse had shared texts critical of vaccination on social media. The specialized police department for politically motivated crime took over the investigation.

&gt; Lawyers: There were no other acts
&gt; The woman's lawyers reject a political motivation of their client, as well as the scope of the acts now suspected by the authorities. They say the saline injections on April 21 were a ""one-time incident."" ""In particular, there have been no other days on which the vaccine was not dutifully administered in the intended amount by our client,"" a statement said.

Even things narrowly having to do with public health and pandemic prevention have not really been done to any great extent. More ambitious things, like a national health care system in the US, were also strangely off the table.

One thing that did happen was reassessment of the idea of how many jobs could be done remotely. This was sort of accidental, but will probably have far-reaching consequences.

Only because no real hurdle has been given, that's the main difference between the UK and the US. Look at the CDC mask mandate change, how suddenly it happened. It's just ""Vaccinated people don't need to mask now and we know unvaccinated people aren't going to mask either, but who cares because cases are low now!"" To me, that shows a serious lack of forward-thinking if the only preoccupation that I need to have with my vaccination is whether or not I need to wear a mask to Target.

All the focus on masking made the CDC completely forget what the actual goal was: getting to herd immunity! Herd immunity was only supposed to be at 70% pre-Delta and we couldn't even reach that. Meanwhile, the UK had been in actual lockdown for most of their vaccination campaign, gradually loosening restrictions as cases started to decline, and what was their end goal? Getting enough people vaccinated so that the country could fully reopen as safely as possible, not just waiting for COVID to magically go away without securing high levels of vaccination. 

The problem is that there was nothing really waiting on the other side for vaccinated people as a group beyond unmasking and a few measly trinkets here and there, like free donuts or lottery tickets. With vaccinations actually leading to more freedom for all vaccinated people, it's a lot easier for people to feel like they're a part of a group effort and it shows that everyone is responsible for making things better for everyone else. Whereas in the states it's more like, ""Heh, I've got my vaccination, so forget those screwballs.""

The problem with that kind of individualist thinking is that vaccination is *not* a completely individual act if the goal is to reach herd immunity and/or keep cases managed over long-term periods. That's not to say vaccinated people should be shamed--and I've seen way too much of this attitude on here and other sites--for trying to move on to some extent because they have done their part for getting to herd immunity. But when the goal isn't reaching herd immunity and vaccination is not treated as a group effort, it's easy to shift the blame towards vaccinated who just want to enjoy their lives more.

Those brief months when cases had seriously declined is when we should have been saying things like, ""Let's continue keeping COVID out of our community, get vaccinated! "" or ""100,000 shots a day keeps the COVID away, come and get yours today!"" When things were going well, that was the time to double down on vaccinations, not when hospitals are overflowing and the school year's starting.",,,,1628647126,{},h8hhuim,False,t3_p1uq2q,False,True,t1_h8h35ww,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p1uq2q/gov_david_ige_looking_at_new_covid19_restrictions/h8hhuim/,1628728941.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Really? Based on what? To the best of my knowledge, none of the under-12 trials have actually publicly reported their results yet.

One cannot claim to be on the side of science and evidence, and then make claims that the benefits of vaccinating children outweigh the risks, before the actual evidence is in.

It's likely that they will be net beneficial, based on the safety  profile in adults. However, we have also seen with the COVID vaccines some (very rare) side effects which are much more common in the younger age groups (heart inflammation for Pfizer, blood clot issues for AZ and J&amp;J). Its possible (if unlikely) that something like this may crop up which heavily affects kids under 12, and makes the vaccine unfavorable for this age group.

Magnet hospitals require a BSN, but some will hire RNs with an ADN, if they agree to enroll in and complete an RN to BSN program within a certain time frame. From there it takes about 3-6 months of orientation, working side by side with another nurse before you can be considered competent enough to take patients on your own. While there are some direct to ICU internships, many hospitals prefer 1-2 years of Med/Surg experience before cross training to the ICU. It then takes another 6-18 months or longer to truly be proficient at the skills and critical thinking required of an ICU nurse. Add to that, Covid patients are the most complicated, time-consuming, and unpredictable patients I‚Äôve ever cared for in my career. All told, it would take 4-9 years to develop a person from someone who has limited knowledge to an educated and skilled professional who can actually keep a person alive while sweating buckets under their PPE and stifling their PTSD until their next therapy session.

Florida being a vacation destination people were going there getting infected and not entering a hospital before home, that and population density and how people live in states matters.

&gt;The authors of the report scoured more than 18,000 publications, seeking studies assessing the long-term effects of COVID-19 with at least 100 subjects. They found fifteen studies, which collectively followed 47,910 patients for as long as 110 days post-infection

The time frame is important to note. We simply can't know what the long term effects of covid are. It hasn't been around long enough. With that said there are some terrifying side effects noted in that time frame 

&gt;""The five most common symptoms were fatigue (58%), headache (44%), attention disorder (27%), hair loss (25%), and dyspnea [difficult breathing] (24%),"" the reviewers reported.

Hair loss Jesus christ 

&gt;In total, they turned up 55 potential long-term symptoms. Other notable chronic effects included loss of taste (reported in 23% of cases), loss of smell (21%), cough (19%), sweating (17%), and hearing loss (15%).

This is more what I expected. Not hearing loss though. What the fuck?

&gt;Unfortunately, none of the studies included in the review were stratified by disease severity, so we don't know for sure if worse disease exacerbates long-term symptoms, though it seems likely.

This is a huge short coming of the study in my opinion. We all know covid can be really bad. But we need to know for how many people. And we need to know why it severely effects them and not others if we want to get a handle on this.

&gt;""The results assessed in the present study are in line with the current scientific knowledge on other coronaviruses, such as those producing SARS and MERS,"" the authors wrote. ""For example, studies on SARS survivors have shown lung abnormalities months after infection.""

Below is a study citing the incidence of encephalitis as a COVID complication to be 0.215%. I cannot give you an incidence of encephalitis due to the ‚Äúcommon cold‚Äù bc the ‚Äúcommon cold‚Äù as you probably know is caused by several different families of viruses. I can tell you that as a physician with 20 years of training and experience that  developing encephalitis from the ‚Äúcommon cold‚Äù would be extraordinarily rare. The only ‚Äúcommon cold‚Äù virus that I‚Äôve ever heard to cause viral encephalitis is enterovirus. Complication rate of encephalitis with enterovirus is 3% - but bear in mind that enteroviruses comprise less than 1% of common cold cases. The vast majority of colds are due to rhinoviruses, coronaviruses (not SARS or covid of course) and RSV. 

So to respond to your question whether the ‚Äúcommon cold‚Äù causes encephalitis at a similar rate as covid, it‚Äôs not even close.

[],,annoyedatlantan,,,[],,,,text,t2_f1901,False,False,[],"Ironic that you reference ibuprofen, a pretty dangerous over the counter drug, as your reference point. A third booster dose is almost certainly less risky than popping a few ibuprofen pills for a week. Ibuprofen and the related family of NSAIDs send about 100,000 people a year to emergency rooms and about 16,000 deaths. Admittedly most of this is from higher end and abusive consumption of it, but ibuprofen is hardly the paragon of safety if we're talking about ""off label"" consumption like a third COVID shot. 

If the vaccines caused that kind of carnage, they would never be approved. And before you say that two doses are okay and a third dose is untested, you may be right, but he idea that two doses are pretty much perfectly safe and a third dose is potentially dangerous is absurd and not really backed by immunological science. 

Here's the thing for me: if society is going to expect restrictions (CDC testing to get back into the US, workplace testing to travel, expectation of self-quarantine on meaningful exposure or positive test), then I am going to do everything I can to protect myself. Not because I am worried about severe COVID (as a fully vaccinated young..ish adult), but because I am worried about the disruption to my life: getting stuck overseas or otherwise ""stuck"" somewhere because I tested positive. 50-75% efficacy (which is probably what Pfizer is 6 months after vaccination) is not enough protection against a virus with a R0 around 6 for anyone to feel safe from life disruption. 

There *is* a valid bioethics question about giving booster doses to people when much of the impoverished world is still trying to get their first dose. But candidly I think this is a bit of feel-good bullshit. The Western world constantly spits in the face of developing countries. We could do so much more by investing in clean water infrastructure, malaria prevention, HAART distribution, and helping reduce childhood malnutrition than COVID vaccinations. The reality is that COVID is not the big killer in the relatively youthful developing world.

There is a difference between being an anti-vaxxer and being hesitant. Many individuals are more in the realm of the latter.   


Just facts are often not enough to change a person's views, hesitancy stems from a lot more than just a knowledge deficit. It's a mix of cultural, psychosocial, spiritual, political, and cognitive factors.  
Do you know what their specific concerns are? The recommended route is motivational interviewing to gain a further understanding behind their hesitancy. It helps to identify the exact area of concern around vaccines and target that. For example, if the fear is the ingredients then breaking that down, if it's infertility then tackling that avenue etc. Simply by being vaccinated yourself, continuing to have discussions and providing an ear you are most likely working towards them opting to get the vaccine.

In the entire history of vaccines there hasn't been side effects develop more than six weeks after vaccination. This vaccine is no different even if it has a different mechanism for generating the immune response, because the mRNA is gone in a day or two. Think of it as a post-it note for your cells, that's discarded once the message is acted on. With any vaccination, regardless of mechanism, what you are left with is immune memory. That's been known for decades and there won't be any surprises in future years. 

But what we don't know is what the effect of Covid infection could be in later years. Think of all the viral infections that have late consequences, some decades later:

Mumps- infertility

HPV- cervical cancer

Hepatitis C- liver failure

Chicken pox- shingles

Polio- post-polio syndrome

The hospital has identified ‚Äú25 cases and counting‚Äù of children with both RSV and COVID-19 at all three of its campuses, said Dr. James Versalovic, interim pediatrician-in-chief at Texas Children‚Äôs Hospital. More than half of those children have been hospitalized.

In addition to the dozens of children currently hospitalized at Texas Children‚Äôs, the hospital has seen thousands more who have not had to undergo in-patient treatment. And the COVID-19 diagnoses at the facility are rising by hundreds each week.

‚ÄúThe delta variant is spreading like wildfire among children and adolescents in the region,‚Äù Versalovic said.

RSV, which can be life-threatening for babies and young children, is usually at its highest rates during the winter, but it has had a rampant off-season run this summer. It‚Äôs a common infection of the respiratory tract that causes cold-like symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Approximately half of Texas Children‚Äôs RSV/COVID-19 patients are infants, and most are children under 5.

ANOTHER ONE: Texas Children's Hospital to become fourth Houston health system to require employee COVID vaccines

Virologists suspect viral competition from COVID-19 suppressed RSV last winter, and now the virus is coming back during the summer. While doctors aren‚Äôt sure if RSV and COVID-19 will make children sicker, co-infections can present different symptoms.

Children with RSV may have trouble breathing, sleep apnea, wheezing, fever and lethargy, while children with COVID-19 are at risk of fever, congestion and fatigue, Versalovic said.

Doctors at Texas Children‚Äôs have also identified the first case of the delta plus COVID-19 variant among its pediatric population.

The delta plus variant is one of the latest strains to emerge during the pandemic. Infectious diseases experts say it‚Äôs more transmissible than prior variants and thought to latch onto lung cells more easily.

Pediatric wards across Houston say they‚Äôve seen a massive uptick in COVID-19 cases among children over the past month. Children under 12 are not eligible for the COVID-19 vaccines, putting them at higher risk of severe illness compared to those aged 12 to 16.

More than 10,000 people are hospitalized for COVID-19 across Texas as of Tuesday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. In Houston, just 27 ICU beds are staffed and available for new patients. Some hospitals are so full, construction crews are setting up overflow tents outside their doors to triage incoming cases.

Texas Children‚Äôs is postponing some non-emergency surgeries to make more beds available for COVID-19 patients. It had not reached full capacity yet, Versalovic said.

[],,KinnerNevada,,,[],,,,text,t2_m76zflk,False,False,[],"Federal health officials on Wednesday bolstered their recommendation that pregnant people be vaccinated against Covid-19, pointing to new safety data that found no increased risk of miscarriage among those who were immunized during the first 20 weeks of gestation.

Earlier research found similarly reassuring data for those vaccinated later in pregnancy.

Until now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the vaccine could be offered during pregnancy; the recent update in guidance strengthens the official advice, urging pregnant people to be immunized.

The new guidance brings the C.D.C. in line with recommendations made by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other medical specialty groups, which strongly recommend vaccination.

‚ÄúAt this time, the benefits of vaccination, and the known risks of Covid during pregnancy and the high rates of transmission right now, outweigh any theoretical risks of the vaccine,‚Äù Sascha R. Ellington, an epidemiologist who leads the emergency preparedness response team in the division of reproductive health at the C.D.C.

The risks of having Covid-19 during a pregnancy are well-established, she said, and include severe illness, admission to intensive care, needing mechanical ventilation, having a preterm birth and death.

So far, there is limited data on birth outcomes, she added, since the vaccine has only been available since December. But the small number of pregnancies followed to term have not identified any safety signals.

Pregnant women were not included in the clinical trials of the vaccines, and uptake of the shots has been low among pregnant women. The majority of pregnant women seem reluctant to be inoculated: Only 23 percent of pregnant women had received one or more doses of vaccine as of May, a recent study found.

Dr. Adam Urato, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in Framingham, Mass., who counsels patients about the vaccine almost daily, said pregnant women are very wary of exposure to synthetic chemicals and want more solid scientific evidence that the vaccines are safe.

Is there something from your past that makes you worried? Is it some *one* from your past or present? Examples: How do you handle being sick, even with vaccine side-effects? How do you handle needles? If you have any strong anti-vaxxers in your life, how do you feel about defying them? Be careful not to minimize yourself in any way; keeping fears away because you're ashamed of them paradoxically gives them power, and can result in a kind of paralysis of avoidance.

You can also imagine the process of getting the vaccine, end-to-end. Take every fear and hesitation seriously, even if it's something silly like ""What if the person giving me a vaccine is rude?"" or ""What if I get side-effects so fast I can't drive/walk home?"" Work through and outline a contingency plan for everything that comes to mind, and work follow-up fears as far as you need to. For example, if you're worried about severe side-effects, then say okay, if I get severely sick afterwards, I guess that means I'm out for a day or two. That means I'll be on my couch, maybe even stuck in bed. How will I eat? Well, I can buy some food in advance that doesn't need much preparation. What if I can't even leave bed? I'll tell a friend I may need help in advance, and call them if I do. What if I have to miss work? I'll tell my manager in advance that I'm getting vaccinated and when. What if I'm super bored because I'm too tired to do anything? I'll add some shows to my Netflix queue. And on and on and on, until you no longer feel afraid.

It tends to spread through shedding of blood, bodily fluids, and new-bodily-fluids-that-used-to-be-organs.  As such, it's highly containable once identified.

[],,bcfyd,,,[],,,,text,t2_31dihri,False,False,,"To shed some light on the availability of Sinovac vs. Pfizer in Southeast Asia, I'd like to lay out here how Malaysia's Covid-19 vaccine procurement has went along:

Last November, Malaysia signed its first vaccine agreement with Pfizer 12.8 million doses. Over time, the Malaysian government increased its order of Pfizer vaccines. In January, more doses were ordered increasing the total to 25 million. Then Malaysia signed for even more from Pfizer in March, making a total of 32 million doses. And in May more doses were ordered yet again, increasing Malaysia's total order of Pfizer vaccines to 44.8 million doses.

For Sinovac, in January, the government ordered a total of 12 million doses.

Those are the doses ordered. But what of the doses that have actually been delivered?

By the end of June, only 5 million doses had been delivered from Pfizer. However, since last month Pfizer has stepped up their deliveries and by the end of July, 10 million doses had been delivered.

Sinovac? By the end of July, all 12 million doses that had been ordered since January had been delivered. Again, 100% of the doses ordered in January had been delivered by July.

So while the Malaysian government clearly ordered more Pfizer vaccines earlier, Sinovac was the one who actually delivered more earlier.

From the way I see it, it's only now, the third quarter of the year, that Pfizer is able to increase their deliveries because Pfizer was prioritising supply for richer countries like the US and EU during the early part of the year. Of course, the US and EU are rich and were able to place bets by ordering vaccines earlier and ordering way more than enough doses for their populations. What's more, the Pfizer vaccine is being manufactured there. In the case of the EU, the vaccine was developed by BioNTech in Germany and they received funding from the German government. So it's no wonder that these rich countries got first dibs on the doses that have been produced. But this just goes to show that it's hard for developing countries to compete with richer ones.

While the 44.8 million doses from Pfizer should all have arrived by the end of the year, Malaysia's Covid-19 cases, ICU admissions and deaths are reaching record highs NOW. Malaysia needs vaccinate as much of the population NOW. To do that, we can't just wait on Western vaccine producers to finish up delivering to Western countries before they can deliver more to us. Malaysia has to get as many doses of safe and effective vaccines as we can get NOW, be they from Pfizer, AstraZeneca or Sinovac.",,,,1628651504,{},h8hqcal,False,t3_p1oi24,False,False,t3_p1oi24,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p1oi24/ravaged_by_delta_outbreak_southeast_asia_shifts/h8hqcal/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,ef10c21863882b6a893ef5658399627f2abdc9e9,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1628651515.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,,

Symptomatic infection: Evidence from UK shows 59% protection vs symptomatic infections

Hospitalization: Evidence from Israel shows Pfizer prevents 81% hospitalizations (for &gt;60 years old) and another study found the hospitalization rate of Delta was 85% higher than other variants. However, evidence in the UK shows 96% effectiveness against hospitalizations.

Some areas are seeing the entire human lifespan be cut by 10 years because of CoVid So if two years mean something then 10 years really should.

In theory yes vaccinated people should be able to go out and enjoy their lives. In practice however with data that we have we know that huge events like this will cause hospitals to be massively overwhelmed over the next few months.

That means vaccinated people who need to go to the hospital won't be able to get care. That means that the healthcare workers who spent the last 18 months and are already quitting and droves will quit even more. Which means that when vaccinated people need care they won't be able to get it. That means that the people who are getting chemo treatments delayed will have more chemo treatments delayed because of unvaccinated people clogging the hospitals.

I feel neither of these accomplish much in combating the Covid pandemic.   


From the article: ""Texas governor Greg Abbott has spent the last year and change doing everything in his power to turn his state into a COVID-infested hellhole.""  This sentence claims that he acted in a way to {in order to, to bring out the result, with an aim towards accomplishing} cause his sate to be infested with COVID.  This is a serious accusation and honestly if it was true that he had malicious intent with how he handled his state, he should be in jail as a criminal.    


Instead I am guessing the truth is closer to ""Texas governor Greg Abbott has spent the last year and change pandering to his republican base in a misguided attempt to protect personal freedom at the cost of the common good.   To no one's surprise, the result of this mismanagement is that his state has became a COVID-infested hellhole.""""

 I think it may partially be the more years in school, I'm wondering if it may also be sort of like the overall antivax attitude of ""it's my choice!"" but with two distinctions: 

1. A sense of resentment  and 2. A sense of needing to have some control over this/their bodies in some way
For the first - even in the best of circumstances, nurses are always going above and beyond. This isn't to say doctors, techs, etc don't as well but just anecdotally, the few times I've been hospitalized, I remember every single nurse. Even when I was stuck there for a month 4 years ago and they had a couple travel nurses covering shifts.

 And, overlapping with the second - they do and give so much (including suggesting I use graham crackers for PB&amp;j which honestly is amazing lol) and now are being asked to do more. We all are but I wonder if for them it's similar to how I felt when I was pregnant and started struggling with PTSD in new ways. I felt like I wasn't in control of my body, that it was being ""used"" so to speak and that I was powerless for as long as I carried my baby. I remember wanting a tattoo or piercing desperately because it felt like a way to have control of my body again, if that makes sense. For the nurses, it may be that choosing not to let that needle and that vaccine dose in their arm is some measure of control that they haven't felt they've had for 18+ months.

Tl;dr: While it's kinda obvious the virus and being asked to sacrifice time, mental/physical health, and risking their lives when people and politicians did/do NOTHING to help them is going to take a toll and be traumatic, the ways healthcare workers cope to get through this surge and try to heal might not be at all obvious and resentment/wanting bodily autonomy can make us do illogical sh*t!",,,,1628653849,{},h8huinp,False,t3_p1ng4i,False,True,t1_h8fg8fo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p1ng4i/dozens_of_texas_hospitals_are_out_of_icu_beds_as/h8huinp/,1628740976.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,Heinrich_Bukowski,,,[],,,,text,t2_20ip082y,False,False,,"As I have said previously, it has not been clear what motivates your persistence regarding concern about teachers having to share their private health information with parents. You are the only person in the thread talking about it (not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with that) and you have remained steadfastly fixated upon it throughout, to the relative exclusion of other points which others (such as myself) find more salient, like public health during a pandemic. 

If you you are truly motivated by a concern for others, that is noble, but you have made that anything but clear, and in any event your concern for others would be misplaced, since I believe it more correctly belongs on the health of students, other teachers, and the general public than on the pitiable but rare teacher with a health condition so severe that it prohibits them from being vaccinated but allows them to mingle in close proximity to others during a pandemic. The needs of the many outweigh the the needs of the few and all that.

&gt;Here is what I believe.

&gt;1. I agree that vaccines should be mandated for teachers. 

&gt;2. If a teacher is not vaccinated under after this mandate, the school nor the teacher owe an explanation to the parents as to why since it probably a medical reason.

I believe that I agree with you on both points (although I‚Äôm not precisely certain on the second point since it seems to be worded a bit wonkily). However, we seem to disagree on what *mandate* means. I am operating under the assumption that *mandate* means that if a teacher is not vaccinated for any reason that they will consequently be unable to teach within the given entity, and therefore will have to seek employment elsewhere or perhaps apply for disability benefits (obviously different municipalities, counties, or states could have different, less restrictive mandates). There would clearly be no legitimate reason for the school to disclose to parents or anyone else the former teacher‚Äôs vaccination status or any other health information, but if the school or other entity decides to allow for medical exemptions to the mandate, they may be leaving themselves open to liability if it can subsequently be shown that the exempted teacher was the source of infection. As far as the ADA is concerned, I believe the legal requirement is ‚Äúreasonable accommodation‚Äù, which may be to require the teacher to teach only remotely, and again the school may choose not to explain to parents why said teacher only teaches remotely. Leading, I suppose, to your concern that parents will speculate as to the reason.

We don‚Äôt actually know how antibodies get transferred from breastmilk to babies. It‚Äôs a lot of educated speculation. It does not enter the bloodstream and is only passive immunity. From what we can tell it mostly just coats the nasal and stomach for a bit before ultimately being digested which is why breastmilk antibodies only seem to last as long as you‚Äôre breastfeeding. This is also why the only real immunity benefits we‚Äôve seen in studies is in gastrointestinal illnesses and I believe ear infections. We do think the antibodies may neutralize germs entering the nose and mouth but so much is still unknown and we still don‚Äôt fully know for how long children benefit from it. It could be the first few weeks, months, etc but it‚Äôs very hard to study. Antibodies via placenta is way more beneficial which is why we encourage TDAP and flu shots during pregnancy instead of relying on breastfeeding. This is why we also start vaccinating all babies (including breastfed ones) at 8 weeks.

Here is your original comment:

&gt; What if they tell you it‚Äôs none of your business if they‚Äôre vaccinated? I don‚Äôt mean that rudely either. I am on board with mandating teachers get vaccinated. But, it‚Äôs not fair that they should have to tell every parent their status. The school should know for safety reasons but as a teacher I wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable telling the whole town my medical status, even if I am vaccinated.

You simultaneously claim to agree with vaccine mandates, while complaining about *the whole town knowing your medical status.* Throughout the entire thread you complain about parents asking about your vaccine status and sharing your answer with other parents, and about people making Facebook posts about it, while I have consistently tried to explain to you that if vaccines were a condition of employment, there would be no private medical information to be shared with parents, since everyone would be vaccinated.

One would naturally assume that since you claim to be in support of vaccine mandates for teachers and since you further claim to be a teacher yourself, that you do not have any medical conditions which would prohibit you from being vaccinated, so the reasons for your persistent concern about parents knowing your vaccine status is entirely unclear. If you are motivated by an altruistic concern for the hypothetical and rare individual who is unable to be vaccinated due to underlying medical conditions, that is noble of you, but rather than being forced to share medical information with parents, those individuals may be forced (or could voluntarily choose) to seek employment in another school district or another state without a vaccine mandate.

The messaging wasn't really ever that ""masks won't help"", it was that the public shouldn't wear masks early in the pandemic. Why? If you tell everyone they should wear a mask in a society that doesn't typically wear masks, there will be a run on them. This is a public health policy decision, where PPE was absolutely needed to save the lives of healthcare workers, and was in very short supply. There was really no other option from a public policy perspective but to tell people not to wear masks at the time.

I've not seen any papers or information which supports your 3rd quote. With delta variant, there's evidence that breakthrough cases can result in a similar peak viral load between vaccinated and unvaccinated, but also evidence that contagious viral load has a shorter window for the vaccinated. There's also no doubt that vaccinated individuals are less likely to become infected and contagious overall. 

People seem to think that medical advice is ""flip-flopping"" to use the c.2000s political term: The idea that if you say one thing, and then ever change what you say, you were previously lying or deceiving people.

Janelle Stecklein/ CNHI State Reporter
OKLAHOMA CITY ‚Äî The state‚Äôs hospital system is nearing the breaking point as COVID-19 admissions climb and nursing shortages plague facilities, but the governor said no state of emergency is needed at this point.

The head of the Oklahoma Hospital Association on Tuesday, meanwhile, called on state officials to grant Oklahoma hospitals the same flexibility they were given last year in order to combat the latest virus spike.

‚ÄúOklahoma hospitals need state regulatory flexibility to create additional bed capacity such as repurposing space within a hospital, licensure flexibility and enabling the insurance department to instruct insurance companies to waive or expedite pre-authorization for post-acute care,‚Äù said Patti Davis, president of the OHA.

She called for the ‚Äúmost expedient course to be taken‚Äù to achieve that flexibility.

‚ÄúIf state agencies have statutory authority to move without an executive order by the governor, we certainly would like to see that explored,‚Äù Davis said.

""We have an effective vaccine that is free and widely available to all eligible Oklahomans, and we are well prepared to manage COVID without a state of emergency,‚Äù Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a statement Tuesday.

Dr. Dale Bratzler, chief COVID officer with the University of Oklahoma, said Tuesday that his hospital system has had to start erecting temporary barriers and taking other measures to create COVID-19 units because ‚Äúwe‚Äôve seen a really dramatic increase in the number of cases‚Äù within the past week. He also said during a media briefing Tuesday that another major medical system in Oklahoma City, Mercy, announced that it also is running out of bed capacity.

‚ÄúRemember, there are many other people at the hospital for other things at the same time, and we have this tremendous shortage of nurses that actually would allow us to open up all the beds that we have in our facilities,‚Äù Bratzler said.

The State Department of Health reported 1,042 new COVID-19 cases Tuesday, bringing the state‚Äôs seven-day average to 2,025. The agency reported 919 people were hospitalized with COVID-19. Of those patients, more than a quarter were in intensive care.

State health officials have reported that while some vaccinated residents have become ill, most of the new COVID-19 cases have been among those who have yet to get their vaccine.

Bratzler said that while he doesn‚Äôt see all statewide hospital capacity numbers, he knows ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs happening in Oklahoma City and in our system, and we are approaching the limits of capacity.‚Äù He also said Tulsa area hospitals have been ‚Äúvery, very full.‚Äù

But Bratzler said part of the ability of hospitals to repurpose beds to bring in contingent staffing is dependent on Stitt declaring a state of emergency.

‚ÄúIf our hospitalizations keep going up then that may be necessary,‚Äù he said.

Also, what makes you think they trust test facilities if they already don't trust the health system /government with their vaccine? That's another reason why they don't get the jab. Nor go testing because they say the tests are fake or are detecting the common flu.

The good news is, [the UK did a study](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/one-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-can-cut-household-transmission-by-up-to-half) on whether infected people transmitted to the people they live with and compared vaccinated to unvaccinated people and found the vaccinated people transmitted the people they live with at about half the rate of the unvaccinated people.

The bad news is that study was done in April 2021, so probably safe to assume basically all of those cases were the Alpha variant.

[],,KingGiroux,,,[],,,,text,t2_gwf98,False,False,,"&gt; I don‚Äôt believe you are arguing in good faith.

Please illuminate me on what you think I‚Äôm really up to here. 

&gt; You simultaneously claim to agree with vaccine mandates, while complaining about the whole town knowing your medical status. Throughout the entire thread you complain about parents asking about your vaccine status and sharing your answer with other parents, and about people making Facebook posts about it, while I have consistently tried to explain to you that if vaccines were a condition of employment, there would be no private medical information to be shared with parents, since everyone would be vaccinated.

Here is what I believe. 

1. I agree that vaccines should be mandated for teachers. 

2. If a teacher is not vaccinated under after this mandate, the school nor the teacher owe an explanation to the parents as to why since it probably a medical reason. 

I don‚Äôt think either of those points contradict each other. I know you and others have said parents won‚Äôt ask if there is a mandate. I responded to a poster who said they would want an explanation as to why a teacher wasn‚Äôt vaccinated. 

&gt; One would naturally assume since you claim to be in support of vaccine mandates for teachers and since you further claim to be a teacher yourself, that you do not have any medical conditions which would prohibit you from being vaccinated, 

All these claims are true. 

&gt;so the reasons for your persistent concern about parents knowing your vaccine status is entirely unclear.

See my 2 points above. 

&gt; If you are motivated by an altruistic concern for the hypothetical and rare individual who is unable to be vaccinated due to underlying medical conditions, that is noble of you,

That is really the only thing I have been trying to say. These people are in a tough position and do not deserve to have their business out in public. 

&gt; but rather than being forced to share medical information with parents, those individuals may be forced (or could voluntarily choose) to seek employment in another school district or another state without a vaccine mandate.

That‚Äôs a fair solution. 

&gt; Having said that, I don‚Äôt believe you are motivated by altruism

We are in Orange County, CA. School starts on the 19th. He's going to 1st grade. Needless to say, virtual would be a disaster at his age, and possibly even more so for him because he's slightly hyperactive / add. He's also yearning for company and will be incredibly disappointed if he finds out he's not going in-person.
Lastly, hough my wife and I are both working from home, I suspect facilitating the remote learning and keeping him in-check will take a good portion of our time, at least based on last year's experience. It's very likely that he will fall behind academically and socially.

Now, on the other side of the scale is COVID and Delta. And I want to make a rationale decision based on the data available, not fear. They will have masks indoors but not outdoors, and I don't know to what extent it'll be enforced. The social distancing of last year seems to be gone, possibly out the door with a few other precautions.
Some questions are - what are the odds he will get covid at school? What are the odds he will get covid **and** serious sickness requiring hospitalization? What are the odds he will get covid **and** have long term symptoms?

We had gone back and forth quite a bit on sending him but felt that the benefit of socialization and in school learning outweighed the risks with the information we had at hand and his excellent mask wearing/hand washing practices (Hindsight bit me pretty hard on this decision). He was running a fever the next morning and coughing/sneezing so we decided to get him a rapid test that came up positive. We decided to also test his 3yo brother the following day with one of CVS's self administered PCR tests (he was asymptomatic at the time and the rapid site we used before was out of tests). My wife took him by herself and she said he was really putting up a fight so it wasn't the easiest thing in the world to conduct. The reason I bring this up is that his PCR result came back negative tonight (Today he's running a fever/has chills and has been coughing and sneezing all day).

My wife and I were vaccinated with the Pfizer shot back in late March and she's experiencing no symptoms while I'm experiencing coughing/sneezing/sore throat. We're quarantining either way and his school was notified at the first positive result but I'm wondering what is amiss here. We're considering bringing our 3yo to his pediatrician tomorrow to get him tested again now that he's showing symptoms but not sure if it's worth the risk/effort. My guess is the self administered CVS test was not performed well enough with him struggling or came up negative because he was asymptomatic. Curious what you all think we should be doing here.

We're a private school with ample access to technology, providing each student with either an iPad or a laptop. Wealthy families who could either work from home, or had nannies or au pairs to stay with the kids. Tech-savvy teachers, and a responsive IT department who would even come to our homes to help if we needed it. 

And still, we lost a lot of ground academically, and saw alarming trends with the kids emotional well-being. Depression, anxiety, kids who used to love school and learning just shutting down. One girl's mom met with us online and said she kept trying to get her daughter to sign onto Zoom, but she would just cry and couldn't even verbalize why. 

When we came back to campus last fall, and had hybrid learning with some students still at home, we had a lot of mitigation protocols at school. Masks required, HVAC overhauled, HEPA filters in every class, handwashing and hand sanitizing stations all over, kids in ""pods,"" health screenings every day, mandatory on campus COVID tests for all employees after every school break, random tests at other times, contact tracing, quarantining entire pods when a case was suspected. We had a former CDC epidemiologist on our task force that met weekly, looking at our local data, any new research, adjusting our plans as we learned new info. 

We had very few cases, no one hospitalized, no deaths, and ZERO spread on campus. All the cases were picked up off campus, visiting relatives, etc. and did not spread at school. 

Gradually, our home learners eventually started coming back. The pure joy in being able to see their friends again was palpable. All the rules about masks and handwashing and distancing - they were more than happy to follow, no complaints at all, because they just wanted to be at school no matter what. You cannot overestimate how vital socialization is for their development and well-being. 

And as a teacher, it is infinitely easier to teach in person. You can give immediate help and immediate feedback. The kids can work collaboratively. You don't have to wait for parents to come pick up resources. Kids can just raise their hand to ask questions, instead of having to remember to unmute, hoping no one else either at home or at school is talking at the same time, hoping you'll be heard over the classroom noise and won't have to ask over and over and just eventually give up. Kids at school don't have the constant distraction of the home learners up on the screen in front of them, and whatever else is going on at home in the background.

Because the data doesn't currently support boosters except for the immunocompromised, and maybe the most vulnerable.

I believe there have even multiple articles/threads about it here.  They start developing them as soon as variants of concern are identified, is my understanding.  I don't know whether they would be used over a standard third shot, but I do believe they exist at the very least?

As far as boosters for the immunocompromised and vulnerable, this is primarily who I was talking about.  If I don't need a booster and the data shows that, that's fine, but the data is showing elderly people like my Dad may have waning immunity to the vaccines (a recent study suggested his protection from infection with his Pfizer vaccine may now be as low as 42%), so yes, I'm seriously concerned for him when I keep reading about breakthroughs and all this other stuff every day.  This is not to mention immunocompromised people for who the vaccines may not be as effective in the first place.

Go shovel your bullshit somewhere else. When you use your executive powers to prevent local governments from enacting policies meant to contain the spread of a disease, you are solely responsible for the deaths that come from that decision. Ok, so maybe local governments just ignore his order, and enact policy with the assumption that the governors office doesn‚Äôt have the teeth to enact his policy. But then you get this:

https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/08/09/1026299001/florida-governor-desantis-school-superintendent-salary-masks

So now not only are you preventing local government from enacting COVID-safe policy, but you are actively threatening local officials using their salary to prevent them from going against you.

As an aside, you can generally place people into three groups when it comes to mask policy: 1) will always wear 2) will wear if required 3) will never wear. There are plenty of communities in Florida that could enact mask policies and get that second group wearing masks again.

I'm not sure why you're so focused on this one thing. My point was that this small sect of the population (college students) is not going to vastly impact the larger trajectory of the delta surge that we're currently experiencing. College kids socialize together and at bars regardless of school. True that back to school could cause pockets of surges, but OP said that we're still like a month from the peak of this wave because universities haven't opened back up yet, and that's just not true. The R is already falling in most hard hit states, suggesting that we are in the peak and maybe even starting to slowly move past it.

The uptick is the latest sign of growing interest in the shots amid surging COVID-19 cases around the country and a push to vaccinate children ahead of the new school year.

&gt;Nationwide, the country was averaging around 441,198 new vaccinations per day as of August 5, according to figures released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That represents a 95% increase from the mere 226,209 average of first doses recorded a month prior, on July 5.

&gt;The sharp turnaround comes after the average pace of new vaccinations had been plummeting for months, bottoming out around 218,696 on July 7.

&gt;Since then, the pace of first doses has steadily climbed in nearly every state. Some of the largest increases have come in areas that had long lagged the nationwide vaccination average, and are now besieged by spikes in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.

&gt;In Alabama, which has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S., the average pace of new vaccinations has climbed more than 100% according to the CDC's figures from July 22. The next largest increase was in Louisiana, where first shots have accelerated 84%, followed by Nebraska and Minnesota. Alabama and Louisiana are among the states that have seen some of most severe COVID-19 surges so far this summer.

&gt;The largest share of first doses in the past two weeks has gone to adults between 25 and 39 years old. That group made up more than 25% of all Americans who started their COVID-19 vaccination regimens over the past two weeks.

&gt;Some of those new first doses may have been driven by a growing list of employers moving to push their workers to get the shots, including hospital employees and government workers. The share of unvaccinated Americans who said they would get a COVID-19 vaccine ""only if required"" fell from 6% to 3% last month, according to a poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation.

&gt;However, the largest uptick in first doses over the past month has been in children. More than 4 in 10 adolescents, ages 12 to 15 years old, now have at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine ‚Äî up 8.5% from a month prior.

&gt; Experts say California‚Äôs better-than-average vaccination rates and newly implemented mandatory mask policies in parts of the state have helped prevent a more grim situation.

&gt; While governors in Florida, Texas and other states have opposed allowing local governments to mandate the wearing of masks, California has allowed counties to enact such orders in indoor public spaces for everyone age 2 and older, regardless of vaccination status.

&gt; . 

&gt; Data from around the world and from our county have repeatedly shown that masking is a valuable layer of protection against transmission of respiratory viruses,‚Äù Ferrer said.

&gt; . 

&gt; The biggest reason for that optimism is California‚Äôs relatively robust level of vaccine coverage. According to the latest CDC figures, 77.5% of eligible Californians ‚Äî those who are at least 12 years old ‚Äî have already gotten at least one dose, and about 63% are considered fully vaccinated.

Most vaccines are given as multiple shots over multiple months. We stop giving boosters when the effectiveness gets up to a high enough level that we think another booster isn't worth it. For instance, for the [HPV vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardasil#Administration) some countries do two doses and others do three doses because it's marginal whether the third dose is worth the trouble and different countries made different decisions.

My layman's understanding is that the intuition behind multiple space doses of vaccines is that the initial dose primes the immune system to look for the virus while follow-up doses tell the immune system the virus is an ongoing threat, so it needs to continue to be ready to fight it off. If the gap between doses is too short, it won't register as a separate instance to the immune system. If the gap is too long, the immune system will have entirely forgotten about the first instance. A third dose, especially if the initial dose spacing was short, is a signal to the immune system to keep on the lookout for the virus in the long term.

What I've personally wondered about is how appropriate that metric is when dealing with much smaller fatality numbers (eg especially back when we were in the 10's and 20's) and yet a relatively high case load. With high death numbers it's barely noise, but when in very low figures it becomes much more significant.

Say for example at any given time during a wave 1.5% of your population has Covid (I believe a figure from the UK last month was one in 75 people currently infected for example). If you go on the basis that the UK has circa 1500 deaths per day for all reasons, then it stands to reason that 22 of those daily deaths would have tested positive on any given day just by law of averages (ignoring infections by demographic for simplicity) even if COVID had nothing to do with their passing.... extend that time period out to 28 days (ie percentage of the population that either has, or has had COVID in the last 28) and it captures a proportionally larger percentage too.

As I say when dealing with higher death figures it makes sense as it is easy, fast and hopefully reduces the chance of undercounting. As we transition to an expected much lower death rate from the disease though would it not be logical to shift towards a cause based death metric? For example if we started counting deaths within 28 days of a positive rhinovirus test, we would inevitably conclude that many, many people were dying from common colds every winter.",,,,1628635898,{},h8guv3n,False,t3_p1pjm3,False,True,t1_h8fwkfs,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p1pjm3/bbc_news_more_than_75_of_uk_adults_now/h8guv3n/,1628716568.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm pointing to an evolutionary mechanism that's pretty well understood. When we think about selective pressure you have to account for time and number of events. There will be mutations that will occur in the wild among counties where the vaccine rate is super low because it's not deployed there. Each infection is an opportunity for mutation. Absolutely. 

Where the US is different, is that we have a very heterogenous population of vaxxed and unvaxxed. Most countries are either mostly vaxxed or not vaxxed at all. This mix of vaxxed/unvax creates new selective pressure gates. There's little pressure for Delta to evolve past is current r0 as it is extremely effective at infecting. But it has millions of potential hosts that it is not infecting as effectively. When nature run out of places to go that's when the mutations that would otherwise not to take begin to get selected. 

For example we've had a bunch of variants like Eta, gamma, etc that didn't take hold because Delta was more effective in the unvaxxed population. If one of those had a mutation that maybe dropped the r0 down a lot (meaning it can't compete w Delta) but could breakthrough more easily than it goes through the gate and spreads. We don't have to worry about that kind of breakthrough variant in unvaxxed areas because it's not likely to mutate on its own because it's competing with Delta. But in the US it's a different story.

Nerves are the slowest healing cells in the body so part of it is just waiting on nerves to heal. But the part you can help is what you have to work on.

Once I got a diagnosis from the Mayo Clinic, one of the things they prescribed to me was physical therapy, but all of it was LAYING FLAT ON MY BACK. No joke! And honestly, it could be done at home now with youtube videos. But the theory is this: You can reprogram your body to work around your current deficits by taking being vertical/standing out of the equation. You can reteach your body how to properly respond to stimulus and stress and correct your overacting heart rate while not stressing it by being on your feet or even sitting upright.

I know it sounds bonkers and tedious but it did indeed work. Some of the things they had me do was laying flat back and moving this arm circling machine. Using tension bands in my hands while raising and lowering my legs. The physical therapist had never done anything like this before so we winged it together. If you look up on Youtube exercises for elderly, and also exercises while laying flat on the floor, you will see some of the things we did. I had PT 3 times a week so just doing these things for like, 60 min 3 times a week at home would be helpful IMO.

I began to notice that during physical therapy my body actually started acting normally, like, I could be standing and my heart rate would be 150. But if I laid flat/reclined and did the work, heart rate reacted normally to exercise. Started at 80, would work up to about 140, then would cool down.

After that success, we started shifting the exercises to upright ones and standing ones, and again my body took the ""normal"" reaction with it. After about 8 months, I was walking and running on a treadmill for 15 minutes no issues. 

Here are some things that have never gone away, but are managed: I still get those heart PVC flip flop skipped beats. I still feel dizzy randomly (but some of that I figured out was because the vagus nerve runs through the colon and GAS lol stimulates it), but I have found a low(er) carb diet REALLY helps minimize heart rate skips and random dizziness. Staying up on your electrolytes helps especially potassium!

I recall being on florinef for a few years and that did help when I had to stand for long periods of time, it helps you increase blood pressure with fluid retention. But it has been years since I needed it.

I still cannot take medicines that are like opiates or have side effects that lower blood pressure without, you know, having a fainting episode from lower blood pressure. And it's weird what can cause lower blood pressure, i was given metformin at one point for another unrelated issue and oh man, it seriously bottomed out my blood pressure. Vicodin did the same thing when I strained my back also made me faint from low blood pressure.

Did you pay attention to the part where that number comes from hospitalizaitons all the way back to January 1, when almost nobody was vaccinated?  My state was only doing 80+ year olds all January.  And you know what recent data says?    ""74% of people infected in Mass were fully vaccinated"".    You know why, because they're mostly vaccinated there now, so that 97% is going to steadily drop to pretty close to the vax/unvaxxed (60/40) number over time.  This is also why, cynically, CDC is not going to track ""breakout"" infection anymore if you don't go to the hospital, because they don't really want to know the answer - it doesn't serve the narrative.

This data will help assess the real-world efficacy of the vaccine and is becoming more important in today's clinical scenario, especially with the emergence of new variants and anecdotal reports of severe breakthrough infections. **Any resident of India who has received one or two doses of any vaccine against Covid-19 is eligible to participate.**

LONE TREE, Colo. (CBS4) ‚Äì Doctors say patients hospitalized because of COVID-19 range in age, medical history, and include both genders, but overwhelmingly have one trait in common: they are not vaccinated. As more people are admitted for severe illness from the virus, the average age has dropped concerning medical staff about the need to increase vaccinations.  
‚ÄúThe danger really is when the breathing becomes so difficult, they cannot breathe,‚Äù said Dr. Eric Lung, chief medical officer for Sky Ridge Medical Center.  
Lung says they‚Äôre seeing an increase in patients over the past week and some have come from other states. Of the 15 patients noted on Tuesday, only one had the vaccine. Lung says in cases where someone is vaccinated, they could also have another underlying medical condition. The age in patients has moved to the 30s and 40s for adults from the 60s.  
‚ÄúThe question is posed to the doctors, ‚ÄòIs there anything that we could have done?‚Äô and the response is your loved one could have received the vaccine,‚Äù he told CBS4 on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of anger and denial from the families about that.‚Äù  
These patients may go onto need a ventilator or move to the ICU. The situation is similar at UCHealth where the number of hospitalized cases is 149, across 13 hospitals. That is an increase from around 80 patients earlier in the year. Their average age is 43 and predominantly the patients are unvaccinated, as much as 95%.  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs affecting everyone across all sorts of different levels of education, religion, etc.,‚Äù said Dr. Michelle Barron, the senior medical director of infection prevention and control at UCHealth. ‚ÄúThere is no one who is potentially being spared.‚Äù  
Baron says those who are unvaccinated had concerns, they were unsure it was safe or got misinformation. She says deaths are not just among the old but even younger adults, cases are across the state as well. Those hospitalized are averaging five days in care, visitations can be limited depending on the location.  
‚ÄúPeople are still dying from this disease every single day. Every single day we could prevent this potentially if you get a vaccine,‚Äù she told CBS4 on Tuesday. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a wakeup call, they think, ‚ÄòOh my gosh, that could be me.'‚Äù  
Her staff tell her there is an understanding of the danger but only after it is too late. She says family and friends have learned from the impact of the virus on their loved ones, choosing to get the vaccine.  
‚Äú‚ÄòCan I get the vaccine now?‚Äô and the answer is obviously, ‚ÄòNo‚Äô unfortunately,‚Äù she shared some patients have asked. ‚ÄúIt infiltrates through that group, where they‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòOkay, I was wrong, please go get your vaccine. Don‚Äôt get sick like I‚Äôm sick now.‚Äù  
Doctors worry that people do not understand how concerning it should be to need medical care at their institutions. They also say the spread that comes with unvaccinated populations helps the virus mutate and prolong the pandemic, potentially sending the healthcare system back toward the scenario it saw last year.

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

&gt;If I have already had COVID-19 and recovered, do I still need to get vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine?

&gt;Yes, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19. That‚Äôs because experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. Even if you have already recovered from COVID-19, it is possible‚Äîalthough rare‚Äîthat you could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 again. Studies have shown that vaccination provides a strong boost in protection in people who have recovered from COVID-19. Learn more about why getting vaccinated is a safer way to build protection than getting infected.

And even more recently:

https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0806-vaccination-protection.html

&gt;In today‚Äôs MMWR, a study of COVID-19 infections in Kentucky among people who were previously infected with SAR-CoV-2 shows that unvaccinated individuals are more than twice as likely to be reinfected with COVID-19 than those who were fully vaccinated after initially contracting the virus. These data further indicate that COVID-19 vaccines offer better protection than natural immunity alone and that vaccines, even after prior infection, help prevent reinfections.

&gt;‚ÄúIf you have had COVID-19 before, please still get vaccinated,‚Äù said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. ‚ÄúThis study shows you are twice as likely to get infected again if you are unvaccinated. Getting the vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and others around you, especially as the more contagious Delta variant spreads around the country.‚Äù",,,,1628649148,{},h8hluuz,False,t3_p202if,False,True,t1_h8hjtnk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p202if/a_study_identified_more_than_50_possible_longterm/h8hluuz/,1628731012.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She still hangs with some  kids in person and also has her Roblox crew, but I can tell you with great certainty, she did better online that she probably would have done in school. It was a shorter time- as a teacher I can tell you, kids in my school get about 4 hours (maybe less) total of instruction in a school day. A lot of it is just lunch, busy work and while that is all important, it wasn‚Äôt worth the risk of sending her, even if the odds of her contracting anything and feeling it were minimal. I don‚Äôt want to be that statistic. 

In short- she got a lot of what she needed in the online setting, but lucked out with a teacher that embraced it. 

Their district is not offering remote without a doctors note, so we are either forced to send them or homeschool. I teach summer school at their district and I won‚Äôt send them because I‚Äôve worked there and they are not going to keep the kids safe. The superintendent sent out an email recently that spoke about all the mitigation they were doing for summer school which wasn‚Äôt happening. Even though it‚Äôs theatre, they aren‚Äôt cleaning every period like they say they are, which is impossible anyway and they definitely did not change the filters to Merv 13 or whatever they are. They also do not keep up with temp checks. If they aren‚Äôt doing the theatre correctly,   How are they doing the important stuff? Makes me worry, for real. I‚Äôm also wondering what it‚Äôs going to be like with a full school. Shit is sparse now. 

Either way, I decided to take a remote job teaching in another state. I will home school them in the morning, teach in mountain time and be exhausted until they can get vaccinated.

It's entirely expected that the case rate among children would be much loser than it is. 

 It's not, actually - a lot of children's diseases are much more infectious among kids, yet produce much worse cases in adults.

&gt;  In 2020 the WHO saw infection rates among children at about 8.5%, this jump to 15% is not comforting.

 WHO numbers are a bit suspect, because a number of countries ran testing campaigns that were focused on symptomatic cases, which underrepresented children. If I look at Ontario's numbers (which I trust, because Ontario never did anything stupid with testing), I'll see that over the course of the pandemic slightly under 20% of cases were in children:

Two (known) problems seem to combine in particular in this age group:

- the fact that the Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine (popular with some young people and generally primarily used in the 18-59 age group) requires only one shot, which is not easy for doctors to put into the registration software. Common practice seems to be to register it directly as the ""second"" shot (to highlight that the patient is fully vaccinated) and not register it as a first shot. That leads to an underreporting of first shots.

- The fact that company doctors (i. e. doctors directly employed by big companies like Porsche or Bosch for their workforce) are often not able to register their vaccinations in the same way as GPs (as they are not naturally linked to the same databases). A workaround for this problem exists, but it is estmated that only 50% of company doctors are using it. And as these doctors are only dealing with the working population, it is a problem that primarily affects the 18-59 age bracket.

Each of these problems on its own could, in theory, lead to an undercount of several million jabs. 

Some researchers are now saying that the percentage of 18- to 59-year-olds who have received at least one jab might be closer to 69% rather than 59%.

On my side of the world (EU), the rethoric is that the kid must have contracted COVID outside of the school setting.  A causal connection is seldomly considered, even when multiple such cases ""suspicously"" coincide in the same school class.

There's also very little reporting being done in public (nor privately to parents).  While individual schools may have not-so-ethical incentives to downplay any issues, the main driver for this is political.  We want to sustain the education of the our kids, our successors, and give them the chance to be successful in their lifes.

Personally I'm torn with this.  I understand the necessities of the young generation.  The goal is good.  But I think that our government does not address the risks in the best possible way.  The school system remains similarily resource-starved as pre-COVID.  Instead of paying to create a safer education environment, the general population simply ""pays"" by suffering more exposure and virus spread.  Available tax (or relief) money is mostly destined to short-term casualties such as small businesses, restauration and the touristic sector.  Their voices are louder and they can point to quantifyable existing damage.  Our politicians are short-sighted and listen to them.

Drink water because you need it to keep your blood pressure right. I would also recommend fasting salts, something kind of new on the market but basically it has electrolytes and keeps normal people who fast from fainting. If I feel like I am having PVC issues sometimes taking a couple tablets of fasting salts helps.

Caffeine, if you can tolerate it, can be helpful, as it triggers vasoconstriction and can help with blood pressure. Be careful if you have anxiety but try out staying caffeinated.

The primary mechanism of my dysautonomia ended up being POTS that always resulted in fainting. Early on I remember having the worst orthosatic headache and not being to stand even for going to the bathroom and showering without being totally exhausted from a high heart rate and feeling faint (every moment of every day) or fainting at least once a week.

And so many doctors dismissed me because I didn't show obvious cardiac problems. They told me it was in my head, it was anxiety etc. Meanwhile I genuinely feel like I am slowly dying with no one believing it because it doesn't show up in normal testing. The one thing that I did test positive for was a cardiac tilt test. I instantly fainted when they gave me the nitro. So that explained the mechanism of action (neurocardiogenic syncopy) but NOT the underlying cause of the orthostatic hypotension, which triggered tachycardia, which then triggered fainting. That ended up being speculated later by a better doctor as a post viral autoimmune response that somehow either damages or attacked either the vagus nerve or a part of the brain related to autonomic function.

If you assume nerve damage then you have an approach like I described above, that ignores the damaged part of your system and instead works around it with the functioning part of your nervous system. Retraining the body to respond to physical stimulus and stress in a normal way by removing the other stressors by laying flat.

I want to give you hope because, honestly, there is definitely reason to hope and not only that, there is direct evidence to hope. I went from spending a few years laying flat in bed, wanting to die, not being believed, feeling like a burden. Then having a few years where I was still exhausted sometimes and still faint sometimes but clearly getting better. Partly from retraining the body partly from nerve repair and healing.

But I have since hiked in deprived oxygen altitudes for miles, above 13,000 feet at Rocky Mountain National Park. I was able to train normally on hiking trails and worked up to long distance changes and climbs. Solo, so no one had to watch over me and I was not worried about my issues. I have traveled the world multiple times and flown and walked for miles each day in cities and just been in tears and awe about my own ability to do those things again. I have stood for hours to be on the front row of concerts in the heat and watched people around me faint, but not me!

The state was founded in January 1777, when delegates from 28 towns met and declared independence from the jurisdictions and land claims of the British colonies of Quebec, New Hampshire, and New York. The republic remained in existence for the next fourteen years, albeit without diplomatic recognition from any foreign power.""

""Because of objections from New York, which had conflicting property claims, the Continental Congress declined to recognize Vermont, then sometimes also known as the New Hampshire Grants. Vermont's overtures to join the Province of Quebec were accepted by the British, offering generous terms for the Republic's reunion. When the British surrendered at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781, however, American independence became apparent. Vermont, now bordered on three sides by American territory, ended negotiations with the British and instead negotiated terms to become part of the United States.""

Also, you might want to look at this news out of New Jersey, which show a significant increase in the percentage of SEVERE breakthrough cases. I guarantee you that is coming to a state near you:

&gt;In New Jersey, fully vaccinated people accounted for 18.5% of all new COVID cases in the period July 20 through the 26, Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday. More importantly: Those cases accounted for 3% of all new hospitalizations.  
Murphy pointed to the data Monday as evidence that vaccines work, but for many, the fact that even 3% of hospitalized COVID patients were already vaccinated is a worry -- and so is the direction in which the breakthrough cases are trending.  
That 3% representation of immunized people hospitalized with the virus in the period July 20 through July 26 is up substantially from the .004% representation in the period up to July 26. The 0.14% representation of new COVID cases within that group leaping to 18.5% also may raise questions about vaccine efficacy vs. delta.

[],,Adodie,,,[],,,,text,t2_156nvb,False,False,,"With increases in COVID transmissions in kids recently, I've seen lots of (extremely understandable) worry on this sub recently about COVID and kids. Frustratingly, lots of articles only say ""risks are low,"" but do little to actually spell out or quantify the risks.

I think it's really important for parents to have an idea of the risks COVID poses to children so they can make choices that are right for their family, so I've been doing some research recently to give a better idea of ""how much risk does COVID pose, exactly?"". I am not an expert -- so I welcome any comments -- but thought this may be helpful as parents navigate this worrisome time. (sorry, too, if you've seen this before -- I've reposted this on threads that talk about kids and COVID because I think it's so important to have some idea of the risks, and feel that lots of articles posted on here don't really do the topic justice):

**Mortality Risks:** Obviously, there's an extremely fine line to walk here: every death of a child is horrendously tragic, and I cannot imagine being the parent of a child who has died or been hospitalized. The good news for parents, however, is that mortality risks still remain low. [Out of 74,000,000 kids in the U.S., 519 have died of COVID since the crisis began](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/well/family/back-to-school-covid.html) (as of July 28). This works out to a mortality rate of 0.0007%, or 0.015% amongst those who had had confirmed cases of COVID. (To put it in context, [overall mortality rates have been lower than childhood mortality from auto accidents](https://www.cdc.gov/transportationsafety/child_passenger_safety/cps-factsheet.html#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20motor,more%20than%2097%2C000%20were%20injured)). Again, this is immensely tragic -- simply put, no child should die -- but if I were a parent, I'd probably be more worried about the prospects for long-term COVID symptoms (discussed below).

**Risks of Delta:** Delta is new, so there is still much we do not know. However, data from the U.K (where Delta has hit for some time now) gives us some clues. Let's start with the good news: [based on data from the U.K., kids remain the least impacted age group by a long shot](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/hospitals#hospital-admissions-by-age). Despite  not having access to vaccines, kids age 5-14 still have had by far the lowest hospitalization rates of any demographic (this past week, it's been 1.08/100,000; kids age 0-4 have had noticeably higher rates -- 3.12/100k -- though still lower than any other age group). Similarly, the chance a child would be hospitalized if they had a confirmed case of COVID was similar to prior waves, and maybe even a little bit lower.T

he bad news? Well, more kids are going to get Delta on account of it being more transmissible, particularly in areas where schools aren't taking any precautions. The fact we're already seeing big increases for hospitalizations amongst kids is bad, to say the least, and its important to note this is already occurring with no indications cases nationally are peaking 

**Risks of Long COVID/The Disease Course More Generally:** We still have lots to learn about long COVID, and Delta is new enough that current studies don't really address it. For COVID more generally, however, the earliest studies suggested frighteningly high rates of long-lasting symptoms (one even pegged it at a third!). But these suffered from immense methodological weaknesses, such as low sample sizes, parental-reported symptoms, probable selection bias, and no control groups.

More recent research (which isn't perfect and still includes many of the above weaknesses, but is at least somewhat better) has suggested much lower rates than the first studies, albeit the risks are real. A sampling of some of the more recent work include:

* [In a self-reported survey in the UK, over 95% of infected kids had no symptoms lasting longer than four weeks](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext), [and 98% had no symptoms more than 56 days](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext) (if I'm understanding the study correctly, it only analyzed kids with symptomatic COVID, so there would be lower rates for all infections).
* [In a survey from the UK of people who had COVID, an estimated 7.4% of children aged 2-11 reported any symptoms 12 weeks after infection](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/prevalenceofongoingsymptomsfollowingcoronaviruscovid19infectionintheuk/1april2021) (this study included a control group, albeit it was only matched for age/gender)
* [In one study with a control group, researchers found that kids infected with COVID in Zurich actually were no more likely to report symptoms of long-COVID than kids who were not infected.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01935-7)  To be clear: this study does not imply that long-Covid does not occur. However, if true, it suggests the actual prevalence of long-COVID in kids is likely quite low. (This is definitely the most encouraging study I found).

So, what's the average course of the illness in most children (again, with the caveat that most research is pre-Delta)? First off, it seems that \~50% of children will be totally asymptomatic. The Lancet study (first bullet point) cites a source suggesting between 43-68% of cases are asymptomatic. Of those with symptoms, the one study found the median symptom duration is 6 days, with the most common symptoms being headache and fatigue.

Three final notes:

First, we need to be careful when discussing long-COVID and differentiate between symptoms that are unfortunate but manageable (and resolve over time), and symptoms which are debilitating. Unfortunately, to my understanding, current research has not really addressed this adequately. One problem I have with lots of the discussion on long-COVID on this sub is that folks will often take the reported percentage with any symptoms at the endpoint of the study and say, ""Woah, \[X\]% have permanent disability!"" ... when that's not really what the study says. In the Lancet study at least (first bullet point), the most common symptoms that lasted in the children who had lasting symptoms were 1) fatigue, 2) loss of smell, and 3) (to a lesser degree) headaches. This doesn't really resolve the question -- depending on the levels of fatigue, for example, it certainly can be debilitating -- but I think this is something we really shouldn't lose sight of when discussing long-COVID.

Second: I've seen concerns on here about organ damage and the like. I haven't really seen great studies focusing on this on children (I very well may have missed some, so do not take this as gospel). Moreover, in the studies I've run across on adults, there's lots of jargon and it's not always clear what the medical implications of certain findings are. Thus, I haven't really focused on it here -- not because it might not exist, but because it's above my expertise and I really do not want to misinterpret findings.

Third, risks -- even quantified -- are hard to interpret, and people will probably have different reactions to the same numbers. Let's say the Lancet study (showing 1.8% of children with symptomatic COVID have any symptoms lasting &gt;56 days) is correct. On the one hand -- if your child catches COVID -- this means he/she is extremely unlikely to have any symptoms that last that long. One the other hand -- this still means lots of kids in raw numbers will have symptoms that last a long time.

**Takeaways:** Building off of this last point: people will look at the above data and likely come to different conclusions. For me, I look at it and feel somewhat reassured -- it's not at all that there's zero risk (there's definitely not) and the death of any child from COVID is an absolute tragedy, but the data speaks to somewhat lower risks than the impression I'd likely get if I spent my whole day on this sub. But then again, I'm also not a parent. Others may look at the data (particularly the long-COVID studies) and still very reasonably feel worried.

**In any event -- and I know I'm preaching to the choir here -- the most important thing you can do to protect the kids around you is get vaccinated. And if you happen to be a parent with a children age 12 or over who's on the fence, please get them vaccinated, too. It'll protect your child from a truly nasty disease and help lower the risk for those around your child, too.**",,,,1628701054,{},h8jye9y,False,t3_p2e5mu,False,True,t3_p2e5mu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p2e5mu/nearly_94000_kids_got_covid19_last_week_they_were/h8jye9y/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,f378f903eef31251a01f4216d60c71337013d7c3,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1628701066.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,,

That would be an immune response.  ""Attacking"" is a laymen's term for the body producing an immune response.

Yes, they train your body on what a specific piece of the virus looks like (in this case, the spike protein).  This isn't a new thing.  Other vaccines in the past have only contained parts of the virus.

&gt;It's why you'll hear the anti vaxxers claim it's not a vaccine at all, which technically by definition it is not **because it does not create an immune response from the body**

By the (Webster) definition of vaccine in November of 2019, they are correct, but the bolded part is not the reason why.  It's because our definition of vaccine was antiquated.  Here's the current definition:

&gt;a substance used to stimulate the production of antibodies and provide immunity against one or several diseases, prepared from the causative agent of a disease, its products, **or a synthetic substitute,** treated to act as an antigen without inducing the disease.
