A higher rate of infection than medical polypropylene masks in a health care setting.  Not a higher rate of infection than no mask at all.  It does not then follow that cloth masks shouldn't be used at all.  Not everyone has $60 up front to order disposable masks in bulk, and multiple studies have concluded that cloth masks are definitely better than nothing at all.

I think masking can be done away with after:

After that, sure, remove the masking. At that point, anyone not vaccinated is by choice with the exception of children and, unfortunately, that‚Äôs going to be the case no matter what. 

Masking will become a choice of personal protection, which I‚Äôm good with. For example, we‚Äôll go back to wearing them if the area becomes a hotspot.

So then why did they spend so long not being frank about that? Why did they bumble vaccine procurement (whilst spinning bullshit about how it was actually a virtuous act because ""other places need it more)? How on Earth did they not have health departments, and all other sectors of society, properly informed on a long term end-goal so that they could have spent the time they avoided covid preparing properly, rather than now having to do it in a panicked rush once an outbreak had already begun?

A government that plans based on optimistic hopes that they'll just continue to avoid an outbreak seems naive to me tbh. Just days before this outbreak began she was pushing a fantasy that NZ would maintain elimination whilst ""reconnecting with the world"". Of course even that chat had next to no detail or parameters.

I'm thankful that NZ has been covid free for long periods the rest of the world hasn't been. My parents are there and many of my most dear friends and loved ones.

We have investigated a nosocomial COVID-19 outbreak involving the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant among a highly vaccinated population. The attack rate among exposed individuals reached 23.3% in patients and 10.3% in staff, with 96.2% vaccination rate among exposed individuals. Moreover, several transmissions probably occurred between two individuals both wearing surgical masks, and in one instance using full PPE, including N-95 mask, face shield, gown and gloves.  
  
In a recent publication by Bernal et al., the effectiveness of full vaccination with the Comirnaty vaccine against the Delta variant was high, although lower than against the Alpha variant (88% vs 93.7%) \[9\]. This was not the experience in Israel, with a rapid increase in cases since June 2021 despite a high vaccination rate \[1\].  
  
Although reports of breakthrough infections are increasing \[10-12\], this communication emphasises several points. It challenges the assumption that high universal vaccination rates will lead to herd immunity and prevent COVID-19 outbreaks. This was probably true for the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus, but in the outbreak described here, 96.2% of the exposed population was vaccinated. Infection advanced rapidly (many cases became symptomatic within 2 days of exposure), and viral load was high. Another accepted view is that, when facing a possible mismatch between the SARS-CoV-2 variant and vaccine or waning immunity, the combination of vaccine and face mask should provide the necessary protection. Although some transmission between staff members could have occurred without masks, all transmissions between patients and staff occurred between masked and vaccinated individuals, as experienced in an outbreak from Finland \[12\]. We cannot rule out that protection measures were not optimally implemented, however, transmissibility in summer 2021 differs from our experiences in the previous 18 months. Whether this can be attributed to the low Cq and high transmissibility of the Delta variant is not clear. Of note, in our cases, in particular case patients, the time from vaccination was considerable. The shortest interval was 142 days (5 months), and many of our case patients advanced to severe disease. Data from Israel imply that the main reason for the increase in COVID-19 cases in summer is indeed waning immunity, and a third vaccine dose, 5 months after the second dose will possibly result in trend reversal \[13,14\].  
  
   
Conclusion

This nosocomial outbreak exemplifies the high transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant among twice vaccinated and masked individuals. This suggests some waning of immunity, albeit still providing protection for individuals without comorbidities. However, a third vaccine dose may be needed, particularly in individuals with risk factors for severe COVID-19. Appropriate use of masks, especially in high-risk settings is advised.",,,,1633357026,{},hfcpp2d,True,t3_q16aes,False,False,t3_q16aes,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q16aes/eurosurveillance_nosocomial_outbreak_caused_by/hfcpp2d/,1633473968.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,danysdragons,,,[],,,,text,t2_36453,False,False,[],"One thing that‚Äôs interesting is that even though RNA viruses do mutate at a high rate, coronaviruses are unusual in that their RNA copying has a proof-reading mechanism, which makes them more resistant to mutations than other RNA viruses. That lower mutation rate is one reason why we were caught off guard by all those variants emerging. If you let the virus roll the dice hundreds of millions of times...

This proof-reading mechanism is one reason why other antiviral drugs that work by inducing mutations, e.g. Ribavirin, haven‚Äôt been very successful against Covid. The (very) good news is that Molnupiravir seems to work in a way that bypasses this proof-reading mechanism. More good news is that the drug doesn't seem very vulnerable to viruses developing resistance to it.

If you want a detailed description of how the drug works, there's a nice (very technical) article: [Molnupiravir: coding for catastrophe](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-021-00657-8), excerpts below:

&gt;Two recently published studies reveal the biochemical and structural bases of how molnupiravir disrupts the fidelity of SARS-CoV-2 genome replication and prevents viral propagation by fostering error accumulation in a process referred to as 'error catastrophe'.   
&gt;  
&gt;...   
&gt;  
&gt;Treatment with molnupiravir failed to induce viral-resistance mutations, which suggests a high genetic barrier to immune evasion. Notably, in contrast to the antiviral nucleoside analogs fluorouracil (5-FU) and ribavarin, molnupiravir is resistant to the proofreading exoribonuclease encoded by coronaviruses, which makes it an attractive target for further development. Thus, understanding the molecular basis of inhibition of molnupiravir reveals the lethal mutagenesis mechanism that will aid the informed design of related inhibitor",,,,1633356542,{},hfcon2l,False,t3_q0mat2,False,True,t1_hfcedu4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q0mat2/fauci_says_americans_should_get_vaccinated_even/hfcon2l/,1633473370.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The variant that left Wuhan was worse than the original Wuhan one. Then Alpha was worse again and now Delta is worse than Alpha. They not only infect easier but also cause more serious symptoms.

Now the failed vaccination campaign puts the virus under a huge evolutionary pressure to circumvent immunity. We should not have mixed the vaccinated open society with huge infection numbers. It begs for a tragedy.

In UK report the specialists say that there's even a realistic possibility that the virus will mutate towards MERS like lethality rates. It would mean 10-30% lethality rate. Do we really want to give it even a 1% chance of mutating that way?

Contraty to the popular disinfo that ""viruses never mutate more lethal"", there actually are famous cases of it like Ebola and West Nile.

From the link:

&gt; I believe just the way the CDC has recommended that when you are in a situation where you have a dynamic of virus in the community, where there's clearly a lot of spread, even if you are vaccinated and you are in an indoor setting, a congregate setting, it just makes sense to wear a mask and to avoid high risk situations. And what we should be doing is look at ventilation in indoor places. We know now that this is clearly spread by aerosol, and when you have something spread by aerosol, you absolutely want more ventilation, which is the reason why outdoors is always much safer than indoors. And if you are indoors, ventilation is going to be key. And that's the reason why we really should be paying attention to that.

&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN: But we can gather for Christmas, or it's just too soon to tell.

&gt; DR. FAUCI: You know, MARGARET, it's just too soon to tell. We've just got to concentrating on continuing to get those numbers down and not try to jump ahead by weeks or months and say what we're going to do at a particular time. Let's focus like a laser on continuing to get those- those cases down. And we can do it by people getting vaccinated and also in the situation where boosters are appropriate to get people boosted because we know that they can help greatly in diminishing infection and diminishing advanced disease, the kinds of data that are now accumulating in real time.",,,,1633375080,{},hfdzfxg,False,t3_q14miq,False,True,t1_hfdyuce,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q14miq/fauci_says_its_too_soon_to_tell_whether_americans/hfdzfxg/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,fbe0b3ee5f6f9276cb2e0d060354bc96f1e84548,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1633375098.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

&gt; Literally nobody said anything against Christmas, not even Fauci.

So you‚Äôre saying he said nothing against holiday traveling or seeing family? 

Especially if you‚Äôre fully vaxed?

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-dr-anthony-fauci-on-face-the-nation-october-3-2021/

&gt; DR FAUCI: I believe just the way the CDC has recommended that when you are in a situation where you have a dynamic of virus in the community, where there's clearly a lot of spread, even if you are vaccinated and you are in an indoor setting, a congregate setting, it just makes sense to wear a mask and to avoid high risk situations. And what we should be doing is look at ventilation in indoor places. We know now that this is clearly spread by aerosol, and when you have something spread by aerosol, you absolutely want more ventilation, which is the reason why outdoors is always much safer than indoors. And if you are indoors, ventilation is going to be key. And that's the reason why we really should be paying attention to that.

&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN: But we can gather for Christmas, or it's just too soon to tell.

&gt; DR. FAUCI: You know, MARGARET, it's just too soon to tell. We've just got to concentrating on continuing to get those numbers down and not try to jump ahead by weeks or months and say what we're going to do at a particular time. Let's focus like a laser on continuing to get those- those cases down. And we can do it by people getting vaccinated and also in the situation where boosters are appropriate to get people boosted because we know that they can help greatly in diminishing infection and diminishing advanced disease, the kinds of data that are now accumulating in real time.",,,,1633374493,{},hfdxvfi,False,t3_q14miq,False,True,t1_hfdvm8p,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q14miq/fauci_says_its_too_soon_to_tell_whether_americans/hfdxvfi/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,a448cd7c86d5feb0416886f2632deea080ad4f23,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1633374505.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Facebook wasn't the first social media platform of its kind. It's not even the only major social media platform of its kind today: both China and Russia have competing platforms that I know of. I wouldn't be surprised to learn of others.

Facebook's predecessor's didn't have the problems Facebook has. I don't know of any information indicating that any contemporary competitors have anywhere near the scale of issues that Facebook has either, but I'm very open to being educated there.

Even different kinds of social media platforms, like Reddit, Youtube, or Twitter, do not face anywhere near the scale of problems that Facebook has. That's even though they do share in the base problems: they all just address those problems far better and base their business model in part around preventing those problems from festering. Facebook does the opposite and has built their business around causing and expanding those problems.

[],,sushomeru,,,[],,,,text,t2_7ilbe,False,False,[],"&gt; The thread above OP was a scare comment about how open schools will lead to a wave of new infections, a wave which hasn‚Äôt materialize and in all likelihood will not

You obviously didn‚Äôt keep up with what happened when Texas opened up their schools. The fact is there are places that don‚Äôt (and by government order cannot) require masks, actively fight vaccine mandates, and spread misinformation like wildfire.

Texas was and still somewhat is a shit storm for Delta variant. And that‚Äôs the problem. We sound like we‚Äôre fear mongering only because literally some parts of the world won‚Äôt take basic precautions. And when zero precautions are taken that‚Äôs when a virus will spread.

In places that are masking and cleaning, they‚Äôre fine to attend school most likely. Studies support that. UNICEF, CDC, and many others say that‚Äôs fine. When you follow proper safety guidelines the risk for transmission and exposure is minimal. The fact is though, almost nowhere is following the guidelines perfectly. So that begs the question: what is the threshold for these imperfect guidelines? What is minimum viability for safety? That‚Äôs what isn‚Äôt being studied or at least that‚Äôs what isn‚Äôt popular knowledge if it is being studied. And that‚Äôs where the danger comes in when trying to fight this virus and that‚Äôs where statements like yours are *very* dangerous.

People will read your statements with *their* situation in mind and become lackadaisical about *their* situation‚Äôs safety guidelines. So if their situation was enforcing masks at a 95% success rates, they may see a 90% success rate as acceptable now, but contrast that with the district that never or can‚Äôt mask and simply washed hands every time they entered the classroom, now maybe they start washing hands every other time? Or not at all now because it‚Äôs ‚Äúrare‚Äù and washing hands takes too much time. 

While these admittedly are very poor examples, I do hope they help illustrate the dangers in telling people ‚Äúhey, this is a very rare thing.‚Äù Because there‚Äôs three things at play here: 1) humans are nutritiously bad at understanding small probabilities, 2) you only have to catch COVID once for it to really mess you up and/or kill you, 3) hospital beds and medical personnel are being taken up by adults and teens that refuse to get vaccinated.",,,,1633334628,{},hfbtn0l,False,t3_q0vqim,False,False,t1_hfbkr5f,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q0vqim/he_was_a_loving_little_boy_mother_wants_her/hfbtn0l/,1633456594.0,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, Influenza cases where indeed almost non-existent last winter in comparison to other winters.

Complicating factor is that what goes in to the 'flu shot' is partly selected based on which flu variants where the most dominant... last winter... you see the problem there - the flu shot may not be as effective this year as it was in other years.  
  
Nobody cheers on more deaths of course. But we could see even more flu deaths averaged over the two winters, last and coming, because of this basically *postponed* flu wave.

&gt;After declining for months, largely because of the federal effort to vaccinate residents, the number of deaths rose sharply from July to August. Nursing homes reported nearly 1,800 deaths among their residents and staff in August, which represented the highest monthly toll since February.

&gt;The findings underscore the ongoing vulnerability of nursing home residents, who are old and in poor health, and highlight the importance of getting booster shots to people in this population. The rising number of infections could fuel more calls to vaccinate nursing home workers ahead of the federal requirement announced in August by President Biden.

&gt;‚ÄùWhile the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths happened outside of nursing homes in July and August, the high rate of increase within nursing homes indicates that residents and staff in these settings are at risk of death during the Delta surge,‚Äù the researchers said. The study, published Friday, did not break out how many of the dead were unvaccinated.

&gt;August saw a much steeper increase in deaths in nursing homes than in the community at large, said Priya Chidambaram, a senior policy analyst for the foundation and one of the study‚Äôs authors. ‚ÄúVaccinations are very strongly protecting people in these facilities, but the Delta variant did have an impact,‚Äù she said.

&gt;Preliminary data from September may indicate deaths are falling again, she said.

&gt;Nursing homes were especially hard hit early on in the pandemic, accounting for nearly a third of the country‚Äôs overall deaths through the end of June, according to the Kaiser analysis. But the vaccination of residents brought the monthly number of deaths down from a high of around 22,000 in December and January to around 300 for June and July.

&gt;Although cases did increase, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre still nowhere near our peak in December 2020, nor at any point last year, thanks to safe and effective vaccines as well as providers‚Äô ongoing vaccination efforts and infection control measures,‚Äù the American Health Care Association, a major nursing home trade group, said in a statement.

&gt;The association said infections were largely the result of a high number of cases in the surrounding community. The very small number of cases occurring ‚Äúare largely happening in communities where there is high spread and low vaccination rates among the general population,‚Äù the group said.

&gt;But the group added that it was encouraged by the recent rollout of booster shots for the Pfizer vaccine and said it was eager to follow any developments regarding the other vaccines.

&gt;While the vaccination rate among residents is now approaching 85 percent, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, only about 65 percent of nursing home employees are vaccinated, roughly the same percentage as American adults overall.

&gt;‚ÄùThe rate of increase among staff is slower than among residents,‚Äù Ms. Chidambaram said.",,,,1633308575,{},hfano65,True,t3_q0us2w,False,True,t3_q0us2w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q0us2w/the_delta_variant_caused_a_spike_in_deaths_among/hfano65/,1633437608.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notwithstanding the need to ensure that hospitals can adequately deal with the infected  (the real reason we seek to limit the spread of COVID), **is there anything more or less transmissable/infectious between a vaxxed person with the virus and unvaxxed person with the virus?** 

What I am getting at here is, does it \[functionally\] make any difference to the overall potential for tranmission if people are vaccinated or not? **As I understand it, whether vaxxed or not, unvaccinated and vaccinated can equally carry it, transmit it and aquire it.** Is that correct?

Consider two examples:

1. An office of 200 people - 5 people have COVID, 20% are vaccinated
2. An office of 200 people  - 5 people have COVID, 90% are vaccinated

In both cases, as I understand it, a certain number, say 50 will contract it. The only difference between the two scenarios will be the average severity (much higher for #1 than #2).

&gt;After pioneering booster shots for everyone 12 and older, Israel is believed to be the first country to condition the validity of vaccination passports on having received a booster.

&gt;The country said it would soon cancel the vaccination passports of more than a million people, mainly those who are eligible for, but have not yet received, a third vaccination shot.

&gt;To be considered fully vaccinated in Israel people must meet one of the following criteria: be 12 or older and have received a booster shot at least a week ago; be within six months of having received a second vaccination shot; or be within six months of having tested positive for Covid-19.

&gt;The booster shots are Pfizer vaccinations, by far the most commonly administered in Israel.

&gt;In Israel, a Green Pass ‚Äî a digital or paper vaccination certificate ‚Äî is required for entry to public spaces, including restaurants, hotels, clubs, cultural venues and large private gatherings. Unvaccinated people can only gain entry with a proof of a negative rapid test carried out at an authorized test station, which is valid for 24 hours, or a negative PCR test valid for 72 hours.

&gt;The change in policy came after Israeli health officials and experts identified a significant waning of immunity in people five or six months after their second Pfizer dose and after studies indicated the effectiveness of the booster shot in preventing severe disease as Israel battled a fourth wave brought on by the highly infectious Delta variant this summer.

&gt;There are signs that the fourth wave is being contained. The daily average of infections has dropped by about 54 percent over the last two weeks and the number of severe cases among the hospitalized is decreasing.

&gt;‚ÄùNow is the time to be strict about the Green Pass, be cautious and not become complacent,‚Äù Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of Israel said late Saturday. An early advocate of the third dose, Mr. Bennett said it saved lives and allowed the economy to remain open.

&gt;Israel initially led the world with its rapid vaccine rollout and, with a population of just over 9 million, is one of the most vaccinated societies. Since the government made boosters available in August, starting with older age groups, and quickly expanding to the younger ones, more than 3.4 million people have received a third dose. People who recovered from Covid-19 more than six months ago are now required to get at least one shot.

&gt;Demand for a third dose increased in recent days as the deadline for the validity of people‚Äôs vaccination passports approached. A rush of people trying to download a new Green Pass caused the Health Ministry‚Äôs phone application to crash temporarily on Sunday, so the ministry announced that expired Green Passes would remain valid for a few more days.",,,,1633308139,{},hfamsa7,True,t3_q0unyq,False,False,t3_q0unyq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q0unyq/israel_will_require_a_booster_shot_to_be/hfamsa7/,1633437208.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All y‚Äôall are just making everything more confusing by making up stuff; it isn‚Äôt helpful. 

&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN: Do people need to start looking around and saying it's just too risky to gather with family members if there are unvaccinated children?

&gt; DR. FAUCI: Well, MARGARET, I believe just the way the CDC has recommended that when you are in a situation where you have a dynamic of virus in the community, where there's clearly a lot of spread, even if you are vaccinated and you are in an indoor setting, a congregate setting, it just makes sense to wear a mask and to avoid high risk situations. And what we should be doing is look at ventilation in indoor places. We know now that this is clearly spread by aerosol, and when you have something spread by aerosol, you absolutely want more ventilation, which is the reason why outdoors is always much safer than indoors. And if you are indoors, ventilation is going to be key. And that's the reason why we really should be paying attention to that.

&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN: But we can gather for Christmas, or it's just too soon to tell.

&gt; DR. FAUCI: You know, MARGARET, it's just too soon to tell. We've just got to concentrating on continuing to get those numbers down and not try to jump ahead by weeks or months and say what we're going to do at a particular time. Let's focus like a laser on continuing to get those- those cases down. And we can do it by people getting vaccinated and also in the situation where boosters are appropriate to get people boosted because we know that they can help greatly in diminishing infection and diminishing advanced disease, the kinds of data that are now accumulating in real time.",,,,1633365094,{},hfd8pkt,False,t3_q14miq,False,False,t1_hfd18kk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q14miq/fauci_says_its_too_soon_to_tell_whether_americans/hfd8pkt/,1633485004.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here‚Äôs what he said, btw, for anybody who is actually interested: 

&gt; DR. FAUCI: So that's the one thing I want to make sure that our viewers realize that we've done well in the sense of getting 55% of the population fully vaccinated and 64% with at least one dose. But we've got to keep pushing on the vaccination front.

&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. You said, ""Don't let your guard down."" There are two new studies out that show COVID's gotten better at transmitting through aerosols, just through the air. What does that mean? We're going into cold weather. We're going into the holidays. Do people need to start looking around and saying it's just too risky to gather with family members if there are unvaccinated children?

&gt; DR. FAUCI: Well, MARGARET, I believe just the way the CDC has recommended that when you are in a situation where you have a dynamic of virus in the community, where there's clearly a lot of spread, even if you are vaccinated and you are in an indoor setting, a congregate setting, it just makes sense to wear a mask and to avoid high risk situations. And what we should be doing is look at ventilation in indoor places. We know now that this is clearly spread by aerosol, and when you have something spread by aerosol, you absolutely want more ventilation, which is the reason why outdoors is always much safer than indoors. And if you are indoors, ventilation is going to be key. And that's the reason why we really should be paying attention to that.

&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN: But we can gather for Christmas, or it's just too soon to tell.

&gt; DR. FAUCI: You know, MARGARET, it's just too soon to tell. We've just got to concentrating on continuing to get those numbers down and not try to jump ahead by weeks or months and say what we're going to do at a particular time. Let's focus like a laser on continuing to get those- those cases down. And we can do it by people getting vaccinated and also in the situation where boosters are appropriate to get people boosted because we know that they can help greatly in diminishing infection and diminishing advanced disease, the kinds of data that are now accumulating in real time.

Obtaining the appropriate schooling and certifications to do vaccine research is going to take a while.

https://www.historyofvaccines.org/index.php/content/articles/careers-vaccine-research

&gt;Basic research focuses on the biochemistry and physical properties that disease-causing microbes use to cause damage to the host. Such research also considers the biophysical characteristics of the microbes that might be used in vaccines or drugs to prevent or interrupt the disease process. This part of the vaccine development cycle is called basic or preclinical research.

&gt;Typically, a scientist with a doctorate degree in cellular and molecular biology, biochemistry, or microbiology leads these studies; however, a wide range of research functions are carried out by research assistants who might require only a BS degree in the same fields. In the case of vaccine development research, research associate jobs might involve growing cell lines in culture (a cell line is a clone or group of clones grown in a culture and derived from a single cell and which can proliferate indefinitely under strict lab conditions), cloning DNA, or performing assays (lab tests that look for, quantify, or measure some activity of proteins, viruses, and DNA). Basic research jobs might also offer opportunities to become an expert at operating specialized laboratory equipment such as flow cytometers that use lasers to evaluate cells.

&gt;All basic research requires a data analysis stage, which represents yet another field of expertise: data management and analysis. These are jobs that usually require a BS but not necessarily an advanced degree.

&gt;Most universities allow students to volunteer or be paid a small stipend to work in a lab‚Äîthis provides valuable training and is excellent experience for getting a job after graduation. These student jobs can range from technician assistant, in which the student may be required to prepare chemical stock solutions, wash, and sterilize glassware, and care for research animals, to senior technician, who maintains cell line stocks, tracks and breeds research animals, orders laboratory supplies, and may conduct experiments.

&gt;Once a vaccine looks like it is a serious candidate for therapeutic use, the project team moves it into the development phase, or scale-up development phase. In development, scientists, who have advanced degrees in manufacturing engineering, and their assistants work out the best methods for producing the vaccine on a large scale. Again, a PhD level scientist typically heads these experiments, but there are numerous jobs for individuals with BS degrees",,,,1633364220,{},hfd6g09,False,t3_q17jfy,False,True,t1_hfd3f04,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q17jfy/change_of_heart_for_selfdescribed_antivaxxer/hfd6g09/,1633483735.0,33,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;  
&gt; Is that correct?

That is incorrect, though it hasn't been clearly explained by a lot of the media, so it's understandable that you would have that misunderstanding. Vaccines do protect you from even an infection of COVID between 50-95% of the time. The actual statement is that given you have COVID, at the peak you are just as contagious unvaccinated or vaccinated.

The first thing to understand is that this is \*given that you have COVID\*. Vaccinated people are several times less likely to get infected, and as such several times less likely to spread it. As such, your example would be unlikely as the second office would probably have fewer people with COVID in it. 5 in each is still possible, but it's already a scenario where the vaccine has not performed as well as it does on average.

The second thing to understand is that even in your example, the second office will have far fewer people contract COVID. Even if those 5 people spread COVID equally, then the second office will have much more protection against contracting COVID from the 5 infected people.

The one caveat is that the vaccines do seem to be losing protection against infection over time, while the protection against hospitalization and death is more stable, which is why boosters are so important. This is likely because the body has two different defense mechanisms: antibodies, which are shorter term but faster and more responsible for protection against cases and spread, and B and T cells, which are longer term but slower and more responsible for protection against hospitalization and death.

The third thing to understand is that even if you have COVID, being vaccinated might still mean you are less likely to spread it. This is because while the peak amount of virus appears to be the same, its quite possible that you're at your peak for a shorter time. I don't have as good an understanding an effect of this though, I think its still being researched.

However, the overall thing to realize is that even if the vaccine protects against infection only 50% of the time, that's 50% less chance of both someone catching COVID and someone spreading it to someone vaccinated. Eventually at high enough levels of vaccination this creates what is called herd immunity, where even though a breakthrough happens every now and then, that breakthrough won't be able to lead to an explosion of cases but will stay isolated with a few people. Unfortunately, the CDC and FDA have decided that cases and spread don't matter and are as such responsible for causing significant confusion around the massive benefits of vaccines relating to reduction in cases and spread that indirectly translate to reductions in hospitalizations and deaths.",,,,1633325275,{},hfbians,False,t3_q0cnlt,False,False,t1_hfan299,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q0cnlt/daily_discussion_thread_october_03_2021/hfbians/,1633451165.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; **What are the implications for public health practice?**
&gt; 
&gt; Mask requirements for teachers and staff members and improved ventilation are important strategies in addition to vaccination of teachers and staff members that elementary schools could implement as part of a multicomponent approach to provide safer, in-person learning environments.

The validity of masks was never put into question by the study. If anything, all the study showed was that improved ventilation is incredibly useful.

Additionally, the article has this very confusing paragraph:

&gt; ‚ÄúA year ago, I said, ‚ÄòMasks are not the end of the world; why not just wear a mask?‚Äô‚Äù Elissa Schechter-Perkins, the director of Emergency Medicine Infectious Disease Management at Boston Medical Center, told me. ‚ÄúBut the world has changed, there are real downsides to masking children for this long, with no known end date, and without any clear upside.‚Äù She continued, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not aware of any studies that show conclusively that kids wearing masks in schools has any effect on their own morbidity or mortality or on the hospitalization or death rate in the community around them.‚Äù

This individual asks for evidence for masks, but yet doesn‚Äôt quote any evidence of the detrimental effects of masking kids for this long? I‚Äôve not heard of any negative effects of masking.

With that said, there is no world in which people will avoid gathering over the holidays. The ones who did celebrate in person last year, without vaccines, absolutely will again this year. Those who skipped last year's, and are likely to be vaccinated this time, will not miss a second one.  


The only realistic solution, if Delta is still an issue with breakthrough cases, is to offer boosters for the general population in November (about 6 months out from when most people started getting their shots, and where effectiveness may start seeing some reduction), so we can keep as many reasonable people out of hospitals as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Wow! You mean to tell me that after a year of encouraging mask use and other protocols to limit the spread of an infectious flu-like disease, there are far fewer cases of the flu?! It's almost like most pandemic protocols we've used were designed in response to a deadly flu pandemic or something! 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, by your logic literally zero people have died of HIV/AIDS ever since that virus alone hasn't killed a single person... Instead, opportunistic infections and conditions caused by that virus kill those people... Or, also by your logic, ""***I*** didn't kill that person! They died of blood loss from the effects of the bullet that happened to be fired from my gun, that's not my fault!""

Very few people die of just having the flu, or any other virus for that matter. They die of the effects that the virus has on the body, in the case of Influenza, by multiple organ failure caused by cytokine storm where your immune system overreacts to an infection, or ARDS caused by your lungs filling up with fluid again due to the immune response to that infection.

&amp;#x200B;

Pneumonia isn't a stand-alone virus or pathogen derived illness.. It's a condition where your lungs fill up with fluid that is ***caused*** by several dozen viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, and even environmental pollutants. Covid and Influenza are just two of the common causes of Pneumonia, which is why when someone who has either Covid or Influenza dies of Pneumonia, they are listed as dying of that virus.

&amp;#x200B;

This being said, several months ago I listened to a podcast which featured a prominent, experienced British doctor - a veteran of the healthcare scene (I forget the name).  He made an observation that has stuck with me since and it's as follows.  Our hospitals - at least in the West - have been built to be one-stop-shops for all manner of ailments and conditions.  Which is why they have been breeding grounds for Covid as the virus is circulated throughout hospitals via their HVAC systems.  With hindsight, he said, we'd have been better off treating Covid patients in large, heated, medically-equipped tents away from hospital locations proper.  i.e. segregate confirmed Covid cases in dedicated, equipped, ventilated tents so that hospitals can continue as normal and those sick from Covid receive the care they need and minimizing the risk of infecting others.

Treating patients in tents away from hospitals carries with it bad optics from a political angle - and it does look very third world - but it may well be the best approach when dealing with a largely unvaxxed population such as that of NZ's.",,,,1633381423,{},hfegvpu,False,t3_q0ynv5,False,False,t1_hfeb2xd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q0ynv5/new_zealand_drops_its_covid19_elimination_plan_as/hfegvpu/,1633509467.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pretty much every state went into snap lockdowns when a case or two appeared and snuffed out the emerging clusters. 

Then it appeared in New South Wales in Sydney who had the local state government who prided itself on being ""different"" and while the premier refused for weeks to even say the word lockdown and assured everyone if they did nothing it would be fine. It wasn't fine, got out of control inflections appeared all over the country from Sydney and into New Zealand as well. 

Melbourne is now dealing with a large outbreak after several clusters formed from people from Sydney. The NSW premier and deputy have just resigned after the premier is being investigated for corruption. Part of me thinks she is just running away for fucking over the entire countries collective effort to feed her own ego.

I should nite there are still several states and major cities in Australia that are still covid free and have controlled Delta outbreaks. Melbourne and Sydney are going through outbreaks now. The plan is to open up when vaccination rates get into the 80+% which is in the coming weeks.

Lockdowns can work but they have to be extremely early and obviously enough people need to comply.

Don't even get me started on our federal government's complete failure to secure enough vaccine. Still supply issues even now. Pfizer offered 40 million doses to the Australian government mid last year which they rejected because the local pharma firm had ex-party members on the board.

There are probably a bunch of things that could have been done better depending on viewpoints. There always is.

But 27 deaths and bugger all lockdowns compared to the rest of the world is still going to be a medal performance. Can they catch a decent death rate of, say, 5000 total to equal the sort of average country? I doubt it.

For most of the negative opinions regarding NZ situation the above pretty much nullifies them; I think as lives are actually pretty important and living without lockdowns would have been nice too.

For most of the other opinions regarding transparency etc just look at how well that has worked for other countries (with or without transparancy). Basically individual humans seem to be pretty shit at following the rules which save other people if that individual -really- wants to do something which is against the rules. 

Tell people ""you don't need a mask"" and omit the ""because you're not important enough; we only have enough for medical people"" and you get that thrown in your face forever as not knowing anything. Tell the truth at the time? hah.

Tell people ""wear a mask"" and they get pissy because of their own desire to make a choice.

No government had a snowball in hell's chance of getting it right. Some just did better for longer. West Australia has closed borders and 3 cases yesterday so everyone wants to open up the borders.

&gt;Russia‚Äôs top cabinet official on Monday criticized the country's stalling vaccination rates for failing to slow the spread of Covid-19 as Russians die in numbers not seen since the start of the pandemic.  
Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said health officials have made it easy for people across the country‚Äôs 11 time zones to get the Covid jab and medication.  
‚ÄúBut the **vaccination level is insufficient to stop the spread of infection**,‚Äù Mishustin said during a Covid task force meeting.  
He added that the government is ‚Äúseriously concerned‚Äù about the spike in infections.  
‚Äú**Morbidity is increasing in most Russian regions. There are twice as many patients in hospitals as there were at the same time last year**,‚Äù Mishustin said.  
Russia has approved at least five Covid-19 vaccines, all of which were developed domestically. But its vaccination drive has stalled at 36% of the adult population, according to the independent Gogov monitor that gathers regional data.  
Russia has reported **record high numbers of coronavirus deaths for five out of the past six days**, with its all-time record of 890 Covid-19 fatalities reported Sunday. On Monday, the government tally reported the third-highest number of daily Covid cases since the start of 2021.  
In Moscow, the epicenter of the pandemic within Russia, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said **infections have risen by 30% and hospitalizations by 20% in the past week alone.**  
Anxiety over the resurgent virus was on display when news agencies covering Monday‚Äôs task force meeting initially reported that officials canceled all mass events in Russia.   
Rospotrebnadzor, the consumer-protection watchdog that oversees the national coronavirus response effort, said later that the ban on gatherings of more than 3,000 people was already in place across all 85 Russian regions.  
The Kremlin has urged regional leaders to take steps to slow the spread, stopping short of **indicating that it was planning to reimpose national-level restrictions.**  


Low level of vaccination. Already on levels of daily new cases seen during the peak 6 months ago. Setting new records of daily deaths.

330 million people live in America.

60%, or 198 million have been vaccinated.

An additional 43.6 million Americans have had the virus already.

330 - 198 - 43.6 = 88.4 million Americans with no antibodies to the virus at all.


All of this is making some huge assumptions:

1) that everyone has achieved immunity from either the vaccine or natural immunity, and it won't wane after a few months.

2) that there's no overlap in the people who have had the virus and those who've been vaccinated, even though we know there are. We just don't know how many.

3) that we have an accurate count of actual COVID cases.

4) that we're still going to be dealing with the same delta variant, and not delta plus, or some other strain

But for arguments sake, let's pretend that there are really 88.4 million susceptible Americans.

We saw 3 COVID waves in 2020: April/May, a second in July/August and a third December/January. 

By far, the December/January peak was the worst.

In 2021 we've seen a wave in April/May, and a big one in July/August/September.

Bottom line: we still have tens of millions of Americans with no immunity and if the pattern keeps repeating, we're in for a massive COVID wave through Christmas and New Year's.

&gt;**BACKGROUND**  
&gt;The B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), has contributed to a surge in cases in India and has now been detected across the globe, including a notable increase in cases in the United Kingdom. The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines against this variant has been unclear.  
&gt;    
&gt;**METHODS**  
&gt;We used a test-negative case‚Äìcontrol design to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease caused by the delta variant or the predominant strain (B.1.1.7, or alpha variant) over the period that the delta variant began circulating. Variants were identified with the use of sequencing and on the basis of the spike (S) gene status. Data on all symptomatic sequenced cases of Covid-19 in England were used to estimate the proportion of cases with either variant according to the patients‚Äô vaccination status.  
&gt;  
&gt;**RESULTS**  
&gt;Effectiveness after one dose of vaccine (BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) was notably lower among persons with the delta variant (30.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.2 to 35.7) than among those with the alpha variant (48.7%; 95% CI, 45.5 to 51.7); the results were similar for both vaccines. With the BNT162b2 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 93.7% (95% CI, 91.6 to 95.3) among persons with the alpha variant and 88.0% (95% CI, 85.3 to 90.1) among those with the delta variant. With the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 74.5% (95% CI, 68.4 to 79.4) among persons with the alpha variant and 67.0% (95% CI, 61.3 to 71.8) among those with the delta variant.  
&gt;  
&gt;**CONCLUSIONS**  
&gt;Only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness were noted with the delta variant as compared with the alpha variant after the receipt of two vaccine doses. Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked after the receipt of the first dose. This finding would support efforts to maximize vaccine uptake with two doses among vulnerable populations. (Funded by Public Health England.)

I will also add for comparison, that Flu Vaccine Effectiveness is usually found to be in the 30s-40s. ( https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/effectiveness-studies.htm )

Even more importantly, 
&gt; Even though vaccines offer different ranges of protection, real-world evaluations show they still provide robust protection against hospitalization at 60 to 95 percent.

[],,jackp0t789,,,[],,,,text,t2_epakr,False,False,[],"&gt;I fail to understand how a relatively rich country like the US has such a high death count, whereas countries like India and the entire continent of Africa, have much lower death counts (yes, even after accounting for government undercounting in India by a factor of 10).  
&gt;  
&gt;Can someone help me understand this?

&amp;#x200B;

There are dozens of factors that lead the US to have larger official counts than the nation of India, and the entire continent of Africa, here are just a few:

1. The US likely records and keeps track of such data throughout it's territory far better than the health systems and institutions of India which have a hard time getting detailed information from more remote and poorer regions of their nation. That helps contribute to India's under-reporting issues. 
2. If we go by India's numbers on [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries), they have about 450,000 deaths. If they are undercounting by a factor of 10, their total death count is 4.5 million, over six times as many as the US
3. Africa is an entire continent composed of dozens of nations, each with different amounts of resources that could be used to respond to and keep track of this pandemic. Many of those nations are highly impoverished and suffer from internal as well as external conflicts that compounds the difficulty of responding to this pandemic and keeping good records if it's impact especially in more remote and unstable territories. Many parts of the African continent also have to contend with not only this pandemic, but a large variety of other infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Dengue, periodic outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg, Polio still, and hundreds of other pathogenic diseases not to mention societal factors like malnutrition, extreme poverty, densely populated urban centers that lack access to hygienic water and other supplies.
4. Culture in the US. Before this pandemic, it was not uncommon at all- in fact, it was the norm- for workers to go into work sick as long as they could get out bed and out of the house. Many people couldn't afford to take sick days, and many workers feared losing future hours if they used such a sick day. A lot of these workers worked in professions most conducive to spreading infectious diseases like point-of-sale jobs like servers, back-of-house jobs like cooks, and everything retail.
5. The first major outbreaks of Covid in the US like in the NYC metro area in the spring of 2020 hit so hard and so fast that by the time the CDC confirmed community transmission was occurring, thousands of people were already infected and incubating the virus. That's why it took little over a week and a half between one man from Westchester being the first suspected then confirmed case of community transmission, to hospitals in NYC and it's surrounding metro areas being overwhelmed with critical cases streaming into the ICU and ER's.
6. The administration we had when the first sustained waves of infections hit in the spring of 2020 was probably the worst suited administration to deal with any crisis since Nero ruled over Rome in 68AD.
7. Denialism ran rampant in many communities in the US leading to many people ignoring public health information and distrusting the institutions providing that information, which helped the virus continue to spread as people refused to wear masks and practice social distancing in the early days of the Pandemic. This problem persists to this day with anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers continuing to spread their toxic vitriol.
8. The population of the US, especially in the hardest hit demographics, have some of the highest incident rates of the comorbidities that lead to more severe Covid infections, such as Diabetes, heart disease, and chronic pulmonary issues in the world.

It's about statistics. You're also have ""effectively zero"" chances of winning a lottery but someone's eventually gonna win it.

People go around claiming such nonsense as ""doesn't seem to be an explosion of cases anymore"" when we're still at 100K new cases every day (with &gt; 2000 deaths per day) and hospital systems are bulging at the seams and most of the occupants are unvaccinated types.

We also know that the more people that get infected increases the chances of mutation that's more serious. Thankfully some of the more deadly strains aren't as contagious as Delta (and Delta is more deadly than the original strain) because they just can't compete with Delta. Hopefully we won't see a strain that's both more contagious AND more deadly than Delta. 




&gt; Deaths of children infected with COVID-19 were also very rare, confirming the findings of other studies.

&gt; But even with the encouraging conclusions, Kakkar said parents should not take from the study a sense of false security that would discourage them from vaccinating their children, given that the study showed kids who were in good health also ended up in hospital.

&gt;That includes 96% of teachers and 99% of principals.

&gt;""Every adult in our schools is now vaccinated,"" de Blasio said. ""It clearly works,"" the mayor said of the mandate.

&gt;Schools Chancellor Misha Porter said 18,000 new shots were given out since Friday. She said unvaccinated employees can still get their shots and return to work.

&gt;""New York City schools are the safest places to be,"" Porter said.

&gt;""We call them our kids because they become our kids. We want to get thru this pandemic,"" said Michael Mulgrew, UFT President.

&gt;Some schools are reporting that 100% of their teachers are on the job.

&gt;""The first three weeks have been amazing, students happy and staff happy to be back in the building,"" said Joshua Ng, Lower Manhattan Community School, Chapter Leader.

&gt;""A lot of our students really struggled when they were not in school. It's a totally different ballgame now,"" said Peter Cocheo, Richard Green High School of Teaching, Chapter Leader.

&gt;Less than 4,000 teachers are now unvaccinated. The district says it has a robust backup of 9,000 substitute teachers.

&gt;The union says the mandate should have been enforced at the beginning of the school year.


&gt;The pockets of concern are mainly on Staten Island, particularly the borough's south shore where principals spent the weekend planning to fill staff shortages. School resource officers are also in short supply right now.

&gt;The UFT estimated about 1,000 more teachers were vaccinated over the weekend, after the 5 p.m. deadline Friday.",,,,1633362965,{},hfd39wq,True,t3_q186dm,False,False,t3_q186dm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q186dm/96_of_nyc_schools_teachers_now_vaccinated_after/hfd39wq/,1633481857.0,16,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She received the J&amp;J vaccine back on 03/19. She is also a frontline worker (pharmacy cashier) in a neighborhood with low vaccine rates among customers. Half her coworkers aren't vaccinated either and they share the same break room and bathroom of course.

I am in healthcare and I got 3rd Pfizer dose 2 weeks ago. Back in March, I had the chance to get her Pfizer or Moderna. But went with J&amp;J because of the convenience. 

Now with the silence on J&amp;J from the authorities (not to mention the pause), we are both very anxious of her catching the delta and not having any immunity to fight it. Not to mention the enormous guilt I have. Both my parents and brother got their booster doses this week. Not to mention, the countless other people I was able to get vaccinated in the early days with Pfizer who are all getting the booster now. 

Please advise on getting the two dose Pfizer or Moderna now for her. Or should we just wait to see what the health officials say. 

P.S. Not super relevant but wife also has a skin condition that gives her rashes from wearing the face mask for long hours at her job. But the champion that she is, she powers through with only periodically removing her mask for few seconds just to let her skin breathe. Very worrying given her line of work.

Anecdotal evidence is that someone I know locally who is vaccinated got sick and tested negative for COVID.

You seem to be saying they are undercounting by a factor of 10. Do you mean the death count should be 10 times higher? If so that mean there are over 4 million (4,489,970) deaths in India alone. Math is definitely not my strong suit so you may be talking about population percentages of deaths. 

But to answer your question, being rich and having money doesn't necessarily mean you are a person with well developed critical thinking skills. People tend to feel the need to belong to groups, whether it's a political group or a family group. Believing what that group has told you and not straying outside of the group is very precious to some people. Whether it's with politics or religion ""We do this because this is how our family has always believed"" is a common phenomenon worldwide. 

Being a fairly wealthy country has nothing to do with the poor choices people make. You would think wealthy country equals better education equals better educated population but unfortunately family and religious groups can trump good education. It doesn't matter if the US has the money to buy all the vaccinations in the world if we have citizens who decide they don't want them. It's like the old saying ""you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink"". Our high death count is mainly due to people who chose not to take the vaccination now getting sick. I can understand how bizarre it must look on the outside for a country to have a surplus of safe vaccinations but a percentage of population who refused to take them.

It isn‚Äôt even Halloween yet, ffs. Can we focus on that first? That seems fair, yeah? 

&gt; DR. FAUCI: So that's the one thing I want to make sure that our viewers realize that we've done well in the sense of getting 55% of the population fully vaccinated and 64% with at least one dose. But we've got to keep pushing on the vaccination front.

&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. You said, ""Don't let your guard down."" There are two new studies out that show COVID's gotten better at transmitting through aerosols, just through the air. What does that mean? We're going into cold weather. We're going into the holidays. Do people need to start looking around and saying it's just too risky to gather with family members if there are unvaccinated children?

&gt; DR. FAUCI: Well, MARGARET, I believe just the way the CDC has recommended that when you are in a situation where you have a dynamic of virus in the community, where there's clearly a lot of spread, even if you are vaccinated and you are in an indoor setting, a congregate setting, it just makes sense to wear a mask and to avoid high risk situations. And what we should be doing is look at ventilation in indoor places. We know now that this is clearly spread by aerosol, and when you have something spread by aerosol, you absolutely want more ventilation, which is the reason why outdoors is always much safer than indoors. And if you are indoors, ventilation is going to be key. And that's the reason why we really should be paying attention to that.

&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN: But we can gather for Christmas, or it's just too soon to tell.

&gt; DR. FAUCI: You know, MARGARET, it's just too soon to tell. We've just got to concentrating on continuing to get those numbers down and not try to jump ahead by weeks or months and say what we're going to do at a particular time. Let's focus like a laser on continuing to get those- those cases down. And we can do it by people getting vaccinated and also in the situation where boosters are appropriate to get people boosted because we know that they can help greatly in diminishing infection and diminishing advanced disease, the kinds of data that are now accumulating in real time.
