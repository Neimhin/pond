Hours after a rally in Santa Monica against COVID-19 vaccination mandates on Sunday, protesters opposed to required inoculations showed up at the homes of two Los Angeles City Council members.

Protesters banged on the door of City Council President Nury Martinez‚Äôs Sun Valley home around 7:30 p.m., Martinez told The Times. The group also tried to harass Martinez‚Äôs neighbors, she said.

Protesters opposed to vaccine mandates also visited the home of Councilman Mitch O‚ÄôFarrell, who represents Echo Park, Silver Lake and nearby neighborhoods, on Sunday night, O‚ÄôFarrell spokesman Dan Halden said. He didn‚Äôt provide any more details.

A spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment about the incidents.


Hundreds of people descended onto a park near the Santa Monica Pier on Sunday to rally against vaccination mandates. Organizers led the group in prayers, gave speeches, waved flags supporting former President Trump and talked up the recall attempts against several Democrats, including Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. George Gasc√≥n.


Health experts have said the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective and save lives. Data released by Los Angeles County last week showed that hospitals are seeing a greater number of unvaccinated people who are younger and otherwise healthy.

At one point during Sunday‚Äôs rally, a man held up a sign that he said showed the home address of each City Council member, according to video posted on social media. If the City Council voted for a vaccine mandate, protesters would visit their home, the man said, according to the video.

	
‚ÄúWhoever votes yes, we‚Äôre coming to your door,‚Äù the man said, according to the video. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre coming to your home. You want to intimidate us? We‚Äôre coming to you now.‚Äù

At another point, he said that if the vaccine mandates passes, ‚Äúcivil war is coming, get your guns.‚Äù

Martinez suggested Monday that there was a link between the release of council members‚Äô addresses and the people who showed up at her door.

‚ÄúAll of this is simply because we‚Äôre asking people to wear a mask and get vaccinated,‚Äù she said.

The Los Angeles City Council this month voted to direct city attorneys to draft a law that would require people to have at least one dose of a vaccine to visit indoor restaurants, bars, gyms, shops and movie theaters. The plan has not been finalized, and the proposed law still needs approval from the full council.

Demonstrators of various political stripes have targeted L.A. politicians at their homes over the last 18 months. Those angry about face masks and rules requiring businesses to close their doors held regular protests last year outside Getty House, the official residence of L.A.'s mayor.

Martinez‚Äôs home was also targeted in June. Security video and news reports show that a white liquid was poured over Martinez‚Äôs car, while the phrase ‚Äúend the sweeps‚Äù was written on her driveway, a reference to city sweeps of homeless encampments that require people to remove their tents.",,,,1630377054,{},hb0cp92,False,t3_pewwoi,False,False,t3_pewwoi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pewwoi/vaccination_foes_target_homes_of_la_city_council/hb0cp92/,1630462921.0,22,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Excellent job reporting this important news. I think you made a simple typographical error. Delta strains actually have caused more than 8 cases worldwide.  
              
For clarification, for the US alone, CDC data presently shows Delta lineages caused a total of 1,002,417 new infections over a period of 7 days, for the week ending August 14, 2021.    
         
The AutoModerator comment ""Automatic translation [here](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.tmd.ac.jp/press-release/20210830-1/)"" link includes the following English-language text:  
         
&gt;Only 8 cases of Delta strains carrying the N501S mutation have been reported worldwide, and this is the first case reported in Japan (GISAID registration data as of August 27, 2021).  
               
***  
              
Clarification: Presently, for the United States alone, the CDC&gt;[COVID Data Tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home ""https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home"")&gt;Genomic Surveillance&gt;[Variant Proportions](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions ""https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"") page is reporting the Delta lineages B.1.617.2, AY.1, AY.2, and AY.3-AY.12 caused a total of 99.1% of all new COVID-19 infections over 7 days, for the week ending August 21, 2021.    
              
Presently, the CDC [COVID Data Tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home ""https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home"")&gt;Cases, Deaths, and Testing&gt;Daily and Total Trends&gt;Trends in Number of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in the US Reported to CDC, by State/Territory&gt;The United States&gt;[Cumulative Cases](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_totalcases ""https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_totalcases"")&gt;Data Table for Total Cases-The United States shows a total cumulative count of 36,813,312 COVID-19 cases in the US on August 14, and a total cumulative count of 37,824,833 COVID-19 cases in the US on August 21, corresponding to 7 days for the week ending August 21, on the CDC Variant Proportions page.  
                    
Thus, over the 7 days from Aug 14-21, corresponding to the week ending August 21 in the Variant Proportions page, the US had a total count of 1,011,521 new COVID-19 cases, with Delta lineages causing 99.1% of those new COVID-19 cases, or about 1,002,417 new Delta infections over 7 days, for the week ending Aug 14.  
          
And, sadly and tragically, the CDC [COVID Data Tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home ""https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home"")&gt;Vaccinations&gt;Vaccinations in the US presently shows only 61.3% of the U.S. population, age ‚â•12 years and over, is fully vaccinated, amounting to 173,700,607 people in the US, age ‚â•12 years and over, fully vaccinated;  and 38.7% of the U.S. population, age ‚â•12 years and over, not fully vaccinated, amounting to 109,660,905 people in the US, age ‚â•12 years and over, not fully vaccinated.  
            
Some prominent health officials publicly have stated under the Delta variant the U.S. population might need to reach 90% or more fully vaccinated  for the country to reach herd immunity.  
            
I wonder whether 90% or more of the U.S. population might get fully vaccinated if the new Delta B.1.617.2 carrying the N501S mutation or some other SARS-CoV-2 mutation begins spreading across the U.S. population over the coming days, weeks, and months, and begins killing 10-25% or more of everyone age 15-35 years.  
          
I think one thing's for sure. The US predictably is the best place in the world for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to thrive, spread, and mutate because more than 100 million people age ‚â•12 years and over don't seem to give a dam about getting fully vaccinated to help end the pandemic sooner rather than later, perhaps 6, 12, 18, 24, or more months later.",,,,1630392003,{},hb11amz,False,t3_pevw9u,False,True,t1_hb050xl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pevw9u/confirmation_of_the_first_case_of/hb11amz/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,53059f624f33b10d33267c02305b0bec6243850c,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1630392017.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

One year ago, our 7-week average of new cases was 41,600, and deaths was 879.

Today, our 7-week average of new cases is 159,000, and deaths is 1,350.

The only silver lining I see here is the death rate has dropped from 2.1% to 0.85% over the past year.

Considering only [1% of today's COVID cases are breakthrough cases](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/covid-19-vaccine-breakthrough-cases-data-from-the-states/) contracted by vaccinated individuals, then we can see that that the Delta variant is indeed more contagious (as there are far more cases than one year prior) and less deadly (as the death rate is less than half of the year prior).

Also possibly explaining the higher case number is the fact that lockdowns were still in place this time last year.  On the other hand, I would imagine many of those contracting COVID today were not abiding by masks, social distancing, and other quarantine requirements last year.  So that kind of washes out.

I guess I'm just stunned that our numbers are objectively far worse than they were last year, and I don't hear the media really harping on this, probably because it could easily be contorted by detractors to support their proposition that the vaccines are ineffective.

Because of this, many local leaders began urging people not to vaccinate their kids, various districts banned vaccination teams,.

Priests are not qualified to have a medical opinion. They are nonetheless affecting people's health, including that of people who are not affiliated with their religion.

""Comirnaty"" is just a weird name. Apparently they even got a marketing company to come up with it and they gave this reasoning for it:

&gt; ‚ÄúThe name is coined from Covid-19 immunity, and then embeds the mRNA in the middle, which is the platform technology, and as a whole the name is meant to evoke the word community,‚Äù Scott Piergrossi, Brand Institute president of operations and communications, said. 

The Oxford/AZ vaccine isn't really much better, as they have picked ""Vaxzevria"" as their product name. At least it has "" vax"" in the name so you at least have a bit of a clue as to what it is. On the other hand, the Serum Institute of India also produces this vaccine, but markets it under the name ""Covishield"", which is much better.

At J&amp;J they haven't bothered with a catchy name and their vaccine is still called ""Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine"" after Janssen Vaccines, the Dutch J&amp;J subsidiary that developed the vaccine.

The Gamaleya Institute has called their vaccine ""Sputnik V"", which is weird given that ""sputnik"" means ""satellite"". I get the national pride angle they're trying to go for, but viral vector vaccines are not satellites, last time I checked.

Sinovac has called their vaccine ""CoronaVac"", which is incredibly to the point, but also very unimaginative.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt dare think about tomorrow,‚Äù she said.  
  
Loan, from the southern province of Vƒ©nh Long, started working for a plant in Tr√† N√≥c Industrial Zone in C·∫ßn Th∆° City a few years ago. She, like many other workers in the industrial zone, rented a simple room in Residential Group No 2, Tr√† N√≥c Ward, B√¨nh Thu·ª∑ District.  
  
Having been laid off for more than two months since C·∫ßn Th∆° City implemented a social distancing order under Directive 16, Loan is staying in the city, waiting for the day she can return to work.  
  
‚ÄúIf I return to my hometown, I have to spend 14 days in a concentrated quarantine area and another 14 days when I back to C·∫ßn Th∆°,‚Äù she said, adding that she even did not know if she would have meals in the following days.  
  
‚ÄúIf my company re-opens when I‚Äôm at the concentrated quarantine area, I will not have my job anymore.  
  
‚ÄúStaying in the city at this time causes many difficulties for migrant workers like me. Now, I‚Äôm here with no job, no salary and don‚Äôt know when I can go back to work.‚Äù  
  
Another migrant worker from Vƒ©nh Long Province working in Tr√† N√≥c Industrial Zone, L√™ Thanh T√¢n, said that before social distancing he had worked for a seafood processing company for more than a month.  
  
Without income for more than two months, T√¢n and his wife only survive thanks to donated food.  
  
‚ÄúWe have little food left while no one knows how long the COVID-19 pandemic will last. We have to use the food as economically as possible,‚Äù T√¢n said.  
  
‚ÄúA new school year is set to start, I now have no money to buy new books and notebooks for my children.  
  
‚ÄúWhenever my children phone me, they ask me when I will return home or when I will send them money to buy new books.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid of such questions. I try not to cry in front of them.‚Äù   
  
Ph√πng Ph√∫ H∆°n, a migrant worker from S√≥c TrƒÉng Province, said that he was laid-off for more than two months without getting any support from his company.  
  
He and his neighbours, most of whom are unemployed, were not instructed to apply for any support offered by the Government and local authorities.  
  
‚ÄúWe all now want to go back to work mostly,‚Äù H∆°n said.

Ho√†ng VƒÉn Lung, a landlord, said that on seeing the difficulties of the workers during the pandemic, he offered them free rent for a month. Those who can not afford rent now can pay him later.  
  
Lung also called on his friends to donate rice, vegetables and fish sauce for the needy workers.  
  
Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc B√≠ch, a tenant, said that in her neighbourhood dozens of workers were struggling to lead regular lives due to the pandemic.  
  
‚ÄúNow more than ever we should care and share,‚Äù B√≠ch said.  
  
Preparing some food to celebrate the 15th day of lunar July, B√≠ch and her daughter divided the food into small parcels and then gave them to neighbours.  
  
As of August 27, a total of 1,031 out of 1,090 companies in C·∫ßn Th∆° City have suspended operation due to the pandemic, forcing 65,872 workers to lose their jobs.  
  
A total of 157 companies out of a total of 170 companies in industrial and processing zones suspended operation, making nearly 40,000 workers jobless.  
  
According to the province‚Äôs Labour, Invalid and Social Affairs, only 451 laid-off workers in five districts of B√¨nh Th·ªßy, Ninh Ki·ªÅu, √î M√¥n, C·ªù ƒê·ªè and Vƒ©nh Th·∫°nh received financial support worth, VNƒê 1.5 billion (US$ 66,000).  
  
C·∫ßn Th∆° City‚Äôs Trade Union reported that about 7,000 workers heavily affected by the pandemic have not received any support under the Government‚Äôs Resolution No 68 dated early July on policies to support employees and employers facing difficulties due to the pandemic, worth a total of VNƒê26 trillion (US$1.13 billion).

The loopholes include pandemic prevention and control activities in densely populated areas and lockdown areas not being strict enough; as well as green-channel truck drivers who transport necessary goods during social distancing being dishonest about travel itineraries.  
  
Secretary of the Party Committee of H√† N·ªôi ƒêinh Ti·∫øn D≈©ng told local media on Monday morning the loopholes had resulted in new clusters being found in the city in recent days.  
  
For example, clusters of new cases were recently found in Thanh Xu√¢n Trung Ward, Thanh Xu√¢n District and Gi√°p B√°t Ward in Ho√†ng Mai District.  
  
Recently, there were clusters in VƒÉn Ch∆∞∆°ng Ward in ƒê·ªëng ƒêa District, Li√™n Ninh Commune in Thanh Tr√¨ District, HH4C Linh ƒê√†m Apartment Complex in Ho√†ng Mai District.  
  
New positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 were also reported among ambulance drivers, green-channel truck drivers and people who worked at traditional markets and supermarkets, he said.  
  
""All of these cases warn of the very unpredictable way the pandemic attacks the community,"" he said.  
  
‚ÄúWhile the pandemic still shows its complex developments in many localities across the country, we need to continue persevering the effective implementation of social distancing.""  
  
The city was told to implement the model ""COVID-19 safe family,"" requiring each household to sign a commitment not to go out unless necessary, he said.  
  
D≈©ng ordered all relevant agencies to quickly close loopholes and focus on pandemic prevention and control measures to bring the city back to normal.  
  
In addition to the efforts of the city administration, it needed more consensus in the community in the fight against the pandemic, he added.  
  
Therefore, he called on all local people to seriously obey social distancing. People must stay at home and only go out if necessary as well as comply with the 5K message: Kh·∫©u trang (facemasks) ‚Äì Kh·ª≠ khu·∫©n (disinfection) ‚Äì Kho·∫£ng c√°ch (distancing) ‚Äì Kh√¥ng t·ª• t·∫≠p (no gathering) ‚Äì Khai b√°o y t·∫ø (health declaration).  
  
In order to prevent cases of green-channel truck drivers spreading the virus in the community such as cases in Gi√°p B√°t Ward, Ho√†ng Mai District, green-channel drivers must transport goods directly to the delivery place without randomly parking, he said.  
  
If drivers need to leave the cabin for any reasons, they must wear medical protective clothing and must not contact with other people. After delivering the goods, they must leave the area immediately, he said.  
  
H√† N·ªôi has recorded a total of 3,637 cases of COVID-19 as of 6pm on Sunday, including 38 deaths.

Did Florida receive more pfizer vaccinations than moderna but because Florida had such a large outbreak, the circulating viral load was enough to overcome the vaccine's protection, while other states may have a higher relative Moderna vaccination rate but they didn't experience outbreaks to the same degree in their unvaccinated populations, etc. They may have answered that, but I got lost in table hell.

They are among the 80 per cent of Singapore‚Äôs 5.7 million people that have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, as the country moves towards reopening its borders.  
         
Singapore government officials and the Singapore population are very smart about the COVID-19 pandemic, how to control it, how to help end it, how to prevent infections, and how to prevent deaths.  
           
During the pandemic, Singapore has confirmed a [total of 67,459](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6 ""https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6"")  COVID-19 cases and a [total of 55](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6 ""https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6"")  COVID-19 deaths in the country, [including 17](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/population ""https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/population"") COVID-19 deaths in the past 28 days.  
            
At the end of June 2020, Singapore had an estimated population of about [5.69 million](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/population ""https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/population"") people.  
              
Thus, the overall COVID-19 mortality rate in Singapore is about 0.97 deaths per 100k population.  
           
In comparison, during the pandemic, the US has confirmed a [total of 39,057,459](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/population ""https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/population"") COVID-19 cases and a [total of 638,711](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/population ""https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/population"") COVID-19 deaths in the country, [including 25,260](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/population ""https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/population"") COVID-19 deaths in the past 28 days.  
         
On June 30, 2020, the US had an estimated population of about [331.53 million](https://www.census.gov/popclock/ ""https://www.census.gov/popclock/"").  
               
Thus, the overall COVID-19 mortality rate in the US is about 192.7 COVID-19 deaths per 100k population.  
                
During the pandemic, the number of U.S. COVID-19 deaths per 100k people has been about 199 times the number of of Singapore COVID-19 deaths per 100k population.  
                
If the US had the same overall COVID-19 mortality rate as Singapore, the US presently would have a cumulative total of about 10,953 total COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic, instead of 638,711, and about 627,758 people in the US who died from COVID-19 would be alive, not dead.",,,,1630395958,{},hb15xs9,False,t3_pf0ma1,False,False,t3_pf0ma1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pf0ma1/covid19_singapore_residents_who_took_sinovac_turn/hb15xs9/,1630477974.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the AAP, a source (citation 2) for your link:
&gt; As of August 26, nearly 4.8 million children have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic.

&gt; ‚ÄãIn states reporting, 0.00%-0.03% of all child COVID-19 cases resulted in death

The percentage of &lt;18 covid cases that resulted in death is so small im some states that it rounds to 0.00%.  The highest reported, 0.03%, is 50 to 100x lower than that of adults, assuming a 1.5%-3% case fatality rate.

From your source:
&gt; Sadly, over 350 children have died

While each death, and especially each child death, is a tragedy, 350 deaths out of 4.8 million fucking cases qualifies as ‚Äúnegligible risk‚Äù.  [In 2016](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/nejmsr1804754) about 35x more minors died from general injuries, about 11x more died in car crashes, about 4x more died from suffocation, and almost 3x more died from drowning.

&gt;The new protocols were announced in an email to students.

&gt;The email said that last week alone, 304 undergraduates, 45 graduate students and 15 employees tested positive for COVID-19. The week prior, 95 students and 18 faculty tested positive.

&gt;All but eight of the people were vaccinated, the university said, and the vast majority were asymptomatic.

&gt;""Nonetheless, this surge is placing significant stress on the people, systems and facilities"" that are dedicated to keeping the community safe, the email said.

&gt;For that reason, the university announced the following protocols:

&gt;   Masks will now be required on the Duke Campus in all indoor and outdoor locations, unless you are exercising alone, eating or drinking or otherwise not around others

&gt;Indoor group seating at Duke Dining facilities will be temporarily suspended

[],,toss77777777,,,[],,,,text,t2_3dvlc8im,False,False,[],"I agree that prohibiting any restrictions is foolish and is somewhere between an over-reaction and turning it into a political statement.

Last year our school district tried to put together a plan for the classroom that included lots of restrictions. Half of the kids would go on alternating days, desks 6+ feet apart, they were still on their computers even in the classroom (so that the teachers were not required to come in), classroom monitors (separate from teachers) make sure kids kept their masks on and stayed socially distant, interleaved bell schedules in middle and high school to decrease the number of kids in the halls, no group seating at lunch, etc etc.

However something like 30-40% of families opted into this because it was a ridiculous circus and worse than remote learning. And this led to every classroom being 1/3 in person and 2/3 remote which further disrupted the classes. Most kids say they learned nothing and goofed off the entire time.

There is currently no way to get the small kids vaccinated, but at the same time they are at infinitesimal risk for getting seriously ill if they are exposed. They can be carriers, though the chance is much higher if they have symptoms.

My wife and her friends and colleagues are all vaccinated and deal with roomfuls of unvaccinated preschool kids every day. And kids that age have no sense of personal space and can't reliably wear a mask. So they are basically all exposed all day long. Masks are hard to enforce with any reliability. They rely on the vaccinations for themselves and the older family members of the kids.

I am not trying to shame anyone but just ask what the risks are. When the pandemic started there were a lot of unknowns. But at this stage there is a lot of data and a lot more is known and it is possible to ""follow the science"". We are fortunate that the kids are at very little risk. With SARS for example it was inverted, the risk for kids was higher than adults.

The other side of this situation is that kids and parents have been going out of their minds with the kids at home which takes a heavy toll on some kids, parents, and families.

[],,Worms_sg,,,[],,,,text,t2_9wimhx4b,False,False,[],"Australia has secured half a million doses of Pfizer coronavirus vaccines in a swap deal with Singapore to bolster the behind-schedule rollout.

Under the agreement 500,000 doses are expected to arrive for distribution next week, with Australia to send the same amount to Singapore in December.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the vaccines would be additional to 4.5 million doses of the Pfizer and one million Moderna shots expected to arrive this month.

""That means there are 500,000 doses extra that will happen in September that otherwise would have had to wait for several months from now,"" he told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday.


The vaccines will be distributed based on population with 159,236 set for NSW and 131,149 heading to Victoria.

Labor leader Anthony Albanese continues to accuse the government of not securing enough doses and failing to establish a more diverse vaccine portfolio.

The opposition argues the slow rollout has left Australia behind almost every developed country in the world.

""Why does the prime minister not take responsibility for the fact that Australia's economic recovery was always hostage to his failures on vaccines and quarantine?"" Mr Albanese told parliament

Mr Morrison said there were more ""irons in the fire"" on vaccine deals.

He said the Singapore doses would accelerate the vaccination rollout as Australia pursues vaccination coverage targets of 70 and 80 per cent of the population aged 16 and above.

WA Premier Mark McGowan argues opening borders to states with the virus would cost hundreds of lives at 70 per cent coverage.

The prime minister toned down his criticism of states wary of releasing restrictions at the lower threshold, saying he understood people wanted to be cautious.

""We are all starting from different places under this national plan but we are all heading to the same location,"" he said.

Mr Morrison said the goal was to reconnect Australians with each other and the rest of the world when more than 80 per cent of over-16s are vaccinated.

But he is adamant states like WA, SA, Tasmania and Queensland will have to prepare for cases of the Delta strain when the nation reopens.

Mr Morrison insists major lockdowns will cause more harm than good at the higher threshold, but said it would not be ""open slather"" at 70 per cent.

""Ultimately everything is a state matter, but I note that there was an agreement to the national plan which was to see Australians coming together.""

Australia has fully vaccinated 35 per cent of its population aged 16 and over while 58.7 have received one dose.

Earlier in the month, the Morrison government clinched a deal with Poland for an additional one million Pfizer doses.

There were 1164 new cases in NSW on Tuesday, while Victoria recorded 76 new infections.

Australia's death toll is 1006 after the latest three deaths in NSW.

The ACT recorded 13 new cases, prompting Chief Minister Andrew Barr to extend lockdown until at least September 17.

Under a section on moderate cases, it says (emphasis mine), ""See 'Therapeutic Management of *Nonhospitalized* Adults With COVID-19' for recommendations regarding SARS-CoV-2‚Äìspecific therapy.""

Which makes sense to me because I believe the term ""clinical"" refers to any type of medical care, ranging from regular doctor's office visits all the way to hospitalization. (A clinician is any medical professional who treats patients, as opposed to doing research or something.)

It is weird how the definition seems to say that moderate cases do not exist unless they are observed by a medical professional. But I think the article is written for medical professionals who are dealing with patients, so I don't think it's meant to say anything about situations where no medical professional is involved. It's just trying to tell them how to handle it when they are.

This study demonstrated a significantly higher humoral immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) compared with the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech), in infected as well as uninfected participants, and across age categories. The higher mRNA content in mRNA-1273 compared with BNT162b2 and the longer interval between priming and boosting for mRNA-12733 (4 weeks vs 3 weeks for BNT162b2) might explain this difference.

A relationship between neutralization level after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and protection against COVID-19 has been demonstrated by several studies.4 As such, the height of the humoral response after vaccination, which correlates with neutralizing antibody titers,5 might be clinically relevant.

Limitations of this study include the lack of data on cellular immunity and on neutralizing antibodies, as well as the specific focus on health care workers. Whether the observed difference in antibody level translates to a difference in the duration of protection,4 the protection against variants of concern, and the risk of transmission6 needs further investigation.

The symptoms are a lot more evident though.

Start looks like a clear entity has consolidated control and needs to start building systems to govern. This is like the Taliban right now. Once systems are built, we have a steady rise in prosperity shared across the population, and culture starts to form, usually in the form of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs build the country together and make it great (again)‚Äù. This is China in the 90s and 00s. Eventually you have a prosperous period while being on top, this is the Victorian British Empire when the sun never set on Britain.

(WFLA) ‚Äî More than a hundred parents in Sarasota County lined up outside a chiropractor‚Äôs office to get a medical exemption form for their children. Many waited for hours Monday.

&gt;A 90-day mask mandate officially went into effect Monday in schools across Sarasota County.

&gt;Parents and their children started lining up outside Twin Palms Chiropractic in Venice before 6:00 p.m. to get a mask exemption form. The last group walked in shortly before 11 p.m.

&gt;Dr. Dan Busch signs the medical mask exemption forms. The chiropractor says his policy is to meet with the student and their parent or legal guardian to determine if they qualify for an exemption. He told 8 On Your Side he‚Äôs signed dozens over the last week. 

&gt;‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking at things like anxiety, asthma, depression, respiratory distress, there‚Äôs a lot of qualifying conditions,‚Äù Busch said. ‚ÄúI do feel as a parent I should be allowed to parent and have those choices.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a political thing, Busch said. ‚ÄúI am not an anti-mask person or an anti-VAX person but I am a pro-freedom, pro-choice person.‚Äù

&gt;School district leaders in Sarasota County say they‚Äôve seen several medical exemptions come in and it is a concern.

&gt;There were concerns that the practice was offering mask exemptions to anyone who wanted one. Dr. Busch says he has not given exemptions to parents he has not met with.

My wife and I are both vaccinated but our daughter obviously is not.  We go into quarantine, and she shows very little by way of symptoms.  Slightly runny nose, very minor and infrequent cough but she has allergies so that is completely normal.  On Saturday, my wife wakes up not feeling great, we take an at home test and it is negative.  She wakes up Sunday feeling worse. We take our daughter in on Sunday for a rapid test, which is positive.  My wife, being symptomatic, goes into the same doctor who says you definitely have it, no need to pay for a rapid let's just do PCR so you have the test result, but you definitely have it.  I go in the following day (Monday) and do the same. On Monday the wife's symptoms are worse.  She is achy, has trouble breathing at times, feels like she gets run-over by a truck and her sense of taste is dulled.  She wakes up this morning still feeling bad and decides to get the Regeneron done.  She does it and by the afternoon is feeling much better. In the meantime I've developed a cough and feel fatigued, and everyone I talk to says I sound rough.  I don't feel terrible, but not 100% either.  So it seems we all have it.

Then this afternoon my wife's and my tests both came back negative. I could 100% believe I don't, my symptoms are minor enough just to be allergies or the impact of being cooped up for the past week. But my wife's symptoms line up directly with covid, two doctors, the one she saw Sunday and the one at the Regeneron facility both said it was covid.  I would think she was just tested too early, but she was symptomatic at that point.  False negative?  Vaccine keeping the viral load in her nose down?

The Cuban Missile Crisis, the Norwegian Rocket Incident, and the 1983 Soviet false alarm incident were three examples of this. 

In the 1983 Soviet false alarm incident, a single man determined the outcome of humanity. The radar computers detected a salvo of five nuclear missiles headed towards the Soviet Union. Thinking that a pre-emptive nuclear strike would involve thousands of missiles, he made a tough decision - that the five missiles were most likely an error. Had he decided that it was a real attack, the Soviet pre-emptive attack strategy held that the vast majority of the Soviet nuclear arsenal was to be launched at the United States immediately.

I'm not convinced one way or the other that vaccine resistant mutations are more likely to come from the unvaccinated. 

I see the point that more replication = more chances for mutations. That piece is undeniable. 

But there's also a case to made that having a large population of vaccinated people applies selective pressure in favor of mutations that are vaccine resistant. For example, if I caught covid (am vaccinated) and the virus mutated in me in a way that conferred vaccine resistance, I'm going to pass the resistant version on to others. The version I originally caught is going to be well supressed. I won't pass that on to others. Or, if I picked up a resistant strain, of course I'm going to pass that one along because it won't be well supressed either.

Instead, we get different stories and different dates from politicians and government officials, and things are ever-changing.  There's little to no communication about how the clinical trials are going or when they should be definitively over.  The last time they were over, the FDA went back and told Pfizer to get more people enrolled.  It kind of feels like the FDA could have spoken up months before that if they had such concerns.

I feel like at this point, a better approach would be for Pfizer and Moderna to open up clinical trial access to every parent that wants it for their kid, and go ahead and start getting people vaccinated.  My kids' school district hasn't even been open two weeks yet and there's already been a thousand cases, which is pretty much in line with the rest of the state.

Mortality is not selected for directly. If you change the spike too much to avoid the immune system, the virus may not be able to bind to cells as well. I'm not saying it won't get worse before it gets better but with out ability to create new highly effective vaccines within months, we have the tools to even deal with a worse variant.

There are people already working on pan-covid vaccines (that should work more broadly against variants), nasal and inhaled vaccines (which should help tremendously at preventing any infection), vaccines that are stable for longer without freezers (making mass vaccination in some areas much easier). By the time gen3/4 vaccines are widely available, hopefully we already have covid under control in most of the world. But if we don't because of new variants, there's still more hope.

Australia has shown a willingness to shutdown international travel entirely and lockdown regions and domestic travel, with  roadblocks and everything else, at the first sign of community transmission.

Let's not pretend it's simply masks which are keeping a lid on transmission in Australia.

Everyone in South America is wearing a mask.  Mask compliance in Peru is 100%, and has been the entire time, since early March 2020, with huge fines for anyone caught in public without one.  Peru has about the worst outbreak in the world.  Same in Argentina.

If the r0 of Delta is 6 (and by some accounts, it's a lot higher), and masks reduce transmission by 60%, then masks alone will lead to an rT of 2.4 -- way higher than flu, and almost as high as the original strain of Covid without mitigation.

Masks cannot stop the spread, only slow it.

Anyway, I'm not saying don't wear a mask, I'm just responding to the idea that Covid is ""easy to contain"" with masks.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

A terrible storm came into a town and local officials sent out an emergency warning that the riverbanks would soon overflow and flood the nearby homes. They ordered everyone in the town to evacuate immediately.

A faithful Christian man heard the warning and decided to stay, saying to himself, ‚ÄúI will trust God and if I am in danger, then God will send a divine miracle to save me.‚Äù

The neighbors came by his house and said to him, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leaving and there is room for you in our car, please come with us!‚Äù But the man declined. ‚ÄúI have faith that God will save me.‚Äù

As the man stood on his porch watching the water rise up the steps, a man in a canoe paddled by and called to him, ‚ÄúHurry and come into my canoe, the waters are rising quickly!‚Äù But the man again said, ‚ÄúNo thanks, God will save me.‚Äù

The floodwaters rose higher pouring water into his living room and the man had to retreat to the second floor. A police motorboat came by and saw him at the window. ‚ÄúWe will come up and rescue you!‚Äù they shouted. But the man refused, waving them off saying, ‚ÄúUse your time to save someone else! I have faith that God will save me!‚Äù

The flood waters rose higher and higher and the man had to climb up to his rooftop.

A helicopter spotted him and dropped a rope ladder. A rescue officer came down the ladder and pleaded with the man, ""Grab my hand and I will pull you up!"" But the man STILL refused, folding his arms tightly to his body. ‚ÄúNo thank you! God will save me!‚Äù

Shortly after, the house broke up and the floodwaters swept the man away and he drowned.

When in Heaven, the man stood before God and asked, ‚ÄúI put all of my faith in You. Why didn‚Äôt You come and save me?‚Äù

And God said, ‚ÄúSon, I sent you a warning. I sent you a car. I sent you a canoe. I sent you a motorboat. I sent you a helicopter.

[],,VigilantMike,,,[],,,,text,t2_wh3tf,False,False,[],"&gt; rationalization you've made for yourself to be absolved of personal responsibility

I am vaccinated. I took responsibility. I don‚Äôt know why people can‚Äôt comprehend that vaccines are leagues beyond mask, I presume it‚Äôs because vaccines provide invisible protection while mask are visual and humans like visual indicators, even if in reality they are the less effective option. 

&gt; You personally do not have a better handle or perspective on what will or will-not manage the pandemic that is better than the CDC's. 

The CDC has a laundry list of guidelines that we as a society have ignored for years. I mean, come on, they tell you to not eat raw fish. When they updated their guidance that vaccinated people don‚Äôt need to wear mask, we had offered the vaccines to every one 12 and up who wanted one and our infections were low. Despite that it took only a couple months for the vaccinated to mask again, this time indefinitely since we‚Äôre no longer waiting for the vaccine. 

There is absolutely a faction of people that will never be able to mentally move on and want people to mask forever. My highly vaccinated state‚Äôs hospitalizations are at 1/5 of what they were at the peak and plateauing, if we‚Äôre asked to remask now then when will it be considered okay to take them off? The answer is not when we reach any tangible metric, it‚Äôs when the cautious ‚Äúfeel‚Äù that it is safer, regardless of how much the situation has objectively changed. 

Fortunately my governor is remarkably intelligent for a politician. He knows that the situation is still much safer than it was earlier in the year, and beyond all the unvaccinated getting infected at once right now, the situation isn‚Äôt really going to get better since most people have already received their vaccines. But the hospitals are doing well, and aren‚Äôt facing collapse, so he hasn‚Äôt imposed any state restrictions deplete being one of the first democratic governors to do so in 2020. Being the fair man he is, he created a special executive order clarifying that individual towns and cities have the right to impose mask mandates if they wish, but he listened to his public health advisors that reasoned that the state doesn‚Äôt need a sweeping mandate. If the appeal to authority fallacy is so important to you. Still don‚Äôt get your last sentences. My opinion is worthless (even though my college education was dedicated to analyzing and interpreting data) because I don‚Äôt work in a scientific field, but a doctor who‚Äôs antivax (they do exist) has a more valid opinion? What? I actually am a part time employee (not sure why that‚Äôs relevant, but if you‚Äôre wondering I turned down a full time promotion twice because I make enough with less hours), but my full time colleague who is antivax and has not received the shot has a more valid opinion because she works ten more hours a week?

Ron DeSantis' ban on mask mandates.

&gt;Just days after a state judge ruled that the governor's ban was unconstitutional, Florida's education commissioner on Monday announced the state was withholding funds from Alachua and Broward counties ""for their continued violation of state law.""

&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to fight to protect parent‚Äôs rights to make health care decisions for their children. They know what is best for their children,"" Richard Corcoran said in a statement Monday.

&gt;The funds, which he said amounted to ""the monthly school board member salaries,"" would continue to be withheld in Alachua and Broward counties until the school districts complied.

&gt;""What‚Äôs unacceptable is the politicians who have raised their right hands and pledged, under oath, to uphold the Constitution but are not doing so. Simply said, elected officials cannot pick and choose what laws they want to follow,"" Corcoran said.

&gt;Alachua County Public Schools Superintendent Carlee Simon said in a statement Tuesday she was ""very troubled by the state's action.""

&gt;""Our School Board members made a courageous decision to protect the health and lives of students, staff and the people of this community, and a court has already ruled they had the legal right to do so. They deserve praise, not penalties,"" she said.

&gt;Simon added the school district has already begun to take legal action to ""ensure that Florida's districts have the right to act in the best interests of those they serve.""

&gt;Broward County Public Schools Interim Superintendent Vickie Cartwright said she believed the school district was also in compliance with the law.

&gt;""The health and safety of our students, teachers and staff continue to be our main priorities. As such, BCPS will continue to mandate masks, knowing the data shows they help minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our schools,"" Cartwright said in a statement. ""As previously stated, this decision will be reviewed by the School Board after Labor Day as conditions may change and modification may be appropriate.""

&gt;Jared Ochs, the director of communications for the state Department of Education, told NBC News in an email Tuesday that the school funds have been withheld since Thursday.

&gt;""Our Department plans on continuing to follow the rule of law until such time as the Court issues its ruling, and subsequent to that ruling, we plan on immediately appealing this decision to the First DCA, from which we will seek to stay the ruling,"" he said.

&gt;Florida became the epicenter of the latest surge of the pandemic in the U.S. with record new cases and hospitalizations as the school year began earlier this month. In July, DeSantis, a Republican, barred local school districts from requiring students to wear masks even as the state battled a resurgence of the coronavirus.

&gt;A Florida judge on Friday knocked down DeSantis' order, saying the sweeping action from Tallahassee doesn't ""pass constitutional muster."" School districts have the right to set policies, like mask mandates, as long as they have ‚Äúcompelling state interest‚Äù and have a ‚Äúnarrowly tailored‚Äù plan of action, according to Leon County Circuit Judge John C. Cooper's decision.",,,,1630436040,{},hb3atls,True,t3_pfc8oq,False,False,t3_pfc8oq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pfc8oq/despite_courts_decision_florida_withholds_school/hb3atls/,1630518288.0,21,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

All of these statistics are very broad and don't account for the fact that most of the murders are taking place in very specific areas. They don't account for what kind of people are more likely to die in a car accident (reckless drivers making poor decisions). And the covid deaths do not reflect how many of those 3000 people had pre existing conditions. 


Young adults should absolutely get vaccinated, but the idea that they should be living in fear of covid if they are healthy is completely unfounded and not supported by any data. 


In fact, young children might even be at a higher personal risk from the vaccine and its side effects than they are from the virus.

My understanding was that vaccines were not intended to stop infection, so breakthrough just signified to me that they were vaccinated people vs unvaccinated.

For example I was surprised to find that when they say a vaccine is say 70% or 90% effective, what they are really reporting is an average of several numbers. There is the amount that the vaccine is effective against any infection, mild illness, serious illness/hospitalization, and death, which are all different numbers; and also how effective the vaccine is after say 30, 60 and 90 days. They just average it all into one number. But what most people care about is the effusiveness against serious outcomes after say 30 days. When they used to say that Pfizer was 90% effective and J&amp;J was 70% effective, the difference was primarily in mild illness, which most people don't care about, but most people also don't dig into the details, and they see that 90% is greater than 70% and just assume that the J&amp;J vaccine is 20% better, which is incorrect. Similarly, the justification for booster shots is because vaccine effectiveness ""wanes"" after 6-7 months. But it only wanes against mild illness, and remains the same for serious illness. So people taking their third shots are only slightly reducing their chance of mild illness which is not a lot of benefit.

But I digress.

The news is mostly in Japanese only right now.

Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMD) has very recently posted a press release about the new mutation called N501S which is a mutation from the Delta Strain (B.1.617.2).

Text refers to TMD's ""TL;DR"" section. Translation partially assisted by Google Translate and DeepL.

Throughout July 2021, TMD has confirmed rapidly increased hospitalizations and visits to the TMD Hospital by people infected by the COVID-19 Delta Strain (B.1.617.2)

In mid-August, TMD has identified a new mutation of the Delta strain, ""N501S"". This mutation is similar to the ""N501Y"" mutation of the prevalent Alpha strain.

Mutations mentioned (I'm not a microbiologist so roast me if I got this wrong):

* Alpha =&gt; N501S
* Delta =&gt; N501Y (This is what TMD discovered)

&gt; ÂàÜÂ≠êÁ≥ªÁµ±Ëß£Êûê„ÅÆÁµêÊûú„ÄÅN501SÂ§âÁï∞„ÇíÊúâ„Åô„ÇãÂΩìË©≤„Éá„É´„ÇøÊ†™„ÅØ„ÄÅÂõΩÂÜÖ„ÅßÊñ∞„Åü„Å´Â§âÁï∞„ÇíÁç≤Âæó„Åó„ÅüÂèØËÉΩÊÄß„ÅåÊ•µ„ÇÅ„Å¶È´ò„ÅÑ„Åì„Å®„Åå„Çè„Åã„Çä„Åæ„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ

Based on molecular analysis results, it is highly possible that the new delta mutation ""N501S"" is a newly-acquired one in Japan.

There have been only 8 cases of delta strains reported worldwide, and this is the first case reported in Japan. (GISAID data registered as of 2021/08/27)

Words for Japanese Learners:

* ÂÖ•Èô¢ nyuu'in = hospitalization, to become an inpatient
* ÈÄöÈô¢ tsuu'in = hospital visit
* ÊÑüÊüì kansen = infection (of diseases)
* ‰∫ã‰æã jirei = cases
* ÊÇ£ËÄÖ kanja = patient
* Ê†™ kabu = in addition to the usual meaning of ""stock"" or ""share"" (corporate world), this word also means strain in microbiology.
* Â§âÁï∞ hen'i = mutation

This study demonstrated a significantly higher humoral immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) compared with the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech), in infected as well as uninfected participants, and across age categories. The higher mRNA content in mRNA-1273 compared with BNT162b2 and the longer interval between priming and boosting for mRNA-12733 (4 weeks vs 3 weeks for BNT162b2) might explain this difference.  
  
A relationship between neutralization level after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and protection against COVID-19 has been demonstrated by several studies.4 As such, the height of the humoral response after vaccination, which correlates with neutralizing antibody titers,5 might be clinically relevant.  
  
Limitations of this study include the lack of data on cellular immunity and on neutralizing antibodies, as well as the specific focus on health care workers. Whether the observed difference in antibody level translates to a difference in the duration of protection,4 the protection against variants of concern, and the risk of transmission6 needs further investigation.

So the graph/data gets updated eventually to the correct levels, but the graph will always show that last bit of data with a downward slope because of lag between reporting information and processing information.

There were almost 11k new Covid-19 infections yesterday in Israel  and almost 60% of them were amongst those who were double vaccinated. In general  immunity from infection starts to wane significantly at 5 - 6 months.

The number of serious cases and deaths has also increased as to be expected, but at a  lesser rate than the numbers amongst the unvaccinated.  Israel has about seven hundred seriously ill patients currently and among those 40% were double vaccinated. 

The Israeli ministry of health published a study last week showing a 4 - 10 fold increase in protection after 12 days following the third shot booster.

* An overloaded ER may direct people to other providers. For example, routing possible broken bones to an orthopedic clinic instead of the hospital ER (this actually happened to a family member last winter). 

* If the hospital truly has no capacity left, they will try to limit ANY procedures that could send patients to the hospital.

As if you disagree with what I wrote &amp; as if I'm dismissing the amount of work that nurses perform yet I very clearly stated that nurses were usually understaffed, overworked &amp; underpaid, which is more or less the same argument that you responded with.

I don't work in Health Care but have relatives, family &amp; friends who do &amp; I am also able to see for my own eyes what happens when I go to a Health Care Facility.

You can't assume that your own experience is universal, applies to everyone, everywhere.

Medium to Large organizations/facilities tend to be more strict &amp; keep things tight when it comes to those things, but in smaller places or non-medical organizations that happen to have some medical/nursing personnel on staff, in rural areas &amp; other medical deserts, it is not unheard of for things to be done in whatever way is necessary to get stuff done.

Even in medium to large organizations, it's not unheard of for some minor lines to get crossed by non-medical staff to do whatever it takes to be helpful.
I am not talking about administering actual care to patients, but handling minor tasks whether purely administrative or not in order to help out.

Of course when things are crazy, in a major emergency, with people in a tight spot, squeezed for time &amp; resources, it makes sense things to be all hands on deck &amp; anyone who can help in anyway should be helping in whatever way they can.
The thing is that those things tend to happen often, even in non-emergencies, because the constant under-staffing causes every day to be somewhat of an emergency situation where everyone has to be ready to spring into action to go help, because the only person available to help in those situation is whomever is the closest person nearby instead of an additional medical staff member waiting nearby on standby.",,,,1630440400,{},hb3kqwl,False,t3_pco9w8,False,True,t1_hb2uyo4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pco9w8/new_york_approves_covid_vaccine_mandate_for/hb3kqwl/,1630523920.0,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was a very logical decision in light of limited vaccines and the relatively strong protection a single dose gave for the variants in circulation at the time. While 16 weeks was probably too long (due to exposure risk), 8 to 12 weeks was a no-brainer in terms of maximizing protection in society. 

Israel didn't do it because they had massive supply relative to population - they were able to vaccinate almost their entire high risk groups before most countries had even started their vaccination program. The US did it because.. well, we're the US and the name of the game is cover your ass. While not quite as good, the US also had a much stronger supply than most other countries. 

I agree that there is a balance between risk between doses, but it was always obvious to everyone that 4 weeks (and especially Pfizer's 3 weeks) was suboptimal for triggering the best immune response. Pfizer and Moderna picked those durations to be the *minimum possible window* where there would be a distinct and separate immune response to the second dose than the first dose.

The data showed that many Israelis who had been among the first to receive the vaccine were nonetheless catching the Covid virus. Israelis who had been vaccinated later were not getting infected as often.

The study led to headlines around the world about waning immunity ‚Äî the idea that vaccines lose their effectiveness over time. In the U.S., the Israeli study accelerated a debate about vaccine booster shots and played a role in the Biden administration‚Äôs recent recommendation that all Americans receive a booster shot eight months after their second dose.

But the real story about waning immunity is more complex than the initial headlines suggested. Some scientists believe that the Israeli data was misleading and that U.S. policy on booster shots has gotten ahead of the facts. The evidence for waning immunity is murky, these scientists say, and booster shots may not have a big effect.

After returning from an August break last week, I have spent time reaching out to scientists to ask for their help in understanding the current, confusing stage of the pandemic. How worried should vaccinated people be about the Delta variant? How much risk do children face? Which parts of the Covid story are being overhyped, and which deserve more attention?

I will be trying to answer these questions in the coming weeks. (I‚Äôd also like to know what questions you want answered; submit them here.)

One of the main messages I‚Äôm hearing from the experts is that conventional wisdom about waning immunity is problematic. Yes, the immunity from the Covid vaccines will wane at some point. But it may not yet have waned in a meaningful way.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a big difference between needing another shot every six months versus every five years,‚Äù Dr. David Dowdy, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, told me. ‚ÄúSo far, looking at the data we have, I‚Äôm not seeing much evidence that we‚Äôve reached that point yet.‚Äù


At first glance, the Israeli data seems straightforward: People who had been vaccinated in the winter were more likely to contract the virus this summer than people who had been vaccinated in the spring.

Yet it would truly be proof of waning immunity only if the two groups ‚Äî the winter and spring vaccine recipients ‚Äî were otherwise similar to each other. If not, the other differences between them might be the real reason for the gap in the Covid rates.

As it turns out, the two groups were different. The first Israelis to have received the vaccine tended to be more affluent and educated. By coincidence, these same groups later were among the first exposed to the Delta variant, perhaps because they were more likely to travel. Their higher infection rate may have stemmed from the new risks they were taking, not any change in their vaccine protection.

Statisticians have a name for this possibility ‚Äî when topline statistics point to a false conclusion that disappears when you examine subgroups. It‚Äôs called Simpson‚Äôs Paradox.

This paradox may also explain some of the U.S. data that the C.D.C. has cited to justify booster shots. Many Americans began to resume more indoor activities this spring. That more were getting Covid may reflect their newfound Covid exposure (as well as the arrival of Delta), rather than any waning of immunity over time.

‚ÄòWhere is it?‚Äô
Sure enough, other data supports the notion that vaccine immunity is not waning much.

The ratio of positive Covid tests among older adults and children, for example, does not seem to be changing, Dowdy notes. If waning immunity were a major problem, we should expect to see a faster rise in Covid cases among older people (who were among the first to receive shots). And even the Israeli analysis showed that the vaccines continued to prevent serious Covid illness at essentially the same rate as before.

‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs data proving the need for boosters, where is it?‚Äù Zeynep Tufekci, the sociologist and Times columnist, has written.

Part of the problem is that the waning-immunity story line is irresistible to many people. The vaccine makers ‚Äî Pfizer, Moderna and others ‚Äî have an incentive to promote it, because booster shots will bring them big profits. The C.D.C. and F.D.A., for their part, have a history of extreme caution, even when it harms public health. We in the media tend to suffer from bad-news bias. And many Americans are so understandably frightened by Covid that they pay more attention to alarming signs than reassuring ones.

The bottom line
Here‚Äôs my best attempt to give you an objective summary of the evidence, free from alarmism ‚Äî and acknowledging uncertainty:

Immunity does probably wane modestly within the first year of receiving a shot. For this reason, booster shots make sense for vulnerable people, many experts believe. As Dr. C√©line Gounder of Bellevue Hospital Center told my colleague Apoorva Mandavilli, the C.D.C.‚Äôs data ‚Äúsupport giving additional doses of vaccine to highly immunocompromised persons and nursing home residents, not to the general public.‚Äù

The current booster shots may do little good for most people. The vaccines continue to provide excellent protection against illness (as opposed to merely a positive Covid test). People will eventually need boosters, but it may make more sense to wait for one specifically designed to combat a variant. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know whether a non-Delta booster would improve protection against Delta,‚Äù Dr. Aaron Richterman of the University of Pennsylvania told me.

A national policy of frequent booster shots has significant costs, financially and otherwise. Among other things, the exaggerated discussion of waning immunity contributes to vaccine skepticism.

While Americans are focusing on booster shots, other policies may do much more to beat back Covid, including more vaccine mandates in the U.S.; a more rapid push to vaccinate the world (and prevent other variants from taking root); and an accelerated F.D.A. study of vaccines for children.

As always, we should be open to changing our minds as we get new evidence. As Richterman puts it, ‚ÄúWe have time to gather the appropriate evidence before rushing into boosters.‚Äù",,,,1630432025,{},hb311cv,True,t3_pfaxne,False,False,t3_pfaxne,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pfaxne/the_morning_is_vaccine_immunity_really_waning/hb311cv/,1630512662.0,37,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

J&amp;J appeared to be less effective at first mainly because they ran their clinical trials later than Pfizer or Moderna, when the South African variant was having a major impact on infections. 

More recently, J&amp;J has appeared to provide similar resistance to the Delta variant as the mRNA vaccines, although there‚Äôs just not as much data on the J&amp;J vaccine as there is on the mRNA ones.

The lack of studies/trials for J&amp;J be Delta is a bit frustrating given how many studies have been done on the mRNA vaccines in comparison, likely due to their novelty. Even though the J&amp;J hasn‚Äôt been around for as long there still should be more delta variant studies at this point. The J&amp;J is the most viable vaccine option for most of the world as well because it just requires refrigeration and not freezing like the others, and is just one shot, so it‚Äôs easier to distribute at scale. 

Interestingly, the J&amp;J booster shot appears to be very effective at producing antibodies in an early trial, so we may see the booster recommendation coming around the time it gets FDA approval.

Yes and no.  Mormons also believe they can experience their own personal revelations, just like Joseph Smith did.  In fact that was one of the quotes in the article.

I think saying that all Mormons believe this is like saying all Catholics really believe they're eating a piece of Jesus when they take communion.  There are certainly some Catholics who believe in transubstantiation, but every one I've met has said no, not really.

As an ex-Mo I find this amusing, infuriating and also not the least bit surprising.  I learned there were non-believers attending events regularly for a variety of reasons at a fairly young age.

&gt;A second vaccination with 100 Œºg was not administered because of the increased reactogenicity and a lack of meaningfully increased immunogenicity after a single dose compared with the 30-Œºg dose. 

Basically after the 1st dose there was a similar immune response between 30 Œºg and 100 Œºg and there were issues with reactions with 100 Œºg.

&gt;Systemic events increased with dose level and were reported in a greater number of participants after the second dose (10-Œºg and 30-Œºg groups). After the first dose, fever (defined as ‚â•38.0 ¬∞C) was reported by 8.3% (1 out of 12) of participants who received 10 Œºg and 30 Œºg BNT162b1 and by 50.0% (6 out of 12) of individuals who received 100 Œºg BNT162b1. After the second dose, 8.3% (1 out of 12) of participants who received 10 Œºg BNT162b1 and 75.0% (9 out of 12) of participants who received 30 Œºg BNT162b1 reported fever of ‚â•38.0 ¬∞C. On the basis of the reactogenicity reported after the first dose of 100 Œºg and the second dose of 30 Œºg, participants who received an initial 100-Œºg dose did not receive a second 100-Œºg dose.

Which does seem to match with peoples reports of greater side effects from Moderna than Pfizer.

Pfizer has an experience with the whole process so they already begin next step before people even start talking about it. Moderna is new and learns what's next after Pfizer already did it.

Pfizer got approval for 12+ first, got approval for a booster, also already is finishing trials for 6m+.

It doesn't mean it is better, it is just more familiar what needs to be done. BioNTech made a good decision to work with them.

Ultimately all vaccines will get full approval, there was nothing that showed they aren't safe. Somebody gave a good analogy, that FDA approval isn't like a test, it's more like PhD dissertation. Your professors don't let you get to the point to defend your PhD thesis without being sure you pass it, to not embarrass yourself.

I know that we can't really have perfect science during a time of crisis like this, but this is really, really unscientific thinking. Just because something is logical doesn't mean that it is true, and plenty of things in the history of medicine/science have seemed logical but then turned out to be false or dangerous once they were actually tested and measured, such as lobotomies. Also, for women, this type of talking point is probably not remotely comforting, as throughout history women's health issues have been brushed aside by male doctor's and scientists who assumed their bodies were fundamentally the same as a men's and that therefore, *logically*, anything that was safe and good for a man was also safe and good for a women. In fact, [until 1993](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/toolkit/recruitment/history), women were not even required by law to be included in clinical trials for pharmaceuticals, and the NIH didn't formally recommend that sex be considered a biological variable [until 2016](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sites/orwh/files/docs/NOT-OD-15-102%20Guidance.pdf). It turns out that women's bodies are [somewhat different that those of men in some ways](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/women-are-overmedicated-because-drug-dosage-trials-are-done-men-study-finds) and that the previous logic was wrong.

The article you link in that post ironically is one with N501Y and E484K, which are 2 mutations we know to be wary of (E484K is actually the only mutation thats labeled as a mutation of concern. It seemingly can be tacked on to any virus and provide significant levels of immune evasion, often at a cost of transmission rate). N501Y is believed to increase transmisibilty. 

That double-mutated strain never took off though, even though it's been sequenced at reasonable numbers since then, which implies it didn't just die from a fluke.

Wrong. It was vaccines that brought my state down to acceptable levels, not masks. Mask should not even be in the same sentence as vaccines in terms of effectiveness. Right now they are much more a symbol of how much one cares about safety than an actual tool of mitigation. 

&gt; And yet masks are still going to be necessary to get infection rates down to non-disaster levels. That's just where we are.

Nope, my state took vaccinations seriously and even with the surge we‚Äôre holding strong. We don‚Äôt have near zero hospitalizations like we did a while ago, but we are nowhere near our old peak or risk of collapse, and people with other medical needs are easily seen.

&gt; You actually find that on their website, or is that just a Joe Rogan thing?

It‚Äôs literally on their website. Along with telling people to not eat eggs that weren‚Äôt refrigerated and uncooked cookie dough. And im not a Joe Rogan listener, and not on the right. The right shouldn‚Äôt get to have a monopoly on showing faces.

&gt; Tell yourself whatever you think you need to pretend that you know more about ending a pandemic than the CDC.

The CDC doesn‚Äôt even have a definition for when the pandemic is ‚Äúover‚Äù. My highly vaccinated state has low hospitalizations in spite of the surge. If that‚Äôs not considered good enough, than they are going to ask for zero Covid to appease the public, even though we‚Äôll never achieve it. Not to mention that the CDC is a nationwide organization and gives broad recommendations that apply to the country as a whole, but there are outliers, such as we‚Äôre I live where most adults are vaccinated. 

My governor has his own state health advisors who advise him that a mask mandate is not necessary for us and not likely to be necessary, except in hospitals and schools until kids can get vaccinated.

I originally stated that we have handled this pandemic worse than the plague was handled. I stand by that as so many of the deaths that have occurred were preventable, if we had acted properly from the start the virus would have not spread and mutated the way it has. 

The only arguments you have given were that the plague was more deadly than Covid. The people in the 1300's knew nothing about germ theory etc etc.

That's fine if you don't agree with my opinion but you have offered nothing to back up your claims that I am wrong.

The SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA  vaccines BNT162b2  and mRNA-1273  have each shown more than 90% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 illness1,2 but, to our knowledge, humoral immune responses have not been compared directly.

Methods

Health care workers at a tertiary care center  who were scheduled for vaccination with 2 doses of either mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 were invited to participate in this prospective cohort. Serologic testing was performed prior to vaccination as well as 6 to 10 weeks after the second dose . Total immunoglobulin levels to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were measured with an anti‚ÄìSARS-CoV-2 S enzyme immunoassay . After vaccination, antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein were determined. Previous infection was defined as anti-nucleocapsid positivity at any point, anti-spike positivity before vaccination, and/or a history of positive polymerase chain reaction results on nasopharyngeal swab.

Antibody levels were compared after the second dose of each vaccine for the entire cohort; for those previously infected vs uninfected; and by age group  among previously uninfected individuals, using the t test after log10 transformation. Correlation between age and log10-transformed antibody levels was assessed with Pearson correlation. To adjust for confounding, a multiple linear regression was fitted with inclusion of age, sex, previous infection, and time between vaccination and serologic testing. All tests were 2-sided with statistical significance set at Œ±‚Äâ=‚Äâ.05. Analyses were performed using RStudio . This study was approved by the local institutional review board; participants provided written informed consent.
Results

Of 2499 health care workers who received 2 doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, 1647 participated in this study. A total of 688 were vaccinated with mRNA-1273 , and 959 with BNT162b2 .

Higher antibody titers were observed in participants vaccinated with 2 doses of mRNA-1273 compared with those vaccinated with BNT162b2  .

Previously infected participants had higher antibody titers  compared with previously uninfected participants  . In both groups, those vaccinated with mRNA-1273 had higher antibody titers compared with those vaccinated with BNT162b2 . The difference in antibody levels according to previous infection was higher than the difference between the 2 mRNA vaccines .

Antibody levels negatively correlated with age in previously uninfected participants , being highest among those younger than 35 years. Across all age categories, previously uninfected participants vaccinated with mRNA-1273 had higher antibody titers compared with those vaccinated with BNT162b2 .

The type of mRNA vaccine remained independently associated with the log-transformed antibody titer in a multiple linear regression .
Discussion

This study demonstrated a significantly higher humoral immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccine  compared with the BNT162b2 vaccine , in infected as well as uninfected participants, and across age categories. The higher mRNA content in mRNA-1273 compared with BNT162b2 and the longer interval between priming and boosting for mRNA-12733  might explain this difference.

A relationship between neutralization level after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and protection against COVID-19 has been demonstrated by several studies.4 As such, the height of the humoral response after vaccination, which correlates with neutralizing antibody titers,5 might be clinically relevant.

Limitations of this study include the lack of data on cellular immunity and on neutralizing antibodies, as well as the specific focus on health care workers. Whether the observed difference in antibody level translates to a difference in the duration of protection,4 the protection against variants of concern, and the risk of transmission6 needs further investigation. Future research should also address the relevance for patients with reduced antibody response after vaccination.",,,,1630426572,{},hb2nf6y,False,t3_pf8440,False,True,t3_pf8440,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pf8440/comparison_of_sarscov2_antibody_response/hb2nf6y/,1630505027.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abstract  
Aims  
The Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a global pandemic requiring global responses. The objective of this paper is to identify the common factors of COVID-19 cases and deaths among the 50 most affected countries.  
  
Methods  
We performed Ordinary least squares among a wide range of socio-economic, environmental, climatic and health indicators to explain the number of cases and deaths.  
  
Results  
The findings are: (i) obesity is the only significant global denominator for the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths; (ii) the percentage of the population over the age of 65 and number of hospital beds per 1000 population inversely correlated to mortality from COVID-19.  
  
Conclusions  
Obesity increases vulnerability to COVID-19 infections and mortality. Global awareness of obesity and social investment in health infrastructure are pre-requisite for a pandemic adaptive future.

[],,PoppyVetiver,,,[],,,,text,t2_j2t9v,False,False,[],"Late last month, researchers in Israel released some alarming new Covid-19 data. The data showed that many Israelis who had been among the first to receive the vaccine were nonetheless catching the Covid virus. Israelis who had been vaccinated later were not getting infected as often.The study led to headlines around the world about waning immunity ‚Äî the idea that vaccines lose their effectiveness over time. In the U.S., the Israeli study accelerated a debate about vaccine booster shots and played a role in the Biden administration‚Äôs recent recommendation that all Americans receive a booster shot eight months after their second dose.But the real story about waning immunity is more complex than the initial headlines suggested. Some scientists believe that the Israeli data was misleading and that U.S. policy on booster shots has gotten ahead of the facts. The evidence for waning immunity is murky, these scientists say, and booster shots may not have a big effect.After returning from an August break last week, I have spent time reaching out to scientists to ask for their help in understanding the current, confusing stage of the pandemic. How worried should vaccinated people be about the Delta variant? How much risk do children face? Which parts of the Covid story are being overhyped, and which deserve more attention?

I will be trying to answer these questions in the coming weeks. (I‚Äôd also like to know what questions you want answered; submit them here.)One of the main messages I‚Äôm hearing from the experts is that conventional wisdom about waning immunity is problematic. Yes, the immunity from the Covid vaccines will wane at some point. But it may not yet have waned in a meaningful way.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a big difference between needing another shot every six months versus every five years,‚Äù Dr. David Dowdy, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, told me. ‚ÄúSo far, looking at the data we have, I‚Äôm not seeing much evidence that we‚Äôve reached that point yet.‚ÄùAt first glance, the Israeli data seems straightforward: People who had been vaccinated in the winter were more likely to contract the virus this summer than people who had been vaccinated in the spring.Yet it would truly be proof of waning immunity only if the two groups ‚Äî the winter and spring vaccine recipients ‚Äî were otherwise similar to each other. If not, the other differences between them might be the real reason for the gap in the Covid rates.

As it turns out, the two groups were different. The first Israelis to have received the vaccine tended to be more affluent and educated. By coincidence, these same groups later were among the first exposed to the Delta variant, perhaps because they were more likely to travel. Their higher infection rate may have stemmed from the new risks they were taking, not any change in their vaccine protection.Statisticians have a name for this possibility ‚Äî when topline statistics point to a false conclusion that disappears when you examine subgroups. It‚Äôs called Simpson‚Äôs Paradox.This paradox may also explain some of the U.S. data that the C.D.C. has cited to justify booster shots. 

&amp;#x200B;

Many Americans began to resume more indoor activities this spring. That more were getting Covid may reflect their newfound Covid exposure (as well as the arrival of Delta), rather than any waning of immunity over time.‚ÄòWhere is it?‚ÄôSure enough, other data supports the notion that vaccine immunity is not waning much.The ratio of positive Covid tests among older adults and children, for example, does not seem to be changing, Dowdy notes. If waning immunity were a major problem, we should expect to see a faster rise in Covid cases among older people (who were among the first to receive shots). And even the Israeli analysis showed that the vaccines continued to prevent serious Covid illness at essentially the same rate as before.‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs data proving the need for boosters, where is it?‚Äù Zeynep Tufekci, the sociologist and Times columnist, has written.Part of the problem is that the waning-immunity story line is irresistible to many people. The vaccine makers ‚Äî Pfizer, Moderna and others ‚Äî have an incentive to promote it, because booster shots will bring them big profits. The C.D.C. and F.D.A., for their part, have a history of extreme caution, even when it harms public health. We in the media tend to suffer from bad-news bias. And many Americans are so understandably frightened by Covid that they pay more attention to alarming signs than reassuring ones.  


The bottom line:

&amp;#x200B;

Here‚Äôs my best attempt to give you an objective summary of the evidence, free from alarmism ‚Äî and acknowledging uncertainty:Immunity does probably wane modestly within the first year of receiving a shot. For this reason, booster shots make sense for vulnerable people, many experts believe. As Dr. C√©line Gounder of Bellevue Hospital Center told my colleague Apoorva Mandavilli, the C.D.C.‚Äôs data ‚Äúsupport giving additional doses of vaccine to highly immunocompromised persons and nursing home residents, not to the general public.‚Äù",,,,1630422853,{},hb2e814,True,t3_pf72ll,False,False,t1_hb29rgm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pf72ll/is_vaccine_immunity_waning_it_may_not_really_be/hb2e814/,1630500020.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

To be fair, I don't think the way you said it is technically wrong, just that it is open to being misinterpreted.

I understand I'm splitting hairs here, but it is more appropriate to say you have an 88% lower chance of being infected (which is not the same as a 12% chance of infection). efficacy rates are the reduction of an outcome/infection of vaccinated group compared to an unvaccinated group ([Efficacy against outcome = (unvaccinated outcome rate - vaccinated outcome rate) / vaccinated outcome rate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_efficacy)). It is possible that the actual chance of getting infected is lower or higher but those determinations would require separate trials to be determined and it is not appropriate to infer based on the efficacy treats; for instance if your exact situation were replicatedwith populations of vaccinated and unvaccinated partners, it is possible only a percentage of the unvaccinated would have contacted the virus (in which case it would be expected that 88% fewer vaccinated people would get infected/more than 88% would have avoided the virus); conversely if most or every unvaccinated person got infected you could have more than 12% in the vaccinated group who also got infected. Basically statistics make it complicated and while recognizing science is important, understanding it and representing it appropriately is also important. 

As I wrap this up, I'm not satisfied with my explanation either but am mostly annoyed that I feel it is necessary (at those who understand enough to use data in their disputes of it whilst simultaneously claiming its meaningless, not at you or your comment).

Here's what the CDC ([https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/spread.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/spread.htm)) has to say: ""People with flu are most contagious in the first three to four days after their illness begins.""

As for your third link, they are speculating that this coronavirus may become mild like the other 4, but as was my original point, those other ones are most contagious after symptoms start.

J&amp;J was very effective against the original strains of covid. Keep in mind, a vaccine efficacy of 60% was already solid so with J&amp;J at 85% vs Pfizer and Moderna, it's like splitting hairs. Now at the same time I'm also going to say- efficacy is not a great measurement either. We get wrapped up in these percentages as an easy marker but the way it's measured is highly dependent on the study group, time, etc. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3odScka55A is a great explainer.

Moreover, J&amp;J's effectiveness hits full strength two weeks after it's administered. Pfizer and Moderna's effectiveness doesn't come in until two weeks after the second shot, or 3-4 weeks after the first shot.

Another plausible explanation is Simpson's paradox. This is statistical phenomena that can skew the interpretation when correlations in the data are not properly accounted for. In the case of covid, we see the highest rate of vaccination in the high risk demographics. 

High risk vaccinated individuals, are less likely to be hospitalized than high risk unvaccinated individuals. But high risk vaccinated individuals are also more likely to be hospitalized than low risk vaccinated individuals. And some of the highest risk vaccinated individuals may be more likely to be hospitalized than lowest risk unvaccinated individuals. 

The combined higher vaccinated rate among the higher risk individuals skews the interpretation. This effect will make the vaccines look like they are less effective that they truly are if you look at the population as a whole. To get a true sense of the effectiveness of the vaccine you have to look at individual demographics separately.

[],,HamburgerManKnows,,,[],,,,text,t2_5kcw6r6q,False,False,[],"‚ÄúOne of the main messages I‚Äôm hearing from the experts is that conventional wisdom about waning immunity is problematic. Yes, the immunity from the Covid vaccines will wane at some point. But it may not yet have waned in a meaningful way.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a big difference between needing another shot every six months versus every five years,‚Äù Dr. David Dowdy, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, told me. ‚ÄúSo far, looking at the data we have, I‚Äôm not seeing much evidence that we‚Äôve reached that point yet.‚Äù

Simpson strikes again

At first glance, the Israeli data seems straightforward: People who had been vaccinated in the winter were more likely to contract the virus this summer than people who had been vaccinated in the spring.

Yet it would truly be proof of waning immunity only if the two groups ‚Äî the winter and spring vaccine recipients ‚Äî were otherwise similar to each other. If not, the other differences between them might be the real reason for the gap in the Covid rates.

As it turns out, the two groups were different. The first Israelis to have received the vaccine tended to be more affluent and educated. By coincidence, these same groups later were among the first exposed to the Delta variant, perhaps because they were more likely to travel. Their higher infection rate may have stemmed from the new risks they were taking, not any change in their vaccine protection.

Statisticians have a name for this possibility ‚Äî when topline statistics point to a false conclusion that disappears when you examine subgroups. It‚Äôs called Simpson‚Äôs Paradox.

This paradox may also explain some of the U.S. data that the C.D.C. has cited to justify booster shots. Many Americans began to resume more indoor activities this spring. That more were getting Covid may reflect their newfound Covid exposure (as well as the arrival of Delta), rather than any waning of immunity over time.

‚ÄòWhere is it?‚Äô

Sure enough, other data supports the notion that vaccine immunity is not waning much.

The ratio of positive Covid tests among older adults and children, for example, does not seem to be changing, Dowdy notes. If waning immunity were a major problem, we should expect to see a faster rise in Covid cases among older people (who were among the first to receive shots). And even the Israeli analysis showed that the vaccines continued to prevent serious Covid illness at essentially the same rate as before.

‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs data proving the need for boosters, where is it?‚Äù Zeynep Tufekci, the sociologist and Times columnist, has written.

Part of the problem is that the waning-immunity story line is irresistible to many people. The vaccine makers ‚Äî Pfizer, Moderna and others ‚Äî have an incentive to promote it, because booster shots will bring them big profits. The C.D.C. and F.D.A., for their part, have a history of extreme caution, even when it harms public health. We in the media tend to suffer from bad-news bias. And many Americans are so understandably frightened by Covid that they pay more attention to alarming signs than reassuring ones.

The bottom line

Here‚Äôs my best attempt to give you an objective summary of the evidence, free from alarmism ‚Äî and acknowledging uncertainty:

Immunity does probably wane modestly within the first year of receiving a shot. For this reason, booster shots make sense for vulnerable people, many experts believe. As Dr. C√©line Gounder of Bellevue Hospital Center told my colleague Apoorva Mandavilli, the C.D.C.‚Äôs data ‚Äúsupport giving additional doses of vaccine to highly immunocompromised persons and nursing home residents, not to the general public.‚Äù

The current booster shots may do little good for most people. The vaccines continue to provide excellent protection against illness (as opposed to merely a positive Covid test). People will eventually need boosters, but it may make more sense to wait for one specifically designed to combat a variant. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know whether a non-Delta booster would improve protection against Delta,‚Äù Dr. Aaron Richterman of the University of Pennsylvania told me.

A national policy of frequent booster shots has significant costs, financially and otherwise. Among other things, the exaggerated discussion of waning immunity contributes to vaccine skepticism.

While Americans are focusing on booster shots, other policies may do much more to beat back Covid, including more vaccine mandates in the U.S.; a more rapid push to vaccinate the world (and prevent other variants from taking root); and an accelerated F.D.A. study of vaccines for children.

As always, we should be open to changing our minds as we get new evidence. As Richterman puts it, ‚ÄúWe have time to gather the appropriate evidence before rushing into boosters.‚Äù",,,,1630429677,{},hb2v55v,False,t3_pf72ll,False,True,t3_pf72ll,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pf72ll/is_vaccine_immunity_waning_it_may_not_really_be/hb2v55v/,1630509371.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The amount of energy that must be used on AC/Water must be staggering. I cant imagine what kind of infrastructure overhaul would need to be made to have entire sections of the country functioning in a similar way. I really think Vegas will be the canary in the coal mine.

Money cant fix everything, and mother nature will always win in the end. She's got time on her side.

Will the classroom with only vaccination and no NPI be safe for a student who lives with vulnerable people or children and/or  an infant or newborn? What if that student wears N95 masks but no one else is masking in a small classroom? 

The concern is getting infected in class and bringing the virus home. The pulmonologist treating a vulnerable adult and the pediatrician treating the infant have advised an unmasked classroom is unsafe even with vaccination.

Then Delta came along and we're hearing all these people who are fully vaxxed and still getting sick - sometimes very sick - with covid. The thing almost all of them have in common is that they were vaxxed with Pfizer. 

I personally have not heard of anyone sick with covid who is fully vaxxed with Moderna, not to say that it doesn't happen. We live in MS, the state that has been called the #1 covid hotspot in the world due to our low population and prevalence of near unmitigated spread of the virus.

This is likely the main reason for Delta's infectiousness -- people with it just carry a much higher viral load, and therefore their coughs and sneezes and such carry many more viruses. It's also why even imperfect masking (single-layer cloth masks, poorly fitted N95s, etc.) still helps -- sure, you may still get exposed, but you'll probably be exposed to a lower viral load than you would have been without the mask, and thus be more capable of resisting infection or at least getting a milder case.

So there's no quantity of antibodies that prevents infection, just a ""more is better"" general trend.

The response from those cells to an active infection takes longer (a few days), but the protection lasts for many years.

One hospital.  

It says those that werent exposed but i dont believe we can know that for sure.  Small sample. Large sample size over several sites.

Also what does this mean in hispanic/black/asian?

What is acceptable line for antibodies?  What is rate of decline?  For example if you need 50 antibodies per nanoliter to be effective  but pfizer gives 500 and moderna 990 then its moot. 

If on day 14 pfizer is 400 and moderna is 600, then on day 60 pfizer is200 and moderna is 202. And so on.


Thats why hospitizations and death are good clinical outcomes. 

Both vaccines work great. Period.  Otherwise you would see huge jumps in hospitalizations from the pfizer group. Honestly out of the 8000 or so hospitalized or dead and completely vaccinated how many are moderna vs pfizer?  Also 75% of those are 65 and up. So that means they were more likely to get pfizer before moderna was approved. So even then you would have to account for accessibility.

Wife tested positive on one of the at-home Walgreens (binaxNOW antigen self-test) tests. 

Practically no symptoms, just mild congestion we originally attributed to the poor air quality due to the wildfires. 

So now I'm trying to get tested because I've been directly exposed, but can't find anywhere to get a test. Walgreens are sold out of in-home tests and on-site tests at the dozen+ places I've looked at are booked up for at least 48 hours.

How can we be this deep into a pandemic, 1.5 years in, and still have testing limitations? 

We pushed through a vaccine in record time. We developed, mass produced, and distributed numerous different types of tests, have moved the earth to make this situation better, but we still can't get a test when we need one.

I made a mistake saying ""clearly"", because in reality its not so cut and dry. 

I will say, that in my anecdotal experience, if you werent working in a ""safe"" industry, you were pretty much screwed for a few months. Service industry, entertainment, basically anything not deemed essential. 

My brother didnt start getting unemployment payments deposited until July, and he was calling daily starting in April. If you were relying on that income to cover living expenses or make up for lost income, you probably were not thinking about having kids because you suddenly had more money coming on temporarily. 

On top of that,  I'd imagine that suddenly having to live off of welfare or government assistance would probably have a negative impact on someone wanting to have kids or not. I know that people who are not well off have kids all the time, but thats a different set of circumstances from someone who sees their quality of life drop rapidly (relatively speaking) over a short period of time. 

 Theres also a difference between having more income, and consistent income. If you lost your job in April 2020, had collected MORE in payments from unemployment, but werent able to find a replacement job to match your previous salary, that still seems like a step backwards, especially if you wanted to have kids, considering that a lot of people spent their stimulus/unemployment on either a) existing debt or b) to cover their current living expenses. 

Im sure there are cases of people who saved appropriately and reinvested that money in themselves and it paid off, id wager those cases are the minority.

If you live in the West, it's still one of the safest times in human history to be born. Look at life expectancy or infant mortality 100 or 200 years ago. Look at where they are in less prosperous parts of the world. Were our ancestors wrong to procreate? Was life so horrific in pre-modern or pre-industrial times that life was not worth living because of their relative danger and hardship? The fact is humans are incredibly resilient and get used to their living conditions very quickly.
