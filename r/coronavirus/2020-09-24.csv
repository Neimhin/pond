I remember checking stats on the Netherlands maybe a month ago, and they were doing significantly better than Sweden (admittedly this was in counted Covid-19 deaths). Either things have gotten much worse, or they are one of the few that are under counting so badly it's enough to make a difference. In either case, it just means they've now joined the ranks of nations with worst responses, my condolences to them.  

I didn't say Belgium over counting is the whole story, just that it might mitigate somewhat, as opposed to the fact that the vast majority of nations are under counting, some by dramatic amounts.  

Regardless of how Sweden got where they are, the preventable deaths they've already had are not coming back, and they are among the ranks of worst performing. I'm not clear why so many are trying to ignore this fact.

&gt;At a news briefing Thursday, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said Swedes had become too relaxed about heeding anti-COVID-19 guidelines, and while they plan to lift a ban on visits to elder care homes, he said the government would not hesitate to implement further restrictions if new cases continued to rise.

&gt;Lofven blamed the recent spike in cases on people letting their guard down. He said, ‚ÄúThe caution that existed in the spring has more and more been replaced by hugs, parties,‚Äù and for many, an attempt to return to ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù

&gt;At a separate news conference Thursday, Sweden's state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, told reporters he believed the country has not seen the rapid spread and resurgence of the virus that other European countries have seen because the restrictions it did implement were left in place. Other countries, like Spain, locked down completely, then reopened.

&gt;Tegnell said it was also possible Sweden could experience the same type of surge in a few weeks.

We have a sales tax called GST. It applies to most goods at a flat rate. It does not apply to basic things like food and rent.

At a low enough income, this is actually more than you likely spend on GST.

Additionally, we have a carbon tax that applies to all goods. All Canadians get essentially the same rebate on their income tax from this collected carbon tax. This rebate is given at the beginning of the year for expected expenses. Thus advantages low-carbon low-income people the most.

Though now defacto VAT, it is essentially the same thing.

Are you listening to yourself?


If you haven't ever not had $50 to set aside, then you don't actually know what it's like to be poor. Poor people aren't all poor because of ""consumer debt"". I was homeless for 3 years because I was kicked out at 17. I got my first pair of socks since turning 17 at 21, because I was literally living off of a dollar a day for a while, and whoever would let me sleep on their couch. So no, some people dont have that. This person told you very little about her life, and you just said, ""You should just move to a new place.""


Do you know how expensive it is to move? If you don't have your own truck, you have to rent one, which is on average, $150. Then, you have to have good credit to live in a place with high enough rent to be safe, and then make enough money to be able to pay that rent. Then, you have to have a deposit worth the first and last month's rent, which can be literally thousands of dollars, which you don't have if you don't have $50 to set aside. 


And no, some people do *not* have family to stay with or keep their kids. Either they don't have a lot of family, or their family is *also working* and cannot afford to take care of children. I make 40k a year and I'm supporting myself and paying some of my SO's bills as he's in school right now, but has a savings. I *don't* have 3 kids and a husband to support and I'm still living very, very modestly.



Again, if you haven't actually been poor (you're not and haven't - it's statistically impossible to pay for college right now while working one job unless you're either making waaaaay above minimum wage, receiving rental assistance / an allowance from your parents, or going to a community College), please don't give advice to the poor.

*Published on Thursday 24 September at 03.03*

**Managers and management of nursing homes did not take the coronavirus seriously when the spread of infection was at its worst. If there are testimonies from nursing homes across the country. The criticism concerns, among other things, staff who have been forced to work without protection and claim to have been silenced by the management. This is shown by Ekot's survey of hundreds of cases received by the Swedish Health and Care Inspectorate.**                     
                         
- Staff ran between the wards and anxious dementia patients who went back and forth, it was complete chaos, says the assistant nurse Birgitta.                       
                             
She is one of those who think that in her workplace it should have been realized earlier that it was important to separate the sick from the infected.                           
                                   
- When you came and asked for protective clothing, you got two mouth guards to share, the hand alcohol was refilled, but nothing else, she continues.                               
                            
Since the first case of covid-19 was found in a Swedish nursing home, more than 800 tips, comments and complaints have been received by the Swedish Health and Care Inspectorate, IVO, which concerns nursing homes during the pandemic.                          
                 
**Ekot has gone through all the** complaints and a large part of the tips that came in to IVO during the spring and summer. At the beginning of the pandemic, people who say they work in specific homes are alerted. Many cases concern that the management has not taken the spread of infection seriously, among other things by not distinguishing the sick from healthy, suspected infected people has not been isolated until test results have been received.                    
                      
Several testify that they tried to point out the shortcomings to the management, without results and some have experienced that nursing homes tried to obscure how serious the situation really was. Many who report do so anonymously and among those with whom Ekot still gets in touch, few dare to talk. The assistant nurse Birgitta is actually called something else.                   
                         
*""I understand that you can not order a million mouth guards that should be enough for everyone. It can not be easy, everyone was taken to bed.""*
                                        
*""On the other hand, I think that perhaps you could have taken this seriously that you should not run between the departments. There, I think you could have taken in with the hard gloves right away""*, she says.                                   
                              
**Many call on IVO** to carry out inspections at their workplaces. The tips and complaints come from all over the country, but most of them concern our metropolitan regions. A person in western Sweden writes:                                   
                        
*‚ÄúThere is a human tragedy going on in silence! We have been left to our fate, both residents and staff. Those who are still working go from infected wards to healthy ones. No risk of spreading‚Ä¶ Cover. No one may provide information to either residents or relatives ‚Äù.*                           
                          
**√Ösa Fur√©n-Thulin** , head of social services in Sweden's municipalities and regions, believes that the situation in nursing homes now looks completely different, that they have learned a lot and that the managers also had a very tough time during this period.                   
                      
*""I think of the enormous frustration and pain and how hard it must have been for both managers and employees and especially for users as well. It has been such a tough journey but I think a lot of this is about ignorance and despair and not being enough. I think if there is a second wave, we will be much much more stable""*, she says.",,,1601048473,{},g6jlqqb,True,t3_izlri8,False,True,t3_izlri8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/izlri8/staff_in_accommodation_alerted_they_were_silenced/g6jlqqb/,1601049049,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Just for clarification, I thought this was a Canadian sub so I was venting about that situation since by and large cases are fairly low enough. The situation in the US is pretty terrible where I wouldn't feel comfortable doing everyday business.

I really sympathize with your reasoning. Personally though from what I have seen though is that people are inherently selfish. People have been doing whatever the hell they have wanted for the last few months because they simply cannot function with living like that without rules in place. This is personally not an issue for me, to each their own. But at the very least if so many people are already doing that then its mental torture to subjegate yourself to be, what seems to be the only one trying to stay locked up and not doing the little pleasures you like. I'm not saying go out and go about your life like before - but at the very least seeing family, friends and having some things you like to do as hobbies shouldn't totally be sacrificied for the ""greater good"". Especially when the system in place will likely create way more vectors than you ever as they encourage everything to be open.

This is coming from someone who was forced to go back to work and watch as multiple ppl were doing whatever they want - flying for weddings, attending parties, opening businesses, etc while still being in quarantine mode. I'm an introvert who had no issues in lockdown honestly (so a minority) but even that was the equivalent of mental torture knowing you are doing everything you can but the large majority of people aren't. If I felt that way I can only extrapolate that many extroverts and such probably totally lost it by now and cannot function in quarentine mode.

For that reason I don't think you can do a half assed corona response where you encourage busisnesses to all be open, schools to be open, but still expect people to be in lockdown mode for their own life. I personally plan to wear a mask anytime im in an indoor space and will pick and choose my outtings based on how passionate I feel about it (so probably no movie theatres, but open to meeting up with close friends and families and occasional gym outtings because that was my biggest passion pre lockdown and its open).  But this coronavirus situation has convinced me rellying on individuals to act accordingly and blaming them when it doesn't work simply doesn't work. If its unsafe - have rules in place to lock it down. At the end of the day people are inherently selfish unfortunately.

I'm just human like everyone else. Being forced into work I kinda lost it after a few months and now I am doing more things that expose me to more people for my own mental health. I am terrified about this virus like everyone else but I truly do feel if I do get it, it will statistically probably be from a work interaction anyway even with PPE. At the end of the day why do we go to work - do sustain our life and fund doing the things we love.

They give you the right to work. In the most basic sense they could fire me tomorrow cause I looked tired and wouldn't have to tell me why I'm fired at all. A decade ago in the same state my brother's best friend broke his leg skateboarding to his minimum wage job at Walmart due to a distracted driver almost hitting him, they fired him a week later for being unable to stand for long periods of time and cited that he was absent over a week ago when he broke his leg as the actual reason he was fired after over a month of him questioning why he was fired. 

If they don't like your attitude, they don't like you questioned your pay, or even if you're a protected class they can and will fire you and you have no right nor way to challenge it. Most jobs though will just pile more and more responsibilities on you so you quit over get fired to avoid paying you the ridiculously small amount for unemployment. I know for a fact I'm a victim of wage theft but I can't fight it at all without losing my job and can't get evidence to prove it due to how the store sets up when we get reduced and minimum wage pay. 

In the case of protected class they can cite whatever else as valid. For instance being habitually late by a few minutes, or taking too long to clock in or out for lunch and piss breaks, or even wearing black nonslip tennis shoes over grey nonslip tennis shoes. They can't cite you were fired for being gay or black or a woman but they'll find something else to claim was the reason and you can't prove otherwise.

The 6 feet social distancing rule is based on the fact that the US CDC and WHO both believe the spread of covid by aerosol is unlikely. But currently, there are suspicions that covid can spread by air. So what should the WHO and the US CDC do? Announce that covid is airborne and get rid of the 6 feet rule? Or keep the 6 feet rule?

Well, I have read an article (couldn't find, sorry, it is weekend now, and I am getting lazy), that Chinese contact tracing teams found the biggest distance where infection was proven was 7m, so to be on the safe side, I think WHO should advocate for that. However 6 feet distance already considerably reduces the risks, and maintaining 7m distance from everyone at all times is hardly practical, so I can accept that as a ""Meh, good enough"".

&gt; People from other provinces are Chinese citizens.

That is hardly an argument against maintaining an effective quarantene.

&gt; There are many countries that have implemented quarantines. Which of these countries have banned foreigners from leaving their country?

Spain did for example. We (Hungary) also had a short period when no one was allowed to cross the border for any reason AFAIK.

&gt; Instead, a better strategy is not to have a ban, but a more controlled evacuation.

Why not both? ROC banned commercial flights in December, as said, but it still evacuated its citizens from the PRC in an orderly fashion over time.

&gt; Why are you blaming the WHO but not the US government for essentially doing the same thing?

Have you read my comments? 

&gt; Of course, the US fucked up so badly it is not even funny, and the earlier incompetence and cover-up attempts of the WHO and the PRC pale in comparison.

&gt; So, to reiterate, there are plenty of decisions that the WHO can be blamed for, and no, they haven't done their job well. They did a better job than the US government, yes, but that is an incredibly low bar.

How am I *not* blaming the US government? In fact I am saying they did a much worse job than WHO.

I worked in a call center for my local tv/internet provider for 4 years. I ended up quitting because I couldn‚Äôt go in to work without having a panic attack and crying on the parking lot. 
The company itself was awful,  I was a single mom who took the job because it was well above minimum wage AND full benefits. If my kid was sick he wasn‚Äôt allowed at daycare so I couldn‚Äôt go to work or I‚Äôd be late finding a sitter, which I 1000% is NOT the company‚Äôs problem by any means. They were AWFUL to me though, would treat me like shit the whole day for trying to juggle my life. 
The sales tactics  they used were disgusting, if an 80 year old woman called in for help with her bill, offer her internet. Doesn‚Äôt have a computer? Easy. Sign her up for a 2 year term and give her a free laptop! Doesn‚Äôt know how to use it? Do it anyways, she can‚Äôt cancel for 2 years. 
I became pregnant with my second child and was pretty far along when I started to hemorrhage at work. When I told my manager she rolled her eyes and asked ‚Äúwhat does that mean? What do you need?‚Äù While I was hysterical. A coworker drove me to the hospital and I was written up for leaving early. I called a meeting with my union rep over the one and she ganged up on me with the manager. 
My dr took me off work for a month 2 years later to try and get me on some medications because I was STILL struggling with post partum depression which had turned into a full fledged anxiety disorder. I did all the proper protocols, filled out and filed all the forms according to their policies and went on leave. Came back, and they decided at some point that they didn‚Äôt actually want to approve it so now I was going to be investigated and fired. I didn‚Äôt go through ALL the avenues. They require that I use their in house confidential counselling service, so too bad for me. 
Except I DID and they referred me to my doctor. I had to print out an email with their counsellor to prove it.

For example, people with A blood group are much more susceptible to the virus than other blood groups.
India's population has a majority of the B+ blood group (nearly 40% of the population have that) while about 20% of them have an A+ group.
This is opposite to what you see in many western countries, where the majority is the A+ blood group.

The bad: 

1. don't underestimate the need to limit index cases and act quickly at the start of the epidemic. Don't \*assume\* only travelers from a specific country only are affected, for example. Having quarantines when the situation isn't clear risks being one quaranine too many, but next time that's what will happen, and people will understand. Sweden had 10% of it's entire population travel abroad in the period of the Lombardy outbreak. Many to  the alps. 

2. don't think saying ""need to protect the elderly"" actually accomplishes it. The funding, training and equipment needs to be there too. It wasn't. 

3. Don't scrap your civil preparedness just because the cold war ends (field hospitals, reserves of PPE). Sweden had massive cold war resources with half a dozen huge field hosipitals and so on. All scrapped just in recent times. When the pandemic hit, there were basically 1-2 field hospitals available.  


The good:

1.  Don't impose restrictions (unless absolutely necessary) that can't be maintained long term. E.g. don't risk having a strict restriction that you ""have"" to  lift, at a point in time that may even be worse than when it was added, such as in a cold season. 

2. Don't make complex rules and change them quickly causing confusion. Don't have travel restrictions from regions X and Y of country Z and the next day only region Y and only if you have the right paperwork...  Same thing: don't change it if you think it will change again next week. Change the rules if you genuinely believe the new set of rules are sustainable.

3. Ask people to follow restrictions instead of forcing them to, but also make it \*possible\* to do so, by quickly changing sick leave laws, adding emergency funding for businesses so businesses can still pay salaries, rents and so on.

4. Care for small children (daycare and school for young kids) should be kept open as long as possible because the positive effects of allowing parents in important jobs like nurses to work outweighs the small increased spread it creates.",,,1601030316,{},g6itv6e,False,t3_izgtp1,False,True,t3_izgtp1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/izgtp1/what_lessons_can_europe_learn_from_swedens/g6itv6e/,1601030326,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

This includes pupils of all ages, including teenagers who can stay home alone and study remotely with relative guarantees of success. But many other students are small children who need to be looked after by a parent or adult during their isolation period.

While Dom√®nech says that she is much less productive because of the situation, she recognizes that ‚Äúthere are worse cases in the class,‚Äù such as parents who have to work in offices and do not know whether they can ask for sick leave. ‚ÄúAnd I am also worried about my daughter‚Äôs education, especially since I think this is going to happen again and this will not be a normal school year,‚Äù says Dom√®nech, who works as an accountant.

First quarantined classes return to school
Regional authorities believe that the number of classes in quarantine is at a reasonable level. In some regions, such as Navarre and Arag√≥n, authorities point out that classes that were placed in isolation when schools first reopened have now begun to return. Others, such as the Basque Country, say the rate of quarantined classes has slowed down. And in general, education authorities say the goal is still to maintain the greatest number of face-to--face classes possible. This is despite the fact that restrictions may be introduced in other social contexts if the virus continues to spread.


Based on available information, which has largely come from other countries that reopened schools before summer or at the beginning of August, public health experts such as Salvador Peir√≥ believe that schools are unlikely to be major hotspots for transmission. But schools are not islands, and if a region has a high transmission rate, this is likely to be reflected in its schools, explains Peir√≥, who is a member of Fisabio, a health research foundation run by the regional government of Valencia. This could make it difficult for schools to continue the normal academic year as planned. For example, the Madrid region, which has the highest incidence rate of Covid-19 in Spain, also has the highest number of classes in quarantine since the beginning of the school year. Last Friday, 168 classes were in isolation, a figure that jumped to 832 on Wednesday.

Differences between the regions
EL PA√çS asked regional authorities for the number of classes that have been quarantined since schools reopened. Only 13 replied. None of them specified the age of the students, and only a few of them indicated the number of affected classes as a percentage of the total. In Madrid, 832 classes have been quarantined (1.4% of the total) since students returned to school. The region with the second-highest number of quarantined classes is Catalonia with 602, followed by the Basque Country (268, 1.5%), Castilla-La Mancha (180, 1%), Andalusia (168, 0.2%), Arag√≥n (148, 1.7%), Navarre (142), Castilla y Le√≥n (141, 1%), Valencia (130, 0.3%), Extremadura (73), the Balearic Islands (49, 0.7%), La Rioja (33) and Galicia (27).

The difference is a reflection of several factors. First, the transmission rate of the disease varies greatly between the regions: in Madrid, the 14-day cumulative incidence of Covid-19 was 742.6 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, compared to 114.4 in Galicia, according to Tuesday‚Äôs epidemiological report. Secondly, some regions delayed the start of the school year, with some classes returning up to two weeks later than others. And lastly, some regions update their figures every day while others do so every week: in Andalusia and Valencia, for example, the latest figures are from Monday.

Regional authorities in the Canary Islands, Asturias and Cantabria did not reply to EL PA√çS‚Äôs request. Murcia only offered the number of students and teachers in quarantine, 187 and 43 respectively, but not the number of classes. In the case of Madrid, unions argue that transmission rates in schools are higher than what is being reported by the regional government in the official statistics.",,,1601029591,{},g6it792,True,t3_izh1kj,False,True,t3_izh1kj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/izh1kj/nearly_3000_classes_in_spain_forced_to_quarantine/g6it792/,1601029602,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Do they? The 6 feet social distancing rule is based on the fact that the US CDC and WHO both believe the spread of covid by aerosol is unlikely.  But currently, there are suspicions that covid can spread by air. So what should the WHO and the US CDC do? Announce that covid is airborne and get rid of the 6 feet rule? Or keep the 6 feet rule? 

&gt; Well, should they then not let people from other provinces go home too?

People from other provinces are Chinese citizens.  

&gt; the drastic measures that were taken from the beginning, then yes, they should also keep foreigners in the quarantine.

There are many countries that have implemented quarantines. Which of these countries have banned foreigners from leaving their country? There are lots of problems with banning people who are not your citizens from leaving your country.  

&gt;  If it was good idea in May and July, it surely has been an even better idea in December,

Not necessarily. Banning flights just created panic, which lead to large number of people trying to catch the last couple of flights out of a country, which means a large deluge of people that is difficult to test and quarantine. 

https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/517119-bill-gates-says-trumps-travel-ban-may-have-made

Instead, a better strategy is not to have a ban, but a more controlled evacuation.

Honestly, these people tend to wear masks and distance anyway and tend to be less apt to go to crowded places to begin with, so are not as ""dangerous"" as people online say they are.  But this is where they are coming from:

The media plays a huge role, if not, should take all the blame, for this.

We live in a click-bait era of journalism. Alot of people who have followed news for decades see how journalistic standards have nosedived. Many of the articles that people are citing as fact are actual opinion pieces or a series of what-if questions disguised as research.  It can be very disheartening for someone older whose watched the decline of real journalism to be brushed off with ""right wing talking point"" or ""fox news"" - this is an issue that people on all sides should be worried about.  I think those who are left leaning are currently not as worried because the it's been in their favor for the last few years, but whose to say that will always be the case?  Personally, I read the NYT for 25 years and finally stopped because it was getting so bad.  I think that younger people who start reading it now might take years to realize that so much of it has become opinions and what-ifs disguised as journalism.  They just think ""OMG it's in the NYT it's true."" Well, that might've been a good stance 30 years ago, but not now.

To this point, the media churned out loads of ""facts"" about covid prematurely, skewed towards the ""covid is worse than it actually is"" side, especially in March and April.  This backfired because the media lost more credibility.

Same with the ""protests are OK"" narrative. At the same time the media is publishing articles about a drive-in church being a super-spreader, there are groups of 1000s of people in major cities that the media is saying can't spread the disease.  

I think the media also over-censored stuff on herd immunity and masks not being super-effective.  This stuff was all over google when I was researching it in March and April.  Anytime you over-censor stuff, people think there is something to hide.  I still don't understand where all of the studies on masks not preventing viruses went.  I doubt they were retracted.  My MO in life is ""out with the truth and things usually settle correctly.""  In this case, that means leaving articles out there about masks not being super-effective.  Let people look at those and the ones that say they are super-effective.  Deleting articles or suppressing them in google searches does indeed backfire, despite what people want to claim.  Same with hydrochlouriquine.  If it's so horrible, and ineffective, just let people publish articles on it.  Why do so many articles on it get deleted right away?  If what they are saying is BS, people will realize it.  Let's give people some credit.

Instead, the rush to delete all of them just makes people think the media is hiding something.  The Streisand effect, if you will.  

And really, why is the media so invested in this one?  It's not like people were going to run out and buy hydrochlouriquine and run back to work without a mask.",,,1601056813,{},g6k2bly,False,t3_izjsv0,False,True,t1_g6jo99d,/r/Coronavirus/comments/izjsv0/daily_discussion_post_september_25_questions/g6k2bly/,1601058515,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I hate how people don't even understand what social distancing is. Social distancing doesn't prevent any of that. It's literally what enables people to do those things safely.

Also, almost every country has barred incoming travel for non-residents. That has nothing to do with social distancing.

&gt;However people are getting tired of the other things i mentioned.

New Zealand, Singapore, Finland, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and even Sweden have been largely open for months, some since May. There's no reason the economy cannot be reopened safely if people follow the recommendations.

This is literally New Zealand in June: https://www.cbssports.com/general/news/new-zealand-welcomes-back-rugby-with-packed-stadiums-after-country-eradicates-coronavirus/.

&gt;When people tell me ""oh you might lose your job, also don't see other people. Also cancel your vacation. Also don't go out to eat. Also don't really do anything except sit at home"" and then maybe i'm reluctant to do it again that's not me being selfish.

Which social distancing guidelines recommend any of that? All you have to do is maintain distance if possible in public and don't have gatherings beyond the group size restriction. Meanwhile, wear a mask to reinforce the benefit of social distancing.

Still, to point out the irony, health experts across EU have attributed the main cause of the second wave to people breaching social distancing by holding parties or congregating in bars/restaurants beyond the guidelines. What's the point of people wanting things reopened if they aren't going to take steps to ensure it stays that way?

This was slowly lifted to ""only travel within 2 hours"" and then during summer (and now), only travel if you are healthy with no symptoms and avoid public transportation or transportation without designated seats if possible. 
- avoid public transport if you can, especially rush hour. 
- Ban against visits in elderly care. This was started in March and won't be removed until October. Essentially, you couldn't even visit your family if they are in the elderly care housings. Note; elderly care housing is where the most vulnerable, old or sick live.  It's for those who can't live alone or be with just home care service.  
- many hospital's also had a ban against visitors. Only patients were allowed in (with the exception of very seriously ill, children and during childbirth where limitations were put by the staff on how to handle it, who was allowed, if they had to wear protections or similiar)
- If you can, work from home. This has recommended since March and is ongoing until end of the year but probably until we have a vaccine.  Since the pandemic started, there has not yet been a  return to work recommendation.
- Only table servings allowed. No bar serving etc. This includes for clubs, bars, pubs, resturants, cafes etc. 
- A minimum of 1 meters distance between groups around tables. 
- Signs reminding of covid and to keep distance etc is a must. 
- Crowding is not allowed. If a restaurant or similar is too crowded or do not obey the above rules, they get a warning or get shut down. 
- Facility must provide disinfectant. 
- No public gatherings above 50 people. This includes demonstration, clubs, sports games, public parties/festivals, church service etc. Anything you *promote in public* is considered a public gathering. This was also seen as a signal to rest of the society that generally anything else above 50 is also not okay (though allowed) even if it is a private wedding or similiar. 
- All high schools and universities had to go distance/digital. This was only for a few months though. Now schools have to be able to provide safe education where public transport is not getting crowded nor facilities. Some schools have education still digital, some have split the weeks between digital and at school between classes, and some have changed their time tables to not be during rush hour. 
- avoid all kinds of social gatherings, including parties, weddings, funerals, baptisms etc.
- avoid hugs, causal dating etc. 
- avoid changing rooms etc. 
- try to social distance. 
- if needed to gather or meet, keep it outdoors in safe distance. Several municipalities removed the fees for outdoor service/tables for resturants. 
- information everywhere about washing your hands, stay home if sick and keep distance. 
- Focus on communicating information about covid and how to minimize spread. This goes to all ages and multiple languages.  
- if you have any symptoms, even if very very mild or just a little, stay home and get tested if you can. You should be symptom free for at least two days before going out in public. This also included kids and parent who had to stay home because of sick kids are also paid by the government. 
- In order to encourage people to stay home if sick, the government removed the qualifying day of sickness (first day sick, you usually don't get paid otherwise). They also pay 80% of all sick days. Swedes get paid usually by the company for the first 15 days of sickness but this time, the government pays so the companies don't go bankrupt because half of their workforce is at home with a little bit of sniffles. Government also pays if you are sick lonher. Work also can't require a doctor's note until you have been sick for 2 weeks straight. 
- if you are infected, you need to isolate for a minimum of 7 days and have at least 2 days free of fever. If very sick/admitted, more isolation days as decided by the hospital. 
- all risk groups need to be extra careful and self-isolate as much as they can. 
- government gave aid/support to volonteer organisations that helped out with grocery shopping or similar to risk groups. 
- risk groups can get money to stay at home if their work does not allow them to work from home. This wasnt introduced until August but mostly because of bureaucracy and a new IT system needed to be implemented.

These things may not sound like restrictions but the important thing to remember which is a bit different from many countries (where they fine you or force you essentially instead of trusting their people) is that when an agency goes out with recommendations or guidelines, it's essentially something people are expected to adhere too. Personal responsibility is big. Business-wise, they can be charged or reported. Individual-wise, you face the shame of breaking the jante law and of being an idiot who stands out and who no one likes or approves of. When you look at the numbers (travel/movement, sickness days,  economy etc), you can tell the majority listened to them during spring in particular. There has been now a more relaxed attitude sadly though which together with the cold weather is making the numbers rise :(

Edit: another important thing to add is that the FHM also encouraged people to still go outdoors (parks etc), take walks and generally stay active/exercise as long as you keep your distance, keep to the recommendations and don't do it while sick. Same with for instance sex with a partner.

&gt; In a study published in BioMed Central‚Äôs journal Population Health Metrics they said Canadians can expect to live until 79.7 years of age, versus 77.2 years for Americans.

&gt; A healthy 19-year-old Canadian can expect to have 52 more years of perfect health versus 49.3 more years for Americans.

[LET ME GOOGLE THAT FOR YOU](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjlwIva74TsAhWQLc0KHV4GCpAQFjABegQIDBAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Fus-health%2Fcanadians-live-longer-healthier-than-americans-study-idUSTRE63R6B520100429&amp;usg=AOvVaw3avEpS8Ja2oRmgbSkmduNx)

And let's look at median wealth:

&gt; The US has a median wealth of $61,667 per adult, which puts the country at number 18, well behind others, including Ireland ($72,473), Taiwan ($78,177), and Korea ($65,463). Canada, on the other hand, comes in at number six, with an average wealth of $106,342 per adult.

[source ](https://www.businessinsider.com/richest-countries-in-the-world-2018-10)


so it would seem your median Canadian is almost 2x more valuable/wealthy than your median American. Don't let the preponderance of basketball stars, hollywood stars, SF tycoons, and titans of industry fool you into thinking the average american is even CLOSE to as well off as the avg Canadian.

So should the WHO declare covid to spread by aerosol right now?

Do you think the American CDC and WHO are working together to cover this up?  That the Americans are lying? 

&gt; As for the PRC's malicious conduct in this case, I thought that would be common knowledge by now.

The accusation that China should have prevented flights out of the country does not make sense to me. There are a lot of foreigners living in China. These flights were essentially an evacuation for foreigners. Should China prevent all of these people from leaving for their home countries? Isn't that holding them hostage or a kidnapping?  

&gt; It is also telling that one of the least affected countries is ROC, right in the neighbourhood of the PRC - and they reached this success by consistently going against the advice of the WHO and the PRC

Countries like Korea are also in the neighborhood, and they did pretty well by following the conventional advice. If it wasn't for the spread by Korean churches, their covid performance would have been even better. And as I recall, Korea never banned all flights from China either.

[],,jdorje,,,[],,,,text,t2_ii7rl,False,False,[],"&gt; Why do Covid fatalities remain low when infection numbers are rising?

They do not remain low.  They have risen exactly proportional to cases, just one (full) month later.  This is the headline that keeps getting propagated despite being entirely false.

France was down to about 500 daily cases and 10 deaths (2% CFR) during the summer lull.  Then in a month their cases rose by a factor of 6, and over the last month by a second factor of 4.  Deaths have increased by a factor of 6, but because they're delayed by a full month from cases the second factor of 4 has not come into play yet.

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/france/

It is likely that it is overall less deadly, and we know exactly why.  The single biggest thing is that nursing homes, responsible for super-spreading and 50% of the deaths, are easily protected via testing.  We also have drugs (rem and dex) that can reduce mortality by a small factor, maybe 25%.  The hope is that vitamin D in summer greatly reduces the number of people who have severe cases, and that lower viral load does so also, but the evidence for these two things are minimal.

But IFR in spring was around 1-1.5% and we have no proof whatsoever that it has dropped.  We all assume it has, and we're probably right, but when you look for evidence you will not find any.",,,1601048370,{},g6jljb3,False,t3_izgmi9,False,True,t1_g6jkj5s,/r/Coronavirus/comments/izgmi9/france_sees_record_new_coronavirus_infections/g6jljb3/,1601048933,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I'm also seeing the topic come up again about how the CDC said masks don't work. I know the story is that they needed to limit how many masks were used, but I don't really blame folks for feeling like they've got shaken faith in health officials, because if they lied to us once, why believe them now? I also know another angle is that it was a case of miscommunication; the word sent to officials, including Fauci was ""Tell the public not to use masks"" in the interest of reserving them for healthcare workers, which got interpreted as ""masks don't work"", but then I'm being told the word that can still be found on the CDC website (maybe with use of the Wayback Machine?) was definitively ""masks do nothing to prevent the spread"", making it sound like the evidence was conclusive.

At this point I can't think of anything further to say in masks' support. I'm finding I just desperately *hope* there's still reason to wear them, because I just want there to be this wall of defence against the virus.

Again, please don't think I'm actively trying to disparage masks. My confidence is just kinda shaken, and I'm only trying to be so thorough about questioning them because I want all bases covered.

Lastly, one opinion I've heard is that the advice on masks was not changed for health reasons, but because of political motivations. Given our current ""us vs. them"" climate, I don't totally doubt this, but at the same time I'm unsure what political incentive there'd be in this.

**Why NBA, MLB and PGA Tour Are Ditching Nasal Swab for Saliva COVID-19 Tests**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The return of professional sports is not responsible for absurdities such as a nurse in Los Angeles waiting a week for COVID-19 test results that Clayton Kershaw receives within 24 hours, or an uninsured, asymptomatic hospital worker in the Dallas metroplex paying as much as $400 for a test Joey Gallo gets free of charge, four times a week.

&amp;#x200B;

did a nurse get a spit test?

&amp;#x200B;

AFAIK, saliva tests do not exist in the quantities  needed for the general public (they're relatively new).

&amp;#x200B;

I suspect pro sports are essentially conducting trials for spit tests.

&amp;#x200B;

sports testing is to keep people out of the facility who MIGHT be sick.

that's different than someone already feeling sick and getting PCR.

&amp;#x200B;

if MLB, NBA, NFL manage to keep COVID out of the locker rooms.. that means spit tests are a viable option to keep COVID out of schools and offices.

&amp;#x200B;

at a dollar a pop and results in 15 minutes (AT HOME)..

&gt;The strategy, if adopted and backed by the federal government, could put hundreds of millions of tests in the hands of consumers within weeks, at a cost far less than repeated rounds of economic stimulus, Mina said. The tests, which can be produced for less than a dollar, can be performed by consumers each day or every other day. Though not as accurate as current diagnostic tests, they are nonetheless effective at detecting virus when a person is most infectious, Mina said. If everyone who tests positive stays home, he said, the widespread effect would be similar to that of a vaccine, breaking transmission chains across the country.",,,1601048219,{},g6jl8et,False,t3_izircu,False,True,t3_izircu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/izircu/mlb_promised_free_covid19_testing_for_essential/g6jl8et/,1601048761,2,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

It's also why there is no observable trend of mask mandates preventing or slowing COVID-19 transmission.

'To mitigate the effects of the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the outbreak, a temporary ban on entry to the EU via Sweden is in force.'

Literally from official sources. Finland also has similar travel restrictions.

&gt;and never isolated itself and never locked down and never shut schools and never wore masks mandatory

Yeah, and now you have more cases/deaths per capita. Just fyi, New Zealand has had less restrictions than Sweden for 3 out of the last 4.5 months.

So we just let the business slow down, and fire people or layoff, or furlough, or whatever new fancy loophole word we've got for our tax breaks for 2021. Employee expenses go way down, making us even more money!

Money comes in, we start to repair our losses and fix our business by buying our stock and all around just strengthening things from the top-down. I say top-down because it stops about 12% from the top and the rest gets cut!

Cut for more money, employee expenses go down, money stays in our pocket, and the government is paying us even MORE to do it!

A little off topic, but this seems like something you'd be interested in: I've been most intrigued by a relatively unknown pandemic of 1889 to 1890 that was originally attributed to an influenza virus, but is now being proposed to be a human coronavirus that jumped from bovines to humans:

**The gist of it:**

CoV-OC43 that now causes the common cold, might have caused a much more severe illness when it made the first jump to humans. Could it be that when a coronavirus does transition to humans, it initially causes a severe pandemic, that eventually abates as the virus mutates and becomes completely endemic in the population?

Of course, we're talking over the course of 130 years in this case, but at the same time, the pandemic lased and resurged over the course of a few years, before it eventually abated.

I wonder if this virus eventually will follow suit; and could we already be seeing some evidence of that?",,,1601062825,{},g6kdwpd,False,t3_iyvao2,False,True,t1_g6jzdtv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iyvao2/research_suggests_school_reopenings_contribute_to/g6kdwpd/,1601065042,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

i disagree on the 'bunker down until vaccine' point.  Rather, it is bunker down when community transmission is trending towards surpassing contact/trace capability.  lots of places have reopened relatively successfully thereafter, but been smart about staging that.

Agreed! A stipulation of the PPP loan could've easily been that a company could not pay out dividend or buy back shares, both of which only help make more money for people that already have money. If a company has that in their contract, then shareholders can vote to remove or suspend that from their contract if they want PPP loans.

2. Easily beat your predictions because your industry is not really affected.

The article spent a lot of time explaining why a vaccine will help but won't fully stop the virus. It's not just get injected and you good. 

1) It will probably provide immunity for under a year, meaning you will need yearly Covid shots like for the Flu shots. 

2) The bar for approval is 50% effectiveness, which means for everyone injected, it will only work as intended for half the population (though realistically most vaccines will probably be in the 70% effective range). 

3) It also depends on enough people taking the vaccine for a country to reach herd immunity. Around 66% will need to take it for it to work. 

All this is to say it will dramatically lower Covid-19 levels. But every few days you will still read about a random outbreak in one town or city. More likely in regions with a low vaccine uptake rate. 

End of the day, once mass vaccinations begin, it will end the crisis mode. But for a few years (2022-2023) it will burn at a low level.

Mobility was down, not as drastic as the neighbours, but still considerably compared to normal.

Economy took a similar hit to its neighbours who did a lockdown.

As long as hospitals dont become oversaturated, everything is mostly ""fine"", the problem is when they are (which the lockdowns are meant for, they were also meant for medical professionals to figure out effective treatment strategies).

What works in the low population density of the Nordics, where dense hubs are far separated from one another, doesn't necessarily work for the densely populated blue banana in the EU.

Sweden compares itself often to its direct neighbours in their news (which is the more correct comparison than say US/Sweden that some love to do). It doesn't look nearly as successful in that context; they are aware of that and their own officials have at times expressed regrets of their approach.

In the end, winter is still coming, and herd immunity is still not reached in Sweden.

So, here's an idea I had, hope it helps some to have a safe Hallowe'en this year:

I have been racking my brain to try and work out a safe way of doing it without direct contact with the kids; I figure that just putting a bowl outside wouldn't work as everyone would still have their hands going through the bowl at best, and the whole bowl might be taken at one go at worst. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am lucky enough to live at a location with a small yard and about a 12 to 14 foot stretch of fence; what I'd been thinking is that I would buy the candy and Hallowe'en bags to put together for the kids, then glove and mask up to put them together (and I may get tricky and make 1/2 non-peanut, the other with peanuts, clearly marking the difference) to start.  I will try stringing lines across the fence and yard so I can decorate it like a spider web (complete with fake spiders and such) and clip on the bags throughout the 'webbing'.  I figure, this way I can watch through my front window in costume while staying safe inside, and to make sure no one takes too many on their own, and the kids can just walk up to see if they're brave enough face the spider web for their bag of candy.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been trying to put forth this idea as much as possible half to see if anyone can spot flaws in the plan, half to see if there may still be a Hallowe'en this year if enough people join in on the idea (whether in this way or some version of it).",,,1601054588,{},g6jxxuz,False,t3_izf2b2,False,True,t3_izf2b2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/izf2b2/avoid_trickortreating_due_to_coronavirus_this/g6jxxuz/,1601056021,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Saying ""well theyre contractually obligated to give out the government grants to their rich shareholders"" is kind of hand waving the problem. The fact that they can say they had no choice is the problem - if they had a choice they likely would have done the same thing but now they get to act like their hands are tied

And your example of 'super clean corp' is from the perspective of a small company owner or something. In reality, all the major decision leaders of public companies have their own compensation decided by stock price. Even if it is NOT in the best interests of the corporation to buy back their own stock(instead using it for hiring or expansion or raises to keep valuable employees), an executive who might have a 5 year career in the company has every incentive to use those funds to buy back the stock because it directly increases their personal take home pay

Regardless, nothing is going to change and the richer will get richer and the poor/middle class will stagnate but at least we'll all be able to tell ourselves it is all fine and moral because it was technically legal

&gt;By Gerry Shih May 25, 2019 at 12:20 PM EDT

&gt;BEIJING ‚Äî The video opens with the 21-year-old sociology student facing the camera. His voice quivers as he recounts his interrogation ‚Äî his humiliation ‚Äî for days at the hands of Beijing police.

&gt;The officials pressured him to quit labor activism and drop out of Peking University, he says. They slapped him until blood streamed from his nose. They jammed headphones into his ears and played hours of propaganda at full volume. 

&gt;On the last day, he alleges, they had him bend over a table naked and spread his buttocks, joking darkly that they would teach him how to insert a listening device.

&gt;‚ÄúThis all happened on campus,‚Äù Qiu Zhanxuan seethes in the video he recorded in February after he said the police released him, temporarily, after a four-day ordeal. 

&gt;‚ÄúIf I disappear,‚Äù he adds, ‚Äúit‚Äôll be because of them.‚Äù

&gt;Qiu disappeared April 29.  
  

  
Maybe he was ""rightfully"" detained, but why silence him? Allow him to communicate with the outside world - unless preventing the spread of COVID wasn't the real reason for detaining him.",,,1601054484,{},g6jxqjf,False,t3_izihcs,False,True,t1_g6j9cs0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/izihcs/missing_chinese_journalist_under_state_supervision/g6jxqjf/,1601055902,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

How about...  
I have been racking my brain to try and work out a safe way of doing it without direct contact with the kids; I figure that just putting a bowl outside wouldn't work as everyone would still have their hands going through the bowl at best, and the whole bowl might be taken at one go at worst. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am lucky enough to live at a location with a small yard and about a 12 to 14 foot stretch of fence; what I'd been thinking is that I would buy the candy and Hallowe'en bags to put together for the kids, then glove and mask up to put them together (and I may get tricky and make 1/2 non-peanut, the other with peanuts, clearly marking the difference) to start.  I will try stringing lines across the fence and yard so I can decorate it like a spider web (complete with fake spiders and such) and clip on the bags throughout the 'webbing'.  I figure, this way I can watch through my front window in costume while staying safe inside, and to make sure no one takes too many on their own, and the kids can just walk up to see if they're brave enough face the spider web for their bag of candy.

&amp;#x200B;

Also China is quarantining _every single person_ who‚Äôs entering China, no matter who you are and what‚Äôs your citizenship, for 14 days (that‚Äôs why you see ‚Äúimported cases‚Äù being reported, those are who showed symptoms during this 14-day quarantine after they travel into China). With these preventive processes being constantly taken, the only ways that the virus can be in China that I can think of are:
1. Smugglers, and this is the case for Xinjiang‚Äôs outbreak a few months ago and for Ruilin‚Äôs recent cases.
2. Imported by frozen food/products since virus can stay alive on the surface of frozen products. Workers might touch their nose and mouth after touching these surfaces and get infected. This is basically the case of Beijing Xinfadi outbreak and recent Qingdao virus carrier. This pattern of infection was also previously found to be the case for New Zealand. To prevent this case from happening and causing community spreading, China is doing regular checkups for high-exposure workers, including frozen food workers, doctors/nurses, etc., roughly every two weeks. If there is a case found, again, the carrier gets quarantined and cared, all of a few degrees of close contacts get tested, and maybe another entire-city testing.
3. The virus still exists in some animals. This part is hard to control, and all we can do is to strictly follow the process once a human patient is found, and wait for scientists to figure out what animal(s) carries the virus.

Plus, almost all people in China (I wanted to say everyone, but I know this is not the case - there are always outliers and no-brainers) know how this virus spreads and how to control it, and nearly no one will decide not go to hospital if they show symptoms, since people know hiding is not the way to get rid of it. People learnt this in a hard way early this year.

With these preventions, mainland China pretty much becomes a huge bubble, like the one NBA has in Orlando now but in a much much larger scale. People live in this bubble almost get back to normal life, and COVID is not a hot topic anymore (though people in China are still talking about how bad the COVID situation is in the US and some other countries). People are now more focusing on their daily work, the economy growth, and they can just go wherever they want, meet whoever they wish to.

I guess to summarize, China is just following science, listening to their scientists, acting quickly and strictly following the process, and doing it in a controlled fashion. If these steps can‚Äôt control this virus, I doubt that this virus can be controlled at all before we have a working vaccine. Probably a lot of countries and people not living in China just don‚Äôt believe that this virus can be controlled and are just waiting for the miracle vaccine for the rescue, and this is the reason when there is a country has controlled it well, they get ashamed and start smearing on this country &lt;shrug emoji&gt;",,,1601056109,{},g6k0xt0,False,t3_izcxox,False,True,t1_g6j9rv9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/izcxox/chinas_mainland_reports_2_domestic_cases_of/g6k0xt0/,1601057730,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,1601056435.0,

A lot of places have auto-answer on your phone, you're done with one client, and there's another right away on your line. Lot's of micro-managing too, all your calls are timed &amp; tracked &amp; recorded. Your boss will frequently pull you aside to ask why a particular call was twenty minutes long, or why you didn't close a call by upselling something else to the customer just now? 

So picture working at a never-ending line of customers at a grocery checkout, with your boss right behind you with a timer &amp; a conversation recorder, stopping you only when they wish to give you criticism. It's incredibly soul crushing to go through 8 hrs a day, usually with abismal pay &amp; benefits. 

Oh, also, the customers are 90% angry from the start, taking their frustrations out on you the majority of the time. It's ""your job"" to put up with it and de-escalate the situation. Most companies give front line call workers very little resources to actually help the customer, hoping they'll be able to get the customer to ""let it go"", or get frustrated enough to hang up. 

My experience comes from working in call centers for extremely large companies. In mutiple instances, I was in a ""customer de-escalation role"" for very upset customers that were wronged. I was often given ridiculous expectations to make a certain number of sales off of these poor folks while also giving away as little resources as possible to fix their issues, it was extremely frustrating!

If I could change anything, it'd be that call center workers need higher pay, but shorter hours. So work 6 hr shifts, 5-4 days a week, but be paid a very competitive amount. Also, hourly breaks of 5 minutes.

The other possibility is that you realized your argument was rubbish so far.

The CFR varies very widely everything from less than 1% to up to 20% to the point that I don't think it is a reliable indicator of anything in particular, because it is skewed by the level of testing and the ability to treat.  To the point that simply counting cases is also not a reliable indicator of anything.

Or two regions could both have 1,000 and 20,000 cases but the same number of fatalities.

Those are the things keeping the economy opened safely. You cannot complain that things are closing while being unwilling to make some sacrifices to keep them open.

&gt;People are angry because they lose their jobs

That happens when the country closes, something social distancing is meant to prevent. I'm just going to point out the obvious contradiction here.

&gt;because they feel like they can't enjoy their lives.

It's a pandemic. Do people really expect to be able to do everything as per normal?

&gt;i'm simply saying why people don't want to do it anymore.

Then cases spike and restrictions get tighter. The inability of others to put up with a mild inconvenience has now led to increased restrictions for everyone. How is that not selfish?

Also, you were able to do almost everything you could pre-COVID except for smaller group sizes. There absolutely is a mismatch between the degree of complaining and the actual restrictions you face.

They claim to have returned the funds ""after further clarification from the Treasury Department"" but they went ahead and got that 10 million back in the second round of PPP funding when no one was looking anymore.   


Meanwhile, I should have been able to get $1800 from PPP to cover my lost 1099 income. Even though I applied the first day, the money was gone before anyone looked at my application. I applied again for the second round and because my income is seasonal, even though I was losing full paychecks every week at the height of the season that I wouldn't be able to get back in the fall, they would only give me $950. So you can see why it's frustrating that businesses who could have gotten loans from conventional sources at 1% interest instead took money out of the PPP finds when there weren't enough to go around to all the small businesses that needed help to begin with.

Not dramatically better?!? The rich literally have to worry about nothing. The same can't be said for almost half of the US.

Almost half of the population lives paycheck to paycheck. That's not poor money skills, that's how our society is intentionally structured.

Minimum wage is not a living wage. In my city, louisville ky, some fast food jobs offer a starting pay of around 10 dollars. The living wage in this same for one person is 12 dollars. Our most basic jobs, which society depends on, do not allow people to survive. And that doesn't account for things that one has no control over, like medical emergencies, car repairs, etc.

Medical debt has bankrupted countless people, and many people die in the US because they can't afford what the medicine they need. Yet the medical insurance companies are still making hand over fist, and still donating to PACS and Super PACS so this continues.

Your stock increases in value from the buyback, but your profits are down on your taxes. So you pay less despite the fact that between the loan, your rising stock price, less competition, and a larger and more desperate prospective workforce, you're making more money than ever.

[],,cnne12,,,[],,,,text,t2_10gnzl5m,False,False,[],"If you legitimately have no extra money, then that probably should be resolved asap unless you plan to keep doing this job until you die. $45k a year doesn't mean much without knowing things like where you live.

Most of the problem people face is with budgeting and taking on consumer debt. If you've already dealt with this and you genuinely can't afford things like rent and microwave noodles then you need a new job or you need to move to a less expensive place because there is no other way out of that. However you're not in the middle class if you are too broke to afford to live except for very unfortunate circumstances.

You could probably budget out at least like $50 a month. Preferably for retirement so you don't have to die working. If not I'm genuinely sorry about your circumstances but if you can't afford $50 a month then you got bigger problems than not being able to invest. Do you not have someone who could watch over the kids while your husband works? No family available to help at all? No possibility of working shifts when you're home? No way to fit in training for a career in another field? No place you could move to with a lower rent or mortgage?

I'm not trying to be rude but saving and investing just some of your income, in opposed to living paycheck to paycheck and having debt, will make a massive difference in the future. It really doesn't matter if it was your own fault or not. Finances will eventually screw you over if nothing is done about it.

And I do know what it's like to be poor and have too much to handle. Last fall I literally was up for like 5 days straight one week because I was working and going to school.

Also you usually get shit pay and benefits on top of that. Fundamentally a call center is trying to extract maximum value from human labor at the lowest possible cost. Good places understand the value of good customer support and good workers and put some extra value into the office, hire decent managers, and empower workers, but again, this is rare. Most business people see call centers as a cost that needs to be reduced rather than the customer retention that it actually is (or hell, often it's also a sales department that actually *makes* money, but it still gets treated like shit).

If they had received financing from ‚ÄúWall Street‚Äù or anyone, a covenant of that financial contract will often require them to pay dividends to who ‚Äúloaned‚Äù them the money. 

I doubt even 10% of the people on this sub understand how finance even works, nobody scoffs at businesses using PPP loans to pay interest on loans, make mortgage payment, ect. I think because they view that as a ‚Äúcost of doing business‚Äù and the common folk understand what that is. 

The author tries to explain how dividends may be required and how it‚Äôs a ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù situation that they‚Äôre not protesting when that‚Äôs the case. I think that goes over the head of many people here. If I get a loan from a bank, they may charge me 10% interest. If I chose to have investors provide me the capital in exchange for equity (shares of the business ie you believe in me and buy half my business) the contract might state that I pay out x% of net income as dividends plus xxx,xxxK per quarter for the next 5 years to the ‚Äúshareholder‚Äù who may be a group of private of small investors, a hedge fund, or even another small business with knowledge of your business who had extra cash on hand. I know landscaping business owners who do this with real estate, they put up say 50k and get a dividend for X years plus a small slice of the pie if it works out. The only way the business can decide to not pay the dividend is if they declare bankruptcy. This is why, as the author explained, the PPP loan was used for wages while the current cash on hand was used for dividends. That‚Äôs not a case of the business indirectly using a PPP loan for dividends, that‚Äôs the business using less of its own cash for mandatory dividends, kicking bankruptcy down the road for another couple quarters in hopes they recover before hand.


The only dirty way of taking a PPP loan and paying out dividends is if a company was doing exceptionally well, had no obligation to pay dividends to shareholders and decided to take the money and pay dividends with it. As stated, PPP&gt; than 2 mil are being audited. Dividends must be disclosed on financial statements. This would be hilariously stupid and anyone with an accounting department or half a brain would never try this. The only reason this happened in the past is because Congress/bush/Obama admins never put restrictions on them, but this time around both political parties plus the exec branch unanimously agreed from the outset there would be no stock buybacks or voluntary dividends paid with the funds. 


I‚Äôll also get into the stock buybacks situation but that‚Äôs vastly more complicated to break down in a digestible way that people would accept without the pitchfork herd coming for me. I‚Äôll try anyway because someone with the knowledge should put the ELI5 out there. The short and simple on it is that it can allow a small company to make a fuck load of money with nearly no risk if they‚Äôre certain they can financially rebound very rapidly from the crisis. For ex I own Super clean Corp. My stock price is tanking but I‚Äôm in the cleaning supplies business, I‚Äôm going to actually benefit from this crisis in the long term and my share price will go way up down the road. Since some of my customers did go out of business in the short term my business is down this month, I‚Äôve laid some employees off, and I qualify for PPP. I‚Äôm going to use it to pay some payroll AND buy my stock back, not because I have enough PPP money to affect my stock price and drive it up long term (the PPP loans weren‚Äôt large enough to do this given the scale of this recession) but because I can invest a couple million now and make a 300% return inside of a year if this works out how I expect it to. Fast forward 3 months and other businesses are using PPP to stay in business and demand for cleaning supplies is up, I now need to hire more employees and have the money to do so because I‚Äôve made a shit ton of money on stock buybacks. 

This was the story of Ecolab, a company I invested in which cut executive pay, froze bonuses, laid off workers and then business exploded a couple months later. I have no knowledge of whether or not PPP loans were taken out by the company and if so, what they were allocated to. It‚Äôs just a convenient business case to convey the point. 

These stock buybacks could also be used for fraud at larger durable companies but again, audits, paper trail of stock purchases and financial situations, if you were doing great the whole time and transferring the companies income out of the business in the form of executive bonuses ect, it‚Äôs on paper. Time will tell on what type of fraud/wealth transfer occurred with these funds in future but given the protections placed on the money by our lawmakers this time, it will certainly be less so than in the past.

If you want to look for misallocation of tax dollars just look at the pork barrel funds that were placed into the Covid relief bills that had nothing to do with struggling businesses or citizens. I‚Äôll take no position on them but each party demanded billions to the same traditional causes they try to throw billions at year after year that never ends up helping struggling families.",,,1601050044,{},g6jov98,False,t3_izi28a,False,False,t1_g6iyzi3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/izi28a/publicly_traded_firms_paid_dividends_bought_their/g6jov98/,1601050831,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Here's the CDC stats for 2017.

 Here's a NYT article about how doctors in NYC, the worst hit area in the entire world, had almost no people coming in for heart attacks and strokes, illnesses often cause by obesity and old age, two of the primary morbidities in COVID-19. We will unquestionably see a lower amount of people dying from those illness this year in the end of year morbidity statistics. Why? Because they died from COVID instead. You can use a basic google search to find plenty more stories about hospitals being empty outside of COVID patients. You can look at comorbidity statistics with COVID deaths to see how many of them had these conditions already or were morbidly obese. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/well/live/coronavirus-doctors-hospitals-emergency-care-heart-attack-stroke.html

These are not 202,000 excess deaths. It's called the ""harvesting effect"" in which a bad virus (typically the flu) kills a vulnerable population earlier than they might have died from their other illnesses. We saw the reverse of that in Italy this year where the flu was very weak and there was a very large fragile population of elderly/ill people in December/January that very likely would have died due to influenza had they gotten it.

SEE: Fig 1B that shows this phenomenon in action.

Even if there is no work available, you can't layoff an employee.

Compare this to the German ""short-time"" model.  If the business has no work, they simply layoff the employee.  The government *pays the employer* 60% of the employee's salary.  The employer continues to pay the employee through normal means, at a reduced rate.

When work comes back, the business simply rehires their already-trained worker.

The worker is happy, because even though they had substantially reduced wages, they also didn't have to work throughout the period, and never had any gaps with unemployment verification.  Their employer continued to pay them throughout, just at a reduced rate.

The employer is happy, because they didn't have to permanently layoff the employee, their already-trained worker comes back, but they didn't have the overhead of paying the employee when there was no work to be done.

No one needs to apply for any special loan, no loans need to be converted, no unemployment needs to be filed.  Employers simply report the number of employees they have temporarily placed on short-time.

The US is going to have tens of millions of people changing jobs, retraining, causing churn in the economy, which might naturally be healthy, but certainly is not en masse as a result of an economic disruption.

Germany had a bunch of workers simply report back to work when work was again available.

In the US, even if a business was not planning to let anyone go, they still got the funding.  I'm Germany, only businesses which temporarily placed workers on leave get the funding.

CoV-OC43 that now causes the common cold, might have caused a much more severe illness when it made the first jump to humans. Could it be that when a coronavirus does transition to humans, it initially causes a severe pandemic, that eventually abates as the virus mutates and becomes completely endemic in the population?

How are they used for fraud? They're perfectly legal. SEC has placed a safe harbor rule in effect

&gt;Stock buybacks are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Act under Rule 10b-18, which creates a ‚Äúsafe harbor‚Äù in which companies are free from risk of liability for manipulation under the Securities and Exchange Act as long as they follow the conditions as laid out in the rule.

[],,jdorje,,,[],,,,text,t2_ii7rl,False,False,[],"Good discussion!  I think both CFR and IFR are highly variable.

We know that IFR is exponential based on age, so my simple formula is that it's 1% for a 65-year-old, increasing (decreasing) by a factor of 10 for every 20 years older (younger) you are.  Applying this over the population distribution of the US gives very similar numbers to what we've seen.

But this means IFR will vary hugely just by who is getting infected.  And in particular, keeping COVID out of nursing homes could reduce it by a factor of 2 or more alone (from the 1.4% value we saw in spring).  If on top of that we're also having elderly people (outside of nursing home) being a lot more careful, IFR could drop exponentially.  A truly competent society could have drafted and intentionally infected the 25% least vulnerable of its population back in February and had mostly herd immunity wit almost no deaths.

Meanwhile CFR can certainly vary too, and even more than IFR.  Not only does it vary in all the same ways as IFR, but also if your testing gets better or worse than you'll test and find a different percentage of infections.

Seroprevalence unfortunately does not seem to be useful anymore, because antibodies are lost after a short time in most people.  We have sero studies from spring in NYC, Spain, the UK, and Sweden.  But those places all had large outbreaks within a short period, and the sero studies were done soon thereafter.  A sero study done now wouldn't tell you total infected, but would find some unknown percentage of people infected based on how long ago they have been infected.

Meanwhile my methodology for France is simple.  They have had 1-2% CFR for a while, and their reported deaths lag 1 month behind reported cases.  I look at the 7-day rolling average for cases and deaths, although this can be thrown off for a day during 3-day weekends.  Assuming CFR remains in that range (obviously a big assumption) then we have 500 cases and 5-10 deaths over summer (low point was 6), rising to 3842 daily cases as of a month ago and thus 38-76 deaths per day today (actual value: 60) and then rising to 11,680 cases as of today and thus 116-232 deaths per day as of a month from now.  There are issues with such a simple model, but it agrees with the data very well and I don't see how you can make a better one from what we know.

This is far fewer deaths than in March, but since we have no idea how IFR compares now to then, we don't know why.  Is it because IFR is lower, or is it because we're testing a larger percentage of cases?  Obviously both, but we have no idea to what degree each is true.

&gt;  
&gt;Delivering a recorded speech to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Johnson will say the COVID-19 pandemic has increased barriers to trade.  
&gt;  
&gt;He will also present a five-point plan to improve the international response to future pandemics.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúAfter nine months of fighting COVID, the very notion of the international community looks tattered,‚Äù he will say, according to advance extracts distributed by his office.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúUnless we unite and turn our fire against our common foe, we know that everyone will lose. Now is the time therefore ... for humanity to reach across borders and repair these ugly rifts.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;His plan includes a global network of research hubs, more vaccine manufacturing capacity, and an agreement to reduce export tariffs imposed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;He will commit an initial 71 million pounds to the global vaccine partnership known as COVAX to secure purchase rights on 27 million doses, and 500 million to a separate COVAX initiative to help poorer countries access a vaccine.  
&gt;  
&gt;Johnson will also announce 340 million pounds ($433.23 million) in funding for the WHO spread across four years - a 30% increase on the previous four-year commitment - with around a third of the money dependent on reform to the organisation.

Over a thousand health care workers have died  from COVID (worldwide).  They are overwhelmingly those who worked in COVID wards early on and didn't have adequate PPE.  The sheer amount of the COVID particles that they came into contact with for 10 and 12 hours a day, for weeks and months, eventually wore down their system. Most of us are NOT in that situation, and so we need to focus on how to layer our defense so we to protect ourselves, our household and those we interact with.  No one wants to pick up COVID at a friend's house and take it home to grandma. So, what do we need to be concerned with?  Let's walk through it.

Layers of defense:  Masks, Proximity to other People and Clean Air Circulation.  Wearing a mask by itself does not guarantee you won't breathe in any particles.  What a mask does is lower the amount of particles you breathe in.  If you live in a household with someone who has COVID, and breathe the same air as them all day long, you have a high chance of getting COVID.  Does that mean you will have symptoms?  Depends.  You could be asymptomatic and feel fine, however, you can pass it on to others. This is why the advice is to limit your interaction with those outside of your household.  Essentially, create your own bubble (some countries call it a pod) to limit your exposure.

Compare three scenarios.

In the first, a group of friends (who do not live together) who get together in a house for a few hours without masks.  They breathe each other's air.  You don't have to be right next to someone inside a room or home to breathe their air.  Thinking of it in the same way as smelling someone's perfume from a few feet away, a cigarette smell drifting across, etc.   It's how air circulates.  If one of them in this get together has COVID, they have increased the chance that the others who got together will get it.  They aren't wearing masks, they are in a confined space and there is not outside (clean) air flow.

In the second scenario, the same group of friends gets together outside at a park.  They wear masks and sit on chairs and blankets that they bring, spread out so there is room between them.  Two meters, three meters, let's just say there is room.  There is air flow since they are outdoors.  If one of them has COVID, there is very little chance that another friend in the group will get it.  They have masks on, they are outside and their is airflow.

In the third scenario, the same group of friends go to a restaurant.  They sit next to each other at a table and do not wear masks to eat or drink (obvious).  If they are dining inside, then this is the same scenario as when the group of friends got together inside a house, they are breathing other people's air.  This is why many cities, countries, states, etc are limiting how many people can be inside a restaurant at a time (25%, 50%, etc) so as to try and minimize the potential for spread.  It is not an exact science, as we are not clear on how much a person needs to inhale in order to be infected, and that seems to differ based on age, health and unknown reasons as well.  We are starting to see more cases from inside dining, a good example is the Starbuck in Korea recently.

If they are dining outside, then there is less chance of breathing in the air from another table, but it can happen. Again, the question is how much does each person need to breathe in to become infected.   In the outdoor dining scenario, with the other tables two or more meters away, the issue still remains if one of the friends has COVID and is asymptomatic.  Now, they are sitting right next to each other, or across the table and breathing each other's air for an hour or more while they eat, drink and talk.  

I hope this helps.  I am not a doctor or scientist, but when we take the politics and economics out of it, and just look at what we know, layers of defense seems like the answer.

Only a bank could issue a PPP loan for the SBA.  You applied to the bank, then the bank applied to the SBA.  If the SBA rejected it, its not PPP but just a loan between you and the bank.  If the SBA accepted it, then its PPP and you can apply for forgiveness later.  The Forgiveness processes has only just started in the last week or so, so there hasn't really been much news yet of companies getting or not getting it, or issues with it.  There was set timelines, so you couldn't just apply get money and get it forgiven immediately, and when you apply for forgiveness there is a time window on that the SBA to make a decision, if they say no then it just becomes a loan between you and the bank..  I mean, a 1% interest rate loan, so its a win in almost all situations as long as your not doing fraud.  You also couldn't get PPP without 2019 payroll documents (or specific tax documents for certain solo practice situations).

There are other programs not as well known as PPP.  The (Economic Injury Disaster Loan) EIDL was at the same time as PPP, it only had less funding so it was smaller, and the amount you could get had a lower upper limit, one feature though was that you could get up to $10k immediately (Was setup as $1000 per employee, so to get $10k you need 10 employees or to lie) and that $10k was automatically forgiven, even if your loan didn't get approved.  If you did the EIDL and then did the PPP and EIDL money was assumed as part of your PPP total.  We didn't do the EIDL so I don't know as much about it compared to the PPP, but I know on its own it was not forgivable.  I also think it was self administered by the SBA as apposed to the PPP that was handled by banks. 

Your friend's coworker's scam had to work something like this, use someone's good name and file them as some kind of sole proprietor of 1099 contractor, apply for an EIDL and lie about the number of employees to get the 10k automatically forgiven amount up front, and likely not get approved for the actual loan, or maybe get it but decline to take it.",,,1601067041,{},g6klqd5,False,t3_izi28a,False,True,t1_g6kfzmg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/izi28a/publicly_traded_firms_paid_dividends_bought_their/g6klqd5/,1601069348,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

And they must not be allowed to work then? If there's no rent freeze or anything like that, how is that fair at all? Some people need to work to pay rent or college costs and other bills.

I just fail to see how the only alternative to banning 18-22 year olds gathering is no one is allowed to leave the house at all. There's obviously a middle ground in there. If there's already a ban on parties, then enforce the ban. Or maybe educate the kids more instead of just throwing rules and regulations at them and punishing them all the time. Punishment doesn't really change behavior. 

Also I see it's only for two weeks. It will just start back up again the moment it's over. The virus may have a 2 week incubation period, but some people will get infected during the 2 weeks still and it will continue on.

The US CDC, the most authoritative infectious disease organization in the world, agrees with the WHO that covid is not spread by aerosol. Do you think the American CDC and WHO are working together to cover this up? That the Americans are lying?

It doesn't really matter to me what they believe, as long as they advocate for countermeasures that have proven to be effective. Right now they do that. But, as I demonstrated this was not the case for the WHO, even in April they were advocating *against* countermeasures that have already proven to be effective in Korea, PRC, ROC etc. That is the definition of the WHO doing their job badly.

&gt; The accusation that China should have prevented flights out of the country does not make sense to me. There are a lot of foreigners living in China. These flights were essentially an evacuation for foreigners. Should China prevent all of these people from leaving for their home countries? Isn't that holding them hostage or a kidnapping?

Well, should they then not let people from other provinces go home too? If the situation is that bad that it requires closing down a big industrial centre like Wuhan, with the drastic measures that were taken from the beginning, then yes, they should also keep foreigners in the quarantine. That is, after all the purpose of the quarantine, not to let people spread the disease.

&gt; Countries like Korea are also in the neighborhood, and they did pretty well by following the conventional advice.

Wrong, they also went against WHO recommendations, e. g. with mandating masks for citizens.

&gt; And as I recall, Korea never banned all flights from China either.

Are you arguing that banning flights from heavily infected countries is not a sensible move? Because in most countries that is the default policy now. E. g. the PRC certainly lost no time to ban flights from the US, when the virus flared up there. If it was good idea in May and July, it surely has been an even better idea in December, when ROC started to issue flight bans.

&gt; What measures are these? Mask wearing? Social distancing?

The WHO did advocate against mask wearing though for a very long time, as you see, even in April. Of course since then they made an about face.

&gt; These are conventional methods, and not pioneered by anyone in particular.

I agree, closing the borders, social distancing and wearing masks is nothing groundbreaking, just common sense. That said it is even more baffling why the WHO ever thought that it was good idea to argue against two from these three.

So, to reiterate, there are plenty of decisions that the WHO can be blamed for, and no, they haven't done their job well.

&gt;The Act waives the personal guaranty requirement typically associated with Section 7(a) loans, as well as the requirement for applicants to demonstrate that they are unable to obtain credit from other sources.

and

&gt;It also requires that eligible borrowers make good faith certifications that they have been impacted by COVID-19 and will use the loan funds to retain workers and maintain payroll and other debt obligations.

https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/news-and-insights/sba-loan-cares-act-covid-19.html

After the abuse was becoming known, the treasury came out with FAQ with additional guidance, but afaik that wasn't in the original.

&gt;In addition to reviewing applicable affiliation rules to determine eligibility, all borrowers must assess their economic need for a PPP loan under the standard established by the CARES Act and the PPP regulations at the time of the loan application. Although the CARES Act suspends the ordinary requirement that borrowers must be unable to obtain credit elsewhere (as defined in section 3(h) of the Small Business Act), borrowers still must certify in good faith that their PPP loan request is necessary. Specifically, before submitting a PPP application, all borrowers should review carefully the required certification that ‚Äú[c]urrent economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the Applicant.‚Äù Borrowers must make this certification in good faith, taking into account their current business activity and their ability to access other sources of liquidity sufficient to support their ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental to the business. For example, it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith, and such a company should be prepared to demonstrate to SBA, upon request, the basis for its certification.

I don't dispute the number of deaths that generally occur in a year. 

Now in this reply you try to go further and say that these deaths were going to occur relatively soon anyway. But your evidence is not evidence of that. All the article gives is anecdotal evidence. That article in itself would not support the idea that most of the people who died from COVID would have died anyway. Now you can say that I am just rejected the source to agree with my preestablished thoughts. But I am not disagreeing with the source said. (Indeed, the NYT article does not make the claim you make, but suggests a large part of the problem is delaying treatment.) I am saying the inference you draw from it is not supported.

The long version, don't read if your easily triggered :)

We are all unwilling participating in the broadest scientific trial(s) in recent history.  And the first in which we have to opportunity to monitor, in near real-time, the scientific process as data is collected, sorted and tested to guide an increased understanding of this novel coronavirus .  Our petri dishes, unfortunately are not limited to the research labs but also include all of us...in  NYC, Italy, colleges, rural and urban areas, care facilities,  and many more.  Such is a pandemic.

Through this huge trove of collected data, we are finding that  theories that we held true months ago, were just plain wrong.  For example, we know that non-surgical masks do indeed help in reducing the R factor.  We know that previously accepted respiratory interventions were wrong, if not fatal.    Should  we blame and accuse those that conveyed these notions as murderers with blood on their hands?  Of course not!  They were acting with the best of intentions, and with the scientific consensus at the time.   Some of today's scientific consensus will also be proven just as flawed in hindsight.  So much to learn yet...

And so much learned.  But it feels like every question answered leads to multiple new questions.  And that, I remind myself, is the driving impetus of the scientific process, to advance knowledge.  The scientific method, to this interested lay observer, is contradictory, argumentative, tribal, repetitive...especially repetitive.  Seems so inefficient and slow.  

But, I also realize, that as a very human process, it is exactly what is required to eventually arrive at generally accepted consensus, even if science rarely allows a temporal consensus to rest.  Seriously, physicists are still testing (and confirming...whew) Einstein's earliest proofs of relativity.   

I appreciate the difficulty in parsing public policy discussion from politics.  But we have to remind ourselves that the politics is affected by policy, which derives from the science, which is fueled by data.  

 I believe the promise of this reddit was to amplify the science end of the spectrum over the political.   Lets not let that promise devolve into another shaming, defaming, finger wagging, blaming forum of virtuism and ego.  There are many posters here that know what they're talking about, and I would like them to be allowed to engage in a fair discussion without ragers interrupting it.

What makes me *really* depressed is that it didn't have to be this way. Ugh, why couldn't we have been more patient?! We should have just established a well-defined goal of locking down everywhere until a vaccine from the outset. Remember the ""18 months"" of Neil Ferguson? If that were the case, we could have actually got back to normal in November, and had a *completely* normal Christmas and new year.

Unfortunately, at this point, we've screwed up our pandemic response so much, and reopened so prematurely, that *even a vaccine won't get us back to normal*. If only we had followed directions the first time, then maybe we wouldn't still be suffering under closures and mask mandates during September. 

You know, as a matter of fact, we should have done from the start what Victoria, Australia is doing right now. They've got a really good pandemic response, possibly even the best in the world. 

* They've been under strict, continuous lockdown ever since July. Also, instead of shifting the reopening date every month or so, as is common in the United States, they've given a pre-emptive estimate of *at least Christmas*. This helps to prevent skeptics of accusing them of ""shifting the goalposts"" - something that I see a lot in other countries.
* The lockdown is not only *long*, but *hard*, too. Unlike *anywhere else* in America, they did a *real* lockdown. Like, no one farther than 5 km of their homes.
* Gatherings are completely out of the question.
* They require masks for everybody.
* Schools haven't reopened for nearly a year (and counting).

Finally, the police strictly enforces everything. *This* is tantamount to crushing the curve. No one whines about ""defunding the police"" or ""freedumb"". Rather, everybody unites together to achieve the common goal of defeating the virus. 

Unified leadership, strict ""no-exceptions"" enforcement of restrictions, and clear messaging are how places like China and Victoria can successfully crush the curve, whereas other places like the U.S. and the U.K. cannot. The fewer cops patrolling the streets for rule-breakers, the less likely people are going to comply. Without compliance, the guidelines are *meaningless*.

(By the way, I'm referring specifically to *Victoria*, and nowhere else. Not South Korea. Not Wuhan. But ***Victoria***!)

I know. A lot of you are in denial. **But that's the way it's going to be. Accept the new normal, *or whine like a coward*.**

&gt;Time will tell on what type of fraud/wealth transfer occurred with these funds in future but given the protections placed on the money by our lawmakers this time, it will certainly be less so than in the past.

I think this is what most people are implicitly worried about, even if they don't specify or articulate it. Legitimate use of funds - like contractual obligations - passes muster for most, I assume. However, given this administration's position on pursuing fraud -- neutering the CFPB, removing regulations, etc. -- I think the worry is that the protections placed on the funds are only as good as teh ability to enforce them.

If nobody enforces the regulations or restrictions -- and durable corporations know this -- then it should be rightfully frustrating.",,,1601051066,{},g6jqwge,False,t3_izi28a,False,True,t1_g6jov98,/r/Coronavirus/comments/izi28a/publicly_traded_firms_paid_dividends_bought_their/g6jqwge/,1601051998,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

In some cases I have had hourly bonuses end up equaling or even paying out more than someone‚Äôs yearly bonus. Co-managers maybe could if they ran a perfect store but that is still incredibly unlikely. Bonuses are too dependent on customer reviews. If you took those out of the factoring everyone would have better bonuses. There are way too many 1 star reviews that have nothing to do with the store and they absolutely tank everyone‚Äôs bonuses. I read a review yesterday that was along the lines ‚ÄúEveryone was friendly and I got what I needed but it is Walmart‚Äù 1 Star. They think they are sticking it to the company but all they are doing is taking money from everyone‚Äôs bonus. Get rid of customer reviews tied to bonuses.

Government scientific advisers are braced for the first vaccine that gains regulatory approval to be only partially effective and are considering how to explain to the country the need for caution as it is introduced.

Boris Johnson has previously said countries need to ‚Äúwork together to build an impregnable shield around all our people and that can only be achieved by developing and mass-producing a vaccine‚Äù.

Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, does believes that science will eventually ‚Äúride to the rescue‚Äù but early inoculations are unlikely to protect everyone and the virus will continue to circulate.

A jab that cuts the risk of people falling seriously ill would be a huge advance, reducing deaths in high-risk groups and lessening disruption to services such as cancer treatments.

But experts say that it would not enable an immediate return to normal life. Professor Whitty believes that a Covid vaccine comparable to the flu jab, which is only 40 to 60 per cent effective, is realistic, with the Oxford team leading the vaccine race having set a minimum target of 50 per cent protection.

Experts say that a vaccine that reduces symptomatic Covid cases by half would be an immensely valuable tool. However, they caution that people should not expect the first generation of vaccines to be a ‚Äúsilver bullet‚Äù.

While the government believes a vaccine will be ready for use in the first half of next year, restrictions will still be needed while millions of people are injected and some social distancing may remain even afterwards. The extent of these measures would depend on how well the vaccine works.

It is likely that people will need an initial vaccine and then a booster shot about a month later. Some may require doses of two entirely separate vaccines to stimulate their immune system sufficiently.

‚ÄúIt depends on what we find,‚Äù a government source said. ‚ÄúIt seems the most likely outcome in the short to medium term is to find a vaccine, or two doses of a vaccine, that reduces the severity of symptoms. It‚Äôs possible we might need several vaccines ‚Äî but we are backing a lot of horses.‚Äù

The government has agreed to buy 500 million doses of six different vaccines.

Charlie Weller, head of vaccines at the Wellcome Trust, said that the first Covid vaccines were likely to be limited in their effectiveness and that other measures were still likely to be required to control infections.

‚ÄúWe need to manage everyone‚Äôs expectations on what these first frontrunners of vaccines can actually do,‚Äù Dr Weller said.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of hope, understandably, resting on a vaccine that is going to be this wonderful one dose \[that will give\] full lifetime immunity and move us back to normality the next day ‚Äî but it‚Äôs not going to be the perfect solution; it‚Äôs not going to be the silver bullet.‚Äù

She warned: ‚ÄúThey are likely not to provide full immunity or be fully effective for every age group and for every person. That‚Äôs a big ask ‚Äî that you‚Äôre 100 per cent effective on every age group and every person. So it‚Äôs likely that we won‚Äôt get that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe might get a vaccine that‚Äôs 50 per cent effective, and we might get a vaccine that can prevent disease, but it might not prevent transmission from person to person. We might also get a vaccine that is safe for the majority of adults, let‚Äôs say, but it may not be suitable for everyone with every underlying condition, whether that‚Äôs diabetes or asthma or something else.‚Äù

She added: ‚ÄúWe need to carry on focusing on therapeutics because vaccines won‚Äôt solve everything.‚Äù

Experts think it is unlikely that Covid vaccines will achieve what is known as sterilising immunity, where an infection is completely blocked.

Dr Claire Waddington, clinical lecturer in vaccinology and infectious diseases at the University of Cambridge, said: ‚ÄúIt is probably going to be very hard to get a vaccine that interrupts transmission to the level where you‚Äôd want to hug granny if you are infected ‚Äî that‚Äôs a very high bar for a vaccine to meet.‚Äù

The target that has been set in trials of the Oxford vaccine is a 50 per cent reduction in the number of people who catch Covid who then go on to develop certain symptoms. The trials counts a positive case as a positive test and somebody having one serious symptom, such as pneumonia diagnosed by chest x-ray or falling blood oxygen levels that mean they need help to breathe.

Alternatively a case is counted when a positive PCR test is accompanied by two less serious symptoms, such as a new cough, muscle pain or fatigue that interferes with everyday life.

Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca, the drugmaker that is partnering with Oxford, said this week that the ambition was to exceed the 50 per cent target, which has been set by regulators in the United States.

However, even if a vaccine reduces transmission, a 50 per cent level of efficacy may make it difficult to achieve herd immunity, where enough people in a community are protected from the virus to prevent explosive growth in infections.

Less than 10 per cent of Britain is estimated to have been infected and therefore may have some immunity. It has been estimated that between 60 and 70 per cent would have to be protected to achieve herd immunity.

‚ÄúIf 10 per cent are immune then 90 per cent are not. If the vaccine then ‚Äòprotects‚Äô half of these we reach 55 per cent,‚Äù Ian Jones, professor of virology at the University of Reading, said. ‚ÄúIn the remaining naive population infections continue but at a hugely reduced rate.

‚ÄúSo the virus limps along but all the time adding to the immune population. Will we achieve 100 per cent immunity? No. Will we get to a flu-like situation? Yes ‚Äî a vanishing endpoint with some community transmission and some deaths, probably seasonal, but the epidemic wave is ended.‚Äù

**Virus ‚Äòhas mutated to spread faster‚Äô**  
In February of this year, a single protein spike on the surface of a single coronavirus had a single mutation. Then that virus infected someone, and spread (Tom Whipple writes.)

That variant, containing a difference of one amino acid, has conquered the world, leading to suggestions the virus may have evolved to transmit better.

Researchers in Britain and the United States have mapped the spread of the mutation, known as the Spike 614G variant, and shown that it has pushed out other versions of the virus to predominate. The way in which it has achieved that, though, remains unclear.

Viruses mutate all the time and most mutations make no difference to how they behave. A study of 2,500 viral genomes shows that in March most of the outbreak in England was seeded from a different version of the virus, known as 614D. By June, almost all cases were 614G. The same has been observed in other countries.

The fact that 614G has been so successful suggests that it has found a way to spread or survive better. In theory, virologists believe that there is an evolutionary pressure on viruses to increase their rate of transmission and decrease their severity ‚Äî a dead human is no good to a virus.

The study, by researchers from universities across Britain, found no difference in disease severity among those with the two variants. This was not a surprise ‚Äî scientists believe the relatively low death rate from coronavirus makes it more likely that it would evolve to spread faster rather than be milder. Laboratory tests have shown that infected cells seems to produce viral particles faster.

When they tested this theory in the real world, looking at the growth of clusters, the evidence was ambiguous. Writing before a peer review in *MedrXiv*, they said that it was possible its dominance was down to chance.

‚ÄúWhether the current explosive epidemics across the world are to any degree being driven by 614G, or whether it is simply the beneficiary of being in the right place at the right time, it is now the dominant variant,‚Äù they said.

They added it was critical to understand how the virus is changing better. ‚ÄúChanges in the transmissibility of a circulating virus could have a major effect on pandemic planning and the effectiveness of pandemic response.‚Äù",,,1601034230,{},g6ixuq5,True,t3_izhxkr,False,True,t3_izhxkr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/izhxkr/first_covid_vaccines_will_not_be_a_silver_bullet/g6ixuq5/,1601034240,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

and

**""Cardiac Complications Attributed to Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine: A Systematic Review of the Literature""**

## Abstract

**Introduction:** Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are widely used in the long-term treatment of connective tissue disease and usually considered safe. However, chloroquine- or **hydroxychloroquine-related cardiac disorder is a rare** but severe adverse event, which can lead to death. 

**Results:** Eighty-six articles were identified, reporting individual cases or short series, providing information on 127 patients (65.4% female). A majority of patients were treated with chloroquine (58.3%), with the remaining treated with hydroxychloroquine (39.4%), or both in succession. **Most patients had been treated for a long time (median 7 years, minimum 3 days; maximum 35 years)** and **with a high cumulative dose (median 1235 g for hydroxychloroquine and 803 g for chloroquine).** Conduction disorders were the main side effect reported, affecting 85% of patients. Other non-specific adverse cardiac events included ventricular hypertrophy (22%), hypokinesia (9.4%), heart failure (26.8%), pulmonary arterial hypertension (3.9%), and valvular dysfunction (7.1%). For 78 patients reported to have been withdrawn from treatment, some recovered normal heart function (44.9%), while for others progression was unfavorable, resulting in irreversible damage (12.9%) or death (30.8%).

With this type of mask, unfiltered air is released when the wearer exhales.
Health care providers must be trained and pass a fit test to confirm a proper seal before using an N95 respirator in the workplace. Like surgical masks, N95 masks are intended to be disposable. However, researchers are testing ways to disinfect N95 masks so they can be reused.

However, I was wondering if anyone else has ever worked with this dataset and could explain something to me? Basically the numbers feel a bit high to me. For example, the number of deaths that are coded to be associated with covid is 336k rather than closer to 200k. In addition, the numbers for 'All Causes' seem to be higher than expected as well. I was trying to compare 2020 to other years, so was adding up deaths by All Causes for January- August of each year. However that number seemed to be above 3 million for most years even for that 8 month period, when my understanding was that in general more like 2.5 million people die each year.

Any ideas of what I might be misunderstanding or how I should filter the data more appropriately? My fear is that I'm double-counting deaths somehow. My father was wanting to understand whether deaths are being over-reported because of coronavirus and so I wanted to show that there really are more deaths this year than previous years, regardless of reported cause (sigh...). Not sure this is actually the right data set to use though. Thanks for any help you can give!

Now jokes aside...

It sounds to me like you're one of many people who were royally screwed over by the pandemic, and because you can't exactly take your anger out on COVID, you instead choose to direct that anger towards other people that seemingly aren't affected as much as you were. You think that anyone following laws, bylaws or rules pertaining to measures meant to slow the spread of the virus falls into that category of people. You think that while the virus will continue to spread, it's actually these people that are responsible for destroying the US economy because they're ""afraid to live life"". Maybe if people weren't such pussies, we could have let the virus sweep through the country while carrying on with our daily activities, business as usual, and thereby avoiding a recession.

Nope, it doesn't work that way, but that's a topic for another day.

Have you gotten a medical exemption then? Have you tried meds to help with your anxiety or claustrophobia? Have you exhausted all options beyond just saying you have a condition that precludes you from wearing one?

Still, even if you can't wear a mask, your condition would absolutely make it ideal for you to follow social distancing. Again, that's something that selfish people refuse to do and, unlike masks, there's literally **zero** excuse for it.

&gt;will never convince anyone to switch over to your side.

This is pretty disingenuous. If a person is seeing that many cases/deaths in their country and still refuses to follow those measures to keep their country safely opened, then there's virtually nothing I can say to change their minds.

&gt;All it does is make you feel superior and push others further away.

Then add vindictive to that list if a person refuses to wear a mask and jeopardize public health out of spite.

[],,whatTheHeyYoda,,,[],,,,text,t2_11bp8u,False,False,[],"I am really not writing this for you, but for others who might find this.  I am reasonably confident that you will react angrily simply out of a need to be right.

You are correct and incorrect....and here's why.

If you are seated right next to an index patient, in the cloud of aerosols coming from their nose and mouth, then yes, a filter won't help.  Mask and goggles yes.  Filter no.

But let's say you are 18 feet away. 

The virus is not wafting out of their mouth hole just as a virus.  It is coming out as part of a respiratory droplet, which is significantly larger than the virus size.  That respiratory droplet is actually an aerosol (100 nm is the size cut-off between droplet (ballistic) and true aerosols consisting of water, salts, and a whole bunch of other things that combine into the aerosol.

N95 masks work so well because they actually are catching those respiratory aerosols.

Otherwise, every single Dr in the world would be infected by CoVid, if N95‚Äôs don't work.

Merv13 and above work the same (essentially)...supertight woven material, multiple layers, combined with electrostatic charge.

Anyway, those aerosols do get diluted by the overall volume of air in the room.

And if there's low ACH (&lt;1), then the emitted aerosols will build in concentration until the actual infectious dose is reached.

What is the infectious dose?  No one knows for sure.

But based on the infectious dose for influenza , TB and other respiratory vector diseases, it is significantly more than just one virion.

So, if you have a MERV13 filter or better, removing the respiratory aerosols from the air before they build to infectious dose, it does prevent transmission.

Now...at some point the filter won't be able to keep up...for example if ventilation is particularly bad, if you have multiple aerosol emitters, the room volume is small like a closet.

But filters do help...even a box fan with a MERV13 filter from a house HVAC system strapped to the inlet side.

Dr. Jimenez, Dr. Linsey Marr, Dr. Shelly Miller all aerosol scientists/IAQ experts have been extraordinairily communicative in their twitter feeds about these sorts of things.

[],,NewShooterComingOut,,,[],,,,text,t2_4ts3jbfm,False,False,[],"BOULDER, Colo. ‚Äî Young adults are pushing back on a public health order [banning gatherings for people ages 18 to 22](https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/new-boulder-county-public-health-order-prohibits-people-ages-18-22-from-gathering-in-any-capacity) in the city of Boulder.

On Thursday, Boulder County Public health issued the order to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 following the sharp rise of positive cases among that age group.  


Matthew Parone is a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder and lives on campus. The university is currently home to the largest outbreak in the state with more than 1,200 cases. 

Parone is 21 years old and says he feels trapped and robbed of the college experience he was promised by the university.

‚ÄúI felt so targeted and it felt patronizing as if this whole thing was our fault, that we like, asked to be here,‚Äù Parone said. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a radical decision.‚Äù

He says it‚Äôs ‚Äúscary‚Äù to know that he can be policed for talking to someone he doesn‚Äôt live with.

‚ÄúThe order was trying to scapegoat students rather than place the blame where it does belong, which is on the university,‚Äù he said.

Scott Pribble, a spokesperson for the campus police department, says most of the gatherings they‚Äôve seen in the past are in the residential halls and people cramming into one room.

‚ÄúIf you live in a residence hall, but there are other people that don‚Äôt live in your residence room, then you cannot gather with those people during this two-week period,‚Äù Pribble said.

He says enforcement officers will be out patrolling the campus and closely monitoring the residential halls. Students found guilty of egregious violations could face a ten-day suspension or expulsion, according to school officials.

Parone feels like the restrictions go too far.

‚ÄúWe are far away from our families, we have no one and they want us to isolate in our rooms. I think there‚Äôs a human dignity problem here,‚Äù he said.

Several students in groups of two or more on campus admitted they don‚Äôt live in the same dorm room, but live in the same residential hall. When asked how they felt about violating the health order, many shrugged it off saying they don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre doing anything wrong.

Denver7 drove past several homes in the Hill neighborhood. Many gathered outside went inside when they saw our camera, others yelled that they live together.

But the [health order specifies](https://assets.bouldercounty.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pho-2020-07-09232020.pdf) that homes with four or more residents like a fraternity or sorority house should not gather in common areas.

Young adults who gather in the city of Boulder between 18 and 22 years old could face a $1,000 fine or 90 days in jail if found in violation of the mandate.",,,1601046727,{},g6jia66,True,t3_izl7hd,False,True,t3_izl7hd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/izl7hd/boulder_students_speak_out_against_new_public/g6jia66/,1601047056,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Similarly for your car company example, people did do something like that, but A. they had to already be split and in the holding company it couldn't be done just for PPP, B. each one could only get a PPP value based on its payroll following the formula.

People would have far less need to quarantine if community spread is contained too. Want to wager a guess as to what helps achieve that?

Have you stopped for a moment and thought of a reason why this might be happening that is not ""everybody except me is dumb and selfish""? Because this is rarely a good explanation for anything. 

Do you go to work in the morning? Do you take public transportation to get there? Have you tried to follow social distancing in a bus at 7:30 in the morning? Even wearing masks, that's dangerous, and something pretty much everybody is forced to do. This is just an example.

Just because ""news"" websites and Reddit love to put up a freak show and give plenty of space and coverage to those who refuse to social distance and wear masks, just so that some other people can feel smart and superior, doesn't mean a sizeable part of any population actually thinks masks are dictatorship or something.

There is a difference between ""I protest because I don't want to wear a mask"" and ""I protest because I was fired"" or ""please let me keep my restaurant open, or it will go bankrupt"".

Just a hint: when thinking about a problem involving other people, the first step is always to assume other people are rational agents, at least as rational as you, and that they have reasons to do things, not that they're ""dumb and selfish"". 

Second:
&gt;What's 'very hard' about wearing a mask and social distancing to help the country stay safely reopened so that everyone can go work, school and avoid quarantines?

Reread my comment. My point is that wearing masks and social distancing are the easy part of the restrictions. The other parts, the ones that perhaps you are not experiencing, are the hard ones.

Not everybody can afford the luxury of staying home and not see anybody, or to have the privilege of always in any situations have 2 square meters of personal space.

Doctors are seeing a huge increase in patients who have been shedding abnormal amounts of hair, and they believe it is related to stress associated with the coronavirus.


Annrene Rowe was getting ready to celebrate her 10th wedding anniversary this summer when she noticed a bald spot on her scalp. In the following days, her thick shoulder-length hair started falling out in clumps, bunching up in the shower drain.

‚ÄúI was crying hysterically,‚Äù said Mrs. Rowe, 67, of Anna Maria, Fla.

Mrs. Rowe, who was hospitalized for 12 days in April with symptoms of the coronavirus, soon found strikingly similar stories in online groups of Covid-19 survivors. Many said that several months after contracting the virus, they began shedding startling amounts of hair.

Doctors say they too are seeing many more patients with hair loss, a phenomenon they believe is indeed related to the coronavirus pandemic, affecting both people who had the virus and those who never became sick.

In normal times, some people shed noticeable amounts of hair after a profoundly stressful experience such as an illness, major surgery or emotional trauma.

Now, doctors say, many patients recovering from Covid-19 are experiencing hair loss ‚Äî not from the virus itself, but from the physiological stress of fighting it off. Many people who never contracted the virus are also losing hair, because of emotional stress from job loss, financial strain, deaths of family members or other devastating developments stemming from the pandemic.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs many, many stresses in many ways surrounding this pandemic, and we‚Äôre still seeing hair loss because a lot of the stress hasn‚Äôt gone away,‚Äù said Dr. Shilpi Khetarpal, an associate professor of dermatology at the Cleveland Clinic.

Before the pandemic, there were weeks when Dr. Khetarpal didn‚Äôt see a single patient with hair loss of this type. Now, she said, about 20 such patients a week come in. One was a woman having difficulty home-schooling two young children while also working from home. Another was a second-grade teacher anxiously trying to ensure that all her students had computers and internet access for online instruction.

In a July survey about post-Covid symptoms among 1,567 members of a survivors‚Äô group, 423 people reported unusual hair loss, according to the group, Survivor Corps, and Natalie Lambert, an associate research professor at Indiana University School of Medicine, who helped conduct the survey.

Dr. Emma Guttman-Yassky, the incoming chairwoman of the dermatology department at Mount Sinai‚Äôs Icahn School of Medicine, said she has treated many frontline medical workers for hair loss, including her hospital‚Äôs employees.

‚ÄúSome of them had Covid, but not all of them,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the stress of the situation. They were apart from their families, they worked for many hours.‚Äù

For most patients the condition should be temporary, doctors say, but it could last months.

There are two types of hair loss the pandemic seems to be triggering, experts say.

In one condition, called telogen effluvium, people shed much more than the typical 50-to-100 hairs per day, usually beginning several months after a stressful experience. It essentially involves a shifting or ‚Äútripping of the hair growth system,‚Äù said Dr. Sara Hogan, a dermatologist at the David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles, who has been seeing up to seven patients a day with the condition.


Mrs. Rowe tried for a while tying her hair up in a bun, but has resorted to wigs. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to make the best of it,‚Äù she said.
Mrs. Rowe tried for a while tying her hair up in a bun, but has resorted to wigs. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to make the best of it,‚Äù she said.Eve Edelheit for The New York Times
In healthy hair cycles, most hairs are in a growing phase, with a small percentage in a short resting phase and only about 10 percent of hairs in a shedding or telogen phase. But with telogen effluvium, ‚Äúpeople are shedding more, growing less.,‚Äù Dr. Khetarpal said, and up to 50 percent of hair might skip ahead to the shedding phase, with only about 40 percent in the growth phase.


The phenomenon, which some women also experience after pregnancy, typically lasts about six months, but if stressful situations persist or recur, some people develop a chronic shedding condition, Dr. Hogan said. The other hair loss condition that is increasing now is alopecia areata, in which the immune system attacks hair follicles, usually starting with a patch of hair on the scalp or beard, said Dr. Mohammad Jafferany, a psychiatrist and dermatologist at Central Michigan University.

‚ÄúIt is known to be associated with or exacerbated by psychological stress,‚Äù said Dr. Jafferany.

Dr. Guttman-Yassky said that she has seen ‚Äúa huge increase in this type of alopecia.‚Äù

Not all of the patients had Covid-19, she said, but the ones who did tended to progress very quickly from one or two bald patches to ‚Äúlosing hair all over the body,‚Äù including eyebrows and eyelashes. She said that might be because the storm of inflammation that some Covid patients experience elevates immune molecules linked to conditions like alopecia.

Experts don‚Äôt know exactly why stress triggers these conditions, which affect both women and men. It might be related to increased levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, or to effects on blood supply, Dr. Hogan said.

The hair loss itself can cause more stress, Dr. Khetarpal said, especially for women, whose hair is often more closely tied to identity and self-confidence.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your trademark,‚Äù said Mary Lou Ostling, 77, a retired educator who lives in the Stuyvesant Town neighborhood of Manhattan. She was hospitalized for Covid-19 for eight days in the early spring and later noticed that ‚Äúmy hair started coming out in chunks,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI always was clearing hair out of the comb, brush, the sink.‚Äù

Ms. Ostling said she also could tell that her hair wasn‚Äôt growing much because she wasn‚Äôt seeing roots that contrasted with the color she had previously dyed it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always had very long, very thick, very curly hair,‚Äù she said. But in July, ‚ÄúI simply had a lot of it all cut off. I couldn‚Äôt deal with it anymore.‚Äù

When she came home from the hairdresser, she said, ‚Äúmy husband was just staring at me. He said, ‚ÄòI think I have a different wife.‚Äô It was very depressing.‚Äù She said she has finally begun to detect some hair growth.

Experts recommend good nutrition, vitamins like biotin and stress-reduction techniques like yoga, scalp massage or mindfulness meditation. Some also recommend minoxidil, a hair-growth drug, but Dr. Hogan warns patients that it can initially cause more hair loss before it starts working.


For people depressed or traumatized by hair loss, Dr. Jafferany recommends psychotherapy, but not necessarily medication because some antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications can exacerbate hair loss.

When Liz Weidhorn, 44, of Fair Lawn, N.J., who tested positive for Covid-19 in March, noticed members of an online Covid group bemoaning hair loss, she told herself that if it happened to her, ‚ÄúI will take it with grace and I‚Äôll get a kick-ass hat,‚Äù she recalled.

But recently after showering, ‚ÄúI looked at my wet hair and I could see so much scalp,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand I couldn‚Äôt believe how emotional I got.‚Äù She cried and called her husband in to look at it.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really shocking,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt got me very sad.‚Äù

Ms. Weidhorn, who writes a blog about baking pastry, started taking biotin, had her mother cut her hair and is considering getting a headband.

Mrs. Rowe, who managed the front desk for a wellness spa, has gone further. ‚ÄúI tried putting my hair in one of those messy buns, but it looks terrible with the bald spots on the sides,‚Äù she said. So, she got wigs: ‚Äúa really short pixie one, a pageboy one, a long curly one and a strawberry blonde one,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to make the best of it.‚Äù

Dr. Hogan said some patients find the situation so upsetting they avoided washing or brushing their hair because they noticed the hair loss more during those activities. She tells them they shouldn‚Äôt be afraid of normal grooming.

She added, ‚ÄúPatients don‚Äôt like this when I say this, but they come around to it: Hair is not crucial for your survival.‚Äù",,,1601057548,{},g6k3r75,True,t3_izol6l,False,True,t3_izol6l,/r/Coronavirus/comments/izol6l/losing_your_hair_can_be_another_consequence_of/g6k3r75/,1601059337,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Well have you actually looked for reports? Whether from news outlets or more scientific ones? Will every report from patients result in new news coverage when it has already been covered at least once before? Probably not. But from what I can see, the science is closing in on some percentages when it comes to long-term effects.

And do you have to feel it to have actual long-term damage? Could it be that it could turn out to be an actual problem later down the line and that most people don't report it?

&gt; In the **CDC report** that looked at recovery rates for people with mild illness, **1 in 5 young and healthy adults reported prolonged problems**.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2020/persistent-covid-symptoms.html

&gt; What percentage of those with covid-19 are affected with long-term symptoms?

&gt; We don‚Äôt know for sure, but **multiple studies have suggested approximately 10 percent of people experience prolonged illness after covid-19**. At even a fraction of that, the toll is huge given that 6.7 million people in the United States so far have gotten the disease (and more than 30 million worldwide).

Everyone can have religious beliefs. The United States is a melting pot, not a salad bowl. Your country does not respect cultural beliefs. Your country expects every single person to assimilate.

China is more capitalist than the US but it has controls to prevent corruption. Your country legalized corruption.

Wearing surgical masks outdoors, where virus-laden particles easily disperse, has even less value.‚Äú

I was screamed at more in March and the subsequent winter months than I ever have been before. I‚Äôd tell them we had tablets for virtual visits and not one person took the time to do that with their resident. I and some other nurses ended up Skyping in on our days off so the residents felt like they were special and people wanted to meet with them. 

During the summer we thought we‚Äôd... bend the rules slightly to allow outdoor visitation with 10-15 ft. distancing depending on humidity as other factors that day (while we aren‚Äôt explicitly banned from doing this, we aren‚Äôt explicitly allowed to either in my state.) We know socialization is important for our seniors. People wouldn‚Äôt wear masks to visit, and kept trying to move their chairs closer. We had to ban four people from the premises, and finally the only thing that got people to stop being morons was saying that if they moved closer to the resident we would assume they were infected and send them home with them immediately. Legally questionable, but selfishness finally overrode their Facebook anti-mask programming apparently. 

It‚Äôs just exhausting to have completely changed how we operate in a way that makes way more work for us - zero home health/hospice support staff allowed inside, no therapists, no volunteers, more intense cleaning regimen, fixing mechanical problems ourselves to avoid outside contractors coming in, etc. - and families aren‚Äôt even willing to wear a fucking mask or stay where we put them. We have an extremely vulnerable population with 75% of our residents above age 90. We have two above age *100*. It‚Äôs a miracle that the virus isn‚Äôt in the facility already, as we‚Äôre adjacent to a major hot spot, a true testament to staff‚Äôs diligence at home and at work, but if it gets in I‚Äôd bet at *least* of half our population is hospitalized and of that, most will die.

[],,QueenCuttlefish,,,[],,,,text,t2_136zja,False,False,[],"I'm an urgent care LPN. My clinic is directly contracted with Disney World and we operate in one of their facilities. If we're not being fucked by our own corporation, we're getting fucked by Disney.


Patients are allowed to make doctor appointments to be tested for the virus every 5 minutes. The test itself takes 15 to run. 4 clinical staff is considered ""fully staffed."" One of us quitting won't open up more positions, unfortunately. We'll just have to work more to cover the loss or pray someone decides to pick up a shift until someone else is hired. My manager will  disinfect rooms, room patients, and even do drug screens if she's not dealing with a crazy patient or in meetings. Even my manager's manager has physically come in to help the front desk register patients before. 


Since we're an urgent care, people will come to us before going to the hospital. But since we're not inpatient, we don't get much priority in terms of supplies. We don't even have enough equipment for all of us to take vitals at once. One surgical mask per shift, gloves, and goggles/face shield is considered appropriate PPE for us when we collect specimens for rapid tests. Because it's Florida, there hasn't been a shift when we haven't been exposed to a positive case. 


We don't get hazard pay. We're not getting our yearly raises due to the ""financial cost"" of the pandemic. Meanwhile, the corporation has a referral program that will get you a nice $7500 if an RN you refer gets hired and they're continuing to build more facilities both here in Florida and in other states. $7500 is more than all of the money I've saved since starting my job here 1.5 years ago by living in my parents' house, never going out, never buying anything outside of groceries and scrub caps, and always bringing lunch. All of us either have second jobs, pick up extra shifts, or have a lot of support from our families. 


You know how the corporation thanks us? With commercials calling us heroes and an email with some lengthy spiritual reflection from our top executives. They get to work from home saying, ""we're a great team,"" while those of us in the trenches are testing dozens of people for the virus while also sending people to the hospital for active heart attacks, strokes, you name it.


I am fatally altruistic and don't want to leave my team because I am the only licensed nurse among the clinical staff here, nor do I want to go through the process of readjusting to a new job and new coworkers in the midst of an uncontrolled pandemic in one of the worst hit states in the damn country.


I feel so numb. I feel so helpless and dejected. I haven't seen my immunocompromised parents since January and won't be able to see them safely for the foreseeable future. I internalize my stress and have generalized anxiety so instead of crying, my muscles are just perpetually tensed up to the point I don't really sleep between shifts. I lie awake with muscle pains until it's time to get ready for work. Then I spend whatever days I'm off sleeping to make up for it.

&gt; If you want to look for misallocation of tax dollars just look at the pork barrel funds that were placed into the Covid relief bills that had nothing to do with struggling businesses or citizens.

Right, the problem wasn't private companies defrauding the government, but public spending you call pork barrel, though many would find it to be necessary to have increases in public spending in a pandemic.",,,1601052947,{},g6juoo0,False,t3_izi28a,False,True,t1_g6jov98,/r/Coronavirus/comments/izi28a/publicly_traded_firms_paid_dividends_bought_their/g6juoo0/,1601054155,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

[],,DataSomethingsGotMe,,,[],,,,text,t2_vcdds,False,False,[],"The whole debate on masks is symptomatic of why the UK has a terrible record vs COVID-19. The situation is even more exacerbated in the US, but here is my take on the UK.

In the UK the NHS lacked sufficient PPE, and so it is very likely a political decision which meant they were not mandatory. Creating a rush on masks would mean it would be harder for government to secure for the NHS, and in fact several briefings featured Mr Hancock (Health Secretary) asking for the surgical masks to be saved for those who need them the most. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, the government had to make a call.

Even now, the advice is mask or 'face covering', which itself is slightly absurd. You are essentially telling the public that a face covering, the nature of which is determined entirely by the individual, is also acceptable. This means a thin cloth would qualify as a face covering, yet clearly would not mitigate as much risk as an actual mask. I don't know about you, but I do not trust the general public to wear an adequate face covering.

If we are to take a zero tolerance approach to COVID related death or illness, the mandate would be for masks of sufficient quality to mitigate risk of transmission. Produce the masks, distribute to the public, enforce usage. Who cares if this is overkill? People are dying and those who aren't risk long term heath issues. These are high magnitude risks, and even if the likelihood of you getting it is small, the impact could be life changing. 

Now in the US, I don't know where to start. The fact that Dr Fauci is on the receiving end of attempts to discredit him is beyond the pale. Culturally if you will not listen to essentially the one person in the entire country who knows what he is talking about, you have a big problem.

I was fortunate enough to live in Hong Kong before the recent political upheaval. Masks are worn when someone is sick and they have to go into the office. Having someone sitting near you in the office coughing away is far less disturbing if they are wearing a mask. HK therefore had a healthy stock of them, and usage was considered absolutely normal, and obviously instrumental in defeating SARS many years ago. The same can be said for many countries in SE Asia - e.g. Singapore, Japan, Malaysia etc. There is no debate whatsoever on 'do masks work'. The very claim is not backed by any country with a track record of stemming a pandemic.

I digress. For the US, the reason masks were not recommended are likely linked with the denial of mircobiology. We are fortunate enough to be able to use critical thinking to look outside our own country, and determine what we think is true regardless of what our country is claiming, either through government or popular media. If you want to know how to beat a pandemic, refer to those with credibility in beating a pandemic. I don't know how the CDC is run, but claiming masks do not work? I cannot imagine who would claim this with a straight face.",,,1601051305,{},g6jrdnc,False,t3_izjsv0,False,True,t1_g6jlid2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/izjsv0/daily_discussion_post_september_25_questions/g6jrdnc/,1601052271,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Have you tried to follow social distancing in a bus at 7:30 in the morning? Even wearing masks, that's dangerous, and something pretty much everybody is forced to do. This is just an example.

Then do the bare minimum and wear a mask? Follow social distancing as much as possible while waiting for public transport? Do you assume I don't take public transport?

I don't care if people are doing as much as they can to follow the guidelines. Clearly there's a difference between essential travel and breaching social distancing guidelines for entertainment purposes (bars, parties and everything in between).

'France has been seeing an uptick in coronavirus infections and hundreds of new clusters in recent weeks, notably as young people gather at caf√©s or parties and families meet up for summer vacation.'

https://www.france24.com/en/20200804-france-facing-highly-likely-second-wave-of-covid-19-in-autumn-or-winter

Why not mention these factors then?

&gt;There is a difference between ""I protest because I don't want to wear a mask"" and ""I protest because I was fired"" or ""please let me keep my restaurant open, or it will go bankrupt"".

Again with this false narrative. Do you think restaurants can stay open with an uncontained outbreak? Do you not for one second think that the best case scenario for restaurants is to stay open with social distancing measures and adapting by focusing more on take out?

&gt;Just a hint: when thinking about a problem involving other people, the first step is always to assume other people are rational agents, at least as rational as you, and that they have reasons to do things, not that they're ""dumb and selfish"".

Holding parties in the middle of a pandemic that breaches social distancing guidelines is dumb and selfish.

Meeting up in groups big enough to cause a restaurant to break social distancing and thereby be at risk of closure is dumb and selfish.

Not wearing masks when you're in a crowded place like your public transportation example is dumb and selfish.

Sorry, but until you can provide a rational reason for people to be doing this, your argument is senseless.

&gt;Reread my comment. My point is that wearing masks and social distancing are the easy part of the restrictions.

Yet people willfully flout those easy restrictions, what's your point?

&gt;The other parts, the ones that perhaps you are not experiencing, are the hard ones.

Retail and F&amp;B businesses have reopened safely by following mask mandates and establishing social distancing for dine in guests. What's your argument?

&gt;Not everybody can afford the luxury of staying home and not see anybody

Again with a disingenuous argument. Most social distancing guidelines allow for people to meet up in groups of at least 10. Who's asking people to stay at home and not see anybody?

&gt;or to have the privilege of always in any situations have 2 square meters of personal space.

Beyond public transport, how often does that even occur for people outside your family bubble? Even at malls where the congestion tends to be at the escalators, it isn't even that hard to practice social distancing. It's certainly not hard to practice social distancing while in queues too.

As my comment above, I see two paths to audits, depending on the election.  I see either a strict auditing of all over $2million, or a weak or self audit for over $2million.

&gt;Another thing when I was trying to get my ppp loan the one thing that bugged me was it said in big letters ‚Äúeven if you do everything right and have the paperwork there is no guarantee your loan will be forgiven‚Äù in the end I didn‚Äôt take it because 1 it wasn‚Äôt even close enough to cover my buildings rent and secondly it wouldn‚Äôt be forgiven because I would be using it all on utilities for my building lease.

Yup, that is the concern, but even if you didn't get forgiven it was still a heavily deferred low-interest loan that rivals what you probably could get from your bank anyway.

Also, it was ear marked specifically for payroll protection, so if your business is employee light but utility heavy, then yes, this was not the government protecting you as much as the others.

No dispute here!

&gt;  at the very least seeing family, friends and having some things you like to do as hobbies shouldn't totally be sacrificied for the ""greater good"".

Totally, there is no need to totally isolate yourself.  Go see family, but stay outside, wear masks, and limit the length of your visit.  Go do your hobbies, as long as they can be done safely.

&gt;  If I felt that way I can only extrapolate that many extroverts and such probably totally lost it by now and cannot function in quarentine mode.

No need to extrapolate--the empirical evidence is unfortunately all around us!

&gt; For that reason I don't think you can do a half assed corona response where you encourage busisnesses to all be open, schools to be open, but still expect people to be in lockdown mode for their own life.

I don't think ""lockdown mode"" is expected, but no flying to weddings (or other big gatherings) or going to bars or gyms.  These are too risky right now.

&gt; I personally plan to wear a mask anytime im in an indoor space and will pick and choose my outtings based on how passionate I feel about it (so probably no movie theatres, but open to meeting up with close friends and families and occasional gym outtings because that was my biggest passion pre lockdown and its open)

Better to *avoid* indoor spaces whenever possible.  If you do go inside, wear a fitted N95 (or a surgical mask if those are not available) and limit the duration of your excursion.  Absolutely do not go to the gym: A poorly ventilated indoor space with a bunch of people exercising and breathing hard is a dream come true for this virus.  Until then, exercise outside and/or buy your own basic exercise equipment.

&gt;  But this coronavirus situation has convinced me rellying on individuals to act accordingly and blaming them when it doesn't work simply doesn't work. If its unsafe - have rules in place to lock it down. At the end of the day people are inherently selfish unfortunately.

Absolutely agree here.  And the government in many places bears the blame for not closing high-risk settings like indoor dining, bars, and gyms.

&gt; I am terrified about this virus like everyone else but I truly do feel if I do get it, it will statistically probably be from a work interaction anyway even with PPE.

Also the ""intervention"" in the study was given low-molecular-weight-heparin to ICU cases, which is a standard procedure in my country for EVERY hospitalized patient with a severe infectious disease and has been used on EVERY COVID-patient from the beginning no matter if he was on a general ward or the ICU. I am rather amazed that there haven been cases treated without this measure in a first world country.

Drawing the conclusion that risk of death of ICU-cases is reduced NOW from 30% to 3% borders on scientific illiteracy and I rather stick to the statement of my national disease control agency which clearly states :

*The current development must be further carefully monitored. The number of deaths among reported COVID-19 cases is currently low. This is mainly due to the relatively high proportion of younger people among newly diagnosed cases in the last weeks, of which relatively few fall seriously ill and die. If the trend continues and more elderly and vulnerable people get infected, an increase in hospitalisations and deaths is to be expected.*  ([https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges\_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/Sept\_2020/2020-09-24-en.pdf?\_\_blob=publicationFile](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/Sept_2020/2020-09-24-en.pdf?__blob=publicationFile))

I quit within less than two weeks. Why?

* Shifts were 8 hours long with a single 30 min break. This can mean upwards of 5 hours without a scheduled break.
* Calls were almost always back-to-back. You also had about 30 seconds to do after-call wrap up work before another caller would be immediately thrown at you. It was so bad that I was actually losing my voice after a week.

Saying that the cases are increasing but the deaths are staying flat is a ridiculous statement. for the past 9 months we've watched increased deaths from COVID lag behind positive case increased by about 4-6 weeks. because that's how long it takes someone to die from this virus.

Secondly,

You are correct that the low population density and restricted travel mobility has delayed the Dakotas from having a massive uptick until now. It doesn't mean that since they were the last to get it, that they should be cavalier with how they handle it. furthermore, its been clear that this virus isnt effected by seasonality, as cases exploded in the US in both early spring and late summer. Hot or not, you can still get it.

Thirdly,

Regardless of how many cases a town, city, or state has, requiring those infected and those who had come in contact with those infected to quarantine is just common sense. So when the state repeals a quarantine order, It's basically giving people who have had close contact with covid to continue going out and spreading it to others. So yes, ""Nobody is taking it seriously"" can be applied here.

And Finally,

You seem upset about getting downvoted, when you came to a sub that is clearly taking COVID seriously, (NOT HYSTERICALLY), and then make a post about how it doesn't need to be taken seriously.

The restrictions that would prevent people from working or going to school are easily avoided if people wear a mask and follow social distancing guidelines.  

People would have far less need to quarantine if community spread is contained too. Want to wager a guess as to what helps achieve that?

See New Zealand, Finland, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong as good examples.

&gt;Don't act all high and mighty because you can wear a piece of cloth in front of your mouth and nose, we all know the restrictions have been, are and will be way heavier than just mandatory masks, and they have been very hard on many people.

Social distancing is arguably more important, yet people can't seem to do that either. What's the next excuse going to be?

&gt;and they have been very hard on many people.

What's 'very hard' about wearing a mask and social distancing to help the country stay safely reopened so that **everyone** can go work, school and avoid quarantines?
