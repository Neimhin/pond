Treating COVID like an emergency is appropriate up until the point when it stops being an emergency. Temporary measures that are meant to “flatten the curve” and minimize deaths end when COVID causes hospitalizations and deaths at a rate that’s comparable to the other risks that society voluntarily accepts for various reasons (e.g. we don’t ban driving even though it would prevent a ton of car accident deaths because we know that the burden that would place on life isn’t worth it).",,,1613272712,{},gncdi1j,False,t3_lj2lnm,False,True,t1_gncccw6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lj2lnm/covid_we_could_live_with_virus_like_we_do_flu_by/gncdi1j/,1613287441,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Myself and most everyone else work hard for their shit but I would absolutely, without question, let someone steal everything I own well before I'd be prepared to kill another human. The fact that you value your materialistic shit over a human life only further highlights all of my previous points.

&gt;ETA of the .223 Rem is split second at the common range.

Get help. You're not cool. You're not badass. You're not a hero.

&gt;TL:DR using the term assault rifle as an argument is just playing the fiddle of the old unlce Adolph.

Refer to my previous comment. You, me and just about anyone remotely familiar with firearms or even video games for that matter knows exactly what I'm referring to. Furthermore, I wasn't using 'assault' in that context nor attempting to make that point, which only reinforces my suggestion that you're bringing up meaningless and likely rehearsed talking point with no relevance to the actual issue.

&gt;Also make up your mind, If the AR-15 is so mighty and efficient at killing human, it would be equally efficient at killing soft game like deer or rabbits.

Ahh, yeeeah, it's almost as if AR-15's are designed without soft game targets in mind but instead, like, I don't know, maybe sustained fire such as military application and/or to kill humans en masse. Even the most amateur hunter knows that you get one shot (rarely two) to hit your target; literally no one is going out unloading even 5 rounds let along 20+ at a single target.

&gt;Zero practical applications except for... having a fun shooting one at the range?

I'd personally have fun riding a motorbike 200km/h down the motorway. Something being fun doesn't translate to it being practical or appropriate which is precisely why there are laws.

&gt;Im not hero and never claimed to be one. I just keep living my simple quiet life not harming anyone and would appreciate others to not come over and demand I conform with their views.

Unless someone came on your property or tries stealing your shit, in which case you've preemptively decided you'll shoot them \[with a .223 Rem\]. Secondly, what fucking views are people coming over demanding you confirm to? You talking about mormons /S?

Seriously, I presume you already conform to the vast majority of the laws of the land. But no, owning an AR-15 or other ""assault rifle"" (I used it again REEEE) is where the line in drawn? Jesus fucking christ dude. 

&gt;Im not hero

It's obvious to any sane person, though I question how much you truely believe it. My best bet is that you're a scared little coomer troglodyte who uses guns as a crutch for feelings of inadequacy.

This is a challenge for science communication in dynamic situations like covid. A scientist can look at the existing research and _think_ something might be good advice. 3 months later research comes out showing they were wrong, so they change the advice [1]. That's ok, because that's how science works.

Typically scientists are rightly hesitant to share opinions without research because they know it can be hard for people when it changes. In this case though, you have to trust an experts opinion and be ok when they get a few things wrong along the way. I would be concerned if the experts were not changing their recommendations as new information came out. See [1] again where diehards have ignored all the RCTs done.

[1] Hydroxycholorquine is a great example. There were some papers that showed it might work against SARS1, and some anecdotes so people thought it might work.

Based on what I've seen (so this is absolutely, completely 100% anecdotal), here in my city people were way more social and ""close"" over the Summer when our rates were incredibly low.  But once the cold weather hit, everything started ramping back up again.

Does that have to do with indoor vs outdoor transmission?  Seasonal boosts to the transmission rate of the virus?  Holiday gatherings?  All three?  Maybe none?  Maybe some other factor we haven't accounted for?  Maybe the true spread of the disease is so great that we are much closer to herd immunity than we thought?  Or that there is a huge percentage of people with natural immunity?

Because also in my city, we were told there would be a Thanksgiving and Xmas ""spike"" but our numbers peaked BEFORE Thanksgiving so that did not turn out to be true.  However, in NYC just 2 hours away, their spike was deeper into the Winter and could plausibly be blamed on holidays.

100 miles between us but somehow, Philadelphians didn't gather over the holidays but NYCers did?  Is there that much of a difference in culture?  

Lots of questions but few answers.  Either way, all the bad numbers are rapidly dropping here and we have a lot of good to look forward to so we can let the analysts sort it out.

Just rambling a bit.

A 2 week respiratory disease with death rates similar to the flu? Then the goal really just needs to be keeping the hospitals from being overwhelmed. Beyond that, we enter into a pretty ambiguous space. 

Now it turns out that some kids are developing MIS-C after clearing their infections and we don't even know the mechanism. It turns out this ""respiratory disease"" can directly infect basically every organ system including nerves and the brain. It turns out that a not insignificant portion of ""asymptomatic"" people develop organ damage that may be permanent. It turns out that some of the variants are more infectious, which also increases the danger to populations that were previously less likely to get the disease or transmit it (like children).

There are various percentages for the provinces. So more math is involved.

Also, there is some selection bias. The people who were willing to be donating blood were likely people who were more willing to be around other people, and therefore more likely to be exposed to the virus.

Also too, you must look at the median age of a country, the younger the median age, the more people will survive COVID-19. The median age in South Africa is 28.

If this is the case, the outbreak could have started in China, parts of SEA, and/or parts of Africa because those locations are where these bats are known to live/migrate and some communities in these regions use bat guanos as medicine though I'm not sure if covid can survive on guanos processed into pills. If guano can carry covid, it's not a bad theory either considering guano is heavily used as fertilizer as well.",,,1613333911,{},gngmk2z,False,t3_ljpmti,False,True,t1_gngg0v5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ljpmti/cnn_exclusive_who_wuhan_mission_finds_possible/gngmk2z/,1613343009,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There's a bit of a Schroedinger's CCP going on here, because it suggests that they're nearly omniscient about the virus while at the same time being pretty incompetent at controlling it and covering it up.

We know that the medical system missed something like 19 out of 20 cases of the virus early on in the epidemic.  Here in Seattle we had the initial outbreak at the lifecare facility which medical authorities thought was contained.  It was up to the Seattle Flu Study which took respiratory samples that they'd collected for cold + flu testing and violated protocols and rtPCR tested them against SARS-CoV-2 and found a positive sample which showed that there was unmonitored community spread (and that was after the world knew there was a virus and we had a test for it).

We also know that the virus was spreading it Italy in late-Nov/mid-Dec cryptically.  The first confirmed cases were on Jan 31st.  The first confirmed deaths were on Feb 22nd.  That's a 1.5-2 month lag where the virus was in Italy but nobody knew about.

Given how asymptomatically this virus spreads and due to the fact that it is ""just"" a viral pneumonia (there literally isn't a single symptom it causes that isn't caused by some other circulating respiratory virus) the virus will always be well established in a population before doctors will realize that they have way too many cases of pneumonia going on at once.

They fucked it up, but it was always going to be fucked up.

I'm much more pissed about China for the current cover up that we can see in broad daylight going on here.  There should be much more widespread availability of respiratory samples from before Dec 2019 for sequencing and analysis, and they should have people (vaccinated people) out collecting bat shit from every mountain and ravine in Hubei.  Wastewater samples from before Dec have been destroyed ""per standard procedure"" (procedures better be fucking changing then and China better be treating those samples as epidemiological gold from here on out right?).  Instead China is trying to do everything it can to place the origin of the virus outside of China and obscure the source of the virus so that we can't do anything about preventing this from happening again in the future.

TL;DR:  Blame China for the right things.  Stop wishing you can make it simple that China could have stopped the virus.  And stop jacking off about WIV and lab release.

&gt;People are justifiably annoyed that suddenly the news meeting is reporting on almost each variant as if it’s some jaw dropping news when it’s been run of the mill in the science world for the better part of a year

The news media is reporting on these variants because they are already causing problems and will cause more down the road. South Africa was relying on the AZ vaccine, and now they're having to make significant adjustments to their rollout. B.1.1.7 will likely cause another surge in the US when it becomes the dominant strain in March.

People who have [more than five symptoms](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20214494v2.full-text) during acute infection are more likely to get long covid, but that says nothing about illness severity. Many people with mild initial infection (including myself) still have symptoms nearly a year later.

[76%](https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/08/most-patients-hospitalized-for-covid19-still-have-symptoms-six-months-later/) of hospitalized covid patients develop Long Covid, compared to 10-20% of all people who get covid. However, only about 5% of people with covid are hospitalized, which means that about 3.8% (5% * 76%) of people with covid develop long covid after hospitalization. This means that the remainder of the 10-20% of all people with covid who develop long covid (6.2%-16.2%) were not hospitalized, and that it's 1.6 to 4.3 times more common to not be hospitalized and get long covid than to be hospitalized and get long covid. 

This doesn't even touch on the fact that we generally know what's still wrong with people who had severe enough illness to be hospitalized. Their lungs, kidneys, and hearts have permanent damage that can be measured with medical tests. The treatment regimens for such problems are well-defined. Contrast this with the medical mystery of long covid after relatively mild illness, which is frequently no less debilitating than that seen after hospitalization. If you don't understand it, then you can't treat it. 

Overall (both from the perspective of numbers and medical ignorance), the disease burden of long covid after relatively mild illness is greater than that after hospitalization.

This has been known for a while. We are actually hitting the herd immunity threshold required for normalcy to return. How? The TRUE number of Covid-19 infections is FAR higher than known. The CDC reports that the real amount of infections are anywhere from 3.5x - 7x: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html

So there’s currently 28 million reported cases x 7 = 196 million people with natural Coronavirus immunity in the US. But that’s the best possible scenario, let’s keep it at 4x per the CDC link. 

That would mean 112 million people have natural immunity. Add onto it the 37 million of people with the first dose and you get 150 million people ~ with Covid immunity. Meaning somewhere around approximately 50% of the population has immunity from Covid-19.

(Mind the current freezing cold across America) Add onto it the gradual move towards warmer and humid Spring/Summer weather in which respiratory viruses spread less, and you get a perfect finale to end this once and for all.

It is ""only"" like 95% effective though so it makes sense that some people are just going to have to be that unfortunate 5% and still get it.  
    
&gt; At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to protect against future infection. The benefit of mRNA vaccines, like all vaccines, is those vaccinated gain this protection without ever having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick with COVID-19.
  
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html  
  
&gt; Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA). Coronaviruses have a spike-like structure on their surface called an S protein. COVID-19 mRNA vaccines give cells instructions for how to make a harmless piece of an S protein. After vaccination, your cells begin making the protein pieces and displaying them on cell surfaces. Your immune system will recognize that the protein doesn't belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies.

Irrelevant. The point was that we don't know how much immunity lasts.

&gt;Not vastly. This is being measured, at least in some countries.

Yes it is being measured, but not extensively. Those numbers also indicate that we are closer to herd immunity than we might think, and alot more people have antibodies compared to confirmed cases. This varies from region to region obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Trying telling that to the people of Bergamo. And don't forget the  people who don't die but end up with debilitating long-term symptoms.

I'm very sorry for the people that do get ill, but the data just isn't there. The virus is generally not very harmful for people. There are exceptions obviously, but they are rare. Long term symptoms, not much known on that. Let's focus on what we know. It's not very common for people to have long term symptoms at all, and we don't know why they occur yet but feel free to educate me if I appear to be out of the loop.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Firstly, testing for antibodies is probably more expensive than  vaccination. Secondly, the behaviour of naturally-acquired antibodies  seems, like much else with COVID, to be very variable. In a minority of  infected people the level of antibodies declines rapidly. Research so  far suggests that vaccination-induced antibody levels are more  consistent.

I really doubt it is. Do you have any reason to assume that? In any case, it shouldn't be. This might depend on your country. A lot in the USA regarding healthcare doesn't make any sense at all, so I wouldn't be surprised. Also what you say about vaccination-induced antibodies is not likely to be true. We also dont have a lot of data on vaccination for people that already have antibodies, but the data we have suggests they only need one shot, not excluding the possiblity that one shot might even be pointless. Here is a study that [suggests natural immunity might even be as effective as vaccination-induced immunity](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00071-6). There is no reason to think otherwise. Natural antibodies to seem to work against the new strains, as do the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. I have yet to read a study that concludes a loss in antibodies after a given amount of time. A lot of them are still ongoing.

I'm not saying vaccination is pointless. But for a lot of people, it might be.",,,1613296692,{},gndru0x,False,t3_ljg30t,False,True,t1_gndq517,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ljg30t/usa_7day_average_of_cases_drops_below_100000/gndru0x/,1613304043,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; I do also think we are vastly underestimating how many people already have antibodies.

Not vastly. This is being measured, at least in some countries.

&gt; Remember this virus is dangerous because it is hard to track down and highly contagious, not because it is very lethal. 

Trying telling that to the people of Bergamo. And don't forget the people who don't die but end up with debilitating long-term symptoms.

&gt; We're not really testing for people that have antibodies, but have no problem dishing out billions for vaccinating literally every fucking citizen regardless. It doesn't make too much sense to me.

Firstly, testing for antibodies is probably more expensive than vaccination. Secondly, the behaviour of naturally-acquired antibodies seems, like much else with COVID, to be very variable.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marek's_disease

Interesting thing about it is typically a virus won’t evolve to kill its host before it can spread it to others, but in the case of leaky vaccines that trait that would normally get rooted out doesn’t. From the wiki:

&gt; Vaccination is the only known method to prevent the development of tumors when chickens are infected with the virus. However, administration of vaccines does not prevent transmission of the virus, i.e., the vaccine is not sterilizing.

&gt; However, because vaccination does not prevent infection with the virus, Marek's is still transmissible from vaccinated flocks to other birds, including the wild bird population. **The first Marek's disease vaccine was introduced in 1970. The disease would cause mild paralysis, with the only identifiable lesions being in neural tissue. Mortality of chickens infected with Marek's disease was quite low**. Decades after the first vaccine was introduced, current strains of Marek Virus cause lymphoma formation on throughout the chicken's body and **mortality rates have reached 100% in unvaccinated chickens.**

&gt;Infection of the host and the transmission of the virus are not inhibited by the vaccine. This contrasts with most other vaccines, where infection of the host is prevented. Under normal conditions, highly virulent strains of the virus are not selected. A highly virulent strain would kill the host before the virus would have an opportunity to transmit to other potential hosts and replicate. Thus, less virulent strains are selected. These strains are virulent enough to induce symptoms but not enough to kill the host, allowing further transmission. However, the leaky vaccine changes this evolutionary pressure and permits the evolution of highly virulent strains.

The part I find most interesting:

&gt; The evolution of Marek's disease due to vaccination has had a profound effect on the poultry industry. **All chickens across the globe are now vaccinated against Marek's disease**. Highly virulent strains have been selected to the point that any chicken that is unvaccinated will die if infected.",,,1613284633,{},gnd7h6a,False,t3_lj01qr,False,True,t1_gn82k5b,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lj01qr/pfizers_vaccine_appears_to_reduce_coronavirus/gnd7h6a/,1613297234,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I agree that they have this interest, but I don't follow why that would might lead them to lie or dissemble about the efficacy or safety of the vaccines. If more people take ineffective or unsafe vaccines, that won't help achieve that interest of the vaccine succeeding. I don't see it.

ETA of police force is measured in minutes if you do live in urban environment. Tens of minutes if you do live in rural area. ETA of the .223 Rem is split second at the common range. 

The whole funny issue about the ""assault rifle"" term is that its just a propaganda made in its core. Originates back in´44 when the first gun of its class was called a Sturmgewehr by the orders of one wll known guy with a moustache. Because it sounded cool and was designed to have a psychological impact on the common infatryman. How could we be losing the war when we are handed over the STURM rifles, right? NATO just took it over, because well, it was right in its core and it sounds cool and badass. In fact its really just a term without any practical implications, as you can pretty much defend your home with said ""assault"" rifle and on the other hand assault someone with a kitchen knife. TL:DR using the term assault rifle as an argument is just playing the fiddle of the old unlce Adolph.

Also make up your mind, If the AR-15 is so mighty and efficient at killing human, it would be equally efficient at killing soft game like deer or rabbits.

Zero practical applications except for... having a fun shooting one at the range?

I understand the reasoning but I don't necessarily agree with it. It seems unlikely that we could see major social impact due to mass absence from work in the infrastructure sector - we haven't seen that so far, so we should also consider the risks and benefits to the public if employees are not protected. And ultimately, if that could happen in infrastructure, it could impact the food chain - and grocery store employees are critical workers in food supply.

We don't have clear data, but a bet that vaccines *don't* reduce transmission would be a very long shot.

This describes the minority of Long Covid cases. The majority had a mild illness during the acute phase that either never resolved, or resolved and subsequently got worse. Several viral infections have different phases, the second of which is worse (see Shingles or EBV), so it's unclear where your ""implausible"" claim is coming from.

&gt;Point being, you extrapolated a bunch of data from numbers that are highly variable, even things like the number of hospital admissions.

I felt like it was fairly obvious that I was doing a back-of-the-napkin estimate with available figures from a few well-known studies and sources. The 10% Long Covid figure is from the NHS. Clearly the hospitalization rate varies, but it's generally around 5%. 

&gt;When someone decided to argue with me about that, I asked for examples of biological mechanisms for such an event and they were unable to provide any.

The current model with (in my opinion as a molecular biologist) the best chance at being true is that covid simultaneously triggers NAD+ depletion and SIRT1 inhibition. This may or may not present with any symptoms initially, but in the long term, it causes the body to siphon tryptophan to replenish NAD+. However, several studies have shown that virions can remain in the body for months after initial infection, so this process may continue indefinitely. Depleted tryptophan then results in low levels of serum serotonin, which causes mast cell activation in a condition resembling MCAS. However, the body may remain in a symptom-free state until some trigger (often exercise) pushes everything past the tipping point. See [this article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7322475/) and [this article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220307323)

&gt;Truth is we don’t have any hard numbers, but the truth is that all the data we do have indicates long covid is very rare

I'm not going to waste my time on someone who dismisses evidence in order to uphold their preferred narrative. The Lancet study on nearly 1000 hospitalized covid patients (cited above) found that 76% of them have at least one symptom after 6 months. The Body Politic studies (with hundreds of participants) found a definite temporal pattern of symptoms in people with Long Covid, suggesting a common underlying specific pathology. Neither of these points to a rare condition. 

&gt;And anecdotally, I know 10 people who got covid. 3 ended up in the hospital. Not one had symptoms lasting more than 4 weeks, well, except the one that died. 

Oh cool, a tiny non-random sample comprised entirely of friends and acquaintances of a Long covid skeptic. These people would definitely share their experience of chronic illness with you if they had it, so I'm going to take your anecdote at face value.

&gt;I also found it quite telling how the article in the OP’s post lends significant credence to the idea that some symptoms are purely psychological (even describing how people with things like anxiety and depression were likely a result of a fragile mental state made worse by circumstances of infection) something else that people will get viscously downvoted on this sub for.

My anxiety and depression were getting better just as my long covid symptoms were getting worse, and I was even able to taper off antidepressants around the same time that I discovered the MCAS vitamin supplement stack, which essentially cured my and many others' Long covid symptoms. The psychosomatic explanation is among the weakest in the medical field and usually betrays an unwillingness to admit one's own ignorance and/or a lack of imagination for other more explanatory paradigms. 

&gt;And given the amount of upvotes i have on my original comment id say that no I’m not currently being downvoted

&gt; The role of COVID-19 vaccines may ultimately be more akin to that of the flu shot: reducing hospitalizations and deaths by mitigating the disease’s severity. The COVID-19 vaccines as a whole are excellent at preventing severe disease, and this level of protection so far seems to hold even against a new coronavirus variant found in South Africa that is causing reinfections. This, rather than herd immunity, is a more achievable goal for the vaccines.

I think for the lion's share of Americans, ""reducing hospitalizations and deaths,"" as we do with flu shots, will work just fine. If I get the COVID shot (and annual boosters, natch) I greatly reduce the chance that I get it, and hence that I can spread it to others. Also if I get it, I virtually eliminate the chance that it will kill me or cripple me.

and if some antivaxxer blockheads never get the vaccine, and later catch COVID, well, ""play stupid games, win stupid prizes"". And again, me and mine will be protected.

[Quote from WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-world-needs-a-real-investigation-into-the-origins-of-covid-19-11610728316)

“Sev­eral sci­en­tists also told us they were trou­bled by the pres­ence on the WHO team of Dr. Pe­ter Daszak of the New York-based Eco­Health Al­liance. Dr. Daszak has been a long­time col­lab­o­ra­tor of Dr. Shi since they worked to­gether to trace SARS viruses to bats af­ter the 2003 epi­demic. His or­ga­ni­za­tion has ad­min­is­tered more than $100 mil­lion in U.S. fed­eral grants to fund over­seas field­work and lab­o­ra­tory ex­per­i­ments, in­clud­ing those per­formed by WIV, to find and char­ac­ter­ize new viruses in or­der to pre­dict the next pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to the Eco­Health Al­liance.

Last Feb­ruary, Dr. Pe­ter Daszak or­ga­nized a state­ment in The Lancet, a prom­inent med­ical jour­nal, to ‘con­demn con­spir­acy the­o­ries sug­gest­ing that Covid-19 doesn’t have a nat­ural ori­gin.’

Last Feb­ruary, Dr. Daszak or­ga­nized a state­ment in The Lancet, a prom­inent med­ical jour­nal, to “con­demn con­spir­acy the­o­ries sug­gest­ing that Covid-19 doesn’t have a nat­ural ori­gin.” The state­ment was drafted when lit­tle was yet known about the virus. Dr. Daszak de­clined to com­ment for this piece, but a spokesman for Dr. Daszak told us: “The Lancet let­ter was writ­ten dur­ing a time in which Chi­nese sci­en­tists were re­ceiv­ing death threats and the let­ter was in­tended as a show­ing of sup­port for them as they were caught be­tween im­por­tant work try­ing to stop an out­break and the crush of on­line ha­rass­ment.” Yet, in June, Dr. Daszak wrote an opin­ion piece for the Guardian head­lined, “Ig­nore the con­spir­acy the­o­ries: sci­en­tists know Covid-19 wasn’t cre­ated in a lab.”

The spokesman for Dr. Daszak told us that any ques­tions about his po­ten­tial con­flict of in­ter­est should be re­ferred to WHO. Dr. Ben Em­barek said that he sees no prob­lem in hav­ing Dr. Daszak on his in­ves­tiga­tive team: “Of course the WHO team will have dis­cus­sion with the sci­en­tists and re­searchers in Wuhan. And there­fore it is good to have on the team some­one who knows the area well.”

Miles Pom­per, a co-au­thor of an ex­pert guide to in­ves­ti­gat­ing out­break ori­gins pub­lished in Oc­to­ber by the Mid­dle­bury In­sti­tute of In­ternational Stud­ies at Mon­terey, said that “The in­de­pen­dence of the WHO in­ves­ti­ga­tion may be se­ri­ously com­pro­mised by the process used to choose in­ves­ti­ga­tors…. In par­tic­u­lar, the choice of Dr. Daszak, who has a per­sonal stake in en­sur­ing cur­rent Chi­nese prac­tices con­tinue and who is a long­time col­lab­o­ra-tor of a sci­en­tist at the cen­ter of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion, is likely to taint its re­sults.”",,,1613311388,{},gnek31y,False,t3_lj3qwo,False,True,t1_gnchvzq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lj3qwo/white_house_cites_deep_concerns_about_who_covid19/gnek31y/,1613313607,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

* We were actually lucky that this technology was going into production, the more traditional tech of using weakened adenovirus vectors was months slower.

They had ""gravely damaged international cooperation on Covid-19,"" the statement said, adding that the U.S. was ""acting as if none of this had ever happened,"" while ""pointing fingers at other countries who have been faithfully supporting the WHO.""
""With such a track record, how can it win the confidence of the whole world,"" it added.
The statement was released less than 24 hours after White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S. had “deep concerns” about the way the findings of the WHO’s investigation into were communicated.

After they released their preliminary findings last week, Dominic Dwyer, an Australian infectious diseases expert on the WHO team, told Reuters on Saturday they had requested raw patient data on 174 cases that China had identified from the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan, as well as other cases, but were only provided with a summary.
His comments came after other media reports suggested that investigators had been denied data they requested during their trip.

However, another member of the team, Prof. John Watson told the BBC on Sunday that ""a great deal of data"" was provided to them by the Chinese and that criticism over what information was handed over did not ""characterise the mission as a whole.""
Peter Daszak, a British zoologist also tweeted: “As lead of animal/environment working group I found trust &amp; openness w/ my China counterpart,” adding that the team got access to critical new data throughout.

BBC is just as independent as CGTN meaning not at all. There are two **western** studies concluding that BBC is not independent at all especially when it comes to foreign countries.

However, isn't it strange that in my observation the PR department of China tends to be more reliable than many supposedly ""independent"" Western media concerning China. Why you say? Because I can find some places even in Western media that go against the ""mainstream"" narrative and often contradict themselves. one cannot have a clear and consistent view of China using only western media. CGTN is mostly consistent though. (again that's just MY observation, because I do read CGTN and I encourage you to do so as well in order to be informed from both sides)

About 50% of people show no neutralizing antibody activity and the remaining 50% show sharply reduced neutralizing activity. however, having said that, we also know that the t cells are working fine against all strains. this will likely both reduce the amount of time you are infectious as well as reduce your severity although you will still get illness and be able to spread it to others. one potential concern with relying on t-cell immunity is that it is strongly correlated with severity of infection...

&gt; When asked by Stephenson whether there was anything in the federal  government’s contract that prevented provinces from buying doses from  Pfizer and Moderna, LeBlanc said that there was nothing in their deal  that would “preclude a province from deciding on its own that they want  to pursue a parallel or different strategy.” 

This is Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs Dominic LeBlanc answering a question in Vulcan.  Vulcan's cannot lie, but when they want to avoid speaking the truth they state a fact which has nothing to do with answering the question.  Procurement Minister Anita Anand has also recently learned to speak Vulcan.

This is also exactly why the provincial premiers (and the rest of Canada) are gradually realizing they have been misled from the beginning.

For example . . . PHAC is the department that approves any particular sale, use or administration of any drug anywhere in Canada.  No, wait that's Vulcanese for PHAC just rubber-stamp whatever the FDA approves for use in the States. 

In the case of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, temporary emergency use is the only approval provided and that is why the provinces cannot negotiate directly with the manufacturer.  Two years from now when Pfizer's vaccine [is beyond just an Interim Order](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/pfizer-biontech/authorization.html) then and fully approved, then likely any province or doctor can order from Pfizer. 

Asking Minister Leblanc about federally approved drug use is about as useful as asking Manitoba's premiere why they'd want to undermine the federal distribution of vaccines in a Canada.

This language has been used to advocate for a better sick leave system in the US and the normalization of voluntary mask-wearing if you're sick. Which, cool, who wouldn't be for that? But this exact language has also been used to justify shutting down entire industries, enforce strict social distancing protocols for a year, and villainize people who want to hang out with friends. Words like ""careful"" and ""safe"" mean nothing to me anymore, these people need to say what they really think needs to happen and stop hiding in the vague undefined space in between ""maybe wash your hands more"" and ""don't leave your house for a few years""",,,1613337327,{},gngt8xp,False,t3_ljkcyh,False,False,t1_gngfb7a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ljkcyh/daily_discussion_thread_february_14_2021/gngt8xp/,1613346223,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

No there are reasons why it worked. 

China in Wuhan realized that just physical lockdown keeping people at home was not sufficient.

They created government controlled places where anyone who tested positive would be sent regardless of symptoms. The used hotels, dorms and created spaces that were monitored carefully so none left.  If you tested positive you had to go to one of these locations. If you didn’t test positive but had a symptom like a fever or cough, you were sent to one of these locations for isolation.

Of course seriously ill patients were hospitalized, but they realized that asymptomatic transmission was high. 

So anyone who was positive even with no symptoms was separated from anyone they could infect. They were kept until they had negative test results.

China even enforced this in some places by requiring pharmacists to report anyone who bought cough medicine or medicine for keeping fevers low like aspirin. Because all purchases are made through an app, people were easy to identify and trace.

So, basically China went a big step farther than most western countries by doing repeated mass testing and isolating anyone with a positive test or symptoms.",,,1613332325,{},gngjfnv,False,t3_ljvbed,False,False,t3_ljvbed,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ljvbed/wuhans_covid19_outbreak_probably_500_bigger_than/gngjfnv/,1613341486,37,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Despite Trump's fumbling mismanagement, the US was a world leader in pandemic preparedness, and your vaccination numbers are part of that legacy.

The risk I would see is being too US-centric.  Until the whole world is vaccinated, it's just a matter of time for the next &lt;insert_country_name&gt; Variant to emerge.  Currently, US vaccination rates are a combination of large domestic US vaccine manufacturing capacity combined with an Executive Order stopping vaccine exports until domestic US demand is met¹.

Once per capita total cases begin to drop low enough, probably time to also start allowing exports.  Ultimately, it would be best to assist with programs like Covax to help get vaccine to developing countries.

I'm actually pretty confident that you guys got this now, just a matter of following through to completion.

&gt; The SARS experience taught us a lot of extremely useful lessons, as it turned out. SARS-Cov-2 is rather closely related to the 2003 SARS coronavirus, and if you’re going to have a worldwide pandemic, you’re far better off with one that’s so much like something you’ve already poured R&amp;D investments into! In this case, the two big take-homes were that coronavirus vaccines could indeed suffer from ADE, and that this seemed to depend on which protein you chose to base your vaccine around. Specifically, it was the vaccines that targeted the N (nucleoprotein) antigen of the coronavirus that had ADE problems, while the ones that targeted the S (Spike) protein did not. That experience was thoroughly taken to heart in the vaccine developments of the last year: no one, to the best of my knowledge, even bothered to target the SARS-Cov-2 N protein at all, for just this reason. If you look at the antibodies generated in people who’ve been infected by the virus, they most certainly did make N-targeting ones, along with Spike-targeting ones and antibodies directed against the various ORF proteins. But for vaccine work, everyone has stuck with the Spike.

""Meeting a friend for a coffee on a park bench and outdoor picnics will be the first activities to get the green light on March 8, The Telegraph can reveal, with golf and tennis following shortly after.

Boris Johnson said on Saturday he ""very much hoped"" also to reopen schools at the same time, although ministers are discussing a proposal that will see primaries return first with secondaries a further week or two later.

On Saturday night a senior Government source confirmed that from March 8, people in England will be allowed to drink coffee on a park bench or have a picnic with anyone from their own household, or with another person on a one-to-one basis.

Households, however, will not be allowed to mix inside or outside with anyone else. The changes are the first official confirmation that the national lockdown in England will ease on March 8.

Ministers are privately also saying they expect pubs to be allowed to reopen – with outdoor dining as minimum – as soon as the first weekend in April, so households can have Easter lunch together.

As part of a “carrot and stick” approach, ministers are also working on an Australia-style approach that will see local areas locked down if there were a massive outbreak of the virus, or an outbreak of a new strain that could affect the efficacy of vaccines.

The Prime Minister will this week meet with his Cabinet and scientific advisers to begin drawing up his roadmap out of lockdown, and will address the nation on Feb 22.

The Telegraph understands the Government successfully hit its target of offering vaccines to Britain's 14.9 million most vulnerable adults by Saturday, a day ahead of the plans.

Mr Johnson will host a press conference at 10 Downing Street on Monday to mark the moment, but sources said he did not want any early celebration with the overwhelming majority of the country still waiting for their jabs.

One minister said: “The PM does not want any celebration, very much business as usual, I will not rest until the whole country is vaccinated.”

Mr Johnson was nevertheless bullish about releasing lockdown measures. On a visit to the North East of England, he said: ""Our children's education is the number one priority.

“Then working forwards to getting non-essential retail open as well, then in due course, when we can cautiously and prudently do so, of course we want to be opening hospitality as well.

""We don't want to be forced into any kind of retreat or reverse ferret. I'm optimistic, I won't hide it from you, but we have to be cautious.""

Clinically vulnerable people in England are being invited to book their Covid-19 jab as the vaccination programme moves into a new phase on Monday.

People aged 65 to 69 are also among more than one million people who have been invited to book their vaccine, NHS England said.

Almost 1.2 million letters were due to have landed on doorsteps by Saturday asking people to log on to the national booking service, with a further 1.2 million due to arrive this week.

Number 10 sources also confirmed recreational outside sports like golf and tennis will start to be allowed from next month, probably with just one other person. One senior source said that “outdoor sports … is quite likely to relax in March”.

Ministers are privately expecting pubs to be open for Easter Sunday lunch on April 4 although this was dismissed as speculation by 10 Downing Street.

Non-essential shops are also likely to be allowed to open sooner because they have historically not affected the virus’s reproductive rate.

One source said: “It is still being debated over the Feb 22 roadmap but the idea is to get hospitality up and running for Easter. That is the plan.”

Primary schools are planned to open on March 8 with secondary schools a week later, although there are said to be a number of options on the table.

One source said: “It will be a national reopening – none of this geographical tiering stuff.”

Any planned reopening will go alongside plans – described as “draconian” by ministers – to hit outbreaks very hard with a surge in testing, tracing and isolating anyone with the virus.

The new surge testing and local lockdowns will be based on surge testing to track the South African variant of coronavirus in Surrey last week.

Ministers want to mimic the tough lockdowns in Australia where thousands of people have been kept indoors after just a handful of cases. On Monday, the first of thousands of new arrivals into the UK will be forced ten days in airport hotels before they can be released.

Council staff and approved volunteers went door-to-door in the designated areas of Woking, Egham and Thorpe to deliver the kits to those aged 18 or over.

Downing Street will be hoping that the first official confirmation that the lockdown will finally lift from March 8 will quell growing unrest among Conservative MPs who want Mr Johnson to release the lockdown restrictions more quickly.

In a letter to Mr Johnson, seen by The Telegraph, 63 Conservative MPs who are members of the Coronavirus Recovery Group, said as a ""national priority” the “reopening all schools to all pupils must be achieved by March 8"".

They added that given the pace of the vaccine rollout “pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues can open for Easter,"" which falls on Sunday April 4.

The letter – signed by Mark Harper and Steve Baker MP, the chairman and vice chairman of the group – said: “We all have concerns about outside sport and swimming pools, gyms, personal care businesses, care home visits, hotels, events industry businesses, and allowing couples to get married.

“All restrictions remaining after March 8 should be proportionate to the ever-increasing number of people we have protected.

“The burden is on ministers to demonstrate the evidence of effectiveness and proportionality with a cost-benefit analysis for each restriction, and a roadmap for when they will be removed.”

They added: “The vaccine gives us immunity from Covid but it must also give us permanent immunity from Covid-related lockdowns and restrictions.

“This should be a moment of unity – for our country and our Party – as we look ahead with confidence, hope and optimism for a much brighter future, as we reclaim our lives once and for all.”

Separately writing for The Telegraph, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, Conservative MP for the Cotswolds and an officer of the 1922 Committee, said that rural parts of England should not be held back from relaxed restrictions by towns and cities.

He said: “Just as we lead the world in the vaccination programme we must lead the world in the recovery. We should revert back to the tier system; it is nonsense that the unlocking sequence in rural areas should be the same as inner cities.”

He added: “The Government needs to ensure that all schools fully reopen in England by March 8 at the latest, and as cases and hospital admissions fall, we need a route map for the whole economy.

“Everyone understands that lifting regulations too quickly could mean a surge in hospital cases, but equally dangerous is if we are too cautious, the effect on people’s livelihoods and mental health could be devastating.”",,,1613262579,{},gnbog5z,True,t3_ljd697,False,True,t3_ljd697,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ljd697/picnics_and_coffee_in_the_park_as_lockdown_to/gnbog5z/,1613277114,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

### Abstract

Background: COVID-19 is a major health problem because of acute respiratory distress syndrome, saturation of intensive care units (ICU) and mortality.  


Methods: Our study aims to elucidate the effect of calcifediol \[25(OH)D3\] treatment on ICU admission and mortality, in patients admitted to COVID-19 wards of Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain. A total of 930 participants were included. Participants (n=551) were randomly assigned to calcifediol treatment (532 ug on day one and 266 ug on day 3, 7, 15, and 30) at the time of hospital admission or as controls (n=379).  


Findings: ICU assistance was required by 110 (11.8%) participants. Out of 551 patients treated with calcifediol at admission, 30 (5.4%) required ICU, compared to 80 out of 379 controls (21.1%; p&lt;0.0001). Logistic regression of calcifediol treatment on ICU admission, adjusted by age, gender, linearized 25(OH)D levels at baseline, and comorbidities showed that treated patients had a reduced risk to require ICU (RR 0.18 \[95% CI 0.11;0.29\]). Baseline 25(OH)D levels inversely correlated with the risk of ICU admission (RR 0.53 \[95% CI 0.35;0.80\]). Overall mortality was 10%. In the Intention-to-treat analysis, 36 (6.5%) out of 551 patients treated with calcifediol at admission died compared to 57 patients (15%) out of 379 controls (p=0.001). Adjusted results showed a reduced mortality for more of 60%. Higher baseline 25(OH)D levels were significantly associated with decreased mortality (RR 0.40 \[95% CI 0.24;0.67\]). Age and obesity were also predictors of mortality.  


Interpretation: In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, calcifediol treatment at the time of hospitalization significantly reduced ICU admission and mortality.

The reality is we're not starting from zero The reality is we're starting from 80 to 100 million Americans roughly being mostly if not 100% immune. Some people will not have immunity from natural infection but most will I suspect. Study after study shows this with the Marine corps study the most recent one that I saw that people who had antibodies were 80% less likely to be infected compared with those who did not. and these were folks who had some of the mildest cases in fact something like 60% of them were asymptomatic and something like 85% were asymptomatic if they were reinfected.

The reality is that if case numbers go down dramatically even if not everyone is immune we're not going to just stay shut until 80% of people have been vaccinated. It's just not going to happen. Once 50% of people have immunity , we will start seeing dramatic differences and how fast the virus spreads. Relatively minor mitigations will have a large effect compared to when you have zero people who have had immunity.  we will probably approach 65% immunity between vaccination and natural infection by late June. Out of the 65% I would estimate probably 20% from the virus 45% from some combination of the virus and vaccination or vaccination only. we will probably hit 50% immunity between natural infection and vaccine in mid to late April, so if infections are continuing to go down at that point, it's pretty clear what the trajectory is going to be and that's when things will start to open.",,,1613275597,{},gncj8ix,False,t3_ljg30t,False,False,t1_gncild1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ljg30t/usa_7day_average_of_cases_drops_below_100000/gncj8ix/,1613289718,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The ""95% effective"" statistic is specifically about preventing the most severe **symptoms**. Unfortunately, this article doesn't actually say how much transmission is reduced, which still leaves an important question unanswered.

All of the available data I have seen so far shows that these vaccines are significantly less effective at preventing mild to moderate symptoms or asymptomatic cases. 

For example: the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is apparently somewhere around 80% effective at preventing severe symptoms, but only reduces transmission by up to 2/3. That's way better than not being vaccinated at all, but that's also low enough to mean that ""herd immunity"" would be literally impossible to achieve with that vaccine. Even if every single person were vaccinated, the disease would still slowly spread. Definitely better than nothing, but it also means COVID would continue circulating forever.

This isn't unique to COVID, this is normal. There are multiple levels of ""immunity"" - sometimes your body can kill off the virus entirely, but other times you are an asymptomatic carrier.

It isn't alien or magic. It is a poorly understood highly contagious disease that can hijack the ACE-2 and NRP1 receptors, allowing it to damage basically every major organ system both directly and indirectly. Given the strange ways *known* viruses behave, we should treat this brand new disease with caution.

We know it can directly infect the peripheral and central nervous systems. One thing we don't know is whether it is neurodegenerative. If it is, we're already looking at a severely messed up future.

Being vaccinated isn't some ""magical robe of protection"" like in a game of Dungeons and Dragons. 

Vaccination is 1 tool (among a handful of tools).. that we must all collectively still use to keep trying to **reduce the spread**. 

Even if you're vaccinated,. you can still catch, carry and spread Coronavirus. Vaccination doesn't prevent that. All vaccination does is prime your immune system to:

* Make your own (internal) sickness shorter and less severe

That's it. nothing more. 

If you think you can get vaccinated, and it's like ""throwing a light-switch"" or ""opening a door"" and you can go right back to doing all the unsafe or unprotected things you did PRE-pandemic ?

No. That's not what vaccination does. 

Vaccination is a ""communal"" thing (we have to all do it together,.. just like Masks or Distancing or other forms of hygiene). All of those things TOGETHER.. is how we beat the virus. 

The goal we're trying to achieve is to keep reducing the R0 number to be (as far)  below 1.0 as possible.

However, on Monday the country’s statistics institute published data, revealing that the excess mortality in 2020 stood at 358,000, compared to the average deaths from the last couple of years.

&gt; Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova announced that 31 percent of the excess mortality rate in 2020 was due to covid-19, in other words 111,000 deaths. But the official death toll sent daily to the WHO is still below 80,000 dead.

&gt; Independent Russian newspaper Meduza now states that the Ministry of Health for the Moscow region has estimated that 98-100 percent of the excess mortality is due to the corona pandemic.


&gt;This number makes Russia the country with most coronavirus deaths during the pandemic. Details that official Russian statistics under-report coronavirus-linked deaths are very sensitive to Russia and President Vladmir Putin.

&gt;Assuming that almost all of the excess mortality is due to the pandemic, “the number of covid-19 deaths is 6.3 times higher in 2020 than the 57,000 the country officially reported last year,” according to researcher Dmitrij Kobak at the University of Tübingen.

&gt;If the excess mortality has remained at the same level in January and February this year, more than 480,000 Russians have died of Covid-19, not 79,000 as officially presented, Kobak stated.

&gt;When taking excess mortality figures into account as basis for counting covid-19 related deaths, the United States deaths would reach about 550,000, or 1.2% higher than the country’s official figure. However, per capita, Russia would be the country with the most deaths with 0.33% of the population having died of coronavirus compared to 0.17% in the US.",,,1613308932,{},gned2ey,False,t3_ljm2jx,False,True,t3_ljm2jx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ljm2jx/putins_lies_revealed_russia_has_most_coronavirus/gned2ey/,1613311337,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

The non-math version of the reasoning is:  


1) The transmission environment appears to have turned hostile to the virus even before vaccinations could make their presence felt.  


2) The heterogenous nature of the risk of the disease allows early vaccines to have an outsized effect on casualty rates, such that we can vaccinate our high-risk first and get a much larger casualty drop than the percentage of the population we have vaccinated would imply.  


3) Our vaccination program is now reaching a size to where it \*should\* have a noticeable cumulative downward effect on overall transmission as well, especially if/when it ramps up soon with the addition of new vaccines.  


4) The variants just came way too late relative to the vaccination campaign with the exception of B117, but even B117 looks like it is poised to be outraced by the vaccines.

3. Since the Rt is not a constant, it can increase due to our activities. Even if B117 were not present, our collective behaviours alone could create another spike. With pandemic fatigue and the easing of restriction, the Rt will not likely stay at 0.83 for months.

Of course.

The whole mechanism of vaccine is to induce immune reaction to an antigen from the virus or very similar to antigen from the virus. No wonder vaccinated people have immunity ""trained"" to deal with the virus, thus, surprise, surprise, leading to lesser count of viral particles in the body.

That's how vaccine works. 

Now, said that, our body is quite compartmentalized in terms of immune response: having immune response in the lungs does not mean you have the same immune response in your nose.

“Sev­eral sci­en­tists also told us they were trou­bled by the pres­ence on the WHO team of Dr. Pe­ter Daszak of the New York-based Eco­Health Al­liance. Dr. Daszak has been a long­time col­lab­o­ra­tor of Dr. Shi since they worked to­gether to trace SARS viruses to bats af­ter the 2003 epi­demic. His or­ga­ni­za­tion has ad­min­is­tered more than $100 mil­lion in U.S. fed­eral grants to fund over­seas field­work and lab­o­ra­tory ex­per­i­ments, in­clud­ing those per­formed by WIV, to find and char­ac­ter­ize new viruses in or­der to pre­dict the next pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to the Eco­Health Al­liance.

Last Feb­ruary, Dr. Pe­ter Daszak or­ga­nized a state­ment in The Lancet, a prom­inent med­ical jour­nal, to ‘con­demn con­spir­acy the­o­ries sug­gest­ing that Covid-19 doesn’t have a nat­ural ori­gin.’

Last Feb­ruary, Dr. Daszak or­ga­nized a state­ment in The Lancet, a prom­inent med­ical jour­nal, to “con­demn con­spir­acy the­o­ries sug­gest­ing that Covid-19 doesn’t have a nat­ural ori­gin.” The state­ment was drafted when lit­tle was yet known about the virus. Dr. Daszak de­clined to com­ment for this piece, but a spokesman for Dr. Daszak told us: “The Lancet let­ter was writ­ten dur­ing a time in which Chi­nese sci­en­tists were re­ceiv­ing death threats and the let­ter was in­tended as a show­ing of sup­port for them as they were caught be­tween im­por­tant work try­ing to stop an out­break and the crush of on­line ha­rass­ment.” Yet, in June, Dr. Daszak wrote an opin­ion piece for the Guardian head­lined, “Ig­nore the con­spir­acy the­o­ries: sci­en­tists know Covid-19 wasn’t cre­ated in a lab.”

The spokesman for Dr. Daszak told us that any ques­tions about his po­ten­tial con­flict of in­ter­est should be re­ferred to WHO. Dr. Ben Em­barek said that he sees no prob­lem in hav­ing Dr. Daszak on his in­ves­tiga­tive team: “Of course the WHO team will have dis­cus­sion with the sci­en­tists and re­searchers in Wuhan. And there­fore it is good to have on the team some­one who knows the area well.”

Miles Pom­per, a co-au­thor of an ex­pert guide to in­ves­ti­gat­ing out­break ori­gins pub­lished in Oc­to­ber by the Mid­dle­bury In­sti­tute of In­ternational Stud­ies at Mon­terey, said that “The in­de­pen­dence of the WHO in­ves­ti­ga­tion may be se­ri­ously com­pro­mised by the process used to choose in­ves­ti­ga­tors…. In par­tic­u­lar, the choice of Dr. Daszak, who has a per­sonal stake in en­sur­ing cur­rent Chi­nese prac­tices con­tinue and who is a long­time col­lab­o­ra-tor of a sci­en­tist at the cen­ter of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion, is likely to taint its re­sults.”",,,1613312064,{},gnemt3r,False,t3_lj8fzv,False,True,t1_gncuebo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lj8fzv/china_refused_to_give_raw_covid_data_to_who_team/gnemt3r/,1613314653,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;While correlation does not equal causation (greater gender and ethnic diversity in corporate leadership doesn’t automatically translate into more profit), the correlation does indicate that when companies commit themselves to diverse leadership, they are more successful. 

The statement immediately following this seems to show some level of cherry picking of data, but I have no conclusive evidence on that other than assertions and subtext.

 The question I have to your data is whether or not these companies would have succeeded even if they were completely homogeneous in one ethnicity/race, like the entire company has just Cherokees, or just the Eastern Slavs, would it be nearly as successful? Or is the education these people have the driving factor, with people of all backgrounds having access to more education than they had even 20 years back?

Going to rearrange things tomorrow, if you've not read this lately, give it another once-over.  I've added a lot of stuff and I want to make sure I've gotten it right.  I get surprisingly few suggestions for additions or changes.

Get the first vaccine you can get.  [They work.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l9y3ca/daily_discussion_thread_february_01_2021/glle744/) 

[They work really well](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01180-x.epdf?sharing_token=s-oAwLzAGRWC-V-YarbCldRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0O8_r2mfHu1uG1GvhZbL2rc5gDFwnNoP9nEnk_AaCjG1-2v1V0A52Owl-Az7s8bM8LTjz-kZQAHBFWPD3Mv0p8yznVZOVqNdTZyh0s3Mm0KjFfEbr6dEjwQHIw68-D5jwA%3D), and are [safe](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kcdn0b/natural_immunity_from_covid_is_not_safer_than_a/). 

Vaccines given EUA are safe even if you hear [about someone dying or growing an extra arm.](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/04/get-ready-for-false-side-effects)

Should we be excited about a vaccine that's not 90%+ effective like Moderna? Excellent question! [Absolutely, yes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l7mzvn/daily_discussion_thread_january_29_2021/gl8iyj5?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) 

They [work so well](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l7apag/just_004_of_israelis_caught_covid19_after_two/) and are so super safe that super smart super rich [people are paying to cut in line](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kzbsfk/some_wealthy_americans_accused_of_getting/) to get them. If it wasn't safe and [effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/li9jg8/it_works_0_deaths_only_4_severe_cases_among/), they wouldn't be paying thousands for shots.

There’s no such thing as [vaccine side effects that take months or years to show up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k96ng0/how_is_it_possible_to_create_a_safe_and_effective/gfldup9/) If there is a side effect, [it shows up right away.](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2017/0615/p786.html)  Thousands of phase 2 trial participants have had the vaccine for over 6 months, and there are no worrying, lingering, or [delayed side effects.](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/covid-19-vaccine-myths-debunked)

Do the vaccines work against variants? [Yes, probably better than you were expecting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l685dy/vaccination_against_the_new_variants_realworld/)

The currently approved vaccines (Pfizer/Moderna) work against [all the new variants.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kqz7y5/comprehensive_mapping_of_mutations_to_the/)  Even that [new one](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l15czh/neutralization_of_sarscov2_lineage_b117/) you just read about.

ChAdOx1 (Oxford/Astrazeneca) may not be so great against the SA variant.  Pfizer [seems fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lf7uph/neutralization_of_viruses_with_european_south/) against the troubling variants, at least in the lab.

Still worried about variants? Check [this out!](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/27/vaccination-against-the-new-variants-real-world-data) *

Vaccine induced immunity is [comparable to](https://www.verywellhealth.com/antibodies-from-vaccines-and-from-natural-infection-5092564), or [better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l5whhu/increased_resistance_of_sarscov2_variants_b1351/) immunity from a previous infection. Especially [variants of concern.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgxpre/vaccineinduced_immunity_provides_more_robust/)

Post infection immunity lasts [*at least 8 months*](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/koxkm1/sarscov2_infection_induces_longlived_bone_marrow/), though [probably a lot longer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/klpvp7/sarscov2specific_t_cell_memory_is_longlasting_in/)  Again, [*at least* 8 months, though you may not even really need very many antibodies,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ldj06f/immunological_memory_to_sarscov2_assessed_for_up/) since other types of immunity seem to be more important.  It's too soon to say ""lifelong"" but [that is a possibility.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4nkco/the_immune_system_mounts_a_lasting_defense_after/) Also, it looks like those who have recovered *may* only need [one dose of an mRNA vaccine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/labst4/robust_spike_antibody_responses_and_increased/). There are some people (~7%) who don't develop lasting immunity from infections. 

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l9nfu8/stable_neutralizing_antibody_levels_six_months/) probably a lot,[ lot longer,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/)  probably many years. 

The OG SARS virus from 2003 gave detectable immunity [both 6](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/12/7264) and [12 years later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kvbz9y/weekly_question_thread/gizs32j/)   

Covid19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, OG SARS was caused by SARS-CoV. Looks like both came from bats.  [They’re 79% the same.](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930251-8) (PDF)

Antibodies from recovered people who then got an mRNA vaccine [work on variants *and* OG SARS?!](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfiypu/antibodies_elicited_by_sarscov2_infection_and/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) 

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) * article does a good job of explaining the likelihood of vaccines *at least* reducing spread.  [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lf744r/daily_discussion_thread_february_08_2021/gml0gyi/) may help if that article is too much.

Most variants aren't great at being viruses.  [Some have already gone extinct](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/19/danish-covid-mink-variant-very-likely-extinct-but-controversial-cull-continues).

Reinfections are rare, some studies show [less than 1 in 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kyj0bx/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/) (maybe in the 1 in 10,000 range).  Reinfections tend to be much milder than previous infections, even those new variants. 

Milder cases, especially asymptomatic cases [are worse at spreading](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kcy2e0/weekly_question_thread_week_of_december_14/gg8tp7n/).  

Multiple [studies using monkeys](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03041-6) show strong immunity, or [sterilizing immunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/la4fud/immunogenic_bnt162b_vaccines_protect_rhesus/) from multiple vaccine types.  It's unlikely that sterilizing immunity would be found in 100% of vaccinated humans, if we even get sterilizing immunity at all. This is still good news.

3. 580+ Credit Score
4. Rent paid in full and on time for the last 12 months
5. No evictions in the last 3 years

It's actually generous you have to ONLY qualify for 4 out of the 5, to be honest.  But you need a minimum income of at least 5k (60k+ per year job) or hope maybe between you and another adult you have that. But now what I'm seeing is places demand BOTH people qualify individually on their own for the unit (in case break up, one roommate leaves, etc.) and that's making it infinitely harder for even couples to qualify, though they have an easier time than myself as a single woman.

&gt; The motive for getting the vaccine to poorer countries more quickly is not just altruism: evolution will punish any delays.

The author is writing as if wealthy countries are just sitting on piles of unused vaccine doses while slowly figuring out how (or if) they will share the wealth. The reality is that these countries don't even have enough for their own populations at the moment, much less the entire world. 

Until the supply greatly exceeds local demand, there's really not much difference in administering vaccines locally vs sending them to poor countries. If anything, delaying will likely be cheaper, easier, and more effective as the nature of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are harder to transport and administer. A single dose vaccine without the need for ultra cold or cold storage will be much easier to distribute to some remote village in the Andes. 

Also, the notion that these poor countries are extremely relevant to the economies of rich nations seems HIGHLY debatable, at best. Many US companies are doing extremely well, the stock market has reached record highs, supply chains are delayed but still moving (the latest iPhone wasn't pushed back a year) and putting a lot of product in consumers' hands.

The idea that it was widespread in September and October in Italy is  based on laughably bad science.  They used their own homegrown antibody tests, with no validation against controls and found 11% of Italians had COVID antibodies in September-October, while the seroprevalence in Italy last spring was found to be 2.55:

If you had a fucking gun and you had a roughly 2 in 6 chance of blowing out your brains, of which you have a 1 out of 10 chance of living you'd never put it up to your temple for fun. With COVID in most G7 countries a substantial portion of youth have 1+ preexisting condition and even more are not nearly as active as they could be. 

With **STAR ATHLETES** we are talking ""Will never play pro again"" levels of bad but not death, and those are the most fit young people you can find, in the general populace you are far more likely to be overweight or obese, have asthma etc and all of those can make COVID far worse. If we are talking likely chances if you took flat out *no precautions* and got COVID as a 20 something there is a 1 in 4 chance of death or intense hospitalization and 2 in 4 of hospitalization. What you're talking about is a mostly bullshit talking point based on what we *already knew* to be only generally true if you squint and stop thinking immediately after the words exit your body. 

We have deaths as young as 16 in my state and 30 year olds are dropping like flies. In another comment someone already pointed out that half of those who are hospitalized are elderly and the other half is split up into  younger people, as in the 50 to 20 crowd.  If you had as high of a chance to be hospitalized or killed from the flu you'd likely be taking these precautions year round because of the simple fact that the chances of getting seriously fucked up from one disease could put you into poverty. 

The idea that COVID is only a mild irritance to the youth isn't just misinformation, it's damn close to a bold faced lie that only benefits the people who exploit the working class. Even if you are a part of the under 30 crowd who gets only mild COVID symptoms which is already reaching that prior 2 in 6 bullets analogy, there can and will be lung scarring you'll have to heal out of ontop of still spreading the virus which can then infect far more vulnerable members of society. You have just as likely of a chance to have long, outstanding damage that can ruin weeks to months of your life. 

If anything the claim that it ""Barely"" affects the youth is about as dangerous as saying ""Children can't spread it"" which, in both cases, helped spread the virus as much as possible which helped to deal as much damage as possible. You could run your car into another car at 70 MPH and walk out with scratches, or you could do the same thing 4 different times and end up a paraplegic, dead, going through the windshield and more and you have no idea prior to the crash if you're going to be lucky or not.

No, that's not right. By that logic, without a vaccine, 100 out of 100 people would get it. The flu vaccine is only about 50% effective (it varies from year to year). Does that mean that 50% of the people that get the flu vaccine end up getting the flu? Or that 100% who don't get the vaccine get the flu?

No, the way this works is, for a given group of people, you would expect a certain percent to get the illness, and then the vaccine reduces THAT number.

For example, if you have 100k people, maybe you would normally expect 100 of them to get sick per week without the vaccine(number made up...I don't know what the real number would be). With the vaccine, you would then see 5 out of 100k get sick.

France is seeing a baby bust nine months after its first covid lockdown

SAINT-DENIS, France — When France confined more than 64 million people under one of the world's strictest coronavirus lockdowns last spring, there was widespread speculation that a baby boom would follow.

“I thought to myself: They’re all stuck at home, and they need to occupy themselves. So, they’ll make babies,” recalled Martine Mabiala Moussirou, a midwife coordinator at the main public hospital in Saint-Denis, a city on the outskirts of Paris that has one of France’s highest birthrates.

Nine months on, though, instead of a boom, France is witnessing a sharp decline in births. Economic uncertainty, social stress and in some cases anxieties about the virus itself appear to have prompted families to abandon or postpone plans to have a baby.

The number of babies born at the Saint-Denis hospital plummeted by about 20 percent between mid-December and mid-January and is expected to remain below 2020 levels for at least the first half of the year. While the coronavirus wards were hives of activity last week, lights in the maternity ward were dimmed and the corridors empty.

“Usually, it’s bustling here,” said Mabiala Moussirou, who was chatting with other midwives next to a board showing the occupancy status of the ward’s nine delivery rooms.

Only one was in use.

Other maternity wards in France are reporting similar trends, as are cities in Italy. A drop in births is predicted for the United States, as well.

The unusually quiet hospital wards are an early sign of how the pandemic may indirectly shape demographics. They are also one of many indications of the toll on women.

Some developing countries are registering the beginnings of a baby boom, triggered in part by reduced funding for and access to contraceptives and family planning services during the pandemic.

But in France and other developed countries, a pandemic birth slump is emerging, with implications for decades to come.

A dramatic drop in births

The full effect of the coronavirus pandemic on France’s birthrate won’t be known for months. But experts are increasingly confident that the sudden drops in some hospitals are too steep, widespread and abrupt to be coincidental.

“We’re seeing the decline everywhere across the northeast of France,” said Olivier Morel, the academic director of the obstetrics and gynecology department at the university hospital in Nancy.

At the five big university hospitals in the region, births declined 10 to 25 percent in January compared with the same month last year, according to figures provided by Morel.

Those drops are far steeper than the normal year-on-year variations, which are usually in the low single digits.

“Throughout my career, I have never seen a 10 to 25 percent decline,” Morel said.

Further south in Lyon, France’s second-biggest metropolitan area, two hospitals said they recorded a combined 19 percent decline in births in January — a drop they attributed to the pandemic.

Italy experienced Europe’s first major outbreak and was the first Western country to declare a national lockdown in March. Births declined by more than 21 percent across 15 major Italian cities in December, according to a report published by the country’s statistics institute last week.

By contrast, hospitals in the German capital of Berlin have so far not noticed a significant downward trend, but the city was hit less severely than hot spots in France and Italy and did not impose the same level of lockdown.

Why families postponed

or abandoned plans

Demographers aren’t as surprised by the drop in births as the health workers in France might be.

“Fertility has historically been sensitive to cyclical events such as wars, economic crises, epidemics and even to climatic conditions,” said Arnaud Régnier-Loilier, a research director at France’s National Institute for Demographic Studies. “These events all result in a decrease and not an increase in births.”

The Greek financial crisis, for example, contributed to a baby bust.

Where are all the children? How Greece’s financial crisis led to a baby bust.

Sometimes, the impact transcends borders. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, researchers noticed an unusually low birthrate in Italy nine months later.

Researchers suspect that multiple factors associated with the coronavirus pandemic may be depressing fertility rates.

Economic uncertainty is a big one. People thinking last spring about whether to have a baby may have found themselves out of work or seen that major economies were experiencing record contractions. In France, the economy shrank by 5.8 percent in the first quarter of 2020, the largest decline since record-keeping began in 1949, according to the national statistics office.

Although France and other European governments were quick to offer subsidies for furloughed workers, it was with the understanding that those supports would be temporary and some industries might not recover anytime soon. That left many people feeling less than secure.

The constraints of lockdowns also may have worked against decisions to add a baby. Some families felt the pressure of having older children at home while schools were closed. Some couples may have found that constant proximity strained their relationship. Some might have calculated that the need to shield older relatives would reduce the support they would get as new parents.

Researchers are also exploring how the severity of coronavirus outbreaks may have influenced family planning decisions. Some areas of France now reporting a drop in births were also among the hardest-hit areas during the first wave of infection, suggesting a possible correlation.

Under stress in Saint-Denis

Saint-Denis is a place where multiple stresses collided.

It is one of France’s poorest cities, located in a region with one of the highest excess mortality rates due to covid.

Many of its 110,000 residents had barely managed to stay afloat before the pandemic. When the virus hit, the city’s informal economy collapsed, leaving undocumented immigrants without income or any way to qualify for unemployment benefits. The closure of schools meant that children could no longer get the heavily subsidized meals many families had relied on.

In the cramped apartments of Saint-Denis’s housing projects, enduring the spring lockdown — when people were allowed to go out only once a day, for essential reasons — was especially hard.

Those conditions helped propel riots in the Parisian suburbs in late April — and may have depressed fertility rates as well.

Violent protests in Paris suburbs reflect tensions under lockdown

The lockdown led to a surge in domestic violence, said Ghada Hatem-Gantzer, a obstetrician who heads a hospital-linked center for women in Saint-Denis.

“More than usual, women came asking for an abortion because, as they said, ‘I cannot have kids with someone who became so violent during the lockdown,’ ” Hatem-Gantzer said.

But while the portion of women citing that reason increased last year, the overall number of abortions did not, she said.

MaMaMa, a local charity set up to support mothers and babies through the pandemic, hasn’t yet seen the impact of declining births. In a 15,000-square-foot warehouse, volunteers still welcome a constant stream of mothers coming for free essentials, such as bottles, food and clothes. But the financial strains that bring women to MaMaMa may also prevent future births.

Nogochami, 27, was waiting her turn at MaMaMa, wheeling her sleeping 8-month-old in a stroller. The baby was born during France’s first lockdown, at a time when the family’s income had dropped to a few dollars a day.

“We’ll wait a very long time until the next child,” said Nogochami, who gave only her first name because she is an undocumented immigrant from Ivory Coast. “Everything is very difficult. I just can’t have another one now.”

Possibly prolonged impact

Mabiala Moussirou, the midwife coordinator, said she was still hoping for a speedy rebound in births, even a boom, once women regain confidence about the future. But some colleagues are less optimistic.

While the economy in France and some other European countries had slowed less than expected by the end of last year, economists still warn of a double-dip recession. Meanwhile, a resurgence of the virus and fears of more contagious variants have brought on second and third lockdowns in Europe.

Initial findings from a long-term study conducted by Morel and other doctors in the northeast indicate that pregnant women’s economic concerns have only grown.

“I really believe we will face a significant drop in the number of births for several years,” Morel said.

And for a continent that had already been dealing with rapidly aging populations and declining fertility rates, he said, that should spark “serious concern.”",,,1613320853,{},gnflmb1,False,t3_ljnifm,False,False,t1_gneig6o,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ljnifm/france_is_seeing_a_baby_bust_nine_months_after/gnflmb1/,1613326271,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Has anyone considered that people who believe the situation is getting better would be less likely to get tested? ""Oh, it must just be a cold. Covid cases are declining, after all."" In most cases, they would experience Covid as if it were just a cold, since there are proportionally few severe cases. At the same time, fewer severe cases may develop because vulnerable populations are the ones being vaccinated first. It doesn't logically follow that Covid isn't spreading--I think we're not detecting it.

I'm not suggesting some nefarious plot or anything. I'm just suggesting that wishful thinking is getting in the way of healthy skepticism.

Cellular tests exist, but we aren't using them enough to start bringing the cost down or to encourage that breakthrough to make them really scalable.

This inequity is a threat since it will result in poorer countries having to wait longer for the vaccine, during which time the disease will continue to spread and kill people, said Ian MacKay, who studies viruses at the University of Queensland.

This argument seems like some sort of moral dog-whistle to me. They lay out two scenarios:

1) vaccine shared equally among all countries
2) vaccines go to those able to bankroll the vaccine trials and manufacturing

In scenario 1, all countries wouldn’t reach herd immunity for years and so the virus would mutate among the population globally. In scenario 2, the virus would mutate in the poorer countries. The virus will mutate in the coming years regardless.

The argument that I might buy is if we were able to vaccinate 65+ globally before all other groups. That would lessen the death tolls overall and be more equitable. But this is entirely ignoring that the best vaccines are highly dependent on advanced refrigeration infrastructure not found outside rich nations. The question here is not solely of equity, but of feasibility.

In Israel, within 2 weeks of schools reopening in mid-May 2020, a large high school outbreak occurred when 2 students with epidemiologically unrelated infections attended classes while mildly symptomatic.8 Testing of more than 99% of at-risk students (n = 1164 eligible; 1161 tested) and staff (152 eligible; 151 tested) identified 153 and 25 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, respectively (attack rates of 13.2% and 16.6%). Contributing factors to this outbreak included crowded classrooms with insufficient physical distancing (eg, student density in classrooms exceeded recommended values), exemption from face mask use, and continuous air conditioning that recycled interior air in closed rooms during a heat wave.""
