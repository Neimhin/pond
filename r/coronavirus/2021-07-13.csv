Anyway, all that brings me to, so many are fine with all that, including other parents we run into of similar aged kids, because the strong belief they all share is that kids aren’t impacted. While kids are certainly far less likely, there have been some rough outcomes. And we have done so much for the past year and a half to keep them safe from it, so throwing that at the finish line is not something we can come around to.

So I worry that while our kids will be vaccinated as soon as it’s possible, the percentage vaccinated will actually drop as even vaccinated parents don’t see the urgency in getting their young kids vaccinated.

You would need to pass extreme physical and mental fitness tests to join military branches, you would be expected to follow strict hygiene standards working with food processing and preparation... even minimum wage line chefs can't have fake nails or wear make up in most kitchens.

So surely we would expect people whose job it is to provide primary care for the most vulnerable and high risk part of the population to ensure they are doing so as effectively as possible?

I see the argument that carers are being 'forced' into having vaccinations... in my mind... there is no such thing. If you don't want to receive a vaccination you are free to find a place of work that will not require one.

To clarify my stance on 'body autonomy'... I worked in hospitality for over 10 years and have numerous tattoos and piercings. It was deemed by a company I had advanced to when climbing the management ladder that my look was unprofessional, so as part of my contract I agreed to always wear long sleeve shirts and remove my piercings before every shift.

That's fair. However, while children aren't at high risk, their exposure to covid can lead to further mutations. We are also seeing more and more cases in the US of the delta variant among unvaccinated communities. 

Would things being back to normal be great? Yes. But because of where we are at with vaccine hesitancy, it's going to take longer to get there.

&gt;Covid may not go away ever

This is true, however the more people that are vaccinated, the less likely it is to be a major problem.

Again, I agree with you that all schools should have things like filters and purifiers, but I've already addressed why all schools likely won't be able to. And because of that, masking is the least expensive way to try and help stop transmission. 

Kids might be impacted with learning to read facial cues, however things like that can be mitigated by masks that have the plastic window. People can see facial expressions, or read lips etc. Also, the act of being able to interact with each other (even with masks) is still beneficial for growth and development.

&gt;Once a COVID vaccine or vaccines are made available, could states mandate that people get them?

&gt;The short answer is yes. States have the legal and constitutional authority to require that the people who live in that state be vaccinated, or to introduce a vaccine mandate.

&gt;The authority for the state being able to compel vaccination—the affirmation of that authority—goes all the way back to a U.S. Supreme Court case in 1905 called Jacobson v. Massachusetts. That case arose in the midst of an outbreak of smallpox in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1902.

Ba Huan Joint Stock Company, a major chicken and egg producer, has dedicated areas for employees to work, sleep and eat on its premises amid HCMC’s ongoing 15-day social distancing.

Its deputy general director Pham Thanh Hung told VnExpress: ""We have divided Ba Huan into three areas: for workers at farms, workers at food processing facilities and office workers. In the office area, only three people, instead of the 10 previously, are permitted to work in one room.""

All employees are tested for coronavirus twice a week, he added.

Truong Chi Thien, general director of Vinh Thanh Dat Food Corporation, said: ""We will isolate two areas in our factory and staff in one cannot go to the other, and accommodate our workers at our warehouse and campus.""

The company has hired cooks to make food for the workers.

C.P. Vietnam Corporation, a leading husbandry and animal feed producer, has instructed its workers to stay on its pig farms, its deputy general director, Le Xuan Huy, said. ""Our farms are situated far from residential areas.""

Saigon Food Joint Stock Company is converting its dressing rooms, dining rooms and warehouses into temporary accommodation for workers.

""We will hire more mobile water closets to serve workers who stay at our factory,"" it said.

The city Department of Industry and Trade encourages companies that comply with Covid-prevention conditions to let their employees work, sleep and eat at the workplace.

&gt;Abstract

&gt;Background: The period from February to June 2021 was one during which initial wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strains were supplanted in Ontario, Canada, first by variants of concern (VOC) with the N501Y mutation (Alpha/B1.1.17, Beta/B.1.351 and Gamma/P.1 variants), and then by the Delta/B.1.617 variant. The increased transmissibility of these VOCs has been documented but data for increased virulence is limited. We used Ontario COVID-19 case data to evaluate the virulence of these VOCs compared to non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 infections, as measured by risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death. Methods: We created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontarios testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between February 7 and June 22, 2021 (n=211,197). We constructed mixed effects logistic regression models with hospitalization, ICU admission, and death as outcome variables. Models were adjusted for age, sex, time, comorbidities, and pregnancy status. Health units were included as random intercepts. Results: Compared to non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, the adjusted elevation in risk associated with N501Y-positive variants was 59% (49-69%) for hospitalization; 105% (82-134%) for ICU admission; and 61% (40-87%) for death. Increases with Delta variant were more pronounced: 120% (93-153%) for hospitalization; 287% (198-399%) for ICU admission; and 137% (50-230%) for death. Interpretation: The progressive increase in transmissibility and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs will result in a significantly larger, and more deadly, pandemic than would have occurred in the absence of VOC emergence.",,,,1626254847,{},h54x535,False,t3_ojq5lw,False,False,t1_h549rn0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ojq5lw/delta_variant_accounts_for_71_of_recent_samples/h54x535/,1626415891,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_l796l,False,False,,

If all of those were false (they weren’t), that would still only be a maximum false positive rate of 0.025 per cent.

&gt;

&gt;“And of course, none were false positives because they were either checked and confirmed as part of known chains of transmission or as travellers from overseas countries in which transmission is widespread … The real rate is likely well below this figure of 1 in 180,887.”

There was another wave from late March to early May, and it was milder than the previous ones. After that, the number of cases was very low and decreased until mid June. I imagine that this, together with the fact that at least 50% of the population had already received vaccination (at least 1 dose) until that point,  was one of the reasons the government thought it was okay to lift restrictions.

As for the economic reasons, tourism is a REALLY important part of Spain's economy. The sector has suffered a lot since the start of the pandemic, and I imagine there was a lot of pressure to start giving it an oportunity to recover.  By that I don't mean to justifiy it as a good reason to open up, but it's an undeniable problem.

Your body produces mRNA in order to make proteins which is what antibodies are. This is what naturally happens in your body when you are infected with anything. Your body reads it, makes it into mRNA, and sends it out to the factory to produce antibodies.

Old vaccines worked by giving the body something for it to read, the covid vaccine essentially skips that step and directly gives it the information on what antibody to produce.  

mRNA by definition is temporary and will not last long-term in your body.

So no as of now I do not have concerns for long-term effects from mRNA vaccines.  If there is such an effect, it is subtle and mild and currently unable to be detected.

**Now 70 percent of everybody above 18 years and older in Sweden has received at least one dose, and 45 percent are fully vaccinated with two doses**

Since the start on 27 December 2020 and until 14 July, 5,747,869 people in Sweden have received at least one dose of covid-19 vaccine, of which 3,682,574 also received a second dose. This means that 70.2 percent of everyone over the age of 18 received a dose and that 45 percent now received a second dose. This is shown by data from the National Vaccination Register.

\- We have come a long way with vaccination coverage in Sweden and it means a lot to reduce the spread of infection and to be able to keep it at a low level, says Anders Tegnell, state epidemiologist at the Swedish Public Health Agency.

It was harder to hide it in 2020, as well. Less tourism meant more visibility for the locals. 

The overdose issue, as well, was exacerbated by it being harder to find drugs at the start of the pandemic then users suddenly getting their hands on some and trying to use at their prior level. The number of drug users has always been underestimated because many are not actually overdosing in normal times.

I also think our bodies are amazing at healing but we have medicine to bolster it's ability to do things more quickly. For example, you can get over strep throat on your own. You will also be contagious for a week or more after. With anti-biotics you can get over strep in a matter of days and you are no longer contagious 24 hours after fever break. Not just better for you but better for the community around you. You can sometimes get over moderate mental health issues alone, but combine counseling/therapy and modern medicine and you can heal faster (and with a plan get off of the moderate medicines). Always a helper but not a crutch.

Medicine has been around for thousands of years. We shouldn't discount modern medicine just because it's modern.

Vaccination programs are usually not considered fully efficient before herd immunity is achieved. When that's not the case, it can make perfect sense to maintain general restrictions. Why do you think there's a conspiracy behind that?

Yes, there's likely some level of corruption in how public contracts are distributed. That quite a general fact, not specific to the pandemic. How do you deduct from this that there's really no pandemic, that it's engineered through false reporting?  


I don't assume a pandemic leads to higher quality decisions compared to what we'd otherwise experience in government and healthcare. Mistakes must be expected, and shouldn't surprise us. Policies may not be 100% consistent across different authorities and situations. Nothing unusual about that. Again, how can you deduct from this that we're being hoodwinked?  


Americans get tasered by police at very high rates every day. There's one reported case of this being related to refusing to leave an area where masks where mandatory. How you deduct from this that ""people"" are being tasered for not wearing masks? How does this lead to the conclusion that the pandemic is fake?

Countries that didn't implement restrictions in due time have very high case numbers and fatalities. Countries which implemented different levels of lockdown and restrictions managed to keep the numbers down. How do you deduct from this that the pandemic is fake?  


How do you explain your 99.97% stat vs. the significantly increased general mortality rates in countries hit by the pandemic? Also, that number is debunked. [https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-recovery-vaccine/](https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-recovery-vaccine/)

People are getting colds because people are interacting with people more again in indoor spaces - aggravated by the fact that they are not wearing masks. Not because they're wearing dirty masks. 

I am not saying that getting some type of bug from dirty masks is impossible (probably the most common would really be allergies from mold) but it is unlikely. Viruses can't multiply on a mask, so you're left with bacteria or allergy-causing mold. If you're breathing into the mask, it's bacteria that was already in your body to begin with and it's not likely to make you sick.

The doctor does know the what is best for the patient, but if given the choice the patient can be deceived by lying “sweet shop owners” who speak appealing lies. If the decision is given to the patient, the uninformed patient will choose to listen to the sweet shop owner and make the worse decision for themselves.

Yep, could be that the patient makes a bad choice. Still can’t take away their right to choose, bud.

&gt;But in the sense of democracy, it doesn’t literally effect the body of the person but rather the very foundations of a nation

What a moronic statement. Systems of government absolutely directly and indirectly affect the very body of the individual.

&gt;so don’t come at me with the argument “but do you think the doctor should intervene with patients body against their will?” They are not the same. 

Yep, they’re the same.

&gt;And it’s not degrading at all. An average person simply isn’t qualified enough to know how statecraft works, hence not qualified enough to comment on how it should work.

Just because you aren’t educated on what constitutes a functioning government doesn’t mean other people aren’t. Second off, even though you clearly *aren’t* educated on what makes a government function properly, you should still have a right to elect your leaders, because it’s better for you to make your own choices, think about the way you want the world to be, pursue that dream, and learn from your mistakes rather than lazily lick the boot of dictators who do your thinking for you.

&gt;Idea of a benevolent king (dictator) leading to an utopia is as old as the democracy itself. Plato and Socrates were both advocates of rule by competent and benevolent kings rather than democracy where any person, without any in depth knowledge about statecraft, can vote for governance. Modern examples include Ataturk in Turkey and Tito in Yugoslavia, where both of them brought stability and prosperity to otherwise doomed nations. Yet when they passed away, non-benevolent rulers took their place and things went south again.

So much idiocy to unpack.

1. Thank you for confirming my belief that your intellect is at least as archaic as any year that precedes the letters “B.C.”

2. Nobody with any sense “often says” that society ought to trade democracy for dictatorships any more. I’m glad that you took PHI 101 and learned that people used to favor kings, but the developed world (sans you) has progressed past that point.

3. Not that I should have to explain this, but a king is not a dictator.

4. How are you so daft as to not realize the absurdity of your own position. “Yet when they passed away, non-benevolent rulers took their place and things went south again.” Let me say this succinctly so that you can follow along: **How do you not see that this is a major problem with dictatorships???**

&gt;I’m not defending any dictatorship, I’m talking about benevolent dictatorships? Your point doesn’t make any sense.

Too much stupidity to even address here.

&gt;Right to elect leaders is definitely not necessary for a society to reach prosperity. And well-being of a human being is no way correlated to them picking their leaders of they live prosperous lives.

You are genuinely the dumbest person I’ve ever spoken with on Reddit. I am sorry for the insults, but your idiocy is genuinely offensive.

&gt;Calling an argument nonsensical and not providing any counterpoints is just being lazy. How’s that nonsensical? Disregarding that possibility is being short-sighted. Advanced AI we see in movies are science-fiction until they aren’t. They can very well be implemented into our governmental bodies.

It’s a totally out of left field point which has absolutely no relevance to this conversation. It’s not even known if it’s possible for AI to advance to this point. It isn’t even known if it’s possible for intelligence to advance much further beyond that of humans. This is a ridiculous topic to bring up.

&gt;On Monday, Mercy Hospital Springfield had more COVID-19 patients than at the peak in December, and Greene County’s infection rates showed no signs of retreat.

&gt;”Not only are cases continuing to rise, but they’re rising faster,” said Aaron Schekorra, public health information administrator for the Springfield-Greene County Health Department.

&gt;In the St. Louis region, hospitalizations for the virus have been increasing for three weeks. Health officials have warned that the more transmissible delta variant of COVID-19 is circulating here and have called on residents to get vaccinated to tamp down its spread.

&gt;During a briefing Monday morning, St. Louis County Executive Sam Page said the county’s rate of new cases has risen 63% in two weeks.

&gt;”We’re not expecting a slowdown anytime soon,” Page said.

&gt;The case rates are highest among communities with low vaccination rates.

&gt;In the inner north suburbs of St. Louis County, where vaccinations have been slow, the infection rate is 250% higher than the inner central suburbs.

You don't medicate or vaccinate people just for the fun of it. You need to show it is needed and effective. We don't just give everyone a daily dose of aspirin and anti-biotics just in the off chance they catch an infection or get a blood clot/heart attack. 

They can test for antibody levels as time passes, as well as continue to monitor how the vaccinated population is doing regarding infections and death. Remember, vaccines were never 100% effective even right after becoming fully vaccinated. So having some breakthrough cases doesn't mean boosters are the answer. It may just mean vaccines don't work for a small percentage no matter how many dose you give them. 

Sure there is ample supply but that supply really would yield the greatest benefit by reaching the billions of people around the world that are still unvaccinated. Not just to give boosters to people already protected who may get no benefit from a 3rd dose.

Also, each round of vaccination costs the govt billions of dollars. Throwing billions at more rounds of boosters that yield no benefit would be a waste when that same money can help save lives from other diseases that still exist and didn't disappear just because of Covid. 

So like I said, we need to know if boosters are really needed and will provide benefit. If that's true, then sure we should get boosters.

We remote schooled him all year. We were the only family doing it in our town the second half of the year.

It's like no one cares. We stay home. We go to the library when we can see no one else is there and we always wear masks. Sometimes even outdoors.

Remote isn't an option this year.

Viral transmission follows a much more effective global supply chain than humans do and it doesn’t give a shit about the politics. We will all sink or swim together so we need to hold leaders everywhere accountable to reporting accurately. We should not allow them to lazily hide behind these sensationalist headlines filled with accusations and blame.

- If you’re not vaccinated though, this is a much more dangerous time than March 2020. The transmission rate is higher than it used to be, and if you catch Delta, you’re much more likely to die—or get Long COVID. You should be extra careful, only hang out with other vaccinated people, and avoid dangerous events.

- catching the original COVID approximately doubled your likelihood of death at any age. That means catching Delta approximately triples it.

- In China, they estimated the viral load of Delta to be 1,000 times higher than that of the original variant.

- protection against hospitalization and death is nearly perfect for mRNA vaccines, but maybe not for infections.

- Without vaccination, an 80-year-old might have had a 10% chance of dying from the original COVID and, say, 20% with Delta. Now, with an mRNA vaccine, he has a 2% chance of dying if infected.

\- 55 deaths are unlikely linked to a COVID-19 vaccine;  
\- (31 +38) = 69 deaths are under investigation or cannot be assessed due to missing info;  
\- 6 deaths followed a diagnosis of TTS (Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome) i.e. the bad blood clots  
So we can say at least 6 deaths were clearly caused by the vaccine. But here's the kicker: the youngest man to get TTS was 34, and the youngest female was 44. (There have been 105 cases of myocarditis/pericarditis including teenagers, but no deaths from this.)

To the ""I'm too young to get covid"" crowd, I say this: you're also too young to experience a vaccine-induced TTS blood clot and die.

That much is evident, since you're arguing that all forms of evil are equal and that only one true moral truth exists (your idealized form of democracy).

Yeah no you're literally arguing that benevolent dictatorships are just as bad anarchistic slaughter states.

If you believe that, then by proxy you believe all forms of any misdeed are equal. And if you believe that, you have to grant that all forms of good deeds are equal. In other words, petting a kitty is equal to finding a cure for cancer.

This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions. However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

During this time, VAERS received 6,079 reports of death (0.0018%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines. However, recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between the J&amp;J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and TTS, a rare and serious adverse event—blood clots with low platelets—which has caused deaths.”

My best attempt at a TL;DW: They're sorta like health insurance (in the US system), only completely unregulated. Which means, take every problem you've ever had with a traditional health insurance company in the US, add religion, and dial both up to 11.

---

A longer explanation:

Remember how traditional insurance used to be able to reject you for a pre-existing condition, and how much that sucked? That's now illegal... for insurance. HSMs technically aren't insurance, so they can and do reject pre-existing conditions. Also other fun things like going to a hospital that's out-of-network (even if it was an actual emergency and you can't fucking comparison-shop when you call 911), or just set an arbitrary cap on how large of an expense they're willing to pay.

Also, you know how annoying it is that normal health insurance doesn't cover random things that really seem like a standard part of healthcare, like dental? HSMs have *long* lists of things they don't cover -- some because they see them as personal moral failings, like:

* Substance abuse
* Mental health
* Obesity
* *Anything* alcohol-related -- seriously, a woman was beaten senseless and taken to the hospital with skull and spinal fractures, and then had her claim rejected because it was her fault for being outside a bar.
* Abortion
* Anything related to sex outside of marriage. (Got an STD? They'll want to hear the story of how you got it, to make sure it wasn't from fornication.)
* Any other bullshit holier-than-thou reason they make up on the spot.
* Oh, also, some of them won't cover any *preventative* care, either.

So, in theory, I guess the reason people are drawn to these is... kind of the same thing that has people thinking maybe they don't want anti-vaxxers to be a burden on the healthcare system anymore. It's their own fault, right? Same mentality -- some of the people who sign up for these say it's because they don't want their premiums to pay for someone who sat on the couch eating donuts until they got fat and had a heart attack... Basically, they don't want to pay for anyone they think *chose* to be unhealthy. (Disclaimer: I do not agree with them that obesity is a choice, I'm just trying to explain where I think they're coming from.)

The thing is, HSMs have been caught spending well over 80% of their income on overhead (basically paying themselves). Less than 20% of the money goes to paying out claims, probably because of that long list of excuses they can use to reject any claim they want. Which, by the way, is the *exact opposite* of traditional insurance. By law, actual insurance in the US is forbidden from spending more than 20% on overhead, 80% has to go to actual claims!

In other words, if the entire motivation for joining one of these things is to save money on a more-efficient healthcare system that doesn't include people you don't like... well, it won't save money, it's *less* efficient, and there's a good chance it won't include you after all.

---

Oh, and icing on the cake: Since they're not insurance, basically no healthcare providers have a way to bill them like they'd bill insurance. So if you have some huge surprise hospital bill, you pay that out of pocket as if you're uninsured, and then you try to get reimbursed.",,,,1626257944,{},h550k6w,False,t3_oju0qc,False,False,t1_h54r7w8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oju0qc/covid19_cases_surge_in_la_county_fueled_by/h550k6w/,1626417656,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5oygg,False,False,,

In the case of a pandemic, free riders are those who enjoy the positive result when other people get vaccinated — lower transmission of the virus and eventual herd protection — but refuse to take a tiny risk and get vaccinated themselves. The challenge comes, of course, when lots of people realize they can be free riders, and the public good is destroyed.

Charles Darwin wrote about this issue when dealing with the evolution of groups or tribes. It benefits a tribe when its members are cooperative, brave and concerned for each other. But each individual in the tribe has a natural predisposition to be a selfish individualist while benefiting from the social virtues of other members. So how does a tribe maintain its cooperation, courage and mutual concern over time?

Darwin pointed to a number of means. But a particularly powerful “stimulus to the development of social virtues,” he wrote, was that people are deeply concerned about “the praise and blame of our fellow-men.” Human beings avoid being free riders because it is shameful and they care about their reputations. Darwin added that religion gives to these duties the aura of sacredness.

Certain social virtues have become urgent during the covid-19 crisis. And this is testing our country at a weakened point. Many Americans have lost the sense that they share a common enterprise — that they are part of the same tribe. It will seem extraordinary to future generations that, amid a pandemic, some used health policy as a political weapon in the culture war.

Yet for most people hesitant to take the vaccine, the problem is not polarization or conspiracy theories. It is inconvenience, needle fears and a vague sense of personal risk. It is the voice of safety and selfishness in our ear: If we are headed toward herd immunity anyway, what does it matter whether I get vaccinated?

You probably will not hear this assessment from medical professionals, who are trained to be nonjudgmental. But being judgmental is pretty much my job description. So: If you are healthy and refuse to take the vaccine when your chance comes, you are a free rider. You are gaining the benefits of living in a community without paying the minimal cost. And, in the middle of a health emergency, this is shameful. During the past year, front-line workers — especially health workers — have taken far greater risks each day. Many have paid with their lives. Many are paying with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Next to this, the real risk of getting vaccinated is minimal. You are being a bad citizen if you don’t.

The reality, whether people like it or not, is that we do share a community. We owe much of our health and happiness to one another. And we have bonds of history and duty deeper than our differences.

Performing these duties is not without reward. There is a personal benefit in fulfilling a civic responsibility — a sense of pride and shared purpose. And being vaccinated brings a thrill of freedom, allowing you to move through the world with less fear. But the ultimate goal — the return of normal life — can be achieved only when we act together.",,,,1626257491,{'gid_2': 1},h5501jy,False,t3_oju0qc,False,True,t1_h546e8j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oju0qc/covid19_cases_surge_in_la_county_fueled_by/h5501jy/,1626417390,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,2,[],[],text,t2_2xf8busu,False,True,,

The annoying thing is, we have excellent data on how the vaccines do not affect fertility, but it's not well promoted so people don't know that it exists.

""TL;DR: **Yes people in the phase 3 trial got pregnant after vaccination. There was no difference between the rates of pregnancy in the vaccine or placebo groups**. No one in the vaccine group had any trouble with their pregnancy over the course of the study. They also tested it on female rats and did not find any problems, either with fertility or pregnancy.

The Pfizer vaccine FDA report doesn't give a nice summary like this, but they do report 23 people became pregnant during the trial. They report 2 adverse events related to pregnancy, both in the placebo group.

Both companies say they will continue to monitor pregnant people. In general, there is no know reason why a vaccine would affect fertility. I don't believe any ever has before. While mRNA technology is new-ish, it's not so radically different that there would be any reason to believe fertility would be affected. On the other hand, there is growing evidence that covid-19 does affect fertility.""

Abstract

  
Background: Nutritional status influences immunity but its specific association with susceptibility to COVID-19 remains unclear. We examined the association of specific dietary data and incident COVID-19 in the UK Biobank (UKB). Methods: We considered UKB participants in England with self-reported baseline (2006–2010) data and linked them to Public Health England COVID-19 test results—performed on samples from combined nose/throat swabs, using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)—between March and November 2020. Baseline diet factors included breastfed as baby and specific consumption of coffee, tea, oily fish, processed meat, red meat, fruit, and vegetables. Individual COVID-19 exposure was estimated using the UK’s average monthly positive case rate per specific geo-populations. Logistic regression estimated the odds of COVID-19 positivity by diet status adjusting for baseline socio-demographic factors, medical history, and other lifestyle factors. Another model was further adjusted for COVID-19 exposure. Results: Eligible UKB participants (n = 37,988) were 40 to 70 years of age at baseline; 17% tested positive for COVID-19 by SAR-CoV-2 PCR. After multivariable adjustment, the odds (95% CI) of COVID-19 positivity was 0.90 (0.83, 0.96) when consuming 2–3 cups of coffee/day (vs. &lt;1 cup/day), 0.88 (0.80, 0.98) when consuming vegetables in the third quartile of servings/day (vs. lowest quartile), 1.14 (1.01, 1.29) when consuming fourth quartile servings of processed meats (vs. lowest quartile), and 0.91 (0.85, 0.98) when having been breastfed (vs. not breastfed). Associations were attenuated when further adjusted for COVID-19 exposure, but patterns of associations remained. Conclusions: In the UK Biobank, consumption of coffee, vegetables, and being breastfed as a baby were favorably associated with incident COVID-19; intake of processed meat was adversely associated. Although these findings warrant independent confirmation, adherence to certain dietary behaviors may be an additional tool to existing COVID-19 protection guidelines to limit the spread of this virus.

New national surveillance of possible COVID-19 reinfection, published by PHE

New data suggests a low risk of COVID-19 reinfection in the population.


The current data shows that there is a low risk of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. There were 15,893 possible reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 identified up to 30 May 2021 in England throughout the pandemic, out of nearly 4 million people with confirmed infections. This is equivalent to around 0.4% cases becoming reinfected. Current evidence suggests that most reinfections will not cause symptoms.There is currently no evidence that the Delta variant, or any other Variants of Concern, are more likely to cause reinfection than others.

I believe that if someone presents to icu with a totally different ailment but is recorded to be there because of covid (even though that’s not WHY they’re in icu) that is completely misleading. It’s not a hypothetical example- it’s real the cmo answered very clearly that is how they recorded cases since last year. That is the info they are using to impose strict lockdowns &amp; now a two tier society based on who has been vaccinated and who has not. 

I’m fully vaccinated as is my family, my mother is in hospital &amp; would be considered a vulnerable adult due to a previous injury and yet I can’t visit: even tho all the staff and patients have the vaccine. What was the whole point of being vaccinated if nothing changes?

Do you honestly not find anything about the last 18 months questionable? Anything at all? How PPE contracts were awarded to families of politicians? (Worldwide but certainly in Ireland and Uk) How there have been zero actual flu cases? Why covid patients were sent back to nursing homes? Mandatory quarantine hotel contracts given to relations of politicians? Elderly people being tasered for not wearing a mask? A woman facing 18 months in prison for not wearing a mask while on the same day a rapist gets a suspended sentence? None of it? Why antigen tests are not sufficient to travel with but the expensive pcr test is acceptable? How boarding a plane everyone must wear a mask but can remove them to eat or drink sitting shoulder to shoulder for the entire journey? All for a virus that 99.97% of people recover from. 

I’ve followed this pandemic since January and remember watching the numbers in Wuhan. Religiously I researched and read all about it. I watched videos of people in Wuhan dropping dead on the streets.

From the article:

&gt; They were teachers, scholars, mentors, ministers to the troubled. 

&gt; They devoted their lives to God and helping others. After they grew old, they came to a secluded campus in the hills of the Santa Clara Valley to spend the rest of their days in quiet contemplation.

&gt; One by one, the retired priests succumbed to COVID-19. 

&gt; In the span of a month, beginning in early December, eight residents of Sacred Heart Jesuit Center in Los Gatos died.

&gt; As each man grew sicker, fellow residents entered the infirmary one at a time, anointed him with oils and said a prayer. 

… 

&gt; Sacred Heart was home to more than 80 retired priests and brothers, some able-bodied, and others who required frequent medical care. As in other facilities, elderly people living in close quarters provided fertile ground for the coronavirus.

…

&gt; Last November, as the pandemic worsened in California, the coronavirus found its way there. Peterson, the archivist, tested positive, along with four retirees. 

&gt; A full lockdown ensued. The chapel, dining room, gym and library were closed. The retired clergy ate alone in their rooms. Instead of exchanging greetings in hallways, they caught up by email and phone. 

… 

&gt; The first to die was **Bob Mathewson**, 89, on Dec. 6.

&gt; Known as Father Mat, the Los Angeles native founded the counseling office at St. Ignatius High School in San Francisco, according to Jesuits West magazine. At Bellarmine College Prep in San Jose, he made Latin class optional, added modern languages, hired the first female faculty member and made sure needy students had tuition money.

…

&gt; **Bernard “Bernie” Bush**, 86, followed the next day. 

&gt; While training to be a priest in 1958, Bush began visiting the federal prison on Alcatraz Island, assisting in Masses and offering a sympathetic ear to prisoners and staff alike.

&gt; Bush spoke often of his fondness for the prisoners, enjoying chats with Los Angeles mobster Mickey Cohen, New York mafioso Frankie Carbo and Chicago bank robber Lawrence A. Trumblay, said John Cantwell, a longtime National Park Service ranger who worked with Bush on reunions for Alcatraz staff. 
Trumblay was released in time to attend Bush’s ordination in San Francisco in 1965, presenting the new priest with a ceremonial white robe he had made. 

&gt; When Bush celebrated his first Mass, he wore the garment, and Trumblay was in the congregation, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. 

…

&gt; **Joseph Fice** followed Bush to the grave, succumbing to COVID-19 on Dec. 13 at age 82.

&gt; A Southern California native, Fice taught religious education at Catholic high schools for more than two decades and led retreats, including sessions focused on grief for people who had recently lost loved ones. In retirement, he was Sacred Heart’s handyman, caring for antique clocks and the patio garden, Peterson wrote in an online obituary. 

&gt; “Fascinated by word origins, he could be counted on to research and report on whatever arcane subject came up at the table,” Peterson wrote. 

…

&gt; A few days later, on Dec. 16, the virus took **Silvano Votto**, 78, a teacher and scholar of classical languages who was born in Italy. 

&gt; At Sacred Heart, Votto gave lectures on scripture, with the Greek text as his sole reference, Peterson wrote. 

&gt; The day after Votto, **Michael Cook**, a longtime professor at Gonzaga University who wrote three books on theology, died at 84.

&gt; The Montana native, who spoke seven languages, used personal, informal language when discussing God — whom he referred to as “abba,” or “father” in Aramaic, recalled his niece, Colleen Cook.

…

&gt; **Joseph Oneal McGowan**, 80, died six days later.

&gt; He was born in a taxi in Houston in 1940 as his mother rushed to one of the few hospitals that admitted Black patients. 

&gt; Black students were not allowed in Houston Catholic schools, so McGowan’s family moved to Seattle. There, he was ordained as the archdiocese’s first Black priest in 1974, according to a church spokesperson, and later served as head of the University of Seattle’s Office of Minority Affairs. 

&gt; His booming voice and sense of outrage over racial injustice inspired students and instilled confidence in them, said former student Glenn Nelson.


&gt; “Father would just let us go, and that was the first time many of us ever called out white people,” said Nelson, 63, whose mother was Japanese. “It was empowering.”

&gt; In 2019, McGowan moved to Sacred Heart as he battled cancer. He contracted COVID-19, and died Dec. 23.

…

&gt; Then came **Chuck Peterson**, who ministered to Indigenous villages along the coast of the Bering Sea and the banks of the Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers, accessible mainly by bush plane and snowmobile.

&gt; He had dreamed of preaching in Alaska since he was a child in Montana, said Susan Murphy, a friend and longtime parish administrator of Immaculate Conception Church in Bethel. Shortly after arriving in Bethel in 1963, Peterson created a deacon training program for Yup’ik people so that villagers could, after years of instruction, perform communion services, baptisms, weddings and funerals.

&gt; “What made Father Chuck special is he made the teachings so easy to understand,” said Joe Asuluk, 72, who is Yup’ik and has been a deacon since 1989. “If we could understand the scripture, then we could explain it to our communities.”&gt; In 2004, Peterson was working in Washington state when a decades-long sexual abuse scandal surfaced in Alaska. Ultimately, more than 300 allegations involving 45 clergy and volunteers in the Archdiocese of Fairbanks were deemed credible by the church. Most of the victims were native Alaskan children.
Peterson engineered a transfer back to Alaska to try to repair the damage.

&gt; According to Murphy, some former Bethel priests were on the list of accused. Disillusioned, about half the congregation left the church. Peterson won over some people by admitting that church officials were at fault and emphasizing that the victims did nothing wrong, Murphy said.

&gt; After suffering a hemorrhage and cranial bleeding, Peterson moved to Sacred Heart for rehabilitation in 2017. He visited Bethel twice and hoped to return permanently, Murphy said. 

&gt; Peterson, 82, died on Christmas Eve.

…

&gt; Ten days passed before COVID-19 took its last and oldest victim, 95-year-old **Gerald Gordon**.

&gt; Gordon, a native of Spokane, taught at Gonzaga and Xavier University in Cincinnati before working as a hospital chaplain for nearly three decades, according to Peterson, the archivist. He then ministered at Gonzaga before retiring to Sacred Heart in 2015.

&gt; He died of COVID-19 on Jan. 4.

That’s the thing, there’s a huge media push for people to get vaccinated - similar to the mask thing early in the pandemic (don’t buy masks bc our healthcare workers need them). I’m vaccinated and I also saw through the bs earlier in the pandemic that this *reparatory* illness only transmitted through contact. 

I’m fully vaccinated, but still wearing a mask and limiting my trips into public. Not because I’m scared, but because it’s clear that the messaging is “the vaccine is good enough to go back to ‘old normal’ in the face of delta and lambda” is clearly overly optimistic and meant to drive high vaccination numbers. In the macro, that’s the right move. I live in the micro as one of the statistics just like everyone else.

Well not by me, it's your right to have your ideas, and we are here to discuss and debate, not trashing people.

&amp;#x200B;

Vaccines we are given [HAVE passed 3rd phase of approval](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577). The vaccine IS completed. Yes, we might don't have enough time to take a step back but this is not a luxury we can afford, or it's a morbid luxury that cost lives every single day. However I still disagree, it's not an authoritarian move : no one is forced to vaccinate. We don't kidnap people and forcefully inject them with a vaccine. We just said that if you are not vaccinated you will be restricted to go to places that receive public, or for health workers, stop working as long as you are not conforming with the law. And frankly, this is what I was hoping for because the only other solution is to close it for everyone. So ask yourself, is it better to only accept vaccinated people and by so still having some client, or just closing for everyone and have no client at all ?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I said since the beginning that we should learn to live with the virus

Well sorry but that's kinda a looser attitude man. We eradicated smallpox, we almost eliminated polio, tetanus... as a common disease. This is not our first fight against diseases, and it's one that we can win. And even if we fail to eradicate covid, the vaccine is the only way we can go back to normality : we can't put everyone in the hospital, even 50000 people in intensive care is too much for our health system. We cannot dimension with a health crisis as a reference this is nonsense and a waste of money.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;something that Macron definitely didn't do by reducing the capabilities of hospitals

Ding ding ding ! We have a winner ! This is something some politicians said here but in reality, it's false. I'll explain it the same way Olivier Verran, our Heath Minister. Do you know how much cost an intensive care bed ? 2k€/day, and that's the same price even if he is unoccupied. So you know, when the bed is unoccupied : we just remove it. So yeah we reduce capacity indeed. But the other half of the sentence is : when we need it again, we open it back.

It feels a lot different than last summer. Cases were low last summer and some restrictions eased up but things are way more relaxed now. So a bump in cases seems to make sense. 

I think we will have pockets of outbreaks but I don’t think we’ll need to go into a huge lockdown. I could see schools needing to be closed or something like that until the under 12s are able to be vaccinated but I dont really have a good sense of how schools have faired over all. 

Because such a high percentage of the most at risk people have been vaccinated I don’t think we’ll see a crazy uptick in hospitalizations and deaths. I do think it will go up a bit over the next couple weeks but I don’t think there’s a ton we can do about it because the same people who aren’t vaccinated for the most part are the ones that weren’t masking up during the height of the winter wave. 

If you look at the UK their cases have gone up a ton since the beginning of June but their death rates have not shot through the roof. 

Yes there’s people who can’t be vaccinated for health reasons and there’s kids to think about but I think for those worried they’re going to have to be careful and masked up. 

I saw pretty first hand how hard the pandemic hit because the hospital near me always had around 8 ambulances park in the street with a bunch of EMTs congregating which is not the case now. So to me things feel different because the hospitals are way less busy.

The **Numbers** of antivaxers wouldn't be anywhere near as high as it is globally without the largely American propaganda push that covid isn't a big deal.... that's why these people in Canada were waving Trump flags. 

&gt; I don’t think antivax is a uniquely American invention

I'm saying the larger culture war is very much an American invention to associate freedom and the ""good"" things in the world that we enjoy with resisting a piece of cloth on your face and consistent denialism that covid sucks ass even if it doesn't kill you therefore why would you need a shot?

That logic propagates even though it's really really dumb.

&gt; I’m by no means a trump fan but he was never antivax either. He walked a really strange line between regular people and antivax people by publicly bragging about how quickly he got the vaccines out while also not really encouraging anyone to take them. He was trying to somehow appeal to both which was very very odd.

It's not odd when you realize he's just selfish and thus encourages propaganda. To Trump a vaccine simply being available means he can gloat, but he also gets to gloat if he downplays the disease and tells everyone it's not a big deal so he can show low case numbers.

Mild illness already introduces a huge filter on the subset of the population that actually had covid. There are people that were asymptomatic but tested positive and then there are people that don't even know that they had covid, since they were both asymptomatic and never happened to test positive while being infected.

Then there's the fact that while many people report not being back to full health (60% in one study from january, see link after this paragraph) a rather small subset of those people end up displaying particular damage (for instance only 4% of those show any damage on lung scans). It's important to make a distinction between self reported long covid symptoms and long lasting health issues due to covid and medically identifiable through some reproducible test or scan damage that lasts far longer than covid itself.

&gt;The FDA announced the update to the one-shot jab on Monday in [a letter](https://www.fda.gov/media/150723/download) to the company as well as in amendments to its [fact sheets](https://www.fda.gov/media/146305/download) on the vaccine in response to new data showing cases of people displaying symptoms of the syndrome within 42 days of receiving the shot.  
       
&gt;The warning states: ""Reports of adverse events following use of Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine under emergency use authorization suggest an increased risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome during the 42 days following vaccination.""  
           
&gt;The FDA said in its fact sheet for recipients and caregivers that ""[t]he chance of having this occur is very low.""  
           
&gt;Between 3,000 and 6,000 people develop Guillain-Barre syndrome each year in the United States with only about 100 people of the 12.8 million Johnson &amp; Johnson dose recipients having shown symptoms, the FDA [said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/12/johnson-and-johnson-warning/).

A higher viral load means a more contagious virus.

These are solid suggestions. However there is a cost to them that school districts likely can't readily meet. One literal cost is money. Not all districts have the same level of funds meaning that not all schools can have hepa filters or purifiers installed. 

Another cost is time. It takes time to plan, purchase, receive and install those items. 

I'm not saying that school districts shouldn't try to get these things. They definitely should. But masks help reduce the transmission of droplets, so asymptomatic carriers like kids should have wear these to at least try and reduce the spread of covid. Masks also help prevent the spread of other illnesses. This means more kids can be in school for more time because they likely won't get other sicknesses during this coming school year.

Because of that, right now it’s a balance- a lot of kids are going to be years behind developmentally because of this. The longer they’re out of school, the worse it gets. Many will spring back quickly, as kids tend to adapt well… but many still won’t. A large part of it depends on their parents influence.

The bigger issue, I think, is that it will spread to parents and faculty who are at more risk. Which isn’t as big of an issue for those that are vaccinated… but is for those that aren’t.

The majority of people who will be hospitalized or die will be people who chose this situation- those that won’t get vaccinated. Besides children under 12, only a small number of people can’t be vaccinated for medical reasons, and hopefully those people can take extra precautions.

Stop your silly insults, they don't help your case. Neither does the 100% unsubstantiated claim of falsifying data as part of a lockdown conspiracy.   
The Tucker Carlson trick, implying your silly theory as questions, followed by an ""I don't know"" is disappointingly weak . You wanting to distance yourself from your own fantastical theory is understandable, but you really ought to own up to it, so we can have a proper debate. Let's hear it, the deep state and all, or whatever other amazing factless fiction you're into . Own it.

You have presented a video with a politician describing how a hypothetical situation can generate noise in cause of death data. Was that a surprise to you? Are you sure you work in healthcare? There's always a risk of noise cause of death data. Testing isn't 100% either. This is a fact. You present nothing that indicates that this perfectly normal phenomenon happens at very significant level, enough to skew the results.   
Also, nothing in the video backs up your claims about admissions. Only cause of death is dealt with. So your original claim is still suspended in the void, nothing backing it up.

Let's break down your logic: 

* You're vaccinated
* You follow the guidelines
* You don't see Covid cases causing problems - anecdotally

Then you'd think that most people would consider a cause-effect relationship between vaccinations, following guidelines, and the fact that the pandemic is still fairly contained. This is fairly known stuff. True, tried and tested over decades. But no, that would just be too easy, too logical for you, wouldn't it?  
So off you go! Uou deduct that the numbers are deflated on purpose. Not just locally, or randomly, but a full-blown systemic shadow practice. You present one hypothesis to explain this: the motive is lockdown in itself! No further explanation, or insight into who might have this agenda, or what objective might be behind it.

 This is all self explanatory you think? Not agreeing with you on this is being a denier? Head up my ass? Watch the video? You don't think I watched the video? 

You're bringing hot air and broken logic to a fact fight. Once again: stop spreading misinformation. Your feelings are not facts. I'm sorry, there's really no nice way to tell you this. Stop.

Also while I do believe we should get more reporting bias it's very dificult because people don't know about the FDA database, it's mostly family doctors that do the reporting and they've been under medial and social pressure not to due it or set a high bar for it. It's known that prior to 2020 there was a 4:1 underreporting.

Usually these databases aren't meant for phase 3 trials, this type of gathering should have been done by manufacturers like they normally do it for a normal FDA approval.

What you’re taking about isn’t just ridiculous and degrading, it’s paternalistic and flat out ethically disastrous.


The doctor example you gave is almost the same as Socrates’ counterargument against democracy. The doctor does know the what is best for the patient, but if given the choice the patient can be deceived by lying “sweet shop owners” who speak appealing lies. If the decision is given to the patient, the uninformed patient will choose to listen to the sweet shop owner and make the worse decision for themselves. But in the sense of democracy, it doesn’t literally effect the body of the person but rather the very foundations of a nation, so don’t come at me with the argument “but do you think the doctor should intervene with patients body against their will?” They are not the same. And it’s not degrading at all. An average person simply isn’t qualified enough to know how statecraft works, hence not qualified enough to comment on how it should work.


&gt;Hahaha who says that? “Often said” my ass.

Idea of a benevolent king (dictator) leading to an utopia is as old as the democracy itself. Plato and Socrates were both advocates of rule by competent and benevolent kings rather than democracy where any person, without any in depth knowledge about statecraft, can vote for governance. Modern examples include Ataturk in Turkey and Tito in Yugoslavia, where both of them brought stability and prosperity to otherwise doomed nations. Yet when they passed away, non-benevolent rulers took their place and things went south again.


&gt;As opposed to dictatorships, which are classically not oppressive and inefficient.

I’m not defending any dictatorship, I’m talking about benevolent dictatorships? Your point doesn’t make any sense.



&gt;Ensuring the safety and well-being of the people is to ensure their rights. Including, and certainly not limited to, their right to elect their leaders.


Right to elect leaders is definitely not necessary for a society to reach prosperity. And well-being of a human being is no way correlated to them picking their leaders of they live prosperous lives.

Being 5-7 and developing life long symptoms would be a lot of suffering. When I was about 10 I got a bad respiratory infection that my body never recovered from. I've had mild asthma and recurrent pneumonia for the last 20 years. That of course made me high risk for COVID and in October when I caught it, it was not only horrible, but I was far more sick than the average 30 year old with COVID. I wasn't the youngest COVID patient they had seen in the ER, but definitely younger than most. Then the long haul symptoms started. That was all a direct result from an infection I had when I was young.

Again, not disagreeing with you. Most kids who get it will be perfectly fine. My nephew ran a fever for less than 24 hours and had a runny nose for two or three days. He was bouncing around the entire time, so much so that my dad and I had to put together a swing set/play center for him to play on because he couldn't go to the park to get the energy out of him.

Breakthrough infections are expected, per the CDC.  They are only counted when a post-vaccinated victim is hospitalized, per the CDC.

So the vaccinated elderly are still catching COVID badly enough to be hospitalized.  This is exactly how vaccine resistant strains happen, even with mRNA vaccines.  

It's analogous to MRSA, which science says formed from the staph bacteria that survived a medical intervention (methicillin, because staph is a bacteria).  Coronavirus that survives a vaccinated immune system has the opportunity to mutate, multiply, and spread in the same manner.  At some point we will all believe and understand the science behind these diseases.

I had all my childhood vaccines. Our children will have their childhood vaccines.  Does this make us anti-vax or against vaccines? Do absolutely all the vaccines that are available need to be taken to avoid the label anti-vax? 

Whenever the government, in cahoots with pharmaceutical companies that have atrocious track records in terms of pushing unsafe products onto unsuspecting populations, decides in the future that we need to take a vaccine, do we have to automatically roll up our sleeves or are we allowed to at least wait until the supposedly independent oversight bodies give the product their approval? 

Few people who are skeptical about the covid vaccine would argue against inoculating children against polio or measles. The constant attempts to paint all all those who are vaccine hesitant with the same brush of absurdity and stupidity demonstrates a lack of willingness to engage in good faith.

I'm talking specifically about Medi*caid*\--Medi*care* is a different program.

And you are making an apples-to-oranges comparison.  You are comparing denial for pre-existing conditions--which is illegal under the ACA--to denial for failing to meet a requirement (getting the vaccine).

There is already a system in place for the latter.  You can be denied for not meeting income requirements.  You can be denied for failing to meet asset limits.  In addition, you can be denied other federal/state welfare benefits for failing to meet employment requirements, etc.  

COVID-19 is an unprecedented event.  The government has an obligation to its citizens to mitigate the damage in any legal way possible.  This *could* include requiring those receiving benefits to get vaxxed.  The optics around the pandemic change on an almost daily basis, and that's part of the reason for the reluctance.

Cruising in Singapore is subject to the same restrictions as other on-land activities - restrictions on group sizes, masks on outside rooms, social distancing. Additionally, you need to get a swab test done before you board and carry a contact tracing Bluetooth device with you around the boat. Finally, our overall caseload in Singapore is pretty low (~300 active cases in a 5.7M population, most of them imported) and we have 70+% of our population vaccinated with at least one dose. 

Protocols are in place for such an eventuality and it looks like these were followed to a T. This is part of the precautionary protocols, and I will be very surprised if this turns out to form anything more than a small cluster.

Also, they have already exited with testing, been asked to monitor their health and will be tested again in two weeks. [Source](

If you are living in literal ruins and food is scarce and many of your friends, family and former neighbors are dead, you have no choice but to rely on your community. As a result of losing so much in WWII, those countries trended more socially democratic over time, enacting social safety nets as soon as they could.

The US experienced WWII differently. When the GIs cam home, home was just as they left it. And wouldn’t you know, jobs were bountiful because someone had to rebuild Europe. So the US experienced unprecedented economic success never before seen. This lead a lot of families to develop a “bootstraps” mentality, because in their limited view, they did pull themselves up by the bootstraps. 

Over time, this value warped into what you see in the 1980’s, and now we are back to the present. Still pretending high paying jobs are bountiful and anyone can bootstrap themselves into success, completely ignoring that the only reason we had that advantage was because a lot of Europe was destroyed.

&gt;The hostesses have also been known to move between multiple KTVs in one night, going to lounges that have more guests if their usual haunt sees lower patronage.Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist from the Rophi Clinic, told ST: ""Such behaviour greatly increases the ease of spreading the virus and it is why I wouldn't be surprised if the cluster blows up even bigger.""  
&gt;  
&gt;He added that the KTV cluster could be a weak link in Singapore's fight against Covid-19, especially since hostesses and patrons may be trying to lie low, making it difficult for the authorities to ring-fence those who are infected. Some hostesses, he said, could be working illegally.  
&gt;  
&gt;""My concern is whether there are any overstayers who have been working under the radar. They are difficult to detect and they will not come into our hospitals for fear of being discovered by the authorities,"" he said, adding that patrons such as married men may also be reluctant to come forward for testing.",,,,1626269888,{},h55igar,True,t3_ok4icr,False,True,t3_ok4icr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ok4icr/singapore_ktv_cluster_will_grow_with_covid19/h55igar/,1626426856,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_57c32zx5,False,False,,

If you imagine that the vaccine makes you less likely to be hospitalized when infected, then that's true, but it means that hospitalizations will grow exponentially at the same rate as cases do. Just, maybe instead of being at 2 deaths per 100 cases, you'll be at 2 deaths per 1000 cases.  

In the UK we haven't seen that deaths are rising exponentially at the same rate as cases though. This is because the cases are rising quickly in a more ""safe"" group (young people) compared to older people (a vaccinated old person is still more threatened by the virus than an unvacccinated young person) 

The UK is definitely being saved by the vaccine right now, but that has more to do with the vaccine stopping the spread of the virus in vulnerable groups, than just the reduction in hospitalization risk when infected.

Scotland's 7-day average in cases peaked about 2 weeks ago, so we are probably going to see the peak in hospitalizations/deaths within the next week or so. The results?

**Current Metrics:**

Peak 7-day average cases = 3,334 (on 6/30)

Latest 7-day average of hospital admissions = 70 (as of 7/7, so may somewhat increase) --&gt; 2.1% of confirmed peak cases

Latest 7-day average of deaths = 2 (as of 7/12) --&gt; 0.1% of confirmed peak cases


**January Wave Metrics:**

Peak 7-day average cases = 2,356 (on 1/1)

Peak 7-day average of hospital admissions = 196 (on 1/14) --&gt; 8.3% of confirmed peak cases

Peak 7-day average of deaths = 63 (on 1/23) --&gt; 2.7% of confirmed cases

This suggests DRAMATIC reductions in the severity of disease at 75% for hospitalization and &gt;95% for death. Additionally, while Scotland's vaccination rate is very high (~90% of adults with at least one dose), there are obviously still some unvaccinated and many partially vaccinated people in this data set. Thus, the reduction in severity for vaccinated folks is almost certainly even better.

These vaccines work great folks! Go get your shot if you haven't yet.

That opinion piece gets several facts wrong. The mRNA platform vaccines are not the only available vaccines, and even if they were, they are not unknown or novel platforms. mRNA vaccine technology has been researched for over 30 years. mRNA is not a ""gene based"" vaccine as they claim either. Further, they fail to identify any risks of the mRNA vaccines in the 0-16 population while acknowledging that there is a death rate of about 20 in 1,000,000 among children ages 0-17. In your other comment you claim that zero children are suffering from long term COVID symptoms, but that is flat out false. 

Lets look at the actual facts here: Your child is more likely to die from COVID-19 than they are to die from a COVID-19 vaccine. Your child is more likely to become severely ill from COVID-19 than they are from a COVID-19 vaccine. Your child who hasnt gotten the COVID-19 vaccine is more likely to put someone who cant get the vaccine at risk. Your child who hasnt gotten the COVID-19 vaccine is more likely to become a breeding ground for the next variant of concern. 

Public safety requires the participation of the public. If you or your child is not willing to participate in keeping the public safe, then I wont lose a second of sleep saying that you have no business participating in public life. Once the vaccines have full approval require them in schools, allow children to attend in person who have been vaccinated or have a valid health/religious exemption, and those who simply choose to not get vaccinated can find an alternative place to get educated or they can participate in remote learning.

That was the point of the comment you replied to, that people who are suffering from *real, physical* symptoms of a chronic disease are desperate for help across the board.


And do some research on Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases like bartonella and babesia next time before you start spouting off. Lyme spirochetes **can and do** burrow deep into tissues and can continue to cause problems for years, especially in people who are not properly diagnosed and treated within the first few months of infection. Also blood tests are very limited in their ability to detect certain (most) diseases. Why tf do you think we screen people with colonoscopies and mammograms? Why do we swab nasal cavities for covid and cold/flu tests?? 

Yes, there are quacks who prey on desperate patients. But what you described sounds a lot more like a Lyme-literate MD trying to treat their patient instead of dismissing their concerns than a quack trying to fleece someone.

We now know that it was in the community for several months beforehand. While I am not 100% sure what I had was covid, my experience mimicked that of long covid patients closely.

Me: Mid 30’s, M, BMI normal range, no co-morbidities.

Symptoms were acute onset respiratory issues which got worse over 3-4 days, random blood pressure spikes even during inactivity, chest discomfort, and persistent fatigue. Symptoms would ebb and flow, but it was several months before I even felt comfortable going for a walk or short run. I constantly felt like taking short, shallow breaths because deeper breathing felt uncomfortable. Over the summer and fall things slowly improved, but I never got back to 100%, and would periodically experience these shallow breathing episodes and persistent fatigue.

May 25 I received my first dose. I have noticed a marked difference in energy levels and almost no breathing difficulty since then. I periodically find myself adopting a shallow breathing pattern, perhaps out of habit, but I self correct with no trouble.

[],,DJOldskool,,,,,,[],"If you did proper research, you would know those mRNA vaccines are actually safer than any other vaccine that has come before it.

They do not contain a virus at all just a snippet of its RNA surrounded by lipids (fat) to get it into cells, the cells will then copy the mRNA. This allows the body to quickly recognise any virus that has that snippet in its RNA. This is why you should get the vaccine anyway because you can still catch and spread variants, whereas the vaccine will work unless that snippet has changed. The snippet is chosen in part because it is unlikely to change.

The vaccines have authorisation for use, this is standard procedure to not be fully 'FDA approved' until later. Doesn't take much research to find this out either.

Do you have your measles vaccine?  
""Most people survive measles, though in some cases, complications may occur. About 1 in 4 individuals will be hospitalized and 1–2 in 1000 will die."" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles)

Its not necessarily about the death rate, its the hospitalisation rate paired with exponential growth (High R rate) and long incubation / asymptomatic cases that is the danger. Left unchecked it will spread so fast it will overwhelm the hospitals and everyone that even just needs some oxygen dies.

Critical thinking is hearing someone saying 'they are lying to you' and then not believing that unless you research info from the other side and try to get to an informed opinion.

Or another way of putting it 'Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence'. Hearing someone's claims and choosing to believe it and looking for more people making similar claims, just doesn't cut it.

Transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person.8 Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer). “

Exposure occurs in three principal ways: (1) inhalation of very fine respiratory droplets and aerosol particles, (2) deposition of respiratory droplets and particles on exposed mucous membranes in the mouth, nose, or eye by direct splashes and sprays, and (3) touching mucous membranes with hands that have been soiled either directly by virus-containing respiratory fluids or indirectly by touching surfaces with virus on them.”",,,,1626283831,{},h56di43,False,t3_ojzs31,False,True,t1_h56cspw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ojzs31/vaccinated_ca_man_gets_breakthrough_covid_case/h56di43/,1626444122,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5z0thbuu,False,False,,

[],,korokunderarock,,,,,,[],"I live in the UK which, for all its faults, is overall a really pro-vax country. But the language around the COVID vaccines is really super different and a lot more moderate than some of what I've seen on this sub and heard from American friends. In the UK we have always been told you can still get COVID while vaccinated, but it's less likely, and if you do, you're more likely to have a mild case. 

The consent form I had to sign before the first dose (which is [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/954440/PHE_Covid-19_consent_form_adults_able_to_consent_v2.pdf)) is a good example -- it says really clearly at the top that it reduces but doesn't eliminate the risk. And that is what's panning out in reality -- they're not perfect (lol look at our case numbers), but they're [real fucking good](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-hospitalisation-from-delta-variant).

So I was a bit shocked at how widespread the idea that you cannot get COVID while vaccinated seems to be in the USA. Even the language the CDC uses like ""[COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing you from getting sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)"" honestly makes me feel a bit weird, because while, sure, a big reduction in risk still counts as ""effective"", I feel like the wording is intentionally vague, and chosen to make people think the vaccines are completely protective. 

And...I guess I really wonder how much that helps? It seems to me like talking someone into being vaccinated by making them think the vaccine is flawless is just setting them up to be disappointed. I would have thought that having realistic expectations for what the vaccines are actually capable of (which is already fucking great) would make people *less* likely to feel let down by them, and more likely to trust them.",,,,1626216151,{},h539xof,False,t3_oizn9w,False,True,t1_h4yoeov,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oizn9w/most_fully_vaccinated_people_who_get_covid_delta/h539xof/,1626383915,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5l2q5wse,False,False,,

He made the argument that for many of these men the quality of life (sex with other men) outweighed the quantity of life. The book was hugely controversial and often misinterpreted as an argument against safe sex education. In reality Eric was one of the few voices pointing out the obvious, that sex was the defining identity of gay men and the idea of facing a lifetime of living without it was simply too much for many to bear. 

That does put a more understandable spin on the choices made by many during Covid to go without masks and gather with family and friends. I am sure many people were aware of the consequences but the social aspect of life held so much meaning for them they ignored the risks because for them the quality of a life rich with social interaction was more important than focusing on the quantity of life without it.

Hyperbole. An overwhelming majority of the unvaccinated are unvaccinated for personal-belief reasons, and their actions directly endanger the rest of them:

&gt; We still have to solve for a very large part of the population who are being told they can NOT be vaccinated yet…. (AIDS, Transplant patients, even some auto-immune and steroids patients).

We have a solution: [Herd immunity.](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/herd-immunity) Get enough of the population vaccinated, and the virus stops spreading. We've seen this happen with other diseases, global supply chains or not. And if the virus isn't spreading in a region, it's not infecting those who *can't* get vaccinated, either.

But for that to work, we need as many people vaccinated as possible. For polio, that was 80%. For measles, it's 95%. For COVID, we don't know yet. But even if it's as bad as measles, well, add up all the AIDS, transplant patients, autoimmune and steriods patients, it's still not going to be 5% of the population, so we could still actually protect those people by all getting our measles shots. But when you add antivaxxers, suddenly you get measles outbreaks.

&gt; AND the biggest issue of all… the billions and billions of doses still needed in poorer countries with corrupt governments and/or a suspicious population who would rather kill the WHO representatives than get vaccinated.

Yeah, that's a problem.

&gt;While it’s clear that loss of smell and taste happens with some frequency in COVID-19, the why has been a bit more difficult to suss out. It’s different from colds or flu, where smell and taste may be affected by nasal congestion; a stuffy nose is not a typical symptom of COVID-19, and radiographic imaging of affected individuals usually fails to show significant nasal or sinus inflammation. Early on, some scientists thought that COVID-related anosmia meant that the virus might be infecting olfactory neurons or using those neurons to infect the brain, but studies have shown that this is unlikely. Rather, it now appears that the virus attacks the neurons’ helper cells in the nasal cavity. Among other functions, these cells provide metabolic and physical support to the cilia, fingerlike odor receptors on the neurons’ surfaces. And unlike mature olfactory neurons, their surfaces are peppered with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, through which the SARS-Cov-2 virus enters the body’s cells.

Not exactly. The more a virus spreads, the more opportunities it as to mutate. 

The stronger variants overtake the weaker ones, that’s why we focus on **variants of concern**.

&gt; Likely most other mutations are much less severe than delta and we ignore

Delta is demonstrably more powerful than the OG strain that decimated Wuhan. 

It isn’t getting “weaker.”

&gt; After months of data collection, scientists agree: The delta variant is the most contagious version of the coronavirus worldwide. It spreads about 225% faster than the original version of the virus, and it's currently dominating the outbreak in the United States.

&gt; A new study, published online Wednesday, sheds light on why. It finds that the variant grows more rapidly inside people's respiratory tracts and to much higher levels, researchers at the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported.

&gt; On average, people infected with the delta variant had about 1,000 times more copies of the virus in their respiratory tracts than those infected with the original strain of the coronavirus, the study reported.

&gt; In addition, after someone catches the delta variant, the person likely becomes infectious sooner. On average, it took about four days for the delta variant to reach detectable levels inside a person, compared with six days for the original coronavirus variant.

&gt; In the study, scientists analyzed COVID-19 patients involved in the first outbreak of the delta variant in mainland China, which occurred between May 21 and June 18 in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province. The researchers measured the levels of virus in 62 people involved in that outbreak and compared them with the levels in 63 patients infected in 2020 with an early version of the virus.

&gt; Their findings suggest that people who have contracted the delta variant are likely spreading the virus earlier in the course of their infection.

&gt; And the scientists underscore the importance of quarantining immediately for 14 days after coming into contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19, as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends.

&gt; Or even better, getting fully vaccinated. Preliminary data shows that in some U.S. states, 99.5% of COVID-19 deaths in the past few months were among people who weren't vaccinated, the CDC's director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, said Thursday at the White House.

&gt; ""We know that the delta variant ... is currently surging in pockets of the country with low vaccination rates,"" Walensky said. ""We also know that our authorized vaccines prevent severe disease, hospitalization and death from the delta variant.""

But because of vaccines, health experts don’t expect the recent increase to reach the levels seen in New York City’s first and second waves.

July 14, 2021Updated 9:22 a.m. ET

Fueled by the Delta variant, daily coronavirus case counts in New York City have begun climbing in recent days, even as the city seems determined to turn the page on the pandemic.

Just a few weeks ago, there were only 200 new cases a day across the city on average, the lowest level since the early days of the pandemic. But the city has now had a streak of days with 400 or more cases. And the test positivity rate has doubled: from below 0.6 percent on average to about 1.3 percent.

Those numbers are still low, but the increase has been swift, surprising some epidemiologists and public health officials who had not expected to see cases jump so quickly after remaining level throughout June.

Still, with some 64 percent of adults in the city fully vaccinated, epidemiologists said it was unlikely that the Delta variant would create conditions anywhere near as devastating as the past two waves of Covid-19.

Officials and experts are concerned

“Alarming is not the right word” to describe the recent uptick in cases, said Denis Nash, an epidemiologist at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy. “I would say concerning.”

The Delta variant is far more contagious than the original form of the virus that swept across the city in March 2020. It is also more contagious than even the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant (which was first detected in Britain and since has been renamed Alpha) that edged out other variants during the city’s long second wave.

The Delta variant was detected in a few cases in New York City in February during the second wave, but really made inroads over the past two months, when there was relatively little virus circulating in the city. By the end of May, it accounted for about 8 percent of the cases sequenced by the city, and by mid-June, more than 40 percent. Yet throughout June, the number of infections stayed low, at about 200 cases a day.

Given how contagious the Delta variant is, experts are not surprised that case counts eventually started climbing. Countries around the world are experiencing a surge as a result of Delta. In the United Kingdom, with a vaccination rate that surpasses that of the United States, cases have soared, but hospitalizations have risen more slowly.

“The metrics to keep a close eye on are hospitalizations and deaths,” said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University.

So far, those metrics have remained stable in New York City. The seven-day average number of daily hospitalizations this week has remained under 20. The city has recently seen four or five Covid-related deaths a day on average.

The hope, if not expectation, had been that the summertime would be a time of few cases. Case counts stayed low in New York last summer as the city emerged from a devastating first wave. That did not change until September, when rising transmission in a few spots in Brooklyn and Queens preceded a citywide increase in cases that eventually became a second wave that lasted until spring.

In interviews in recent weeks, some epidemiologists said they were expecting a calm summer followed by an uptick of cases around the time students returned to school and Manhattan office workers migrated back to the office.

But in the last week of June, the number of people testing positive suddenly jumped, crossing 300 on June 30. A four-day streak of 400-plus cases followed last week.

“We’ve seen some increase in cases and positivity, but we’ve also seen hospitalization rates continue to go lower,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said this week.

The city has focused on Staten Island

In news conferences, health officials have tended to focus on one borough where vaccination rates are below the city average, wearing masks is unpopular and positivity rates tend to exceed the city average — as they have for much of the past year.

“In Staten Island, the percent positivity and the case numbers have increased in recent days and weeks,” the city health commissioner, Dr. Dave Chokshi, said on Monday. “And that’s because we have unvaccinated individuals, particularly younger people, who remain unvaccinated.”

But the uptick goes far beyond Staten Island. Case counts have climbed significantly in every borough. In Brooklyn, average daily case counts nearly doubled in recent weeks from under 60 to more than 100. On Tuesday, the ZIP code that had the highest average positive test rate in the city, at 4.89, was in Harlem.

The unvaccinated are most vulnerable

Health officials have said the vast majority of those testing positive have not been fully vaccinated.

The Health Department has not yet released statistics on how many new cases are among people who are fully vaccinated. Data from other countries shows that a full regimen of the vaccines in use in New York offers a high degree of protection against the Delta variant.

Still, breakthrough cases are not difficult to find. Stories of them circulate on Twitter, and at clinics and other testing sites.

Tony Smith, a 31-year-old Brooklyn resident who works for a social impact company, thought he was done with Covid this spring, when he got his two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. He had already caught the virus during New York’s initial wave, suffering a range of symptoms, including chest pain. For months afterward, his resting heart rate was elevated.

After his second shot of the vaccine, his heart rate dropped and he began to feel normal.

Then on Sunday, he woke up feeling slightly sick. The next day his heart rate felt higher. And he felt the same terrible sensation in his chest as he did when he first had Covid-19. “It’s like the crinkling of aluminum foil in my chest,” Mr. Smith said.

He tested positive for the virus again on Monday.

So far, he said, his symptoms felt much milder compared with his first infection. “I can tell you right now, it’s hugely comforting to have been vaccinated,” he said.

Delta has not caused the city to consider restrictions

So far, the Delta variant has not led the city to drastically change its public health guidance or virus-related restrictions. Nor has it affected the plans of many large companies to get workers back to their desks in Manhattan, according to Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a leading business association.

“It would have been prudent for our elected officials to have specified in advance if, when and under what circumstances they would walk back certain components of opening up,” Professor Nash said.

For now, the city’s main strategy against Delta is to continue urging the unvaccinated to get vaccinated. But in recent months, the number of doses administered has fallen precipitously.

While vaccination rates are high in the lower half of Manhattan, much of Queens, and parts of Brooklyn, they lag behind elsewhere, especially in Black and ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods.

Already there have been sharp racial disparities in the infection rate and death rate through the first two waves of the pandemic, with the virus hitting Hispanic and Black New Yorkers hardest. Those disparities could grow even more pronounced now with Delta, given the uneven vaccination rates.

“With the Delta variant we can expect to see outbreaks in ZIP codes where African Americans live because of the low vaccination rate,” said Dr. Kitaw Demissie, who is dean of the School of Public Health at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn.

The measles offer a blueprint

In interviews, epidemiologists said that to anticipate what might happen next, it was helpful to remember the 2018-2019 measles outbreak that was largely concentrated in the Orthodox Jewish communities of Williamsburg in Brooklyn. The city’s response to it was not major shutdowns, but enforcement of vaccination requirements.

“We can have localized outbreaks — similar to the outbreaks we saw with measles,” Dr. Demissie said. He expected those outbreaks to largely track areas with low vaccination rates.

The city is scrambling to figure out how to raise vaccination rates, offering in-home vaccinations and other incentives. But Mr. de Blasio has shown little interest in mandating vaccinations or pressuring people through testing requirements or other inconveniences. He has not mandated vaccinations for the city government’s 400,000-person work force, as San Francisco has.",,,,1626274153,{},h55rcbh,True,t3_ok5vfg,False,False,t3_ok5vfg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ok5vfg/as_delta_spreads_virus_cases_rise_in_new_york_city/h55rcbh/,1626431532,19,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_m76zflk,False,False,,

Because the CDC seems uniquely qualified for the task, it's disappointing they’re not tracking all breakthrough cases. But it’s worth noting that the CDC isn’t the only option: the NIH, academic medical centers, state and regional health departments, private companies, and a variety of grant funders, as well as researchers in other countries, can decide to support efforts to track breakthrough cases.
In days, weeks, or even months to come, it’s possible the CDC will reverse its decision and resume tracking all breakthrough cases. Regardless of how we shine a light on all breakthrough cases, it would seem wise to pay more, not less, attention to them.
