To get EUA:

The FDA has said that in order for a COVID-19 vaccine to be administered to the public, including healthy people, they will only issue an EUA if a vaccine has demonstrated clear and compelling effectiveness in a large Phase 3 clinical trial.

At the public health level, different countries have already taken different reactions based on their particular circumstances. For instance, if you have a fairly dense population and are high income country and have access to something like the BioNTech vaccine, then you might take the approach of abandoning AstraZeneca entirely. If you are at the other extreme, low income, poorly developed health infrastructure, lots of people long travel times from population centres, you probably will press ahead with AstraZeneca and similar vaccines because of its advantages and accept that you will have some small number of complications or deaths because it is far smaller number of deaths from the much slower, more expensive, difficult roll out of different vaccines.",,,1618547264,{},guotxn9,False,t3_mrcrm8,False,False,t3_mrcrm8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mrcrm8/covid_eight_times_more_likely_to_cause_rare_brain/guotxn9/,1618555841,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I am on messaging status with 2 of the authors.  I was initially involved with #Masks4All, and then invited to the #CoVidIsAirborne.

That article was written for 3 major reasons:

1.  The WHO Transmission Committee is biased against CoVid being airborne.

2.  The leader of that committee just debated two #CoVidIsAirborne scientists.  And he authored two pretty biased reviews against airborne.

3.  The vast majority of the world's governmebts' public health departments take their cue from the WHO....and people are dying because of it. &lt;===== This is why you should care.  The next pandemic could already be on its way.

If you think it came from animals...we are still living with animals.
If you think it came from a lab, then you know humanity's rather horrific history of accidents.  

I could care less about how this all started, so I will ignore any  conversations about how it started.

And here we go.....

1...................
Dr. Conly who leads the WHO CoVid  Transmission Committee, thinks that transmission is primarily by fomites and droplets (the big ones you can see from coughing and sneezing).

At the last vote of that committee, 33% voted that CoVid is Airborne.

17 are on that committee.
Areas of expertise voting on that committee:

6 anti-microbial scientists

4 hand hygiene experts

1 epidemiologist

1 social scientist

1 water-borne epidemiologist

1 multidrug-resistant expert

1 infection control in hospitals

ZERO aerosol experts.

The WHO says they consult with aerosol scientists.  And I'm sure they do....but aerosols are often not intuitive.

And aerosol scientists have no vote.  Think of that.  No one who understands aerosols on a deep level has a seat at the that table.

(I think aerosols are easy to understand...think cigarette smoke.  Smoke is an aerosol.)

2...................
Anyway....Dr Prather and Dr. David Fisman representing the ideabthat #CoVidIsAirborne, debated Dr. Conly recently.

https://events.ucalgary.ca/obrien/#!view/event/event_id/306929

Watch it yourself, if you like, as there is a recording there.

Dr. Conly's central precept was that CoVid is transmitted primarily via fomites and droplets.  Emphasized the overwhelming amount of virus found on fomites.

But.

He also omitted the truth.  SARSCOV-2 has been cultured from virus captured in the air.  Period.  Lednicky (2020) twice.   And one other group...can get the source if pressed.

BTW, It is very difficult to capture virus in the air...especially in hospitals which have excellent air cleaners (6 ACH or greater).  Typical, ventilation in a home is &lt;1 ACH.

Think of that!  Trying to capture built-up virus as it is constantly being cleaned?  

Also, far less of inoculum is needed to infect via aerosols than droplets or transfer from fomites.  It makes sense once you realize that your lungs stretch out 50 to 100 yards...and you are constantly pouring air over that surface which is riddled with ACE2 receptors.

As opposed to hand transfer of sputum or droplet to your mucal regions nose, mouth or eyes. 

Or a droplet from coughing or sneezing.  Kind of hard to explain droplets when over 50% of transmission is from asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission.  Which, by definition, has no droplets.

Conly also flat out ignored all of the many epi studies that have genomic confirmation.

He also ignored epi studies that have video proof as well as genomic confirmation of SSE clusters.

He also prattled on about the Molinas study published..a study that should never have been.  Completely ignored the fact that most aerosol scientists, including one of his most prominent students, Dr. Linsey Marr, criticized the study at the time.  (Molinas was a God at one point in the field, and he died soon after his study was retracted.  F****ing dirty pool by Conly on that.)

Finally, Conly collaborated with Heneghan to write two lopsided studies reviews of fomites and airborne.

Hugely ironic as Heneghan is supposedly all about Evidence Based science.

3..................
The WHO will NOT come out and clearly state that CoVid is Airborne.

196 countries approximately, take their IPC guidance from the WHO.

&gt; In comparison with a typical year, we estimate this represents an  additional 12–15 new type 1 diabetes cases (80% increase) during the  COVID-19 pandemic, with apparent clusters of cases observed in two  units. The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is the  binding site for SARS-CoV-1 and -2 ([2](https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/43/11/e170#ref-2)) and is strongly expressed in pancreatic endocrine cells ([3](https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/43/11/e170#ref-3)).  Previous evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-1 virus may have entered  pancreatic islet cells via the ACE2 receptor leading to β-cell damage  and new-onset, mainly transient diabetes ([3](https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/43/11/e170#ref-3)).  While our data do not prove a link, we postulate that SARS-CoV-2  exposure contributed to the observed increase in cases by precipitating  or accelerating type 1 diabetes onset.

State officials have lifted all gathering bans, and my father insists that the viewing be traditional. I live with my father, and am taking care of the dogs my mom left behind. My mom was extremely well loved, and I expect hundreds of people to come through, and most of those people to be hugging my dad and hanging around to talk for a large part of the duration.

&amp;#x200B;

I live where most people 'don't believe' in things like masks and vaccines. My county is currently listed as extremely high risk. I don't know if I'm being paranoid, but it feels like it would take a miracle for my dad, not to get covid from this.  


I know it sounds like I'm being concerned for him right now, which I am, but  I'm more concerned about myself. I have asthma, I'm going through extreme allergies right now as it is, my body is already wrecked from the stress and anxiety I have endured from the last 6 weeks of my mom suffering, from her diagnosis to her death(cancer, late stage, inoperable, died from incompetent doctors and complications that should have been solved when she first went and not 2 weeks later), and to be frank, I may have trouble mustering much of a will to live if things got bad. She was the most important person in my life, and the only person IRL who has always been in my corner.  


So I don't know what the heck to do. I have a hard time feeling like I would survive covid if I had a bad reaction. I have no family to stay with who will not also be at that gathering and probably also being hugged by hundreds of people and staying in that room for hours. Except my brother and his family, who had covid a few weeks ago, but they have a toddler and no extra space. I could sleep on his couch, but that would mean I, as an introvert, would have no time to myself around my things, in this period where I need to be able to grieve alone and in peace for my mom, with access to my PC and my online friends.  


And even if I could leave, I would feel horrible, because it would mean I'm not caring for my mom's dogs. Something I promised to do in her final hours. They live in the main part of the house, which is also where my dad resides and sleeps. They would not tolerate not being able to be where they're comfortable and used to living... the oldest would shriek until I let her back in there, and the youngest would freak out from not being able to go in there, and... they just lost their mom too. And my room isn't really big enough for them to live comfortably anyway. My youngest dog has a lot of anxiety and stress issues, and is already going through the pain of mom not coming home for a month, and I would hate to leave him too... I'm the main comfort he has left right now. So I would feel horrible being away from him and unable to comfort him. and if I'm here, and taking care of them, it's basically unavoidable that I use the rooms my dad lives in. It's almost impossible anyway, as that's the main living space, and where our cooking area is.  


So I feel screwed. I don't know what to do. This whole thing has been the worst experience of my life, and I can't believe it's not over... I can't believe I still have to endure more than I already have. Looking for advice, but don't even bother telling me to cancel or restrict the viewing... it's already set up, and my dad will insist on it being entirely traditional. Try not to view him too harshly... that's his wife, and as I said she was loved by many many people, and I agree that as many people that want to come to the viewing should be able... Just if it were up to me I would impose restrictions and not allow a huge gathering.  


I'm so exhausted... none of this has been fair or right... and now I have to deal with this, and I don't even know how. One of the worst parts is that she's not here to guide me... not here to make dad consider my stake in this... not here to comfort me if I get sick.

 I find it totally ridiculous to continue restricting your life after you’re vaccinated. My state only has like 20 daily cases per 100k people. If I encounter one of those, I don’t necessarily catch it because you don’t catch covid automatically just by encountering it. If I would happen to catch it, there’s a 90+% chance that the vaccine will block it. If I do manage to catch it anyway, I’ll have one fourth the viral load, reducing my odds of giving it to someone else by 90+%. If they’re vaccinated, which by then it’s fair to say they probably should be (it’ll be over a month of full eligibility by then) then they also have a 90% chance of not catching it from me. And if by some miracle all of that stuff happens and I do manage to actually infect someone with covid, there’s still like a massive chance that they’ll be a symptomatic (as always) and almost no chance they’ll die (as always).

The hotel quarantine program here is a monumental fuck-up and it's honestly astounding that they haven't canceled it yet, and definitely not surprising that so many people are refusing it:

1. They are forcing people to pay thousands of dollars for a 3-night stay in airport hotels that normally cost $100-200 per night. In practice, the only difference between a regular stay and a ""quarantine"" stay is the delivery of really terrible food to the room. In many cases the fine the police are imposing is less than the cost of the hotel. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the owners of these hotels had some back-door agreements with our federal government given how outrageous the economics of this program are.

2. There is already a mandatory 14-day home quarantine upon returning to the country, which the vast majority of people have been following.

3. The hotels themselves are crowded and busy, making it more dangerous to stay there than to go straight home.

4. It's been a logistical disaster, with some people showing up only to find out there is no room for them and having to spend an entire day getting fucked over and moved around to different hotels until they can find one with  a room.

5. The whole point of the hotel quarantine is supposed to be so you can get a negative PCR test before going home, but Canada already requires a negative PCR test on arrival anyways and they're forcing people to stay all 3 nights even if their test result comes back negative after 1 night.

This is one of those cases where the policy was implemented for political theatrics and the people who are actually impacted by it are faced with the choice between conforming or doing what is actually intuitively more safe and rational to them.

Also, there is no hotel quarantine for people who enter via the land border with the USA, so the true number of people who are bypassing this is actually more than than the 200 quoted in this article.

On March 7, 2021, while being interviewed on CNN by Jake Tapper, Dr. Anthony Fauci stated, "" “I’ll just pick a number even though there’s not a good model there yet, but I would say less than 10,000 and maybe even considerably less than that.”   He also stated that he would like to see ""a substantial proportion"" of the population vaccinated.   As we are currently seeing an average of 70K cases per day in the US, we are not even close to it being safe to lift restrictions in all states.  We also do not know with 100% certainty what effect the new variants will have on cases, severe cases, or deaths just yet.  We can speculate based on limited data we have thus far, but we are still going to have to watch and wait as more states open up and remove mask requirements.   

The biggest danger I can see is that when governors remove mask mandates and reopen, they fail to also ensure that the public knows that the virus did not go anywhere.  It's still there. Hence the upticks we are seeing in several states and the large surge in Michigan.   Governors are relying on citizens to be responsible and wear a mask and distance on their own without being mandated to do so.  Some do, and some don't.   As long as the virus is allowed to spread, there will continue to be mutations.  We've seen this play out already.

The video you posted is common political theater.  Those questioning Fauci could have found the same quote I did from March...or the time he said the same thing in August of 2020, warning that we had to get below 10,000 before the holidays to avoid a holiday surge.  We didn't get there, and there was a surge.   They asked him for a direct number.  The best he has ever been able to give is somewhere under 10,000.  Why? Because no one knows an exact number.  Is it 9,456?  7,235?  We don't know.  The best he, or anyone, can guess is ""under 10,000"".

What finally worked for me was getting to know and trust the nurse administering me the shot.  I usually strike up a conversation, then look away from them and ask them to do the injection without giving me any advance warning.  I’ll be having a 2-3 minute conversation with them getting ready for the shot, and then..... it’s over.  It happened without me even thinking it would happen yet.  I realized after the fact that squirming was actually what made it hurt - the anticipation was way worse than the actual shot, and moving around is what caused more pain during the injection.  Without it, it’s really just a mild poke.

I totally get that panic attacks aren’t just a “look away” situation!  I’m just saying that your best bet is to lay out the situation to a doctor or pharmacist and have them plan a longer amount of time for you so they can help you through the process.  

Bonus points if you can find a pediatric nurse - they’re super familiar with working with kids who are fearful;  I volunteered at a clinic with one and she was *amazing*.

Important to know, because as it stands currently, nothing is stopping a new surge later this year in these rural areas with low uptake if uptake is not gonna increase.

Instead they put in place an inconsistent and scientifically unsound measures. For example they closed cafes and restaurants (except for take away) but kept open places like barbers and salons and many nonessential shops. 

They introduced a curfew meaning people were forced to shop for essential (and nonessential!) items during a compressed timeframe leading to busier shops. This also meant everyone was to remain indoors from 6pm which lead to more people going to other people’s houses in secret. 

As these measures have been in place for 6 months more and more people ignore the no house mixing rules and continue to do so now we are starting a harder lockdown. 

A lot of businesses returned to the office as it was only a week ago they were told they should only be in the office if absolutely needed. 

I have a son so I appreciate the need for schools to be open but now they have had to shut them anyway as predicted. 

The vaccination effort has been poor but not just because of the EU. It was overly complex to get a vaccine to begin with requiring a doctor visit among other things as they followed their usual vaccination process rather than an emergency one. 

Also I feel in part because of Brexit they relied too much on the EU as some kind of “see the EU is great” middle finger to the U.K. rather than taking things under control for themselves which they could have done. 

France also has a huge antivax problem and it seems little is being done to fix that. I don’t know anyone here who has been vaccinated whereas my whole family in the U.K. have been. Sadly all of the people I know here who can have vaccinated now have refused it!

I tested positive today. I received my first Pfizer shot on 18 March. My second was last Thursday. However my exposure was roughly around April 1-3. After my second shot I had the extreme fatigue last Friday but woke up Saturday with what we thought was a cold/upper respiratory infection. I showed and felt zero symptoms when I received my second shot. We just traced back to April 1-3 as a guess for the exposure date.








My girlfriend had, what we thought then was a cold, start last Sunday. So I assumed I caught that. But words cannot express how awful I felt last weekend. We thought it was the perfect storm of a combination of vaccine side effects and the cold.








I worked from home all week thankfully. But last night after continuing to show symptoms including shortness of breath, a few episodes of the “brain fog” and a hellacious cough and congestion I decided to go get tested today.








The urgent care clinic doc was baffled that I’d been vaccinated but still contracted COVID. So now I wonder how this relates to my second shot. And hopefully I continue to improve with the symptoms.








My girlfriend was at the hospital getting her shot today when I found out I was positive.

The number of bats needed in Asia was much fewer than in Africa, which again required fewer than Europe. It didn't test the Americas or Oceania, but I wouldn't be surprised if the Americas especially had even fewer than the tested continents given the distance from Asia.

All speculation, but it actually fits pretty neatly with what we've seen, and would explain the huge difference between India and Brazil (although I'm sure age is also a portion).",,,1618550241,{},guoy327,False,t3_mrqgic,False,True,t1_guofow9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mrqgic/covid_is_much_deadlier_in_brazil_than_india_and/guoy327/,1618557925,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953620306456

It's a bit of a read but the bullets get right to the crux of it: long covid is not a clinical observation, it's a patient-made illness. It has no actual root in medicine. You might say ""well all of these anecdotes can't be wrong"", but they absolutely can, that's also well documented by the Asch Line Study: https://practicalpie.com/asch-line-study/ which illustrates the influence that social pressure/narrative has on people's very perception of reality. This needs to be kept in mind when discussing long covid, since the data source is relevant.

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20214494v1.full Here's another article that actually quantifies long term covid symptoms (methods of data collection were again just a phone app where people could list symptoms, not an actual evaluation from a physician). They found that 2.3% claimed to experience symptoms lasting longer than 12 weeks. Of this 2.3% the overwhelming majority were above the age of 50. The most common long term symptoms were headache and fatigue.

This isn't to dismiss the concept of long term covid symptoms entirely. There are long term complications associated with many viruses that we already live with, there's no reason to think that covid is any different, nor is it a basis to claim that covid is unique in this sense and should be treated as such.

All of the vaccine trials measured your chance of Getting Covid once you have the vaccine versus your chance of getting Covid without getting the vaccine. This is what they mean by saying 5% ineffective. But it is a very different number  than just saying your overall risk of getting Covid once your have the vaccine. Basically, this 95% number is *not* your overall risk. It is how much does the vaccine reduce risk of a normal person walking around and encountering people with Covid. 

If I recall correctly, the overall risk of getting Covid after getting the vaccine was actually 0.04%. So it makes sense that they are now finding the percent infected post-vaccine that is somewhat close to 0.04%. 

I get that this is complicated and could be confusing to many people. But these are different numbers. If you want to learn more, he 95% number is called an odds-ratio. Here is a good [source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.livescience.com/amp/covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-explained.html) that maybe can explain this whole vaccine thing better than I can. 

Another example; (While this isn’t quite the same thing, it might help some people understand a different way efficacy can be calculated). When they say hormonal birth control is 97% effective, that doesn’t mean that 3 times out of a hundred that you have sex you will get pregnant (Imagine!). The statistic looks at 100 “couples” who have sex numerous times over the course of a year. Of those couples having sex throughout the year many times, 3 will get pregnant sometime that year.",,,1618553706,{},gup2gke,False,t3_mrnyb0,False,True,t1_gunp8z6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mrnyb0/cdc_identifies_small_group_of_covid19_infections/gup2gke/,1618560059,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Transmission through air has a specific meaning in infectious diseases, which is that the virus is transmitted via small droplets that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time. It's widely believed that while this is possible with Covid, the vast majority of transmission occurs by way of larger droplets that quickly fall onto a surface and transmission only occurs if there's someone immediately present to inhale these droplets before they fall. 

This piece published in the Lancet argues that the primary form of transmission is in fact these smaller droplets that could remain in the air for hours after the infected person has left.

Here is the [CDC scientific brief on airborne transmission,](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/scientific-brief-sars-cov-2.html) and here is [the article in the Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2821%2900869-2).

Efficacy is a measure of the effective risk *reduction* relative to others. 

Imagine a hypothetical world where the vaccinated population only had .008% infections like read hear... but the unvaccinated population had .005% infections. This would imply that the vaccine has *negative* efficacy (obviously impossible) even though the *absolute risk* of infection is low. 

This is the fundamental issue that people don't understand when it comes to vaccine efficacy. In Israel, for example, an unvaccinated person today (assuming the disease spread was homogenous, which it is not because of some sub-population that are anti-vax) is at lower risk of catching the disease than a vaccinated person would have been at the peak of their spread. Cases are down 98%, so the exposure risk is down 98%, which is actually *more* than the efficacy of the vaccines themselves. 

This is why herd immunity is so important. If a disease is spreading widely in an endemic population, risk remains for vaccinated individuals as well.

Notes:

* Data from [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) and exact totals for every age group can be downloaded as a CSV.  The site provides a graph of this data over time.  While the graph title says it is by ""Date Administered"", the data more closely represents doses by ""Date Reported"".
* Changes are calculated on unrounded numbers and may differ from rounded percentages.
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC source due to lack of age-related vaccination data, so data does not match national totals.
* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group. The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, and assumes that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17 since no vaccines are currently approved for use under age 16.

Again, if it's that simple then let's look at Colorado. 6 million people live in the state and 3 million people have received at least one dose. A large portion of the unvaccinated people are children or people living far away from the dense urban areas (Denver, Fort Collins, Colorado Springs) and of course those who are holding out. Why is the number of cases surging? There is no simple answer to that, unless there are a ton of break-through cases, the vaccine isn't working as efficiently as we are told, or the new case data is incorrect or skewed.  


I want to be very clear, I'm pro-vaccine and I think conspiracy theories are fucking stupid; but there's something that just doesn't add up that if cases are flaring up like crazy and vaccines are being distributed like crazy too. People aren't THAT lax that they're going out and hanging out with friends the day of receiving the vaccine.

Look at Israel's daily case graph. Their earliest steady, uninterrupted decline of daily cases began Feb 8. At that point they had 68 doses per 100 people. Chile JUST reached 64 doses per 100 people - and now there are way more variants floating around as a % of total infections. We know for a fact that the vaccines are at least somewhat less effective against the variants. Also, with an expected VE being 15% lower than the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine, you'd expect the decline to not be as pronounced or start later as well. Not to mention that Chile's vaccination campaign really took off mid-March - again, check the slope. Considering all of these factors, you would expect cases to continue rising in Chile for at *least* until the end of April.

I fully agree. It's the sad reality that we live in a world divided into nations though. Vaccine nationalism makes too much sense in the current geopolitical context.

2)R(t) is the reproduction number for any given date (t). R0 is the reproduction number at day zero (the beginning of the outbreak where it is unknown, there is no restrictions for it and obviously no community-wide immunity/antibodies). So you cannot reduce R0 to below 1, but you can reduce R number at the given moment.

3) Your R number estimate for that moment to be below 1 shows that, at that time, infections are slowing. It does not guarantee it will go that way, it can be due to vaccines, restrictions, personal precautions and seasonality etc.. You can only understand if vaccines are enough when you lift all the restrictions and you observe R is still below one. You can forecast R for future, but as you might have seen, forecasts are almost always wrong.

Yes, there will be breakthrough infections after vaccination — however, the number will be quite low. We know that vaccinated people are less likely to transmit covid. The vaccines under FDA authorization provide 100% protection against death and critical illness.

Your percentages related to infection rate are a bit off, as well. Using your 89% efficacy percentage, it does not mean that the grandparents have an 11% chance of getting covid upon exposure. It means they have an 89% reduced chance of contracting covid. For instance, the attack rate of covid within a household (ie: one spouse gets covid) is around 40%. If even a household member catches covid, the vaccinated person would have a 40% -89% chance of becoming infected at all, not an 11% chance of getting the disease because covid does not have a 100% attack rate. 

Only you can decide what’s best for your family situation. For now, and probably for the foreseeable future, allowing vaccinated adults around your children is very likely as safe as you can get, unless you want to completely sever contact with anyone outside your household.

She made a joke about how all men are like that, and said she was already done with the shot and was putting a bandage on it. Literally didn't feel a prick, sting, or anything at all.

The side effects are definitely real, but pretty manageable (and not everyone gets them). I woke up the next morning with a low fever, fatigue, mild headache and soreness at the injection site. That lasted 36 hours, which seemed like an eternity at the time, but it was just a normal immune response. If you have the luxury of being able to take a day off work, I would do so.

However, I had real COVID about a month and a half ago -- that was way worse. Didn't need to be hospitalized, but it was 7 days of feeling like absolute shit, and I had brain fog and lingering issues up until just a week or two ago.

Ideally in the long term I'd like to believe that potential mutations could result in more resilient but less deadly variants of Covid surviving if it turns into a constant recurring ""seasonal"" disease similar to the Flu but honestly I admit we have no concrete evidence to support that being the likely scenario.

Question is, if it is illegal or not, there is this best effort clause which is a little big fishy both sides see it differently.

But anyway, AZ basically lost the entire EU for their booster shots with their shennanigans.

People will get Pfizer/Moderna whatever but not AZ in autumn and the upcoming season. Cross vaccination seems to be safe enough, Germany just has approved it for the younger people who got their first shot with AZ to get the second jab from Biontech/Pfizer.

Given that the EU probably would have had to pay a lot more to AZ for the boosters (the first shot was basically self cost, upcoming boosters not, to my knowledge). AZ has lost billions in the long term with their strategy.

Not to mention that they tanked their reputation as reliable partner for upcoming other things! This will be remembered for a long time even in other regions!

They basically lost the entire potentially high paying first world except Great Britain on this one! Every drug dealer on the street is businesswise more intelligent than the AZ management, as it seems to me!

And this has nothing to do with the reported blood clot issues, it is just that they were not a reliable partner and constantly dropped their shipment estimates while others always delivered on time with production from EU soil, sending the local politicians here into a corner they never wanted to be in the first place!",,,1618552433,{},gup0w65,False,t3_mr7jid,False,True,t1_gumujim,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mr7jid/oxfordastrazeneca_covid_vaccine_research_was_97/gup0w65/,1618559290,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Now their numbers are as high as 200,000, with their testing rates under 1/1000 as their new all time high. That rate is lower than the US has since around April of last year, and a rate around 400% lower than the US’s average over a full year, with India having 400% of the population. 

I remember a story of 1 man in a city testing positive in a major city early on in the pandemic, he was told to quarantine. Few days later they had 40,000 suspected cases, but no testing, not that testing would have mattered. It sounded exactly like the Albany, GA situation, where hospital capacity went from sub-5% to overcapacity within 48 hours with suspected cases, no testing, because Atlanta had all the prioritized testing, and media coverage. There was little reporting on such anomalies at the time.

India has almost certainly had 1m+ daily infection averages over the course of months, with multimillion infection daily averages for sustained periods as well. They just never had testing to prove how bad it really was. I’d be surprised if they had any less than a quarter-billion infections. I’d imagine it’s closer to a half billion. 

I don’t like the idea of being 23 and getting vaccinated in the US, while already getting extremely mild-covid in August no less, meanwhile there’s hundreds of millions if not billions of people globally who need it more than me. I hate it really.

I don’t know why the US makes itself out to be a world leader while simultaneously hanging everyone else out to dry. We’re vaccinating TEENAGERS at greater risk from the flu.

&gt; No nest protection against SARS-2 for newborns. There is even another interesting observation in children. In children, especially in young children, we have very, very mild, almost always asymptomatic courses of SARS-2, while the newborns are apparently not so well protected against a SARS-2 infection. While we have a nest protection against all kinds of infectious diseases, which comes via antibodies from the mother, via the placenta and also a little bit via breast milk, by the way, our newborns are protected against many infectious diseases in the first year of life, we have the observation that newborn children are not well protected against SARS-2. Then from the first year of life, it's much better. That's when all of a sudden, the courses start to be asymptomatic. We have in this pattern, the contamination with the coronaviruses, so the small children from the first year of life get coronavirus infections. Before that, they're protected. And maybe that's where they build up their cross-protective T-cell response. That may be so, but none of that is proven now. These are all interesting lines of research to go after. And I think that's very important to know now, that maybe for this reason we have a good situation here in the younger ones. And that perhaps this old disease profile in SARS-2 is explained by the fact that we do have these cross-reactive T cells. But we have a situation that is not at all comparable with our state of knowledge, for example with influenza.

I don’t have those numbers, BUT, we do know that there have been over **5 million confirmed cases among the ~264M unvaccinated population** since Feb 1, when “full vaccinations” basically started.

For some kids all of this is fine. I happen to be 2 of those kids. My kids are not special. But they have thrived during this. Some things we do...

 schedules. Bed times and wake times should stay consistent even if there isn't anything to do all day. And always get dressed. 
Meals are all at the same time. 
Electronics are still limited. 
 don't play the news but we do talk about it. The news adds a lot of anxiety that we don't need to be caught up in. 
Unlike the government, do not to wish washy on the restrictions. Since the first set of stay-at-home orders, we have not gone back to normal. No one visits our house and we don't go to others. Kids can play at a park with friends. This consistency is easier on kids.

What scientists actually said was that they didn’t have the data to see if infections were truly curbed by the vaccine. That was many months ago though, and that has rapidly changed.

Most research at this point shows a pretty robust effect of the vaccine stopping infection, as well as spreading it.

As for “full immunity”, that’s not really a thing. A vaccine isn’t a magical shield against virus particles, but it is pretty effective (from what I’ve seen out of a study from Israel, 90%+ effective) from preventing infection.

However the effects of the vaccine and the masks stack. If you’re unlikely to get the disease when vaccinated, you’re even more so unlikely to get the disease when wearing a mask and vaccinated. So if your goal is either to prevent infection the most robustly you can, or slow the spread of COVID the most you personally can, then wearing masks even while vaccinated is a good step in that direction.

What I am saying is, it’s sad, and it’s tragic, but everywhere will be like Texas is now, half filled with antivaxers.. so the people making those numbers will be self inflicted. 

They really need to start reporting the numbers broken down by people who refused the vaccines. It would be stark, and people would realize if you got the vaccine then you are fine.

Unlike many other world leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has not made much of a fuss about the fact that she has now been vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, made by a British-Swedish manufacturer. 

The 66-year-old chancellor received the vaccine at the specially installed center in Berlin's former Tempelhof Airport, which is currently working exclusively with AstraZeneca, a vaccine that is only available to the over-60s in Germany, because of a marginal risk of blood clots. Around 3,000 people a day can currently receive a vaccination there. 

The vaccination was announced by her spokesman Steffen Seibert in a post on Twitter, with a simple photo showing her only her vaccination certificate.

Merkel said: ""I am delighted to have received my first vaccination today with AstraZeneca. I thank everyone who is involved in the vaccination campaign — and everyone who gets vaccinated. Vaccination is the key to overcoming the pandemic.""

Several times in recent weeks, the chancellor had been forced to answer the question of when she would be getting herself injected, and whether she would be taking AstraZeneca. Her response was always the same: ""When it's my turn, I'll get vaccinated, including with AstraZeneca."" She clearly knows what a sensitive issue the vaccination queue is, especially in Germany. 
Politicians in Germany have taken pains to avoid coming across as queue-jumpers, even if there's no reason why they shouldn't be allowed it — as in the case of the chancellor. 
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier also avoided fanfare when he was vaccinated at the beginning of April at a military hospital in Berlin: His office merely issued a photo and a press release, which confirmed that he too had been given the AstraZeneca. 

""I trust the vaccines approved in Germany,"" the 65-year-old Steinmeier was quoted as saying. ""Vaccination is a decisive step on the way out of the pandemic. Take advantage of the opportunities, join in."" 

In Baden-Württemberg's 72-year-old Premier Winfried Kretschmann, of the Green Party,  is so far one of the few German politicians who allowed TV cameras to be used when he was vaccinated in March. He also received the AstraZeneca vaccine and hastened to add that he had confidence in its effectiveness.",,,1618585652,{},guqd4jc,True,t3_ms5442,False,False,t3_ms5442,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ms5442/angela_merkel_gets_her_astrazeneca_covid_vaccine/guqd4jc/,1618587695,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I state I don't know because I heard both statements, ""you can spread while vaccinated"" and ""you cannot spread while vaccinated"". The argument that you could still spread it was at the very beginning of vaccinations and was a reason as to why you have to still wear a mask. They stated due to how the vaccine was being administered or something to that extent that the virus could technically be in your nose for a period of time until your antibodies killed it, so during that time you could spread it. Whereas if they developed the vaccine a different way then the antibodies would already be near your nose to kill said virus right out the gate.

Sinovac, the mainland Chinese manufacturer of the other vaccine available in Hong Kong, had said its doses should not be given to pregnant women. 

William Chui Chun-ming, president of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists, said the public should not jump to conclusions before investigations were completed. 

“Pregnant women, who have unstable chronic diseases such as high blood pressure or diabetes, would be more at risk of the severe adverse effects from Covid-19 vaccinations, just like everyone else with those diseases,” he said.

“But under certain circumstances, pregnant women may want to get vaccinated as it has been proven that the protection also extends to the baby.”

The Hong Kong College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists had previously said it did not recommend “routine Covid-19 vaccination” for pregnant women due to the lack of adequate clinical data on safety for this group.

It added that those who might be at high risk of developing severe complications because of underlying medical conditions should discuss with their obstetricians before taking the jabs. 

As of Tuesday, 8.2 per cent of Hong Kong’s 7.5 million residents had received their first jab since the inoculation programme began in late February, while 4 per cent have completed two doses. ",,,1618597348,{},gur476h,False,t3_ms95sv,False,True,t1_gur42yy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ms95sv/coronavirus_two_pregnant_women_in_hong_kong_who/gur476h/,1618603432,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In a statement released on Wednesday evening, the Department of Health revealed it had received the first reports of miscarriages following immunisation since the coronavirus vaccination drive kicked off about two months ago. 

“Currently, there is no evidence indicating that the two cases were related to vaccination,” the statement said. 

In one of the cases, a 32-year-old woman was treated at Queen Mary Hospital on Sunday for vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal pain. She suffered a miscarriage on the same day, with the dead fetus found to be around 23 to 24 weeks old.

The statement also said “the woman could not give a clear account of her pregnancy information”.

She had received a dose of the German-made BioNTech vaccine at St Paul’s Hospital Community Vaccination Centre on Thursday. There was no record of her complaining to feel unwell during observation at the centre. Authorities also did not state if she had indicated to staff that she was pregnant.

The other case involved another 32-year-old woman, who confirmed her pregnancy on March 25, but sought medical treatment at the accident and emergency unit of Queen Elizabeth Hospital on March 31 due to vaginal bleeding. She was found to have had a miscarriage.

She had received a dose of the BioNTech vaccine at Choi Hung Road Badminton Centre Community Vaccination Centre on March 23.

A source said the patient in Queen Mary Hospital was in a stable condition, while the other woman had been discharged. 

The two cases came to light after a medical source told media about the incidents. The department said it had received the reports on April 12 and 8, raising questions over the delay in making them public.

The CDC also said people can’t get COVID if they’re vaccinated. The CDC is sometimes wrong.

There is no logical way to conclude that the chance of getting COVID from surfaces is 1 in 10,000. Think about how you would possibly calculate that.

If someone comes down with COVID, surfaces are immediately ruled out as the cause if they or anyone else in their household ever leaves the house. It is always instead presumed that they were infected at the grocery store, for example. Of course, if no one leaves the house, there’s no COVID on the house’s surfaces.

There’s no feasible way to measure the odds of catching COVID from surfaces without deliberately contaminating people’s hands and having them touch their eyes, nose, and mouth. This will likely never happen because of the severity of the disease.

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/pentagon-covid-microchip-blood-virus-b1830372.html?amp

I think the governments are concerned about having more control over us than us being healthy and they've used this to their advantage. 

In the UK, the government counted covid deaths by any death that occurred within 28 days of testing positive. By boosting the numbers they're creating more fear and people are more likely to comply. 

Do you think it would be fair to count death by covid vaccine as any death within 28 days of receiving a vaccine?

We still dont know the long term effects the jab will have on us. 

In the late 50s a morning sickness pill named Thalidomide was promoted for women and was believed to be safe. It became apparent  that it was actually causing the children to be born with disabilities. -

The ""best"" part is it was available for 7 years!?!
 
A similar scenario could happen with this jab and with the UK government granting immunity from legal prosecution to the ""vaccine"" developers, it seems like they've prepared for that. -

If you we'ren't informed of the above then please do have a read through it. And for anyone else reading this, I only wish to provide a different viewpoint of the situation we're all in. I want this to be over and back to normal just as much as the rest of you but, as you'll all eventually realise, it's never going to go back to ""normal"".

Caveat and i dont want to come off as mean in anyway—i am a med student myself and i sincerely appreciate our frontline workers and especially our nurses. Yall the true heroes. However i am in my last yr and am not working in the hospital currently. Our friends gf is amazing, however I am worried abt inviting her bc she works on a covid floor. And i know vaccines and ppe work—my only hesitancy is two months ago i worked in the same hospital as her on the same floor. So i had an inside view and honestly i avoided seeing any fam when i worked bc i was nervous abt it, even vaccinated.

What to do? Obviously it seems wrong to be discriminatory but my vaccinated grandparents are attending this. Thank u for ur help!

Example, a friend of mine became ""fully vaccinated"" two days ago. He's counted in that number of someone who is fully vaccinated and didn't get COVID because of it.

Which makes no sense. Lets assume that he got COVID the very second that he was considered ""fully vaccinated."" Well, he would still count as someone who was protected from getting COVID, because two days is not long enough for the symptoms to show, then get tested, and for that result to be counted.  And again, that's if he got infected the very first moment.   

Obviously, the short time scales we are looking at haven't allowed a lot of people to get COVID even if the vaccine did nothing. Most people who are fully vaccinated haven't been so for very long, due to the time that it takes to become fully vaccinated and that daily vaccination numbers are higher now than a few months ago. 

And that's not even taking into account other stuff like that the demographics of people who got early vaccines are different than the general population, etc.

They want to start seeing some family indoors who are not taking the pandemic seriously at all.

My worry is that even vaccinated, with enough exposures to Covid 89% lower risk of catching the virus will still put them at real risk.

Here are the relevant paragraphs from the study:

&gt; Discharge data from 869 medical facilities that contributed inpatient and emergency department encounters to the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release (PHD-SR) (release date, December 9, 2020), an administrative all-payer database capturing approximately 20% of US hospitalizations,3 were used to describe patients 18 years or younger who had an inpatient or emergency department encounter with a primary or secondary COVID-19 discharge diagnosis from March 1 through October 31, 2020.

and

&gt; Among 20 714 pediatric patients with COVID-19, 10 950 (52.9%) were girls, 11 153 (53.8%) were aged 12 to 18 years, 8148 (39.3%) were Hispanic or Latino individuals, 5054 (24.4%) were non-Hispanic Black individuals. Among these patients with COVID-19, 6047 (29.2%) had 1 or more chronic conditions (Table).

&gt; Among the cohort of 2430 pediatric patients (11.7%) who were hospitalized with COVID-19, 756 (31.1%) experienced severe COVID-19. An increased association of severe COVID-19 was observed among patients with 1 or more chronic conditions vs those with none (AOR, 3.27; 95% CI, 2.44-4.37); in children aged 2 through 5 years or 6 through 11 years vs those aged 12 through 18 years (AORs, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.11-2.13 and 1.53; 95% CI, 1.04-2.23, respectively); and in male vs female patients (AOR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.26-1.83) (Figure). There was no statistically significant association between race/ethnicity or insurance type and severe COVID-19.

In other words, among children who had inpatient and emergency department encounters, 12% were hospitalized with covid-19.  This is *not* the same as ""Study finds 12% of US children with COVID-19 are hospitalized,"" and you don't need to take my word for it, since you can look at the article yourself.

And even one very unfriendly lady was not wearing a mask and they just ""reprimended"" her. No fine, anything. And she didnt wear a Mask the full 15-20 min the train took to arrive.

But most of the J&amp;J shots in the US had been given in just the past few weeks. Basically after the first big wave of vaccinations they had 7 side effects including one death. If that is all there ever is then the risks may be ok. But if they find out that there were a lot more, then that might be a different story. So unfortunately they have to pause and let this play out.

With AstraZeneca I think they have found a total of 79 cases and the blood clots look similar between the two. This makes me think there will be more J&amp;J blood clots. This is still very rare, 4 in a million, but is more than 4x what they've found with J&amp;J.

It is also true that you are more likely to get a blood clot from covid than the vaccine. But that risk is highly skewed to a certain population, primarily the elderly and people with certain conditions. So you could say that they should still be vaccinated because the risk is much less. 

But for younger healthy people, the risks of getting sick from covid are also a lot lower. For some, it's 1 in a million, the same as the J&amp;J blood clots. This to me is a little less cut and dry. And this is the decision that some countries have made to give the AZ vaccine only to older people because they are more vulnerable. This may be what eventually happens in the US.

It is very frustrating and I was hoping that the J&amp;J vaccine was going to put the nail in the covid coffin but after thinking about it I do think that ""pausing"" for a little bit makes sense.",,,1618575064,{},guprjus,False,t3_mrxsv4,False,True,t1_gupnxmo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mrxsv4/daily_discussion_thread_april_16_2021/guprjus/,1618575076,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I’m not sure if you’ve heard but this year’s freshman University of California system round was the most diverse class in the history of the system. 

This was in large part because they stopped using test scores to determine who they’d accept. Anecdotally I have heard of two straight A seniors, a white boy and an Asian/white girl who have tons of extracurriculars and looked like shoe ins, at least for B tier schools. They applied to many top schools like Cal and UCLA but also B tiers and one safety school each. Both of them were denied from every decent school. One got into UC Merced, the laughing stock of the UC system and the other got into an international school. Anecdotes aren’t facts but these kids were destined for decent schools before the pandemic. 

The upshot from the UC system’s perspective is that they’ve been able to shove through people that largely would have been ignored before. This has been seen as a great win for black and Latino students who aren’t prepared for real college classes. Because their admissions are based on GPAs, you’re going to see kids who were the top of their class in underperforming South Central LA schools where an A means nothing, get thrown into classes like Trigonometry which they have no business being in.

First of all, you can’t rely on the numbers today. Immunity kicks in 2-3 weeks after the first dose. So you have to look at the number of people given their first dose 2-3 weeks ago to get the real numbers. 

Secondly, you have to remember that many states have used age banding for vaccine eligibility. So those who were vaccinated 2-3 weeks ago are likely older. 

This is significant for two reasons. First, the vaccines are slightly less effective in elderly populations. Second, this allows us to look at age related data and see where the surge is happening. 

Let’s look at Vermont. Vermont has very high vaccine uptake and a very strict age banding system. They did not open it to any essential workers except teachers and medical workers, and only offered it to them after all people over 65 had the opportunity to be vaccinated. So, unlike states that had a variety of ages being vaccinated early, we can actually see age banding at work in Vermont. 

Take a look at Vermont’s weekly Covid update: https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-Weekly-Data-Summary-4-9-2021.pdf

If you go to page 33, you’ll see the vaccine at work. The data shows that during the pandemic, all age bands were approximately equally impacted at approximately the same time. 

As I mentioned, Vermont was very strict on age banding (with minor exceptions). Here’s the calendar for the dates that Vermonters were eligible to make an appointment (vaccines often followed several weeks after the appointment was made):

Thursday, March 25: 60 and older
Monday, March 29: 50 and older
Monday, April 5: 40 and older
Monday, April 12: 30 and older
Monday, April 19: 16 and older

I was unable to find the exact dates for 65+, 70+, and 75+, but I believe it was about a two week window between each group, and high risk conditions also was in there at some point. 

What’s useful about this data is we know that Vermonters 60 and older, at the very earliest saw their first dose around April 1. This means they saw the first benefit of immunity around April 14th. 

So if we go back to the chart I linked above, we can see in real time this strategy playing out. As the third surge hits, all age groups go up—except the 70+ range. Furthermore, we can see one population that is surging hard right now—the 20-29 range, which did not become eligible to make appointments until this week, and likely won’t see a first dose for at least a week if not more. That age band is what is driving numbers right now.

To quote the document:

&gt;	The rate of COVID-19 among those 70+ is nearly three times less in March 2021 than it was in December 2020. The rate among 20- to 39-year-olds and age 19 and under have increased.

&gt;	We can see the positive impacts of the vaccination efforts on the age groups that have had the opportunity to get vaccinated. Approximately 90% of Vermonters 70+ have received at least one dose of vaccine.

That is really significant: the rate of COVID in a population that is likely to see the least benefit of the vaccine is nearly 3 times less in the third surge vs. the second one. 

In short, the surge we are seeing now is being driven by a combination of increased disease in younger populations who have not had time to receive the vaccine and reach their 14-21 day immunity point along with vaccine hesitancy depressing uptake.",,,1618594614,{},guqxzhm,False,t3_mrk2ro,False,True,t1_guqfghr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mrk2ro/us_administers_1983_million_doses_of_covid19/guqxzhm/,1618599929,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The study's results show that having had COVID is almost as effective (80%) as the mRNA vaccines (95%) at preventing future infection, and *better* than the adenovirus vaccines (60-70%).  That's actually not a very strong argument that people who have had COVID *must* get vaccinated.

With the mRNA vaccines in plentiful supply, sure, we can afford to vaccinate everybody, including the previously infected, and it appears that it will provide some additional benefit.  But spinning the facts will be seen through, and statements like ""The findings make a strong argument for healthy young Americans to get vaccinated, according to researchers"" are spinning the facts here.

Maybe you don't know the history of dental dams. In the 80's when everyone was still scrambling to figure out how HIV was transmitted, condoms were pushed pretty hard among the gay community. Lesbians felt a little left out so the experts (yes, Fauci was somewhat behind this then too) recommended they use dental dams.

The CDC did so without asking several important questions about dental dams--it was pure knee jerk.

1) Is HIV transmitted via oral sex? (The answer is we now know is that is possible but extremely, extremely rare.)

2) What is the prevalence of HIV among lesbians? (The answer again is extremely low.)

3) Can someone even feel pleasure through a dental dam? (Doubtful, but the CDC still hasn't researched this.)

And yet, here we are 30 years later, with pages dedicated to dental dam usage, it still showing up in sex ed courses, but it's nearly impossible to find them or find someone who actually uses them.

HIV is 100% lethal disease when not treated. It is a very serious disease. The CDC was mostly in the right to think about everyone being protected even if the risk and actual practicality was zero. That's their job. If they're not busy worrying about us, what are they doing?

But they also have an entry on why one shouldn't eat raw cookie dough too. And yet, you probably eat raw cookie dough. You are absolutely correct in saying it's their job.

The chancellor's tasks are mostly setting up the cabinet (which would still be up and running) &amp; setting general policy tasks. The chancellor does have ""Richtlinienkompetenz"", so they can set legally binding formal guidance for the policies. But the ministers are also able to supervise their ministries &amp; their operations independently, set their own legislation (as long as they adhere to the broad guidelines), this is the ""principle of ministerial autonomy"". Any disputes between the ministries are also to be settled within the cabinet, which would still be active. Essentially the chancellor decides how they want their cabinet to look (so how many ministers, what topics etc.), sets general guidelines and then supervises and tries to guide, mostly. They're not involved with the day to day running. 

If it happened, the President would probably ask the vice-chancellor (Olaf Scholz, currently finance minister, also one of the candidates for the election in October) to take over in a short term solution.

Risk is actually determined by what's called a Bayesian process.

But that fails to take into account the risk of dying from COVID-19 after receiving the vaccine versus dying from COVID-19 having not received the vaccine. 

It's kind of like looking at how risky it is to die in a high speed street race when you're wearing a seatbelt versus not wearing a seatbelt. If you look at the risk of death from those wearing a seatbelt, then the overall odds probably aren't reassuring. But if you look at the death rate of the population of street racers versus the people who don't street race, then the issue of the seatbelts doesn't matter or more. Seatbelt or no, you're prior probability of dying in an automobile crash is a lot lower if you don't street race. This is similar to the vaccine.

&gt;The data to answer the question of whether vaccinated people can still spread the virus are just now being collected.

How can you spread a virus if you've been vaccinated?

&gt;All the COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine candidates under consideration for use in the U.S. rely on bits of genetic material or virus protein — not anything that could grow into an active SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19.

&gt;The concern instead with the COVID-19 vaccine is about whether you might still have an asymptomatic infection despite immunization — without symptoms, but able to shed virus.

Wear Masks To Protect Yourself From The Coronavirus, Not Only Others, CDC Stresses
SHOTS - HEALTH NEWS

&gt;Here's how that might work: Let's say you've been vaccinated and you encounter SARS-CoV-2. You're much less likely to develop symptoms — that's clear. But your immune system may not fight off the virus completely — it might allow some viruses to survive and reproduce and get expelled from your nose or mouth in a breath, cough or sneeze. Remember: No one can be sure yet if this actually happens or if it happens often enough that you'd be emitting enough active virus to sicken someone else.

I think the issue is that all our public health messaging for the last year was focused on staying at home as much as possible when we should’ve been educating people on how to maintain their health while balancing risks. We’re discussing this now rather than a year ago when the conversation could’ve made a difference. Remember last summer when news orgs published misleading pictures of crowded beaches as evidence that beachgoers were killing grandmas?

Along with the fact we didn't really know how to treat covid at the beginning of the pandemic when the trials started(and are still learning). The chance of the participants dying was too high.

So they ran an observation trial instead, with a control (placebo) and a test group where participants carry on with their normal lives and report if they get the disease or not. Then they wait until a predetermined number of people report infection (predetermined to prevent the trial being stopped early to show better results). After this they analyse how many of each group were infected and can work out the efficacy of the vaccine, if the efficacy is high enough the trial was successful and they apply for approval.

With some diseases these trials can take years, not many people get infected with rabies each year, but with covid *gestures vaguely at everything* the chance of infection was *much* higher, so the predetermined number of infections was reached earlier.

Yes, NBC creates a packaged 3 hour show for prime time that depending on time zones, may contain a lot of tape delayed stuff.

Virtually everything that they are going to show tape delayed on prime time can be obtained live through one of their channels or via online streaming.

It's a pandemic. It's not just about you and yours. It's about reaching herd immunity for all of us. And we're going to need to vaccinate a lot of kids to get there, otherwise the virus is just going to keep percolating through children, people who won't or can't get vaccinated for whatever reason, people with weakened immune systems, people who did get vaccinated but it just didn't work for them, etc. 

And the whole time it's going to be mutating, possibly growing better at breaking through the vaccinated population.

The only way to end the pandemic is to reach herd immunity through vaccinating as many people as we can, not just hitting most of the adults, calling it a day, and hoping for the best. The only way to get kids vaccinated is to test the vaccines on kids. Someone's gotta do it. 

I wish we had a trial near us. I'd sign my kids up in a heartbeat. It's not just about them, it's about everyone. Waiting any longer than necessary on getting the kids vaccinated is just prolonging the pandemic needlessly. Do the trials, get the data, make sure the vaccines are safe and the efficacy is high for EVERYONE, then get those rugrats their jabs ASAP.

It's the fastest, best way to actually ""get back to normal"" yet many of the people loudly clamoring for normalcy ASAP aren't willing to do any of the steps necessary to get us there properly because ""they're tired of it"" or scared of vaccines or whatever. 

So instead they'll just half-ass some of the measures, give up before we reach herd immunity, and then shrug and act confused when the pandemic drags on and on.

Currently we are receiving 2.5 M doses a week. This figure is set to increase to 3.4 M a week starting in the week of Apr 26, and 5.1 M doses a week in the last five weeks of the quarter (starting end of May).

In total, we will receive over 50 M doses in Q2, that's an increase of over 10 M compared to initial plans. The extra doses are from an early delivery of Q3 doses to the EU (10 M doses to the EU, of which Germany receives almost 2 M but donates 0.5 M to poorer EU countries with initial low BioNTech order), and from an early delivery of 50 M Q4 doses to the EU as recently announced, of which Germany receives about 9 M.

Additionally, we will receive about 8 M doses from Moderna and Curevac in Q2.

That's a total of almost 60 M doses of mRNA vaccine being delivered to Germany in Q2. 

Since the second doses are given 6 weeks after the first, these deliveries will amount to about 40 M people receiving at least one dose in Q2.
Together with the 10 M from Q1, that's 60 % of the population receiving at least one dose until the end of June *even if Astrazeneca and J&amp;J completely scrapped all deliveries from now*.

Since I think we can expect to get at least half the promised doses from AZ and J&amp;J actually delivered and into people's arms (given that we will run out of 60 year-olds in about a month from now), I think herd immunity three months from now or even sooner is realistic.

CBS News:

&gt; The analysis of real-world data collated by the global health research network TriNetX and European agencies included information on hundreds of thousands of people who either caught COVID-19, or who were given the AstraZeneca, Pfizer or Moderna shots. Most of the data on the mRNA-type vaccines, which are the American drugs, was from the U.S., while data on the AstraZeneca shots came largely from Europe's mass-vaccination programs.

&gt; The data showed that about 4 in every 1 million people who get the American-made vaccines experience cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), or blood clots in the brain. With the AstraZeneca vaccine, which works in a different way and is similar to the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot, the research showed an incidence rate of about 5 in every 1 million.

Keep in mind where I'm coming from on this too.  The risk of CVT from an actual COVID-19 infection is FAR greater.  The risk of CVT from a vaccine is very very small relatively.  I agree with you that it is important to understand the factors that lead to CVT from these vaccines, and I believe researchers are getting close, in that it could very well be related to the spike proteins themselves and another interaction they have with how platelets form.  What I don't agree on, is how these vaccines are being paused, which is causing more doubt about their safety for a lot of people who do not process their risks well...endangering them to make choices that might lead to them getting COVID instead, or spreading to people who are vulnerable.  It's a complex problem, and while there are some very minor risks, vaccination is absolutely necessary any way we can get that accomplished.

That said, I'll repeat again, I am not discouraging vaccination..just the opposite.  I am just disagreeing that a pause is helpful when all vaccines have this risk...and it could lead to another problem when Pfizer and Moderna are put under the same scrutiny, where people wonder why they were NOT paused if the risks are similar.  There are a host of other issues there too, like why the ones being paused are the smaller players in an industry that is likely to see significant price increases (both Pfizer and Moderna have expressed a desire to raise the price of their vaccines after this initial phase, whereas AZ had pledged to keep their vaccine at cost...and got pushed out).

https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm

&gt;Flu:
&gt;Typically, a person develops symptoms anywhere from 1 to 4 days after infection.

&gt;COVID-19:
&gt;Typically, a person develops symptoms 5 days after being infected, but symptoms can appear as early as 2 days after infection or as late as 14 days after infection, and the time range can vary.

My point here is that no one is saying oh my god, hide from it forever, and protect the weak, they're saying there is an easy solution here and that's taking precautions as a society until we have more people vaccinated. It's not even that much longer now, probably just a few months. 

The lockdown for Covid was necessary because even your average person can look at the numbers that died immediately from it, the overflow of all our hospitals, nursing homes, outbreaks in factories, etc, and conclude that it was wiping thousands (millions really)out. I do hope you remember how many died last year were far more than flu ever kills in a year.  THAT is why lockdown was needed. Even non-immune compromised people were at risk.

I'm saying this as someone who took all my precautions extremely seriously in the past year, I think the lockdowns should end soon (I'm in Texas, it essentially has anyway). But that doesn't mean we go 'WHEEE who cares about some ways we can meet in the middle halfway as we transition, let's all do what we want, at risk people suddenly be damned!'. I think both sides need a bit of compromise and soon this will be as normal as flu because the majority out there will be vaccinated, the mutations will start to lessen, and the severity of the viral load if caught by anyone won't be enough to make even an immunocompromised person very sick at all.

The study, which involved almost 50,000 Californians who developed Covid, found that those who had been the most active before falling ill were the least likely to be hospitalized or die as a result of their illness.

The data were gathered before Covid vaccines became available and do not suggest that exercise can substitute in any way for immunization. But they do intimate that regular exercise — whether it’s going for a swim, walk, run or bike ride — can substantially lower our chances of becoming seriously ill if we do become infected.



Scientists have known for some time that aerobically fit people are less likely to catch colds and other viral infections and recover more quickly than people who are out of shape, in part because exercise can amplify immune responses. Better fitness also heightens antibody responses to vaccines against influenza and other illnesses.
But infections with the novel coronavirus are so new that little has been known about whether, and how, physical activity and fitness might affect risks for becoming ill with Covid. A few recent studies, however, have seemed encouraging. In one, which was published in February in The International Journal of Obesity, people who could walk quickly, an accepted gauge of aerobic fitness, developed severe Covid at much lower rates than sluggish walkers, even if the quick striders had obesity, a known risk factor for severe disease. In another study of older adults in Europe, greater grip strength, an indicator of general muscle health, signaled lowered risks for Covid hospitalizations.

But those studies looked at indirect measures of people’s aerobic or muscular fitness and not their actual, everyday exercise habits, so they cannot tell us if getting up and moving — or staying still — changes the calculus of Covid risks.
