Now, for the first time I was getting actual preferential treatment for my appearance, which with a mix of luck (blooming) and my hard work i was able to improve, only for faces to not existe anymore at all just in the time It was my turn to finally enjoy a social life? Its like waiting a long time for your turn in a game and watching as everyone else plays, only for they to say ""well times over"" just at the time it was going to be your turn. Its unfair, Its infuirating and its a huge ""haha you waited and worked for nothing"". Specially when it was an almost lifelong ""project"".

A mask mandate shielded me from many things. Outdoors mandate was lifted some days ago and a bit of people started showing their faces again (me being one of them). I started receiving looks of interest again for the first time in a year while with the mask I was fucking invisible. I also get treated a bit more cold than without the mask in stores and such but that will have to wait till the indoors mandates go aswell. I don't need therapy, I need my face back, and the fact that I instantly started getting things absent from my life since a year ago as soon as I could show my visage again proves it.

I am willing to get vaccinated and am going to go as soon as im called. I dont care how many vaccines I have to get or how many boosters, I just want masks out of society. but people seem to have developed a stockolm syndrome fucking love almost fetish tier for masks everywhere, I fear a lot in my country the people themselves pushing back for masks even when we are vaccinated. I am one of the very few who dropped the outdoors mask, and we have people saying they are willing to mask forever even after covid. I hope that is not the case but I fear society (at least in my country) having forever been tainted by masks.

I am how I am treated. I worked HARD to get a good treatment from people in my life for once and I don't deserve my work being wasted while everyone else who was not ugly in the past got to enjoy their former life and preferential treatment not being faceless. Who cares if I have my face if I have to cover it as soon as I go out? Its like having a car but never being allowed to get it out of the garage. I also have a very bad skinny body and narrow shoulders and my face was the only thing that countered it (and it did it well, i was happy overall), so I got extra fucked by the masks. Im no brad pitt or hot, but im above the average with features that stand out enough to compensate for my bad body. Only way out is having my face not covered again and no more outdoors mandates happening again, not therapy. I went to therapy for years when younger and the only thing that solved my life problems was to look better, therapy is a scam and a waste of time when your problems have practical solutions (like in my case, as I said, they were automatically solved by looking better).

Its not something simple as a mask. It was the most anticlimatic end to a DECADE long journey of effort, hope, perseverance hard work and money spent that made me self harm. It was a big ""HAHA YOU GOT CHEATED"" slapping a cover over all that I had finally achieved after so long, because got better teeth, mask covers it, got better jawline, mask covers it, got better skin, mask covers it, got masseter correction procedure, mask covers it, my cheekbones were visible now, mask covers it and so on...

Ultimately, however, both parties answer to the same masters: Wall Street, lobbyists, the MIC, and corporate donors.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Conservatism/Republicans have been far more damaging to this country for the past few decades and it's not really close.

Hmm. I'll agree with you based simply on the actions of Bush Jr. The wars and military adventures in the Middle East were extremely damaging to the US' image abroad and soft power, not to mention the loss of life and the economic damage to both the US and the countries the US invaded or bombed.

Of course, then came Obama. Elected on a clear mandate to reverse the worse of Bush' policies, he instead made drone bombing bipartisan rather than taking it off the table entirely. He also expanded the US' violent involvement to Lybia, Syria, and Yemen. 

And the Democratic base preferred to blindly support Obama, rather than holding his feet to the fire. So no, the Democrats are not much better. They had the opportunity to be better, but they squandered it in favour of blind partisan loyalty.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Have Democrat's been on board with some of this fuckery, yes- but if you do a legislative head count it's clear which party is on the side of obstructive legislative behavior and harmful policy decisions.

Sure. The Republicans are the worse of the two by both of our estimations 9though obviously Republicans would disagree). But the fact remains that both parties have failed to deliver, and it is not due to obstruction from the ***evil opposition***, but from the failure of the electorate to rise above petty partisan games and **hold their goddamned leaders accountable**.

The Democrat base showed the inability to hold Obama to account during the entirety of his administration, so forgive me if I do not sound sympathetic to their complaints.

Yes, of course.  If this does turn out to be the result of a procedural shortcoming or equipment malfunction, then we need to understand how to prevent that in the future.  That's why I said I'd like to have an answer some day.  But I want that answer to be the right answer, so I can wait for scientists to do their thing.

Do you think the current public debate on this subject is helpful to that goal or detrimental?  I think it's unhelpful (at best).

This same interview linked here was written about in the New York Post today with the headline ""Australian scientist who worked in Wuhan can’t rule out COVID lab-leak theory.""  That was the most meaningful sentence in this entire interview to them.  Confirmation bias at its finest.

My feeling (in case that isn't already obvious) is that the political hacks should stay out of it and leave this very important puzzle to the people who are actually quite good at solving puzzles.

OP, I don't mean any of my comments here to be a criticism of you or the link that you posted.  It was actually quite nice to read the POV of an actual scientist who was on the ground when all of this unfolded.

PHE shows that AZ has twice the hospitalisations of Pfizer, even when fully vaccinated. I don't see how/why you're calling that misleading. Yes, this is 4 and 8 respectively vs 100 unvaccinated, but _it's still twice_.

Further, all studies show that it has more infections, and therefore more potential spread also.

This makes for a compounding effect in subparness - if it reduces R\_eff less, you get more growth generation-to-generation as the virus is introduced to the community _and_ the lesser immunity (due greater hesitancy) compounds this further.

This means you need to vaccinate **more** people with AZ to provide any given level of community protection, allwhilst the negative press results in **less** people being vaccinated in total.

I don't see any way around this, but I do not feel that the Chief Health Officers advising the states to not recommend AZ for under 60s, nor ATAGI managing the National Immunisation Program are idiots here.

They have to manage _population wide health_.

This _includes the effects of hesitancy_.

There's unfortunately only so many times your population can hear ""died after taking the vaccine"", or ""lawyer now requires assistance to walk after strokes linked to vaccine"" before even more reasonable people start saying ""I'll wait"".

We have not had an Australian die of covid domestically all year that I know of. We see the amputations, the complications, the heartache it causes overseas etc - of course we do. But to be able to avoid those consequences here, we need 70%+++ to be vaccinated - and how can you do that if you have news of more than 1 death a month due ""the vaccine"" *?

It's short-term gain, a short-term boost to vaccination by those willing to get vaccines, at a cost of long-term reluctance by those already hesitance. It's a hard public health benefit argument to make.

&gt; Allocate vaccine brands based on blood-clot risk (it's not a uniform risk), vaccinate as many as possible as quickly as possible.

We're already doing that. AZ was for 50+ years old, we had a 52yo woman die (you can read about it [here](https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/2021/06/10/tga-astra-zeneca-clot-death/)), advice has changed to 60+. They're trying to manage hesitancy - but even then, we have 70yos being landed in hospital, and of course the press can't help but report on those either (ABC tries a ""feel good"" piece [here](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-06-29/garry-recovering-from-blood-clots-linked-to-astrazeneca/100252574)).

Raimondo told Reuters in an interview ""he asked for help in that regard, he has spoken to high level officials in the White House. We have responded and we definitely want to be a good partner and I do think it's helping.""

Taiwan said two weeks ago it will allow officials from Taiwan's Foxconn and TSMC to negotiate on its behalf for COVID-19 vaccines.

Mid-June the United States shipped 2.5 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to Taiwan, more than tripling Washington's previous allocation of shots for the island.

TSMC said in a statement to Reuters that they believed ""getting vaccines for Taiwan would help to protect the communities and ensure normal operations.""

Taiwan has been trying to speed up the arrival of the millions of vaccines it has on order as it deals with a rise in domestic cases, although infections remain comparatively low.

The request from TSMC, the world's biggest manufacturer of semiconductors on contract, coincides with a global chip shortage that has slowed production of manufacturers around the world, including in the U.S. auto industry where it is forecast the crisis will hit the production of 3.9 million vehicles. Raimondo has a key role in resolving the crisis for U.S. companies.

Although there has been no major impact so far on chip production in Taiwan since domestic cases began rising in the middle of May, some U.S. auto executives have told Reuters privately earlier this month they were concerned COVID-19 in Taiwan could impact the flow of semiconductors to U.S. factories.

Yes, and the UK is seeing countries close or restrict entries as a result - it's not a low risk environment (unless you're vaccinated). Even the US can't agree to allow free travel with the UK, from what [I'm seeing](https://onemileatatime.com/news/us-uk-travel-restrictions-unlikely-to-end/).

I was repeating another user, but their source was health.gov.au, [here](https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2021/06/covid-19-vaccination-atagi-clinical-guidance-on-covid-19-vaccine-in-australia-in-2021.pdf). 

Low risk environment is ""infection rate similar to first wave of COVID-19 in Australia"" and ""29 infections per 100,000 people in a 16-week period"". That's actually only 64 cases/day, by my calcs.

For medium risk, similar to Victoria's second wave, their model assumes 600 cases/day by my calcs.

&gt; So what you're saying here is that in this age group AZ will prevent more hospital admissions than blood clots...

&lt; 50 years is reported as highly uncertain due lack of data in those age groups. It seemed risky enough that they pulled it early.

&gt; Like I said, the best thing is at this point is to get vaccinated if you're not vaccinated,

If you're not in Australia, absolutely. Let me be clear: I'm only talking from a uniquely Australian perspective.

If it's at all endemic where you are, you want to be vaccinated - by literally any of the vaccines on the WHO list, and probably many that aren't. It's all better than nothing.

But in Australia, the main issue is that we truly do have a lot of supply of mRNA coming online in the coming months. Like, a _lot_.

AZ generates negative press. It has a long time between doses. _Despite_ limiting age brackets, it's still landed 14 people in ICU due TTS, and caused 2 fatalities this year.

14 in ICU - by comparison, Perth has had 0 hospitalised due covid, 0 deaths in 2021. Likely a few hospitalised from hotel quarantine, but not from the community. And no deaths.

Now this is all nothing compared to endemic covid. I know that, but this is just not a PR situation that can be turned around.

It's terminal. Pushing AZ on people is only increasing general hesitancy. Pushing it does not open the borders any sooner, due the mRNA supply coming online, along with the long time between shots for AZ.

It's just all costs, it's people in hospital/dead, and ultimately and genuinely - we don't see delta getting out of control here.

That may be foolish of us, but consider that I'm posting this from home due a 4 day snap lockdown over 3 cases, that has so far lead to 1 further case. That the most recent of those infections has been isolating since before his first negative test (second positive) due contact tracing.

The stats of the effort are just insane - 1 PCR test per 43 pop for this outbreak so far, over 2000 contacts identified, we've gone from a sold out football game (60,000 people) and literally zero restrictions to mask order and zero-spectator game same day. We monitor waste-water so it cannot accumulate, there's a lot of effective sentinel testing (fifo workers, quarantine workers)... it may come across as arrogance, but if it can beat all these measures, I truly fear for the world.

We really and truly agree more than we disagree. I just try to be pragmatic, and I cannot advocate for AZ any longer in these situations, _as they relate to Australia_. The hesitancy any further deaths would cause is just not worth it, because that hesitancy will likely kill far more than would be saved.",,,1625043999,{},h3jhthw,False,t3_oa6dyo,False,True,t1_h3jeh3m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oa6dyo/australias_top_medical_body_refuses_to_endorse/h3jhthw/,1625292995,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;	When someone is vaccinated against a virus, they are only exposed to a portion of that virus or a weakened version of it. When someone gets sick, they're exposed to the entire thing, meaning the immune response — and the symptoms that come with it — tends to be greater. In former COVID-19 patients, for example, ""natural immunity is to the entire virus surface and not just the spike protein,"" Dr. Marty Makary, chief of the Johns Hopkins Islet Transplant Center, told USA TODAY in an email.

We're in Minnesota and our vaccine rate is mid 60% fully taken the jab, meaning two dosages of either mRNA vaccine or one J&amp;J. We were hoping to hit 70% compliance by end of month but it ain't looking so great. I was telling them that I personally am wearing my mask anywhere I'm in doors and around peoples I don't know. I've decided I'm not going to give two shits what other people's do but for me, I live in a county on outskirts of metro area and it has low vaccine rate. The numbers aren't in my favor with that, nonvaccinated vs me. So, knowing only person I've got full control of is me so that's what I'm doing. My entire family has all gotten the shot, 99% of extended family as well. It's my niece and nephew that are younger than 12, 5 and 3, that I worry about a whole lot. Until they are green lighted to get vaccinated and there's adequate data to support it, we've (family and circle)  gotta do whatever we can to keep them safest.
My very bright and intelligent RN sister is all over the studies and data but again, your only able to control one's self. We agreed that you either take the necessary precautions or you don't get to hang around the two of them until theres protection available. Simple as that.

This variant is scary and deadly. It seems to be hitting kids harder than previous and with 12 and younger currently not eligible, that's scary. Personally, I'll continue wearing a mask until the data and the CDC tell me I shouldn't. I honestly don't mind it when running in a store or something. Basically there was no flu this past season. Why? Masks, social distancing, and proper hygiene. I thought that was awesome so will probably continue the trend next flu season regardless. To me it's about doing whatever little bits I can to help those around me. Reality is it will bounce around pockets of population that aren't vaccinated and there will be severe illness and death because of it. The small break through cases are less than 1% so the remaining 99% of new infections are from unvaccinated people. Nothing I say or do will change their minds so all I can do is me. It's going to be rough as hell for some communities and that sucks but those same communities are threatening the safety of the tiniest and smallest of us and to me, that's bullshit. I've already gotten shit for wearing my mask but ya know what? I could care fucking less. Avoid my 6ft safety bubble around me as I move swiftly to and fro, and all is golden. Your ignorant dribble doesn't get to me anymore but cross that threshold and become a threat... well, be handled like one. Empathy vs apathy. Informed vs uninformed and misguided. Crazy days.

To all of you there. Stay safe, stay smart and informed, and try to be Empathetic whenever able. Worlds a wild and gray place currently, every little bit of love and light help.

\- those who are worried about the vaccine affecting them medically to some degree.  My friend's wife won't let anyone in her family get vaccinated.  Why?  Because she got cancer a couple years ago, and doesn't know why (hint: I also have had a serious form of cancer, it's a cell mutation and nobody really knows what causes it).   So because it ""could have been a vaccine"" she took, now she won't take these because she's worried her cancer will come back in five years.   There's nothing anyone can say to prove it won't five years from now, so good luck.  She's a high-level exec, very intelligent, but this isn't work.

&gt; Vaccination with the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine produced neutralizing titers against all variants tested, including additional versions of the Beta variant (B.1.351, first identified in South Africa), three lineage variants of B.1.617 (first identified in India), including the Kappa (B.1.617.1) and the Delta variants (B.1.617.2); the Eta variant (B.1.525, first identified in Nigeria); and the A.23.1 and A.VOI.V2 variants first identified in Uganda and Angola, respectively. These data were submitted as a preprint to bioRxiv.

...

&gt; These most recent data include neutralization assays against additional variant strains. This additional analysis showed minimal impact on neutralizing titers against the Alpha and A.23.1 variants relative to those against the ancestral strain (D614G). This analysis also showed a modest reduction in neutralizing titers against the Delta (2.1-fold), Gamma (P.1, 3.2-fold), Kappa (3.3-3.4-fold), and Eta (4.2-fold) variants relative to those against the ancestral strain. Consistent with previous results, a 7.3 or 8.4-fold reduction in neutralizing titers was observed with the additional versions of the Beta variant relative to the ancestral strain. Additionally, an 8.0-fold reduction in neutralizing titers relative to the ancestral strain was observed with A.VOI.V2, the variant first identified in Angola, but currently not designated as a Variant of Concern or Interest.",,,1625071887,{},h3kusrp,False,t3_oaz13i,False,False,t3_oaz13i,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oaz13i/modernas_covid_shot_produces_antibodies_against/h3kusrp/,1625318032,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Not necessarily.

R0 is about what happens on average for the entire duration of a case.   The circumstances allowing a 10-second exposure to result in transmission may be a low-probability event that might only be possible in a limited fraction of cases or for a short duration during infection or both.

Look at the plots of viral shedding over time -- there's a peak around the time you become symptomatic, and then shedding falls off.   If 5% or 10% of cases are supershedders for a few hours at the peak of their viral shedding you'll see this happen from time to time but it's not going to drag R0 much higher.

Your first comment suggested that it doesn't matter if someone doesn't get vaccinated even though it's available, as long as they don't die. Since you're that narrow-minded, you've missed the further consequences as a result. This includes hospitalisations/comorbidities/long-term effects that exist (since it's not just deaths), passing it on to those who are vulnerable/unable to take the vaccine/those that are awaiting the vaccine/those that the vaccine has not been as effective on as well as allowing a greater opportunity for further spread and emergence of further variants.

The whole point of these vaccines, at this stage, isn't to get rid of the virus (it's likely here to stay), but to protect as many people as possible from all of the above. The way to do this is to maximise the number of people getting vaccinated, even the ones who are not vulnerable since they can still spread it and as mentioned above, creating further opportunity for new variants.

&gt; The company hopes to apply to the Food and Drug Administration in September for emergency authorization of the vaccine for children ages 5 to 11. Results for children aged 2 through 5 could be available soon after that, according to Kit Longley, a spokesman for Pfizer.
&gt;
&gt; Data from the trial for children between 6 months old and 2 years old could arrive in October or November, followed by a potential submission to the F.D.A. shortly thereafter, Mr. Longley added.

So there's three separate age groups that will have the data ready about a month apart.

&gt; ""The insurance must cover medical, travel and other related costs for COVID-19 should they test positive while on board,"" Royal Caribbean said in a statement provided by spokesperson Lyan Sierra-Caro.

&gt; Outside of Florida, Royal Caribbean is requiring all COVID-vaccine eligible passengers to show proof of vaccination. But in Florida, businesses, including cruise lines, requiring proof of vaccine is at odds with state law.

&gt; The added Florida requirement comes on the heels two unvaccinated passengers under age 16 tested positive for COVID on board the cruise line's Adventure of the Seas ship and after sister line Celebrity Cruises also had two vaccinated passengers test positive on its ship, Celebrity Millennium, earlier this month. 

&gt; The cruise line is still carrying out test cruises to comply with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's cruise guidance as it doesn't expect to meet the health agency's threshold of 95% for vaccinated passengers in order to bypass that step.

&gt; The travel insurance requirement applies to sailings departing from Florida Aug. 1 through Dec. 31 and all bookings after June 28.

Truth is we don't know what else might come up from the vaccine and you can't fault people for waiting.

It's a method that some use to talk to others about religion or other non-scientific beliefs. 

The key to it is to ask questions driven by genuine curiosity, free of judgement, full of respect, in the spirit of exploring people's beliefs in greater depth.

Sure the temptation is to ""convert"" people to rational thought but that invariably fails. The successful talks may not end up with much more than someone being a bit less certain than before, and the interviewer having a better understanding of another's perspective. Sometimes the person starts to see how their beliefs may not be as well-founded or well-formed as they thought.

71% protection from hospitalisation means 29 hospitalised for every 100 that are unvaccinated, which is what I said. Pfizer's 94% means 6. That's ~5x.

With two doses, AZ closes the gap to 2x. Data/link was provided. Next time, if you like, I'll include that it's 92% v 96% after two doses - *which is still 2x the hospitalisations*.

If this also translates to infections and spread, which it likely does, AZ would lead to a far greater Bang! when the borders are opened than Pfizer also.

&gt;Based on this a rational policy of roll-out based on availability and blood-clotting risk can be made.

You ignore the rest of the comment - how do you manage sentiment when the whole year, we see more hospitalised, disabled, and dead due AZ than the disease?

Be realistic here - you could drop the surveillance program and gag the media, you could tell the medical group they must assume a high community risk of Covid, as if the borders are already open, but you have to at least acknowledge ""it's complicated"", surely.

&gt; Lastly, it is necessary to emphasize that these findings are based on the prevailing assortment of virus variants in the community during the study. It is not known how well these results will hold if or when some of the newer variants of concern become prominent. However, if prior infection does not afford protection against some of the newer variants of concern, there is little reason to suppose that the currently available vaccines would either. Vaccine breakthrough infections with variants have indeed been reported

Relying on natural immunity is no more ""gambling"" than relying on vaccination induced immunity is. In fact, a case can be made that vaccine immunity is less robust since it only targets the single spike protein, which is exactly the protein that's mutating in these variants.

Take a look at [this study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.21.21259010v1). 

&gt; Viral escape at prevalent T-cell epitopes restricted by high frequency HLA may be particularly problematic when vaccine immunity is focussed on a single protein such as SARS-CoV-2 Spike and provides a strong argument for inclusion of multiple viral proteins in next generation vaccines and highlights the urgent need for monitoring T-cell escape in new SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Variants are escaping vaccination immunity, so to make vaccines more robust they're exploring targeting more proteins with the vaccine.

Nurses aren’t exactly broke but if you start paying them $150k a year, it’s almost triple what residents earn and given the average pay of licensed doctors of around $250k with the average residence being 4.5 years, some licensed med school graduates would find the earnings over time more appealing than sticking with internal medicine.  
  
Doctors are also underpaid and in horrible financial situations. Almost everyone in healthcare is underpaid which increases the stress of the environment. So nurses end up having to make up for a lack of resources.  
  
The other issue (also combined with being underpaid) is that they aren’t treated well. There’s a lot of stress, the common “you’re just a nurse” insult, the high divorce numbers, the fact that patients come to the hospital in awful shape because of poor healthcare in general.  
  
A lot of doctors retire from the industry because despite the high earnings compared to other countries, it’s like always being given a house in the worst possible shape and needing to restore it to keep your job.  
  
What nurses need is better pay **and** better hours **and** for their patients to have better healthcare so that urgent care, adult onset diabetes and late discovered Alzheimer’s is the exception not the norm.

However, you can argue that the further reduction in transmissibility masking might offer is not necessary given the reduction in transmissibility already offered by vaccination.

I think this is inaccurate.  I have seen many claims by experts saying that Delta is more likely to infect and cause symptoms in vaccinated people.  The assurances are generally about reducing risk of hospitalization and death, not infection.  We have always been told from the start that vaccinated people will still get _infected_ even with the original covid.  We are still waiting on rigorous studies, blahblahblah, but it's quite obvious at this point that delta is causing symptomatic infection more often even in vaccinated people.

The thing to remember is that infection is far more analog than we tend to believe.  It is not just ""got within 20ft of someone or not"" that determines infection.  Covid-19 was 1x, Delta is 2x.

Smallpox has been around for millennia and was only eradicated in the mid-20th century. For novel viruses, vaccination on a short timeline is a new development in terms of pandemic response options. The 1918 pandemic, for example, resulted in renewed attempts to develop a vaccine for the Spanish Flu strain (and Influenza in general) with no immediate success. To amend my previous statement: 

&gt; Vaccines have never had a meaningful **short-term** effect for pandemic response before Covid-19.

My point was not to disparage vaccines, but merely to express an observation on our collective behavior during this pandemic. Would we be fine considering these measures a stop-gap if the death rate had been at the level of the Spanish Flu? What about if it was even worse? 

And if that question matters, why are we not prioritizing the implementation of standard procedures for pandemic response to mitigate the effects of future novel disease outbreaks with unknown mortality rates, risk factors, virulence, and methods of transmission?",,,1625031474,{},h3j3e3s,False,t3_o9yf1g,False,True,t1_h3g02df,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o9yf1g/la_county_urges_everyone_to_wear_mask_indoors_as/h3j3e3s/,1625285681,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

While you are right that the average is down for all of the US, there are several states that have been increasing in cases in the past weeks. And a 7-day average of 12k back in March 2020 was enough to start lockdowns. We just have to be vigilant until it’s really over.

[],,livesonthruyou,,,[],,,,text,t2_5vkukykc,False,False,[],"&gt;Maybe people could be allergic to whatever the carrier fluid is? 

I am actually glad you mentioned that! I have explained this in my previous replies on other subreddits, but the CDC has an article discussing their recommendations for those with allergies getting the COVID-19 vaccine ([Source](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/specific-groups/allergies.html)).

According to the CDC, those who are allergic to **Polyethylene Glycol (PEG)** (the active ingredient in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines) or **Polysorbate** (the active ingredient in the J&amp;J/Janssen vaccines) should discuss with their doctor to either get one or the other depending on which active ingredient they are allergic to.

It should also be noted that the chances of being allergic to PEG, Polysorbate, or both is *extremely* low. So low, in fact, if you were allergic you would probably know by now. Let's look at some data:

**Allergy to Polyethylene Glycol (PEG)**: According to [research](https://www.oakbrookallergists.com/2020/12/21/polyethylene-glycol-allergy/) conducted by the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology  (JACI), there have only be 37 cases of individuals allergic to PEG in the last 40 years.

**Allergy to Polysorbate:** Dr. Sanjeev Jain (a board-certified allergist, immunologist, and CEO of Columbia Allergy), said regarding PEG and Polysorbate allergies, ""Polysorbate is a very similar chemical to polyethylene glycol \[...\] So, there is a good chance that if somebody is allergic to polyethylene glycol, they're going to be allergic to polysorbate as well"" ([Source](https://wilkinsonknaggs.com/2021/03/22/how-to-know-if-youre-allergic-to-covid-vaccines-moderna-pfizer-jj/)). This means that an allergy to Polysorbate is virtually as rare as an allergy to PEG.

In other words, both are extremely, extremely rare. So rare, we are talking about 0.00001% chance or even less. Even so, as mentioned above, the CDC has recommendations anyway for those allergic to PEG and/or Polysorbate.

The CDC article also mentions individuals who have had allergies to other vaccines, stating to, ""ask your doctor if you should get a COVID-19 vaccine"" ([Source](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/specific-groups/allergies.html)).

However, the chances of being allergic to other vaccines (while higher than an allergy to PEG or Polysorbate) is still extremely low.

**Allergy to other types of vaccines**: According to the [Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ)](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/191/14/E395), an allergic reaction to vaccines, historically, occurs in about 1 out of 176,000 (0.0006%) vaccinations. To put this in perspective, you have a slightly higher chance of being struck by lightning this year (1 out of 170,000) than having an allergic reaction to other vaccines ([Source](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/youre-probably-not-allergic-to-vaccines#Allergic-reactions-are-extremely-uncommon)). Either way, the CDC still recommends discussing first with one's doctor.

&gt;And from what it sounds like, for immuno-compromised people, getting the vaccine means it's just less likely to lead to the creation of antibodies

This is actually not true. As I mentioned in my other reply on this thread, there is not sufficient evidence at this time to show that immunocompromised persons will not have an antibody response ([Source](https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/immunocompromised-covid-vaccine)).

There was, however, some good news recently in a [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2779852), published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), that found among participants given the COVID-19 vaccine who had just undergone an organ transplant (and thus, immunocompromised) after the 1st dose, 15% had a measurable antibody response, and after the 2nd dose, 47% had a measurable antibody response. This is great news.

Obviously, this is much lower than the general population, however, some protection is better than no protection, and I would argue that getting the COVID-19 vaccine for immunocompromised persons, as the CDC recommends, is the best option, no?

If we aren't going to mandate vaccinations, this will always be an issue.

It is wrong to force everyone to make large sacrifices when we are refusing to force people to make the comparatively small sacrifice of getting a shot.

To be clear, my proposed solution is that those who cannot be vaccinated (or for whom the vaccine might be less effective) wear N95s and avoid crowded places. 
Parents should be prudent in deciding what their younger children can do (e.g. play with friends whose parents are vaccinated and who have that same rule for who their kids can play with).  Primary schools should require masks until 6 weeks after the Pfizer vaccine is approved for children, which should happen in 2-3 months.

It's complicated by having chronic poorly controlled chest pain and an extensive heart history, though the pain was more severe and slightly different... and I can't say if it resolved on its own or with the Colchicine I was given. I didn't have noteworthy palpitations but I had a much harder time lying flat than I usually do, which is already difficult because of CHF.

That said, with having advanced heart failure and other heart problems--I firmly believe I would have likely had a far worse situation if I were to have gotten COVID. 

The article states concurs with my understanding is that the rate of cardiac issues during or after COVID is still higher among people who had COVID versus the vaccination consistently across age groups. I still think getting the full course is personally wise and responsible, and I chose the one I did for the higher efficacy rate than the J+J one because I'm in such a high risk category.

At a press briefing, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said that despite recent outbreaks in several cities and counties, the overall number of new cases has continued to trend downward.

Chen, who also heads the CECC, said one more person had tested positive in a cluster of Delta variant COVID-19 cases in Pingtung, bringing the total number to 15.

The new case -- a contact of an unlicensed taxi driver in the cluster -- tested positive while in quarantine, meaning the risk of him having spread the disease is low, Chen said.


Meanwhile, COVID-19 tests on over 6,000 residents in two Pingtung townships where cases have occurred, as well 392 staff and patients at a hospital being investigated as a possible site of transmission have all come back negative so far, Chen said.

Of the 56 new cases on Wednesday, all but one were domestic infections, and 27 involved people who tested positive while in quarantine.

New Taipei reported the most cases, with 23, followed by Taipei with 22.

Outside of those two cities where most of the cases have been concentrated to date, Taoyuan reported five cases, while Kaohsiung and Miaoli each reported two, and Pingtung had one.

Of the total, 31 cases had a known source of infection, while 22 were being investigated and two had unclear links to other cases, the CECC said.
The imported case was that of an Indian man in his 30s, who arrived in Taiwan on June 27 and tested positive at a government quarantine facility, the CECC said.

Meanwhile, the CECC reported five deaths on Wednesday, three men and two women in their 60s and 70s, who passed away between June 25 and June 28.

The new cases bring the total in the country to 14,804, of which more than 13,400 are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 cases in a single day.
To date, 648 people in Taiwan have died from COVID-19, including 636 since May 15.

With the delta variant, it is literally impossible to achieve herd immunity before kids get vaccinated, before they come out with a booster for the vaccine that directly targets delta, or before a lot more people get sick.  The more people who get vaccinated now, though, the slower the spread and the more time we buy until it is approved for kids or the booster is available.  That means fewer sick people which means fewer deaths.

Yes, I'm not disagreeing with that.

&gt;I understand vaccinating elderly people who are really at risk. But some random healthy 35 year old who works from home shouldn’t be getting a vaccine before someone who’s job it is to be around loads of people, serving them up close.  


The science does say however that even with that increased risk of infection, they are not at as much risk.

And the biggest issue is the delay it would cause to the overall rollout.

The absolute safest thing for your children would be to just never put them in a car and not allow them to play baseball. This is, of course, absurd so you've drawn the line at allowing activities that have some degree of risk with safety precautions to minimize that risk. Which makes sense and is just good parenting and risk assessment!

I could surely find an article about some kid who died in a car accident despite his car seat or who experienced brain damage at a baseball game despite his helmet. Do you agree me using this as proof these activities aren't safe and saying ""Say it's safe to these families!"" wouldn't be a reasonable thing to do?

Also, brain injuries can come from anything. Kids are clumsy, they fall. Does your kid wear a helmet when he's at the park? Jungle gyms could easily lead to grave injury. The data seems to show that there are almost 20x the amount of brain injury deaths to COVID deaths! That's staggering! 

And that's in 2020 with no vaccines when the virus was running rampant all across America. So that was the peak of infections/deaths.

I don't expect to convince you. That's not how Internet discourse works and that's okay. But I do hope you can consider the concept of risk assessment a little more deeply and ask yourself ""Why haven't I made my kids wear a mask during flu seasons? Why do they not wear a helmet when playing tag with their friends?""

Yes. There are legitimate concerns about the mRNA vaccines though.

However there is still a chance of contracting COVID even if you are vaccinated (albeit a small chance) and the effectiveness of the vaccines against some of the variants such as delta and delta + is less clear (although it looks like the efficacy against the variants is still extremely high) so wearing a mask in some situations even if you're vaccinated is not unwarranted. I personally wore a mask for a few months after being fully vaccinated until my kids (twins both 13) were fully vaccinated and now I only wear a mask when required (doctors office), and when shopping as a courtesy to those working there and to further reduce my risk of contracting COVID while in an enclosed indoor space. Is it necessary, no, but it's a small gesture to those who have to interact with me and it's something I have control over to further reduce the already extremely small chance of me contracting COVID. 

I personally have no problems with someone who is fully vaccinated going about their lives, they did their part and got vaccinated and they are not a risk to society.

To the contrary, most of the available data supports that current vaccines protect you pretty well from all strains.

The death rate for 75-84 year olds is 230 times that for 18-29 year olds according to  the US's CDC, and 95 times higher for 65 to 74 years old. According to a study in Israel, being fully vaccinated gives you 97% protection if you are over 65. So being fully vaccinated and over 65 means you are still more vulnerable to die from covid than if you are unvaccinated and between the ages of 18-29. So what is the logic behind stopping young people from going to pubs and restaurants, while allowing older vaccinated people? Furthermore, the flu season is expected to be severe this coming winter, which is again far more deadly the older you are.

Then let's get specific. A restaurant does what you pitched, enforcing vaccination checks. A person is turned down and then sneaks in. Do they simply throw them out if they refuse to leave? What if they sneak in and get caught? Do police get called for trespassing or any bit of resistance? Congratulations, you've suggested an ID check that is at its foundation is enforced at the point of a gun. You can talk about intentions all you want too, but that cold reality is exactly that. It IS dystopian. 

I could take the problem with this argument many ways (like those legitimately allergic to an ingredient in the vaccine and what they're supposed to do), but I'm most interested in the ones that believe the world is better with a ""show me your papers"" way of life enforced by people with guns. 

&gt; advocate for accessibility and resources for the underprivileged. 

It's not just that at this point though. Many reasons, like knowing about the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, are foundational beliefs in not believing the government has your best interest at heart. US government doesn't seem super trustworthy to me, and the mixed messages don't help. I completely understand why people are walking by the CVS every day and not getting a vaccination. 

&gt;It’s not safe for the unvaccinated to be maskless in dense indoor spaces. It’s not just to be mean. It isn’t safe

It's not safe to rock climb or ski, either. You don't need an ID for those though. At the end of the day, those people take those risks to partake, which is as it should be. Rock climbers should rock climb if they want. I shouldn't dictate how they live for them. Unvaccinated can take the risk. Everyone knows what can happen at this point

That's one topic I take contention with. It's simply a matter of protocol before it's ""fully approved"". A set of procedures and timeframe required before it is considered fully approved.  Normally that can take years because finding number of candidates to get results can be problematic. But considering we're in the midst of a pandemic, data is easy to come by, so we have more data that we really need, just they have to follow their protocol and wait minimum timeframe to make it ""official"". Hundreds of millions of people vaccinated and people are perfectly fine. That's enough for me. 

&gt; I have no intention on trying to convince anyone to get the shot, 

Agreed. Trying to convince someone is a lost cause I think.

 Yes, there are more RN’s that stayed then became NP’s but that doesn’t change the fact that the bedside nursing position is being cast as second class to the NP position. It doesn’t change that many nurses feel like the only way to get respect is to go back to school. We should be honoring our bedside nurses. 

You also say I can’t speak for “your RN folks and act like you feel their burden”. They aren’t “your folks”, stop treating them as children or some monolithic group that only thinks and feels one way about nursing. You seem to think you I don’t understand there position without realizing I work and LIVE with my traveling nurses. We are at the same hotels together. We eat the same shitty breakfasts in the morning and split our takeout in the evening. We talk about our kids and families and how much we miss them. We trade tricks for living out of suitcases and horror stories from assignments gone bad. After a year and a half on the road with them, I understand them not just as nurses but as people.  We travelers spend more time with each other than with the full time staff who are often aloof or downright hostile to us. But yeah “I don’t understand their burden” 

And lastly you attempt to belittle me by telling me “now go get to work”. You display the same attitude and condescension to your nursing colleagues no doubt. This is exactly why they want to leave the profession. This is the toxicity they are tired of battling. You are the kind of nurse that would tell a traveler to suck it up when they are crying because they missed their child’s recital or class party. I’m the one who finds them crying in the bathroom and telling them about when I missed my daughters first steps while I was in residency.

Young kids, for instance, though statistically it appears they’ve always had very low chances of serious symptoms. But then there are the adults who’ve had access for months and have no prohibiting conditions, yet they still refuse to get it for a variety of bullshit reasons.

So basically, this sounds like vaccinated people are being asked to put masks back on largely in order to protect those who COULD get vaccinated but have decided they just don’t wanna.

But considering the nature of this vaccine, it hit me; im not the most healthy person. So naturally **assuming,** my immune system is not at its prime.

At times, i call just a package of biscuits my breakfast. You get the picture. I too am curious as well on how am i still alive.

That's what you've been hearing. They protect you, it's wonderful, you're very unlikely to go to hospital - remembering that many unvaccinated don't need to either. You're pretty set.

The concern though is over the community. I haven't seen the numbers for it, but it's reasonable to expect that many vaccinated are now catching covid again, at least mildly. You don't land 4% in hospital unless people are catching it again, after all.

And if people are catching it, it means people can spread it. It means that unvaccinated people, like children, are vulnerable again.

Worse, it means it can circulate *despite* the vaccines, giving it more chances to overcome the vaccines more properly. The more spread you have duelling it out with antibodies, the more chance that one of the random mutations beat those antibodies, and we start this whole rodeo again (al beit with mRNA up our sleeve now).

*But* it's not as bad as that may sound. Scientists remind us that they can't see a way for it to still function if it changes its spike protein too substantially, as that's how it enters the cell. The vaccines train our immune systems to recognise and fight that spike protein, so they remain confident that some immunity will always be there - milder symptoms, etc.

But, to reduce the risk of us all racing for boosters asap, to ""think of the children"" along with the unvaccinated - some scientists are saying people should continue to wear masks, despite the vaccines.

Although titers versus the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus remained high, with 37 of 40 participants having detectable titers, titers against the variants of concern (B.1.351 and P.1) were much lower, with approximately half of participants having titers below the assay limit of quantification prior to boosting. Two weeks after receiving either mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.351, PsVN titers were boosted in all participants and all variants tested. Following boost, geometric mean titers (GMT) against the wild-type, B.1.351, and P.1 variants increased to levels similar to or higher than the previously reported peak titers against the ancestral (D614G) strain following primary vaccination1.”

How many examples are enough? Better than examples are statistics

- In the UK [18 individuals out of 22 million](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-benefits-risks-context) receiving AstraZeneca died. Less than one in a million chance of dying in a country that is pretty plagued with Covid. You should probably take the vaccine if no other alternatives are offered

- I Norway [4 died](https://www.faktisk.no/artikler/z55ky/dette-trenger-du-a-vite-om-astrazeneca-vaksinen) out of [121800](https://www.faktisk.no/artikler/z55ky/dette-trenger-du-a-vite-om-astrazeneca-vaksinen) receiving the vaccine. That's about 1 in 30000 chance of death for this limited demographic. Not good odds compared to the odds of dying of Covid in Norway. That's why the [Norwegian Institute of Public Health recommended](https://www.fhi.no/en/news/2021/astrazeneca-vaccine-removed-from-coronavirus-immunisation-programme-in-norw/) the government to stop distribution of that particular vaccine, and the government heeded.

It's all about local context - not global total nubmers. As a Norwegian female between 30 to 40 I would definitely not take the AstraZeneca vaccine even if offered, since Pfizer and Biontech is also offered. Why take a lottery ticket that has less chance of winning for the same price?

This is not black and white. As [eleanor_vance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oaitfz/covid_vaccine_refuser_regrets_turning_down_jab/h3jfpni/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) said: ""It doesn't seem like there's any middle ground between wearing a tin-foil hat to block the 5G signal and wholeheartedly embracing the vaccine"". There should be. And there should be room to discuss rationally.

&gt;You can say you got the vaccine but you sure have all the talking points down of an anti-vaxxer. So, I'm a bit skeptical.

Again it's not black and white, but sometimes gray. There's more than one vaccine and there's more than one context.",,,1625070545,{},h3ks36z,False,t3_oaitfz,False,True,t1_h3k1i1x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oaitfz/covid_vaccine_refuser_regrets_turning_down_jab/h3ks36z/,1625316540,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

When the yellow plastic elastic breaks or no longer holds good tension on the 3M 8210's, I've been replacing it with fabric elastic from craft store. Doesn't last as long, and needs to be re-adjusted and knot the elastic to add more tension once or twice, then replaced again.

&gt;In contrast to the measles virus, there are a number of pathogens for which vaccination generates stronger immune responses and more-effective protection against disease than does natural infection. In these cases, the man-made vaccine is ‘superhuman’; that is, it gives humans immune responses superior to those generated in response to infection. The bacterium that causes tetanus is a notable example of this. Infection with this pathogen results in production of the highly potent tetanus toxin in small amounts that are sufficient to cause severe disease but not enough to generate a strong immune, particularly antibody, response. On the other hand, vaccination with an inactivated form of the toxin (tetanus toxoid) generates antibody responses sufficient to provide protection against the toxin for a decade and probably longer…

&gt;Among viruses, two classic cases in which vaccines generate immunity superior to that generated by natural infection are varicella zoster virus, which can lead to shingles, and human papillomavirus (HPV), some strains of which cause various malignancies, including cervical, penile and oropharyngeal cancer.

It was just the 'best' vaccine part that you mentioned people were after which is all I wanted to ask. 

If we're focused solely on Australia where you say the COVID numbers are well controlled, those that are at higher risk groups (the elderly, immunocompromised etc) are vaccinated and if their track and trace system is good, then as a young person, then yes, it may actually be best to hold off on an AZ vaccine (assuming there the wait for an mRNA vaccine is not long at all and they are not looking to travel any time soon which would put them at a greater risk of COVID is they were to go someone where it's more endemic and also risk bringing it back). But this point I'd argue is more for the fact that in this specific situation, the risk of having a serious side effect would outweigh the risk of catching COVID (again, going by the currently low number you've stated and assuming it won't rise a lot more by the time they have access to an mRNA vaccine), rather than the efficacy of the vaccine itself (given the above facts regarding mixing vaccines). I think for the most part around the world, countries can not afford to do this and so it won't be a wise move, but it's more understandable in this situation (and presumably NZ, but again I haven't followed their case numbers recently, though I know they were doing pretty well!). The point which stuck out which you mentioned is the supply issue and the act that Aus are due to receive a substatial number of mRNA vaccines, which is great! Hopefully cases will remain well-controlled until then.

Just to point out the tijme between doses; at first it was deemed to be best to delay the second dose of AZ to allow as many people to at least be partially protected by one dose, but it then turned out that delaying doses actually also increases immunity which is why it has stuck, rather than being a supply issue. In fact, recently it's been found that if you wait even longer (10 month) between doses, immunity, including the T-cell reponse, is even greater still! But obviously there needs to be a balance.

AZ like you've said have had a lot of bad press, some may be slightly political especially when offered as an effective, cheaper, more easily stored alternative when compared to other vaccines (unfortunately that's just how pharaceutical industries work), but also some through their own doing (the initial trials didn't do them many favours when they were not consistent with dosages and time frames, so it wasn't a great start). But working on what we know now, it's evident that's AZ's efficacy is very impressive. Regarding VIIT, it's understandable that people are worried about it, but if you look on PHE for example, the number of fatalities are actually quite similar with Pfizer (details aren't given for the specific causes, but we know for example that there's a greater number of portal vein thrombosis), but this does not get media coverage (FYI as important as it obviously is to be transparent, it's probably for the best that this isn't highlighted in the media given what's happened with AZ and the reported clots, but you can see if for yourself. If you want a breakdown of side effects/ADRs for each vaccine, the European Medicines Agency website has a breakdown of all reported cases which shows that serious events are seen even in mRNA vaccines). 

By the way, although you may be frustrated about the lockdown (you may not be), I just want to say that's it fantastic to see that Australia are taking it seriously and doing a lot to protect Australians with high PCR testing, lockdowns and other general precautions.

As you've said, we mostly agree and the situation seems to be a little different in Australia compared to more other countries especially with the rise in the delta variant seen in most.

Anyway, all the best, stay safe!",,,1625046547,{},h3jkj1u,False,t3_oa6dyo,False,False,t1_h3jhthw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oa6dyo/australias_top_medical_body_refuses_to_endorse/h3jkj1u/,1625294345,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Don't feel the need to reply, but just notes:

&gt; It was just the 'best' vaccine part that you mentioned people were after which is all I wanted to ask. 

Sorry, may have come across wrong. I think it's silly. I know cars, aspirin, probably-lightning kills more and all that. It was only a comment on perception, one from how irrational humans are.

They've ""heard"" (and yes, I agree Pfizer is _fantastic_ at marketing, and it annoyed me no end) there's better, and you just can't come back from that.

There are other angles, but especially when my age bracket is getting Pfizer (which I remember my inner lizard brain went ""yay"" to hear), along with all of those across the ditch in New Zealand, it leaves you feeling half-hearted to do it.

I agree, it's silly, but so are humans.

&gt; and they are not looking to travel any time soon which would put them at a greater risk of COVID is they were to go someone where it's more endemic and also risk bringing it back

All travelers can skip any queues to get the vaccine recommended for their age bracket, Pfizer &lt; 50, AZ &gt;= 50.

But then we also can't travel abroad for leisure at the moment (mad, I know), due limited infrastructure to support the quarantine requirements on return (14-days in hotel quarantine + 3 tests, one of them being after ""release"") and the risk it represents on community outbreaks.

It really is quite different here, for better or for worse :).

&gt;  it's evident that's AZ's efficacy is very impressive

Agreed, and I don't mean to badmouth it in general. Its efficacy is literally a dream just 12 months ago - better than any reasonable expectation.

&gt; but this does not get media coverage

I have to be honest, early on in the global vaccine rollout I quietly suspected that mRNA bad press was being suppressed, and that this clotting disorder could be hitting all parties equally, due some interaction between the spikes and ACE2 receptors. This is 100% not my field, but I've just seen enough propaganda/marketing, and especially when working with entities as big as ""big pharma"" I don't put much past them - especially when mRNA was the hail mary saving the US at the time.

But I _do_ trust the [TGA](https://www.tga.gov.au/periodic/covid-19-vaccine-weekly-safety-report-24-06-2021), and they have provided pretty great transparency over this so far. They're requesting reports for myo/pericarditis following Comirnaty, but don't seem concerned on anything yet. Maybe by the time we're down to the youngest age brackets, of course. Cross that bridge then.

&gt; By the way, although you may be frustrated about the lockdown (you may not be), I just want to say that's it fantastic to see that Australia are taking it seriously and doing a lot to protect Australians with high PCR testing, lockdowns and other general precautions.

I understand it as a genuinely small price to pay for the freedoms we've had, including the ability to simply see my grandma/nanna without anxiety in the last year.

I can't say it's all been correct - I expect we'll hear about long-term mental anguish to some individuals, etc, but this is a pandemic, no country can go unscathed. I do like that we've done something different, and that difference will provide case studies for epidemiologists for years to come - adding to the wealth of knowledge, so that hopefully, we can all find better solutions next time.

It will be very interesting to see how we exit this unique position though.

My reasons to hate them are pretty personal and unique.  Open the spoiler if you want the full story on why I hate them

\[spoiler ahead\]

&gt;!The spain mask mandate sent me trough the darkest time I had in my entire life. Not becuse of being unconfortable or anything (I wear thick double filtered masks and still can breathe perfectly even with high heat, honestly don't get the complaints about not being able to breathe). I spent a decade (my entire 20s) on appearance self improvement: long diet to counter high water retention (extremely difficult and lenghty to change, unlike just losing fat), exercise, dentists, grooming, minor procedures... it was a lot of work, money, studying, hard work and perseverance in this almost ""lifelong"" project I had with the end of liking what I saw in the mirror.!&lt;

&gt;!I finally had achieved it, in time (i am in my 30's, still looking younger thankfully but I dont know when I will start looking older) and it was finally my time to enjoy life. For half a year I enjoyed HUGELY the benefits of this self improvement journey.... until covid hit and masks came, the mask covering every single hint of progress I made all these years. I felt so incredibly cheated and enraged. This also added to the fact that the things that improved my face countered finally my bad skinny narrow body, and now I only had my body and my face was hidden. The masks basically shat on everything I spent my entire youth working for.!&lt;

&gt;!It also added the extreme fear of aging with a mask on and losing that ""window"" of ""best I ever looked in my life"" basically wasting whats left of my youth and all my hard work. All my hard work that finally succeeded, completely negated and wasted by the mask.!&lt;

&gt;!I went from the happiest in my life (I was living a reaaaally good time, with a flourishing social life etc) to self harming for the first time in my life because of the masks. Other restrictions felt awful too and were very boring but nowhere near the hit to my mental health masks did.!&lt;

&gt;!Wearing masks when you enter stores and such is a thing, sometimes a hassle but bearable. Not having a face at all when you are outside your house, after a damned decade of work on it, and with the fear of never getting your youth back if this goes for too long, drove me almost insane. I never spent so long in such extreme state of constant anger, frustration, terror and paranoia. I often had nightmares of me getting old behind a mask after I finally, for the first time in my life, was enjoying being in my body and face.!&lt;

&gt;!I hate with all my heart this restriction that sent me to the lowest I have ever been in my entire life, and this includes past bullying. I hope it NEVER EVER gets reinstated outdoors.

&gt;But I think in parts of the country where vaccination rates are high, and that’s certainly true in the Northeast, I think we’re largely protected — at least from the current variants that are circulating,” added Gottlieb, who serves on the board of Covid vaccine maker Pfizer.

&gt;On the other hand, Gottlieb said parts of the country are more vulnerable to outbreaks involving the Covid delta variant. Those are places where the number of people who have previously been infected or received the vaccine are low. He noted the situation in Missouri, where health officials have expressed concern with a rise in cases and hospitalizations, particularly in areas with lagging vaccination rates.

&gt;”If you’re someone even who has been vaccinated living in those parts of the country, and there’s a dense epidemic of this new delta variant, you’re at risk as well because we know the vaccines aren’t 100% and we know in vulnerable populations — people who are immunocompromised, people who are much older — the vaccines may not work as well over time.”

This shows that even if you lose weight your body is changed irreparably. TDEE measurements are nearly impossible with the x factor of how much your body has fought the weight loss and is trying to maintain set point YEARS after weight loss, if you even can in the first place.

Sugar in particular produces more dopamine than cocaine. Your body literally wants it more than almost any other addictive drug. And the shit part is you NEED carbs to survive. It's so callous to put this on people when we live in a world where one of the most addictive substances known to man is actively advertised and accepted.

It has very little to do with knowledge. Many of these people are addicted to sugar before they're even old enough to comprehend proper nutrition. Society cannot and will not be able to handle this with your mentality. It simply hasn't and doesn't work.

One, is that you won't go to hospital. PHE study estimates only 4 people with 2-dose Pfizer will go to hospital for every 100 unvaccinated. So it's basically first rolling to see if you'd go if you're unvaccinated, and then rolling two dice to see if it escaped the vaccine - with double sixes meaning it did - well, that's decent protection.

But the other is the more concerning one, at a societal level. *Infections* are now more common in the vaccinated community. That means more transmissions - and, screw it, they're antivaxxers or kids or whatever, they brought it on themselves.

But what you're missing, is that the more the virus is moving through vaccinated people, the more exposure it has to those antibodies, the more likely it pops a mutation that may allow it to overcome them.

Fortunately, scientists think it would be very unlikely that it can do that - the spike is essential to how it infects cells, so it can't change it too much. *Also*, to mask up until that isn't a problem is basically masks until they have an effective booster shot - who knows how long that will take.

[],,korokunderarock,,,[],,,,text,t2_5l2q5wse,False,False,[],"Hello, I live in the UK which currently appears to be gunning for the title of Delta Capital of the World.

Cases are currently very high here. I now know several mRNA-vaccinated people who have contracted the virus and been symptomatic.

This is not surprising! [Pfizer has an efficacy against symptomatic infection with delta of 88%](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-b-1-617-2-variant-after-2-doses). That doesn't mean 88 out of every 100 people can't ever catch it, it means that [your risk of getting COVID and having symptoms is 12% of what it was before you were vaccinated](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00075-X/fulltext).

What that means is that how protected you are also depends on *where* you are. If very few people around you have COVID, 12% of your previous risk might be nearing zero. If you are somewhere where you are exposed to shitloads and shitloads of cases, although your risk would be much higher if you weren't vaccinated, you might actually still be somewhat likely to catch it, which is what we are seeing happen to some degree here right now.

If you do catch it [your risk of being hospitalised is also only 4% of what it previously was](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-hospitalisation-from-delta-variant). This is going to differ less by environment and more by individual person, but it does mean that most vaccinated people are almost unkillable by COVID, but people who had a super duper high risk of severe illness before vaccination now have a much lower but still non-zero one.

Here's the thing: the vaccines *absolutely work*. You can look at the differences in the UK stats between now and last winter for proof of that. Despite high cases, hospitalisations and deaths are much, much lower. They aren't zero and they are unfortunately slowly ticking up with cases, for reasons explained above, but they are *spectacularly* lower than previously.

Vaccines work. This is true *without them being perfectly protective*. These things are not mutually exclusive.

If cases are low where you are, your absolute risk of catching symptomatic COVID may very well be negligible right now and not worth thinking about. However, if they spike significantly, it is worth understanding that despite being vaccinated you might very well get symptomatic COVID. You almost certainly will not die or end up in hospital, so you may be fine with that.

However, if someone has a baseline-high risk (as I do -- I am not immunocompromised, but I do have a high-risk underlying condition) or has family who do, or they simply really do not want to get sick, they may still want to take additional precautions if there is a widespread nearby outbreak.

I would politely but strongly suggest not telling those of us who are still in a position where we need to think about protecting ourselves that doing so is harmful.

(Side note, for anyone reading this who does fall into the group who prefer to be cautious, I really recommend investing in a reusable KN94 or N95 so you don't have to worry about what anyone else around you is doing.)",,,1625003066,{},h3hm3cj,False,t3_o9t3wc,False,True,t1_h3fnf0i,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o9t3wc/fourth_consecutive_day_of_more_than_800_covid/h3hm3cj/,1625257103,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I already said so many times that immunocompromised people should still wear masks even after full vaccination but you not wearing one doesn't effect them....it's not like you taking your mask off is going to effect the immunocompromised... You can't lose your life for them they should already be wearing their mask....it's not like they are taking their masks off ...they aren't. Why end your life for them? Again I'm not going to start wearing my masks for the chance that a masked immunocompromised person passes by me in the store. I avoid masked people in stores anyway... 

&gt; Kids 

Kids can wear masks so let them do that. I am not affecting them cause as I've said you can't give the virus to other people and especially if they are a kid the small viral load is going to give them a free vaccination basically so you wearing a mask makes covid go longer. 

&gt; Delta plus

https://www.google.com/amp/s/time.com/6075858/delta-plus-variant/%3famp=true nope

&gt; Antibodies will go down

Once you make antibodies your antibodies will only go down if you aren't effected by the virus for a very long time. The reason Israel is having problems is cause they aren't allowing people to get sick with small viral loads that keep allowing people to use their immune system and keep the antibodies working. It's the same thing with why your antibodies think your allergies are allergies...it's cause as a kid your parents never gave you those foods/didn't take you outside and because of that your body never got used to it and now you're allergic... If your body doesn't get used to the variant and fight it it won't be able to get used to mutations. Hence why we got the vaccine but even getting small viral loads over the next couple of weeks allows your antibodies to stay on standby so when you do get sick over and over again your body will get used to it and know to fight it off when it's worse. If you don't your body won't know. Take your masks off and delta plus will be less worse.

&gt;Let me ask you a different question - will you be campaigning for lower speed limits? Because it is a known quantity how many more people will live for every mph you drop the speed limit. Or fuck those people?

I get what you're trying to say but this is a pretty bad analogy. As more people get vaccinated, more of the vulnerable will be protected. 

Lowering speed limits has a bunch of variables that affect the outcome like whether people abide by the limits, whether the limits were already at a safe level in that area, how many people drive in that area, how well are the new limits going to be enforced, etc. There are likely more efficient changes that can be made to save lives than going down the road of changing speed limits which wouldn't be a very feasible change that could get implemented well.

However, these people often have jobs, and will impact the lives of the rest of us even if we're fully vaccinated.  Imagine for a moment that a poultry processing plant has a 50% vaccination rate among their employees.  Once COVID starts to spread there (which can happen through multiple rounds) some percentage of that 50% will be off sick all at once.  So let's say your production is down 10% this week.  Next week, it would be down a normal week 15% because there are even more employees out sick and the ones from last week didn't come back.  At that point, you would be down in a hole 25% until people start coming back and you can ramp production back up.

Combine the above information with this information about [Mixing Vaccines](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mrg3x4/mixing_vaccines_could_mean_booster_jab_is_not/) And consider this Spanish study of [AZ/Pfizer mix is safe and effective.
](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nfa2rh/spanish_study_finds_astrazeneca_vaccine_followed/)

So, would it be safe to mix manufacturers, or get an additional dose after a waiting period after you talked to your doctor about it? Yeah, sure. **But you won't need to, if you got Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J, you are done for now.**

Wait for multivalent mRNA boosters if you really feel that you need additional protection.

[**DELTA** is probably not as bad as you think](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/27/opinion/covid-vaccine-variants.html), it's probably really close to the same as previous variants. Many people aren't convinced that it's more transmissible/contagious/virulent/etc. Remember, the original virus was *really* good at spreading, like really really good, and estimates of R were all over the place. Same thing with Delta. 

It's okay to be afraid of needles. [Don't let that be the thing that stops you from getting vaccinated.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nxri8s/over_half_of_adults_unvaccinated_for_covid19_fear/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

Novavax is highly effective and uses an older vaccine technology. This should be promoted as the vaccine for people who think mRNA is too new a technology for them to get. It can't come soon enough.

[Original Comment 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnzwri/daily_discussion_thread_april_10_2021/gu2011a/) - Vaccines and why variants aren't an issue.

Still totally worth checking out if you haven't already. Hasn't gone out of date yet. 

[Original Comment 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnzwri/daily_discussion_thread_april_10_2021/gu200jr/) - Additional stuff, thoughts. Much less worth checking out, but there are a few things in there that are still good. 

***

The vaccines are FREE in the US.  FREE FREE, not like ""Copay free"", like fuckin FREE. You don't need insurance. Go get one. Now.  Is there something stopping you from going to get one today? Talk to me about it, we'll get it worked out.  

If your doctor offers to give you the vaccine, take it, right away. It *will be absolutely free*. If you get a bill for the vaccine, call the cops or something, [it's *ILLEGAL* to charge you for the vaccine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nvzofq/government_warns_doctors_and_insurers_dont_bill/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

[Dose intervals might increase efficacy if extended past 3 or 4 weeks,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/mudvjd/questin_about_vaccine_intervals/gv58byt/) CDC says you have up to 42 days between doses (but that may be extended at some point).

**More variant stuff:**

Please don't say ""strain"" when you mean ""variant"". 

There [might not be much room left for SARS-CoV-2 to mutate](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/mpcc5k/weekly_question_thread_april_12_2021/gui5xn3/) into.

CDC [doesn't think](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n94zxm/no_evidence_that_pfizer_vaccine_needs_updating/) we'll need boosters/updates/etc for the mRNA vaccines.

Pfizer/Moderna work on the [Double/Triple/Indian Variant](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/n9q3q8/infection_and_vaccineinduced_neutralizing/).

Pfizer (and Moderna, probably) [works on B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 Variants](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/n5r2ry/effectiveness_of_the_bnt162b2_covid19_vaccine/)

And [B.1.617, the Indian/""double/triple mutant"" variant.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nit1sr/covid19_pfizer_vaccine_nearly_90_effective/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

REMINDER: Every time we do a neutralization assay on a variant vs Pfizer/Moderna, we get the same result. [The vaccine wins.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mwpijo/daily_discussion_thread_april_23_2021/gvkm64h/)

T-Cells are really important.  Probably [more important than antibodies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/n5015i/highly_functional_cellular_immunity_in_sarscov2/)

Moderna works great against variants, even [seven months out from the second dose.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ne0wx8/durability_of_mrna1273induced_antibodies_against/)

**The vaccine is better than the disease:**

[Penis issues from Covid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nbh3ez/covid19_endothelial_dysfunction_can_cause/) (but [not the vaccine\).](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/narbhn/researchers_report_covid19_found_in_penile_tissue/)

[Neurological problems](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/na1eri/82_of_people_hospitalized_with_covid19_develop/) from Covid Infection (but not the vaccine).

[Loss of smell](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n88qwv/daily_discussion_thread_may_09_2021/gxiiusd/) is both [common](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6sj6g/daily_discussion_thread_may_07_2021/gxb6wah/) and way [more devastating](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n1efrf/joe_rogan_walks_back_antivaccination_comments/gwcvd0m/) than you'd think.  This does not occur with the vaccines.

Loss of smell [really sucks.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nqkiz5/cdc_touts_smell_training_after_covid19_but_it/) There's a whole subreddit about it ([anosmia](https://www.reddit.com/r/anosmia/comments/nkcta1/3_months_and_minimal_recovery/)), and the people who didn't lose their sense of smell from Covid are tired of everyone asking Covid-loss-of-smell questions.  

[Fewer symptoms = less spread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6sj6g/daily_discussion_thread_may_07_2021/gxbfbt1/)  Vaccines make you have fewer symptoms (*if* you get an infection after vaccination).

If you got infected, recovered, and then got at least one dose of Pfizer, you have immunity not only to multiple variants, but also SARS-CoV-1, the virus for which we named SARS in 2003.  Turns out much of [the ""breadth"" of that immunity is from the vaccine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/net65c/sarscov2_mrna_vaccines_induce_a_greater_array_of/)

[Truly asymptomatic people don't spread the virus much.  People who are pre-symptomatic, and do go on to have symptoms, can be really good spreaders.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ncsstr/daily_discussion_thread_may_15_2021/gy7idau/)

I wear a mask when I'm walking around town because it's not a social activity so the cost is negligible and therefore the benefit doesn't need to be huge to justify it.

I don't wear a mask when I'm in a social situation (e.g. meeting people in the garden) because the cost outweighs the benefit. 

However, I note that here in the UK the Δ variant is growing exponentially despite high vaccine uptake, and that [although vaccination is excellent at protecting against serious disease, it is less than 100% effective at preventing infection, and even a mild case of COVID-19 is no fun](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-57640550).

I think that people should wear masks by default when in crowded but asocial situations (e.g. public transport), because the benefits generally outweigh the harms. But I don't expect people to wear masks in the pub, because the harms probably outweigh the benefits, (at least for people who aren't so vulnerable that they probably shouldn't be going to the pub in the first place).",,,1625084986,{},h3lpd9g,False,t3_oaxkty,False,True,t1_h3kj9nm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oaxkty/cdc_director_vaccinated_people_safe_from_delta/h3lpd9g/,1625335140,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I feel safe with my vaccine for now, and yes we will never have zero covid, like with measles. With Measles, because so many people are vaccinated, we don't see enough transmission of the disease to result in vaccine resistance; this won't necessarily be the case with covid if vaccine uptake remains low in the foreseeable future. It's a fact that people are seeing increased hospitalization of young people with the new variant elsewhere. An increase in cases can send the medical system over the edge in some places. Hospitals in rural areas have been going out of business at a rapid pace, so they simply don't have the capacity to treat their catchment areas as it is. We're still dealing with the fall-out of the mental health crisis from all of this, and people with pre-existing conditions who avoided care during the pandemic due to fear they'd get sick and die are now getting to the point where many of them can't avoid medical treatment.
