1. CT is doing significantly better on vaccines than those two states: 21.4% have gotten at least one shot vs. 14.2 for Texas and 15 for Mississippi.
2. This doesn't take effect for two weeks whereas TX and MS rolled things back immediately. We're at a point where two weeks can make a huge difference.
3. They're not lifting the mask mandate. Whether you think this is early or not the order or operations is correct, business restrictions are more costly than mask mandates and should be removed first.
4. Fewer essential workers are eligible for the vaccine right now in TX and MS than in CT

That being said it's worth being precise in your criticisms and people got over their skis trashing TX and MS yesterday. The real issue is repealing the mask mandate. I'm not sure there's a case for the restrictions on these businesses that are really suffering when over half of 65+ have gotten at least one shot and we've seen increasing evidence that one shot of Pfizer/Moderna is effective.

For me personally, it was a coping mechanism more than anything which leads into addiction. Sad=eat, happy=eat, lonely=eat and with friends=eat. I think this is the case for a lot of people where food becomes comforting and you're not necessarily thinking about the negative effects on your health. 

There's also the issue with the lack of education behind nutrition and healthy eating habits in the US. Cereal for breakfast, takeout for lunch and then carb-rich or processed foods for dinner with no semblance of portion control to be found. This kind of thing isn't taught in schools aside from my anecdotal recollection of the food pyramid in 2nd grade which probably isn't standard in many parts of the US. There's a steep learning curve if you're overweight/obese in the US and starting to get healthy which changes your entire perception of nutrition, caloric intake and portion control.

My problem is the bigger, fictional, idea that there are a large group of people who never want to open up.  Because it's fictional, we can't actually have a conversation because it imagines the 'other' as something they are not.  It promotes division, and the kind of division that cannot be overcome through compromise because it mis-imagines what others want.

Is it all directly related to obesity? We can't know. The researchers clearly stated that we can't know. Is there a reliable correlation between obesity and Covid 19 deaths? That we can confirm. 

If you read the paper, you can see exactly the approach from the researchers: are **all** the deaths a result of overweight? We can't tell. Is overweight correlated to Covid 19? YES. **What can we do about it?**

If you're planning a massive festival, you need permits, hiring contractors to setup, booking bands, selling tickets, etc. To make matters worse, if you're in the live event/convention business, you're going to need to rehire your staff because they were all laid off last year. We have a lot of hotels that are just straight up closed. Again, you have to rehire everyone from housekeeping to bartenders.

The point is that currently 80% of the population is unvaccinated, 10% of the population is only partially vaccinated, and community transmission is at a level that we know from historical data can cause a rapid rise in caseload.

[],,antsdidthis,,,[],,,,text,t2_ow6x9,False,False,[],"&gt;Can anyone explain to me why masks would be required at schools, especially elementary schools, in most places in the US next fall?

Good chance we won't, it really depends on what case counts look like at that point imo but if cases are way down in communities like we expect they will then there probably isn't much point to making kids wear masks even if they're unvaccinated, and like you said there is a huge cost to kids having to wear masks.

&gt;The person I was talking to brought up kids not being vacced yet (how many kids again have been affected? Also, I heard that was coming by the summer?)

Pretty unlikely that all kids will be vaccinated by fall. The trials right now are trying to expand the age range down from 16+ to 12+, which could get approval by the end of the summer, meaning some high school and middle school kids could be vaccinated by this fall. But elementary school students might come a bit later.

&gt;Won’t most adults be vaccinated by then, especially the way things are ramping up? Meaning herd immunity?

Even if every adult is vaccinated, COVID can still spread between children like other respiratory illnesses do. It's just super unlikely to cause serious harm to them. My wife is a pediatrician, and sees plenty of kids test positive for COVID, but only a small minority of them have symptoms bad enough to admit to the hospital. I think the question is more, if you can vaccinate the teachers and other adults in schools, and you can vaccinate parents, how likely is it that COVID could sweep through young students within a school, and how harmful would that even be? If it's super unlikely or not that harmful, then there should be no need for masks. If it's likely and potentially very harmful, masks might still be useful.

&gt;Do we think these vaccines work or not? It really frustrates me. I’m just trying to understand what the endpoint will be for masks being required.

Vaccines are extremely effective. Once vaccines are being administered to most younger children, I see zero reason why we would need masks in schools.",,,1614903348,{},gpptpzk,False,t3_lxfna2,False,False,t1_gppijw9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lxfna2/daily_discussion_thread_march_04_2021/gpptpzk/,1615049615,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

Uk is on track to have every adult vax by summer and  yet are putting more money into future vaccines, more money into research to make a library if vaccines so if a mutation pops up they can have it in production in weeks.

Usa, EU, uk all updating vaccine studies requirements so new vax can be fast tracked when needed. New vax based on previous approved vax just updated for a variant or variants won't need trials with 30,000 but less like with the yearly flu vax.

[],,elcuervo,,,[],,,,text,t2_4x3rl,False,True,[],"Why is Scott Gottlieb the only person who seems to be any good at this?

On CNBC Wednesday, anchor Becky Quick [asked Dr. Gottlieb](https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1367268300909142018),  the former FDA director and a Pfizer board member, whether Texas'  immediate lifting of statewide COVID restrictions, including mask  mandates, is a problem. The answer to this question is obviously ""yes.""  But it also needs to be more than just ""yes.""

Gottlieb got this  balance between caution and hope correct. As he noted, March is going to  be a weird month. In February, the epidemic was ""raging,"" and April is  very likely to be ""profoundly better."" This month, ""we still face a lot  of risk of a resurgence."" So it's not time yet to pull back completely  on COVID restrictions, as Texas and Mississippi have done, but it should  soon be time to ease up on many measures — in weeks, not months, given  the accelerated pace of the vaccine rollout.

Unfortunately, the  public has heard the ""give it just a bit longer"" message a lot before.  We are nearing the one-year anniversary of [""15 days to slow the spread.""](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/29/inside-the-white-house-coronavirus-response-153058)

It's  okay for public health guidance to change when circumstances change,  but the 15-day promise was never credible and should not have been  issued. The public is understandably weary of a year of rules, and wary  of a public health establishment that — after those first overconfident  messages — often seems loath to admit things are about to get much  better.

To be credible, people who hope to influence public  behavior need to meet the public where it is — giving realistic guidance  and concrete timelines about when and how they can change their  behavior soon, if not right *now*.

## Excessively cautious public health guidance is bad for public health

While  Texas and Mississippi are rushing out of restriction too quickly,  public health officials from the federal government have given us  insufficient guidance about when we can expect to start easing up, if  not now.

Even though about 30 million Americans have now received  two doses of vaccine (an impressive feat!) we are still awaiting broad  guidance from the Centers for Disease Control on what you should do once  you're fully vaccinated, and what guidance the CDC has issued so far is  almost comically over-cautious. For instance, the CDC says it's okay  not to quarantine if you're exposed to COVID so long as you are  asymptomatic and received all vaccine doses at least 14 days ago — and [also no longer than 90 days ago](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html).

As the CDC [admits](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/17/after-your-covid-19-vaccination-whats-up-with-the-90-day-limit/),  there is no reason to believe the vaccines stop working after 90 days,  and a 90-day window is not informing other aspects of our federal public  health policy — we're not telling people to go get re-vaccinated after  90 days.

Yet, there goes the CDC, positing an *extremely*  narrow band of newly-allowed behavior after vaccinating. The 90-day  guideline is also bleeding into state recommendations. New York is  creating another exemption to its travel quarantine rules, this time for  people who have been vaccinated, but also [limiting the exception to people whose vaccinations are less than 90 days old](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-event-arts-and-entertainment-venues-can-reopen-33-percent-capacity).

What message does this send to the public?

On  one hand, it's yet another government message suggesting the vaccines  aren't that good. If we have policies built on an implication that the  vaccines only work for three months, how does that encourage people to  get vaccinated? On the other hand, the people who *are* going out  there and eagerly getting vaccines are doing so on the reasonable  assumption that the vaccines work, perhaps not for a lifetime, but for  much longer than 3 months.

Absent surprising new research  findings, they — and I — are going to ignore any public health  directives that tell us to act as though our vaccines are no longer  effective after 90 days.

## You need to be honest and realistic with people

Gottlieb  urged public officials to set date-specific targets for when in the  future they expect to lift restrictions. This provides hope to the  public and a good argument for continuing to comply with restrictions  for now.

""March is a little bit premature, I think, to lift  everything, but certainly getting on a glide path towards lifting a lot  of these provisions right now makes sense,"" he said.

But he is  worried the new CDC guidance about vaccines will instead be ""overly  prescriptive and conservative"" — so onerous that people will just ignore  it. Instead of making it seem like a choice between Texas-style free  for all or months more of tight restrictions — which would result in  many people choosing the former — a middle ground can keep people safe  and encouraged to get the vaccine.

## Tell people they can hug their grandkids again

Gottlieb and Quick both noted that guidance that relaxes restrictions only for interactions among groups where *everyone* is fully vaccinated isn't plausible at a time when the vaccines are not approved for use in children.

A  major reason that older Americans are lining up to get vaccines is so  they can interact with their children and grandchildren in ways they  have not recently been able to do. Vaccines provide extensive protection  to the recipient, especially against severe disease and death, and  those recipients will — and should, if that's what they want — use that  protection to resume closer contact with their relatives, including  unvaccinated children. As Gottlieb notes, they need plausible advice on  how to mitigate remaining risk when doing that, not guidance that tells  them to wait several more months before doing so.

I think that we're going to see at least half of states rescind mask mandates and remove public health restrictions during April. Probably more, which is why I say at least half.

According to the Bloomberg tracker, here are the stats for the Netherlands:

Total doses given: 1,011,426

Doses per 100 people: 5.87

Daily rate of doses administered: 20,120

The Netherlands has a population of 17.28 million.

Jabbing at a rate of 20,120 a day will take (17,280,000 - 1,011,426)/20120 = 808 days. Which is 2.2 years. For just one dose per person.

In order to achieve it by end June (ie. 4 months), you need to jab at the rate of 135,571 a day from tomorrow. In other words, increase your rate of jabbing by a factor of nearly seven *starting tommorow*. To do two doses per person by June, you need to jab at the rate of about 270,000 a day. A fourteen fold increase from what you are doing now.

The longer you leave it, the more you'll need to do each day to catch up. All the evidence is that if the Netherlands is so useless that they can't do more than 20,000 a day, they won't be able to dial up the jabbing to hit the target.

I think that even when mask mandates are lifted, plenty of people will continue to wear them until they feel comfortable, but at some point I think the risk of infection and fatality gets to such a small percentage that it is effectively 0 and it shouldn't be required.

J&amp;J showed efficacy of 64% in South Africa where most cases were the SA variant (20H/501Y.V2), and 68% in Brazil where a majority of cases were the Brazil variant (P.2) - which is to say, the variants in South Africa and Brazil seem to have modestly reduced the efficacy of the J&amp;J vaccine, but not by as much as people were worrying. We don't have efficacy numbers for Pfizer and Moderna against the SA or Brazil variants because their phase 3 trials were conducted before these variants were observed, but we know that lab experiments show that people vaccinated with Pfizer and Moderna have a somewhat diminished immune response to the SA variant so I would expect that just like with J&amp;J they would still be very protective but somewhat less so than the original strain.

None of these three vaccines had phase 3 trials in the UK, but all existing evidence suggests that all vaccines that target the original ancestor strain provoke a similarly strong immune response against the UK variant and would likely show a similar efficacy, which is born out by 89% efficacy of the Novavax vaccine in its UK phase 3 trial and observed effectiveness of AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines in the UK and Israel.

I think pulling back restrictions sends a good message. It tells people that the strong vaccination campaign means a return to normalcy. I feel that's the message that's going to make people root for the vaccine and want to get it themselves.

I understand why Fauci and Biden are cautious about pulling back restrictions, especially dramatic pull backs like Texas and Mississippi, but calling people Neanderthals and saying it's inexplicable to want their normal lives back really doesn't send the message I feel they imagine it does.

Yes, they're being cautious, but they're unintentionally sending the message that vaccinating a fifth of all American adults doesn't matter, and they aren't talking about when the vaccination campaign *will* matter.

Fair enough. But there are still 17.28 million people in the Netherlands, and that just adjusts my figures by about two weeks.

It is literally impossible for the Netherlands to hit the target of two doses per person by end of June unless they do at least 250,000 jabs a day **starting tomorrow**.

We both know that they won't start tomorrow and they won't do 250,000 a day. They're incapable of it, they've been pfaffing around doing hardly anything for months due to laziness.
