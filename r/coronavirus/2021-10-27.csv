Also, with all due respect, I sincerely do not believe you gave ""brain damage"" from a fucking asymptomatic case of COVID at 24. Has a neurologist diagnosed you with such or did you self-diagnose via reddit posts? I believe another possibility is that you're scaring yourself shitless with fears of ""permanent brain damage"" and giving yourself psychosomatic symptoms.

I know you're probably stuck on reddit's echo chambers but I'll give you a news flash: 90% of people don't ""love"" wearing masks. No matter how snug you try to fit them on your face or how 'chic' you try to make them, they pale in comparison to just *not* having one on. 

You say ""masks reduce spread"" but the marginal level of reduction it may reduce the spread of disease does not outweigh the costs to me at all. I seriously cannot imagine a more depressing fucking world than seeing \*everyone\* wear masks at all time in public indefinitely. No society has done this, not even in Japan.

Unfortunately this assertion is not backed up by the article linked by OP. Did you see it? The figure shows that unless a variant more infectious than Delta appears (is that possible?), vaccinating children will have no effect in number of cases (aka spread), hospitalizations and deaths (light and dark blue respectively). 

Now, these models (I'd like to know more where they come from) are only informative to a certain extend. In fact, they are failing to predict the downward trend in US. They may fail also to predict the impact of children vaccination, in one way or another, as it's still a  debatable subject.

A lot of times, if the nurse has a few minutes to spare, they'll hold a phone or iPad up for the patient so they can speak to family, but when the hospital's being crushed by a surge of Covid patients, these family ""visits"" become few and far between. 

And hospitals are pretty damn serious about preventing the spread of Covid in their facilities, utilizing negative-pressure rooms and the like, so I wouldn't be surprised if the patient's room was a paper-free zone (not just legal documents, as is being portrayed to drum up public outrage). This is because Covid survives longer than the typical virus on paper and other surfaces, so it's more of an infection risk. 

If the family has a limited capacity to understand the procedures being performed on their loved one, and if they were already predisposed to believe the hospital was ""the devil"", then it's very likely that they came to the wrong conclusions about what was happening.

Here's my understanding:

Covid, transferred through mucus, is infectious
 mostly by touch, but also has airborne risks.

Human coronaviruses measure between 0.1 and 0.2 microns, or generally about 100-125 nanometers in size,
and can easily pass through plain cloth barriers.
An n95 mask can only filter .30 microns.

Common surgical masks are made from Polypropylene fibers, they are supposed to filter out particles above 1 micron although its efficiency is widely debated.

If a person sneezes or coughs a mask would help contain the mucus, but in reverse,
the masks may well block the virus-laden droplets but the virus is still infectious on the mask. The
water molecules will evaporate and the virii can/will get inhaled. 

Surgical masks may be more effective if soaked in brine, killing the virii on contact.

Inertial impaction, interception, diffusion; the virus is just too small to be diffused. The molecule will evaporate and the virus inhaled",,,,1635385149,{},hibryzx,False,t3_qgzoiq,False,True,t1_hiajwnl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qgzoiq/wearing_face_coverings_protected_wearers_from/hibryzx/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,5ddf89ef707765cb00c998b5214a8ae2f198e3ab,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1635385164.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

depends.  a lot of them are.  risked my life working third shift at a convenience store for that matter.  and as I type this through my glasses with side shields on them, risk mitigation is critical to all things.  PPE should go without saying.  especially for proctologists.  On that note, the vaccines are the best risk mitigation tool we have right now.

&gt;If after all that they believe the risk is too great, then they need to find a new job.

Precisely why I don't do medicine.  I'd make it too risky.  i won't even drive because its too risky for me.

Basically all studies of mix and match were with Moderna FULL dose ONLY.

Moderna's application for boosters had a study in which there were people who had Moderna 3 doses.  The first 2 doses were FULL dose.   The last one was half dose.

Moderna argued that half dose had a much lower side effect profile.  It did result in  a lower antibody response vs Full dose.  However, because the people who got  2 Full doses of Moderna within the past 180-200 days already had sufficient protection it didn't matter.

Again Pfizer during their presentation showed that they needed the exact same dose for the 3rd (as the 1st 2)  to restore immunity levels at 95%.

Now the problem is that there  is NO SINGLE study with half dose Moderna and mix and match.   There is one study (Still ongoing) with all Mix match combinations in different groups, but that is again STILL FULL dose Moderna!

That study shows the efficacy of full dose Moderna as dose 3 regardless of 1st 2 doses is the HIGHEST among all combinations.

[],,MMbasic,,,[],,,,text,t2_11g516,False,False,[],"To be fair, the Reuters article skips around quite a bit.  The format is weird:  goes from the genetics study, to pregnant women, and then talks about obesity and how the virus is harbored in fat cells.

To your point ... 

&gt;They are arguing as if **all** Covid is due to obesity or other preconditions.

No, no one here would ever say ""all"" meaning 100.0%, but I (perhaps 'we') think the overwhelming majority of case-load is due to our obesity (and the comorbidities that arise from that), and advanced age (can't do anything about the latter).  

In that vien (not ""all"", and the opposite: very very ""few"") ... the study even is based around the very few (as the covid-stats clearly bare this out) young, supposedly not-""comorbid"" ...i.e. ""healthy"" ...explaining the few unicorns that have a hard time with COVID might have a genetic predisposition to a C19-cytokyne storm ... and how that trail of crumbs might lead to a pharmaceutical invention/discovery to help not only the unicorns, but could hopefully be applied to the entire patent cohort as a whole.

===============

Also, pulling out the subject data from the actual study .... the BMI of the three groups was right at 30.0.  The critical group was 30.2.  As u/whichwitch9 points out, obesity and overweight might be the same thing at this point.    So IDK man ...maybe IT IS ""all"" due to obesity (or ""overweight""ness).  This would lead me to believe that obesity is a bigger risk (or as big of risk) than the other conditions (heart disease and diabetes) that these subjects were said NOT to have, that qualified them as ""healthy young people"".  

article:

&gt;French researchers studied 72 hospitalized COVID-19 patients under age 50, including 47 who were critically ill and 25 with non-critical illness, plus 22 healthy volunteers. None of the patients had any of the chronic conditions known to increase the risk for poor outcomes, such as heart disease or diabetes. 

The actual study uses language like:

&gt;A young, **comorbidity-free patient cohort** was analyzed by a multiomics approach

I guess if you totally ignore obesity as a comorbidity in and among itself, I guess they were healthy.    They probably couldn't even find a decent pool of subjects (*n=*a lot)  BMI 18 to 25, under the age of 50, that had critical cases and/or Long Covid^(TM) .... *""these people, statistically, don't exist"".*

I think it was an accident, but the last paragraph in the Reuters article actually points out the shortcomings in the study (they ignored their subject pool was a bunch people with excess body fat, and were not ""healthy"").   But so be it, if all this leads the researchers to a method to preemptively ""shut off"" a future cytokine storm in newly diagnosed C19 patients ....the more power to them.

&gt;After weeks of decline, infections in Europe have risen over the last three consecutive weeks, even as cases fall in every other region across the world, according to WHO. There were nearly 3 million new Covid cases reported worldwide for the week ended Sunday, an increase of 4% from the previous seven days, according to WHO‚Äôs most recent epidemiological update.

&gt;Globally, Covid cases had fallen 4% the week before, despite a 7% increase across Europe over that same period. Cases in Europe surged by 18% over the last week alone, WHO data shows.

&gt;‚ÄúThe global number of reported cases and deaths from Covid-19 is now increasing for the first time in two months, driven by an ongoing rise in Europe that outweighs declines in other regions,‚Äù WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs another reminder that the Covid-19 pandemic is far from over.‚Äù

&gt;Covid has surged sharply in Czechia and Hungary, where the seven-day average of cases swelled more than 100% from the previous week as of Wednesday, according to a CNBC analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University. Croatia, Denmark, Norway and Poland each recorded weekly average case increases of more than 70% on Wednesday, JHU found.

&gt;Russia reported a record-high seven-day average of more than 35,800 new cases on Tuesday, 10% higher than the week before, JHU measured. Ukraine‚Äôs seven-day average of over 21,900 new cases ‚Äì a 43% jump from the previous week ‚Äì represented a pandemic high as well.

&gt;Both countries also tallied record-high deaths over that period, JHU calculated.

&gt;The evolving delta variant and the approaching winter season could also fuel outbreaks, said Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO‚Äôs technical lead on Covid. Van Kerkhove said the organization is tracking more than 30 delta sublineages, including the AY.4.2 subvariant, or delta plus, a mutation that‚Äôs gaining ground in the U.K. and could be even more contagious than the original variant.

&gt;‚ÄúEntering the winter months where people tend to spend much more time indoors, in close proximity, perhaps in rooms where there is not good ventilation, cases will increase,‚Äù Van Kerkhove said.

&gt;Delta plus has been detected in 42 countries, but 93% of cases sequenced with the subvariant are in the U.K., according to WHO data. Delta plus features two new adaptations to the spike protein, A222V and Y145H, that enable the virus to enter the body.",,,,1635448021,{},hif15jb,True,t3_qhu43t,False,False,t3_qhu43t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qhu43t/global_covid_cases_and_deaths_rise_for_the_first/hif15jb/,1635625810.0,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;Economic growth slowed sharply over the summer, the government reported Thursday, reflecting the resurgent pandemic‚Äôs impact in keeping consumers at home and the supply-chain bottlenecks that led to empty shelves and higher prices.

&gt;The outlook for the rest of the year is mixed: The pandemic‚Äôs grip is easing. The supply-chain issues, by and large, are not.

&gt;Gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, grew 0.5 percent in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said. That was down from 1.6 percent in the second quarter and represented the weakest growth since the recovery from the pandemic began in the spring.

&gt;As recently as July, economists predicted that the recovery would gain steam in the second half of the year as widespread vaccination allowed students to return to schools, workers to return to jobs and consumers to return to restaurants and hotels.

&gt;At the time, the recovery looked on track, and it looked like it was going to pick up,‚Äù recalled Ben Herzon, executive director of IHS Markit, a forecasting firm. ‚ÄúBased on how things were looking, it could only get better.‚Äù

&gt;But that was before the spread of the Delta variant led to a new wave of coronavirus cases across much of the country, and before the full impact of global supply-chain snarls became clear.

&gt;The good news for the economy is that the direct damage done by the Delta variant was relatively modest and has begun to fade. Spending at hotels and restaurants rose in the third quarter, although more slowly than earlier in the year. More recent data from OpenTable, the restaurant-reservation app, and the Transportation Security Administration suggest that dining and air travel have begun to rebound as virus cases have fallen.

&gt; The bigger factor in the summer slowdown was the supply-chain issues that have made it hard for U.S. stores and factories to get the products and parts they need. Spending on goods fell 2.4 percent in the third quarter, adjusted for inflation, led by a steep drop in sales of cars and other long-lasting manufactured goods.

One of the big challenges with research in academia, is that you can cut up poorly designed studies to draw many different conclusions. With corporate backed research, this is often by design so that the study they fund can be spun to support their business, regardless of what the study gathers. Collect enough variables and lack proper controls? You can make data say whatever you want.

Now, is that what's happening here? Well, always check your sources- and this means looking at what financial interests are disclosed in every bit of research you consume. In this case:

I'm just surprised FDA allowed Mix and Match with half dose.  All studies of Pfizer + Pfizer + Moderna are on the FULL dose.

Losing your sense of taste and smell is linked to brain damage... People with Alzheimer's often have these problems. What do you think controls these processes? You think you just loss some taste buds? Cause if that were the case the first time you burned your tongue you wouldn't taste again. It's because it effects your brain and losing neuronal connections in one region can effect others. You are not just ""losing your taste and smell"" or just getting ""brain fog"". The media has truly down played the long term symptoms and stating people usually get better, that's not the case. I've never had anxiety. From someone that hasn't experienced it it is easy for you to say. Your way of thinking is the exact reason why people getting these long term symptoms wrote off. My friend was told he had anxiety after getting long COVID. Then his doctor got long COVID and changed his tone real quick about that diagnosis.

Yeah I have been diagnosed with limbic encephalitis by a neurologist. Spent time in the hospital having seizures 5 months post. I didn't have any problem till a couple weeks after infection then the storm started. This is typical of these long term symptoms to start later.

The problem is the general public has no clue what is happening. The media is extremely misleading about these long term symptoms. You know they used to tell people with MS that it was psychosomatic. Guess what? Later on they found out it wasn't. 

The brain fog you refer too with anxiety is not at all like this brain fog which is due to brain inflammation.

Go to a population where people interact more, then the local R0 is higher there. Have subpopulations (such as children who regularly interact within themselves) who lack immunity and the virus can easily spread there. So even with 100% of adults vaccinated with 100% immunity, the virus would likely continue to circulate in sub-populations for a while. 

  
Also, it ignores the stochastic natural of the real world. So simply because you reach the level that would over a long time horizon eventually eradicate the disease, you can still have spikes and waves. And then you have external sources of the disease. 

So for a place like Singapore that has had such a limited exposure to covid19, the children have no immunity at all. Nor do the 15% of people who haven't been vaccinated. And the people who were vaccinated 3+ months ago have limited reduction in transmission.

The population ratio is 100.88 (dose/100 people), and the country has been vaccinated about 23.637 million people, reaching the vaccination goal ahead of schedule.

&gt;The command center explained that Taiwan should formulate a COVID-19 vaccination policy with reference to the expert committee of the ""Infectious Disease Prevention Advisory Committee (ACIP) of the Ministry of Health and Welfare"". Personnel, public security and other social function personnel, as well as those who maintain institutions and the operation of the social welfare care system are vaccinated against COVID-19.

&gt;The command center further explained that as the domestic self-purchasing COVID-19 vaccines are gradually in place, and other countries and domestic companies have successively donated COVID-19 vaccines, they continue to promote vaccination operations and gradually open up universal vaccination. At present, there are various risks of domestic COVID-19 vaccines.

The command center sincerely thanks the nationwide COVID-19 vaccination. For the hard work and dedication of the medical staff and staff, we are also grateful to the Chinese for cooperating in order to vaccinate.

""Let's move forward no matter the cost in human life!"" seems to me to be a hideous way to view your neighbors.


&gt; We missed 18 months worth of school. 

Because you people didn't take it seriously. Others purposely spread misinformation about it.

&gt; We have thousands of businesses that will never reopen. 

Because you people didn't take it seriously.


&gt; We have people who are scared out of their mind of covid. 

Because you people didn't take it seriously *and* others purposely spread misinformation about it.

&gt; The mental health and the country has taken a nosedive. 

 You're probably too young to realize that started in the 1980s with Reagan.

&gt; We now have an effective vaccine in fact we have three of them. They are widely available, they are free.

Which, considering it can Kill you and other people, means there needs to be wider adoption of vaccination. 

&gt;  People make a choice. 

 If it was just a matter of them making a personal choice that affected only them, I wouldn't have a problem with it. However, since they're infecting and killing other people, it becomes a problem.

&gt;They want to be safe, they get vaccinated. Once they've made that choice, there is not much we can do other than to encourage them to be vaccinated. 

 If they want to be mutation factories, kill other Americans, and *still* think they have no responsibility, then they don't deserve the associated freedoms.  I don't hear you talking about prisoners having all the same rights as all the rest of us.


&gt;Moving on is In the best interest of the country. 

As per above, that's completely ridiculous. 

&gt; The continual fixation on covid is not healthy.

 So get everybody vaccinated to the point of herd immunity, and we can be done with it. Sheesh.


&gt; In fact I argue it is a bigger risk today than covid. 

 Only from a completely selfish viewpoint.

&gt; People like you and others on this thread want to obsess over covid forever. 

 No, I'm waiting for you people to realize there are things larger than your individual freedom over a scrap of cloth that no way hurts you, that a vaccination that is safer than getting covid, and the desire to stop seeing more people die. Who roots for more death‚ÄΩ Seems nigh-sociopathic.

&gt;Much of the country has already moved on. 

 And they are filling the IC u's and causing medical professionals to quit  in droves. *Nice job...*

Technically there may be a ""best"" which is the highest amount of antibodies in which case you stay with Moderna, but at the end of the day what is the practical effect. Is someone with 3 Pfizer doses going ot be significantly worse off than 2 Pfizers + 1/2 Moderna boost? It might be a negligible difference in risk in the end, and even if it isn't for a single individual, is it going to broadly change the way case trends end up at a city/county/state level?

And let's say Moderna IS the golden vaccine. Do you now start announcing that and everyone starts avoiding the others? Do we throw away J&amp;J vaccines and Pfizer doses? Do we ship them to other countries? I mean that doesn't look good either. This is the same problem with the J&amp;J vaccine to begin with. We all know that studies show it as 3rd place, but all the public campaigns focus on trying to soothe people over the differences by moving the goalposts to ICU % prevention or death prevention. We don't want to discourage anyone from getting it, but it's clear the public has already been dissuaded.

I think at some point if we're just saying to everyone ""just get the shot and don't worry about the small differences"" then maybe we should do the same here.

That doesn't mean we can't debate it out which I love to do and to get more data on, but at the end of the day you're at the clinic and you need to make a choice. I don't think there's really a wrong choice either so whether you want to go with gut feeling, sticking with the same manufacturer, going for optimal antibodies, it's all just fine.

OC isnt' saying stick to what works because it is the best.

That means that we would reach herd immunity if (1-1/5.5)~82% of the population had 100% immunity.  Vaccines don't give 100% immunity, so you we need to vaccinate more than 82% of the population. How much more depends on the efficacy of the vaccine and also by what factor does it decrease the likelihood of transmission if vaccinated person becomes infection. In Singapore, 85% vaccinated doesn't achieve the desired goal. The efficacy of pfizer against infection drops below 50% after 6 months. In other words, if 85% Singaporeans are vaccinated with 50% efficacy, that's equivalent to 42.5% of the population with complete immunity. Not nearly enough. 

What I was saying is that certain vaccines (like pfizer and moderna) give strong enough protection to reach herd immunity if 85-90% of the population is vaccinated and if that protection is maintained via boosters.

&gt;For most of the pandemic the ZOE study‚Äôs estimate of positive cases has been roughly in line with official figures. But on 26 October the ZOE study estimated 92‚Äâ500 new covid cases in the UK that day, whereas the UK‚Äôs official covid website shows that only 40‚Äâ000-50‚Äâ000 people have been testing positive for covid each day recently.3 For most of the pandemic the ZOE study‚Äôs estimate of positive cases has been roughly in line with official figures. But on 26 October the ZOE study estimated 92‚Äâ500 new covid cases in the UK that day, whereas the UK‚Äôs official covid website shows that only 40‚Äâ000-50‚Äâ000 people have been testing positive for covid each day recently.3

&gt;‚Ä¶

&gt;The ZOE app asks users for many different types of data, including PCR or antibody test results and vaccination status.

&gt;Irene Petersen, professor of epidemiology and health informatics at University College London, said it was possible that some users of the app were recording infections that had actually occurred a few weeks ago, since people can still test positive for the virus after they have recovered from it. ‚ÄúYou report, let‚Äôs say, a headache or a fever to ZOE, and you get a PCR test and the PCR test is positive, but that‚Äôs not because you have covid now but because you had covid two weeks ago,‚Äù she said.

&gt;However, Petersen acknowledged that this scenario could explain some of the discrepancies seen and that the UK‚Äôs official figures probably did underestimate the severity of the current situation. ‚ÄúI think we are probably somewhere in between the two estimates,‚Äù she said.

&gt;Spector said that the general public might be less likely to come forward for a covid test at the moment because of the Immensa scandal,5 in which a laboratory in Wolverhampton was found to have issued around 43‚Äâ000 false negative results from 8 September to 12 October. This could be deflating the government‚Äôs case count.

&gt;‚ÄùI just think it‚Äôs really bad news,‚Äù he said, referring to the high estimates of UK cases at present. He suggested that the government should enforce mask wearing on public transport and in crowded places and should speed up the vaccination and booster programme.

They traveled through Gansu Province and Inner Mongolia, staying at a bed-and-breakfast and eating three times at the same lamb chop restaurant. Flying south to Xi‚Äôan, they dropped in to a 1,300-year-old temple. Their fellow tour group members checked out an art museum, strolled through parks and visited friends.

&gt;Then, on Oct. 16, the day they had planned to visit the Terracotta Warriors, the couple tested positive for the coronavirus.

&gt;Since then, China has locked down a city of 4 million, as well as several smaller cities and parts of Beijing, to contain a fresh outbreak that has infected more than 240 people in at least 11 provinces and regions. The authorities have shuttered schools and tourist sites. Government websites have detailed every movement of the unlucky couple and their sprawling web of contacts, including what time they checked into hotels and on which floors of restaurants they sat.

&gt;The no-holds-barred response is emblematic of China‚Äôs ‚Äúzero Covid‚Äù policy, which has served the country remarkably well: China has reported fewer than 5,000 deaths since the pandemic began. The scale of the new outbreak, while tiny compared to many other countries, is large for China.

&gt; But the policy has also, increasingly, made China an outlier. The rest of the world is reopening, including New Zealand and Australia, which also once embraced zero tolerance. China is now the only country still chasing full eradication of the virus.

&gt;Every locality should firmly adhere to the policy of ‚ÄòDefend externally against importation, defend internally against rebound,‚Äô‚Äù Mi Feng, a spokesman for the National Health Commission, said at a news conference on Sunday. ‚ÄúThe current control measures cannot be relaxed.‚Äù

&gt;The government‚Äôs strict strategy is the product of a uniquely Chinese set of calculations. Its thriving exports have helped to keep the economy afloat. The ruling Communist Party‚Äôs tight grip on power enables lockdowns and testing to be carried out with astonishing efficiency. Beijing is set to host the Winter Olympics in February.

&gt;For many Chinese, the low case numbers have become a source of national pride. Xi Jinping, China‚Äôs leader, has repeatedly pointed to the country‚Äôs success in containment as proof of the superiority of its governance model.

&gt;But experts ‚Äî both in China and abroad ‚Äî have warned that the approach is unsustainable. China may find itself increasingly isolated, diplomatically and economically, at a time when global public opinion is hardening against it.

&gt;‚ÄùThe regime thinks it needs to maintain a ‚Äòzero Covid‚Äô policy to maintain its legitimacy,‚Äù said Lynette Ong, a political scientist at the University of Toronto. ‚ÄúAt a huge cost, though.‚Äù

&gt;""Concerns about waning immunity and breakthrough cases have likely been overblown,"" Brownstein said.

Who is Brownstein? ""John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at *Boston Children's Hospital*...."" Hey, look at that, yet another pediatrician talking about how the effects of covid have been overblown. 

Pediatricians have been, collectively, the most wrong of any expert specialty group since the pandemic began, and always on the side of ""just another flu"" and ""children aren't contagious like grown-ups"" and ""keep the schools wide open, teachers be damned."" And that's all fine, if your constuency is aged five, and live only with people under the age of 25. 

And then their PICUs started to fill up after Delta, and all of a sudden it was alarm bells everywhere. Now that that's done, and people are worried about breakthrough infections and long covid, here we go again with downplaying the risks to mature people.

I have known some pediatricians who were among the most saintly doctors I ever met, but then again, I have also known a lot of them who were the most ferociously arrogant, self-righteous assholes I have ever met. Don't agree with them? Must be because you hate children.

Then there's this guy Offit, whose attitude speaks for itself: 

&gt;""It's the unusual vaccine that protects you against mild illness,"" Offit said. ""It's OK to get infected. It really is. You just don't want to get seriously infected.""

Huh, funny coincidence: Offit is a *pediatric* epidemiologist. I wonder if the ICU docs and gerontologists concur? Certainly these people don't:

&gt;""On the other hand,"" the research team reported on medRxiv on Tuesday   
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.26.21265508v1 ahead of   
peer review, ""previous vaccination does not appear to protect against   
several previously documented outcomes of COVID-19 such as long COVID   
features, arrhythmia, joint pain, Type 2 diabetes, liver disease, sleep   
disorders, and mood and anxiety disorders."" The absence of protection   
from long COVID ""is concerning given the high incidence and burden"" of   
these lasting problems, they added.

From today's report, [https://news.yahoo.com/breakthrough-infections-lead-long-covid-182622434.html](https://news.yahoo.com/breakthrough-infections-lead-long-covid-182622434.html)

And then there's this gem:

&gt; And there are concerns that frequent boosting could dull the immune   
system's ability to fight future variants, because the boosters could   
focus the immune response on the COVID-19 strain used to make the   
current vaccines.

I guess based on the concept of Original Antigenic Sin. That is the same hypothesis that gives the immunological rationale behind preliminary study results showing that if people get a flu that is not covered in their annual vaccine, they do worse than if those who hadn't received the vaccine that year. Actually *negative flu vaccine effectiveness* in some groups--but that could be a study artifact, of course. 

But it's notable how that OAS argument isn't used much in the context of flu shots--nobody is trying to persuade people ""not to jump the gun,"" and to wait prudentially until the circulating strains are identified, and then go get vaccinated. While OAS may even be a completely wrong argument, it would certainly be counter-productive in trying to arrange some degree of collective immunity in advance of the season. And yet the argument for covid is completely detached from that reasoning, which I'm sure these people would find monstrous if it were trotted out for the children in their care.",,,,1635434930,{},hie3nyb,False,t3_qho9mw,False,True,t3_qho9mw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qho9mw/as_booster_shots_roll_out_nationwide_scientists/hie3nyb/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,b6c899a01160b75d0b4e3141f7b21fa0fef02392,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1635434945.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

First, vaccine mandates will not go away (and there will be many local issues as schools start mandating it). 

Second, given the uncertainty (will there be a new variant?) and local variations (Colorado's cases are increasing right now, for example), it will probably NOT be appropriate to end \*all\* restrictions then on the whole USA, much less in the world.

Third, there's bureaucratic inertia, and politics, and many different local authorities. Even after it's clear we should eliminate, say, mask mandates in Podunk Township, there will need to be a council meeting, and they meet every 3 months ... and if the mayor won the election by pushing COVID restrictions, then it may take them longer, politically, to get there.

Fourth, a lot of the restrictions are not government mandated, but by private companies. If you work retail, you will probably keep your mask, since it shows your company 'cares' about its clients. Some venues may still (officially) require masks for insurance reasons, etc

Chances are, if nothing else happens, we will have fewer and fewer restrictions over 2022, ending with just vaccination mandates, some construction/business restrictions (like better ventilation systems), and a few weird things, like the quaint little town of Podunk still requiring masks until the next century.",,,,1635434389,{},hie2bvx,False,t3_qhkn7a,False,True,t1_hidjhzh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qhkn7a/covid_cases_fall_by_20/hie2bvx/,1635605221.0,-4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Russia downplayed the daily deaths and new cases during all the pandemic. Last year they reported 56k Covid deaths, while having 362k excess deaths. [New York Times.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210411015946/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/10/world/europe/covid-russia-death.html) Russia still underreport deaths. Yes, US and some other western countries do undercount too, but not close to the undercount that is in Russia. While some other countries maybe got a ration of excess death vs reported covid death of 1.1-1.2 Russia got over 4. E.g. [The economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-tracker)  


US said 100 million vaccine doses in 100 days, outcome was 200 million doses in 100 days. Russia said 60% fully vaccinated in September, with the outcome that now 33% is fully vaccinated. (And how many got e.g. EpiVac and Sputnik light or just bought a vaccine cert?)  


Russia still cannot get Sputnik V approved by WHO and EU, by still failing to provide data and documents.

In Russia the downplaying of pandemic, giving mixed messaged, spreading anti-vaxx propaganda and general mistrusting the government gives the result of 33% fully vaccinated, daily new records and new lockdowns.

States like New Mexico led the nation in vaccination efforts very early on.  New Mexico also has one of the highest vaccinated populations in the country.  Currently 72.3% fully vaccinated 18+, 81.9% at least 1 shot and for adolescents is 54.2% fully vaccinated with 62.4% with at least 1 shot.  Yet for the last 7 weeks.  New Mexico has seen a steady increase in cases creating that hot spot you see on the map.

On the surface you would ask ""why are their numbers going up when they are way more vaccinated than most and only have about 16 people per square mile in their population?

&amp;#x200B;

First in, first out.  That's why.  We know immunity provided by these mRNA vaccines starts to wane at 6 months.  So New Mexico is seeing that before the states around them that got their vaccination efforts up and running later.  

&amp;#x200B;

So those hot spots, like New Mexico.  They are literally a window into everyone else's future.  When the states around them start to hit that 6 months post vaccination mark where their immunity starts to wane, you'll see their cases go up as well.  What will matter most in those situations is what the actual vaccinated percentage in that state looks like when it does, and the population density they have given the increased infectiousness of the delta (and delta+ which has been sequenced in the United States).

First they state that there's zero evidence for the lab creation theory, which is huge. Second, they explain that we don't have the technical ability or know-how to create the subtle mutations or changes necessary to make this virus, especially regarding the mechanisms that make it more transmissible, and that changes like that, especially ones that make it highly transmissible and readily adaptive to a particular host, humans, doesn't happen in just one generation of changes in a lab, it happens over many. These are excellent observations, particularly the one that is in my opinion really worth the most focus, that we have no clue how to edit genes and use those subtle and domino effect like changes to craft new mechanism. These changes are like slapping Ikea parts together, the functionality isn't clear, and how they'll change and function over time with further mutations isn't clear. At all. We simply do not have the smarts or capabilities to craft viruses on this level yet. That is compelling as an argument, and not just a shrug and a guess. Great claims require great evidence. People claimed it was lab leaked. This explains not only that those people didn't provide great evidence, which is enough to debunk the claims and move on, but they go on to explain that we don't even as a species yet have the understanding to built viral mechanisms and changes like this yet.

For more indepth info WHO issued an article today aswell

Furter:

At least ten percent of Africa's population should be fully immunized by the end of September, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has to say goodbye to this goal. ""If it continues like this, I fear that 42 African countries will not achieve this goal - that would be almost 80 percent of the continent,"" explains Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director.

In Africa, across the continent, less than three percent of the population is currently fully immunized. According to the commission, it is 70 percent of the adult population in the EU. ""It's a vaccine apartheid,"" says Ahmed Kalebi, medical advisor and pathologist. He is expressing what many are thinking here. ""It is a worldwide discrimination in which some countries have everything. There up to 65 percent are vaccinated and they have enough supplies. Two to three times more than their population.""

[...]

Covax has pledged to deliver vaccine to 30 percent of Africa's population by September 2022, according to the African Union. The African Union is also buying a further 400 million cans of Johnson &amp; Johnson for the continent. Even if everything is delivered and everything goes as planned, the people on the continent will not be as far along as Germany and other rich countries are today for a year.

[...]
Despite the high demand, there are unused vaccine doses on the continent that cannot be used or that are destroyed. There are several reasons for that. In some cases, the donated vaccine expired quickly.

[...]

Because even the targeted 60 percent immunization by next September will not be enough, we already know that. ""If you look at the USA and Israel, you see that that might not be enough,"" says Masiyiwa. ""The WHO is already pushing us to target 70 percent."" Then Africa needs more vaccine. https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/afrika/pandemie-impfstoff-afrika-101.html

---

So, africa is a big continent and every country faces other challenges, sub-saharan countries are at highest risk, but globally there is not enough vaccines, well within the end of 2022 even.

You are saying the government should pressure the people directly. But flexing their muscle in this way is always risky for any government. Because what happens if nobody cares?

The vast majority of Russians know that their government is corrupt. But they don't care as long as they have bread and circuses - and as long as the government keeps out of their lives. Mandating a vaccine nobody wants might cross that red line.

Putin can easily deal with environmentalist and human rights activists, because there's few of them.

I mean, what is a good vaccination rate? Its not great compared to many of our european partners. Of course you could compare to east europe, but its a bad practise to look at those countries who have the highest incidence globally. According to calculations of RKI, and with international science behind it, our vaccination rate is not high enough to be the sole factor to stop heavy burden on hospitals and deaths. A vaccination rate of 85% is needed and achievable, quote:

&gt; On the basis of the mathematical models presented here and the results of the surveys on vaccination acceptance, we consider a target vaccination rate (vaccination protection through full vaccination) of 85% for 12‚Äì59 year olds and 90% for people aged 60 and over necessary and also achievable. If this vaccination quota is reached in time, a pronounced 4th wave in the coming autumn / winter seems unlikely, provided that the population continues to adhere to the basic hygiene measures in addition to vaccination and, if the number of infections increases again, reduces contacts to a certain extent. https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2021/Ausgaben/27_21.pdf?__blob=publicationFile

What does that mean? We still need nonpharmacuetical measures like masks, distancing, frequent air filter.

Now, let me finish with an anecdote: Rode the train this week, mask mandate is in effect. On one stop only i found 10 people on that train who thought its a perfect time to eat in the train. In the hospital the doctor walked around between rooms without a mask, which he isnt allowed to. When he saw me he wore the mask but put it down to ask if i would recognize him...like wtf..how is that important? TLDR, people spend more time indoors and dont follow mandates pretty much anymore, too low vaccination rate.",,,,1635455082,{},hifis4w,False,t3_qho650,False,False,t1_hidz3dq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qho650/germany_hospitals_reach_critical_pandemic_moment/hifis4w/,1635635818.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚ÄúIn a religiously pluralistic society, we have to respect people‚Äôs religious objections,‚Äù said Peter Breen, an attorney representing the doctor and her co-plaintiff, a medical student at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.  
CU responded in court by quoting from an 1878 U.S. Supreme Court decision: ‚ÄúTo permit this would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself.‚Äù  
Ultimately, the Supreme Court could decide again. But beyond the courtroom battle, the case shows the difficulty Colorado hospitals and other health care organizations have faced in sorting out what is a valid religious exemption to the COVID vaccine mandate, what is not and whether they should be making that decision at all.  
‚ÄúThe standard for a sincerely held religious belief is so general, it‚Äôs open to different kinds of arguments,‚Äù said Christopher Jackson, a Denver-based attorney who specializes in constitutional and appellate law.  


and

The two plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit against CU are anonymous ‚Äî they go by Dr. Jane Doe and John Doe in the court documents.  
Both say that requiring them to take a coronavirus vaccine conflicts with their religious beliefs. The doctor, who is Catholic, and the medical student, who is Buddhist, say they are opposed to the use of cell lines that were derived from cells taken decades ago from aborted fetuses. The plaintiffs say the cell lines, which are frequently used in medical research, were used in either the production or testing of the three coronavirus vaccines currently approved in the United States.   
The student also says he has a religious objection to vaccination in general.  


Officials on the University of Colorado‚Äôs Anschutz Medical Campus denied their requests for a religious exemption. In court filings, the university questions whether the plaintiffs‚Äô religious objections are sincere, noting that the student has received at least once vaccine previously and that the doctor regularly prescribes medicines that were tested using the same cell lines.  
‚ÄúPlaintiffs‚Äô failure to raise prior objections to vaccinations and medications demonstrates that their professed religious objection to these vaccines is not a ‚Äòsincerely held belief,‚Äô but rather a personal, or perhaps a political, choice,‚Äù the university wrote in one case filing.  
CU also notes that major leaders of the plaintiffs‚Äô religions ‚Äî including, in the case of Catholicism, the pope ‚Äî have spoken in favor of vaccination against COVID.",,,,1635389398,{},hic1fi2,True,t3_qhd5i6,False,False,t3_qhd5i6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qhd5i6/a_colorado_lawsuit_is_testing_the_boundaries_of/hic1fi2/,1635567034.0,16,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND  
Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) disproportionately results in hospitalization or death in older patients and those with underlying conditions. Sotrovimab is a pan-sarbecovirus monoclonal antibody that was designed to prevent progression of Covid-19 in high-risk patients early in the course of disease.  
  
METHODS  
In this ongoing, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, nonhospitalized patients with symptomatic Covid-19 (‚â§5 days after the onset of symptoms) and at least one risk factor for disease progression to receive a single infusion of sotrovimab at a dose of 500 mg or placebo. The primary efficacy outcome was hospitalization (for &gt;24 hours) for any cause or death within 29 days after randomization.  
  
RESULTS  
In this prespecified interim analysis, which included an intention-to-treat population of 583 patients (291 in the sotrovimab group and 292 in the placebo group), 3 patients (1%) in the sotrovimab group, as compared with 21 patients (7%) in the placebo group, had disease progression leading to hospitalization or death (relative risk reduction, 85%; 97.24% confidence interval, 44 to 96; P=0.002). In the placebo group, 5 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, including 1 who died by day 29. Safety was assessed in 868 patients (430 in the sotrovimab group and 438 in the placebo group). Adverse events were reported by 17% of the patients in the sotrovimab group and 19% of those in the placebo group; serious adverse events were less common with sotrovimab than with placebo (in 2% and 6% of the patients, respectively).  
  
CONCLUSIONS  
Among high-risk patients with mild-to-moderate Covid-19, sotrovimab reduced the risk of disease progression. No safety signals were identified.

&gt;*--Coronavirus found to infect fat cells--*  
*Obesity is a known risk factor for more severe COVID-19. One likely reason may be that the virus can infect fat cells, researchers have discovered. In lab experiments and in autopsies of patients who died of COVID-19, they found the virus infects two types of cells found in fat tissue: mature fat cells, called adipocytes, and immune cells called macrophages. ""Infection of fat cells led to a marked inflammatory response, consistent with the type of immune response that is seen in severe cases of COVID-19,"" said Dr. Catherine Blish of Stanford University School of Medicine, whose team reported the findings on bioRxiv on Monday ahead of peer review. ""These data suggest that infection of fat tissue and its associated inflammatory response may be one of the reasons why obese individuals do so poorly when infected with SARS-CoV-2,"" she said.*

When the C19 patient data came out in mid 2020, showing how most of the hospitalized or deaths were either: old, obese, had 2+ comorbidities (commonly linked to the prev mentioned obesity) .... and the stuff about vitamin D...  I went on the offensive: lost 30 pounds thru diet and exercise.  Started testing my Vit D levels and supplementing and getting more sun (went from 25 ng/mL --&gt; 60).   That stuff you can fix and control.  I can't un-age myself.  I can't control the people around me.  I can't control the vaccines, which now they say now fade substantially in effectiveness after 4-9 months....and don't even stop infection in the first place.

These 'improvements' are not hard to do, and is going to make everyone's response to the (eventual) infection, AND THEIR RESPONSE TO VACCINATION, much more favorable ... and it goes without saying, fix a whole host of problems going forward.

Children will likely be less vaccinated because so few of them actually get seriously sick so their parents may think it not worth the risk.

Anecdotally, February 14th, 2020... I thought I was going to die. I was feeling sick as hell and couldn't breathe well. I took it upon myself to wear a mask early and stay away from people as much as I could. When I went to a doctor, they told me it was only an upper respiratory infection, but they didn't do a COVID-19 test at all. They only asked my symptoms and gave me medicine based off of that.

I'm sure many people got antibodies from COVID-19 already. However, it's important to understand that the virus can still mutate too. So it's still very important to get vaccinated. All it takes is for a coronavirus to do enough mutation in order to not be targetable by the mRNA vaccine. This is why scientists have been careful to track new strains of COVID-19. If any of the newer strains has a higher infectiousness and is not vulnerable to our current vaccines, it would send the whole world into lockdown again.",,,,1635436042,{},hie6gq7,False,t3_qhkn7a,False,True,t1_hidunvp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qhkn7a/covid_cases_fall_by_20/hie6gq7/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,e58b7d7d36213378339c351099b50e3d3fc37694,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1635436061.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

For both partially vaccinated and fully vaccinated, the hazard ratios for long COVID specifically are close to 1 (1 is within the confidence interval). In fact, the hazard ratio for partially vaccinated is slightly lower for long COVID. See the appendix of the [study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.26.21265508v1.full.pdf) for a plot showing this. 

The authors did include this: 
&gt;Instead, these negative findings might indicate that these 
outcomes arise through different pathophysiological mechanisms than outcomes which are 
affected by prior vaccination. For example, for anxiety and depression, it might be that 
antagonistic forces are at play with the protective effect of the vaccine being counteracted by 
the additional stressor of being infected despite being vaccinated. 
The absence of a protective effect against long-COVID features is concerning given the high 
incidence and burden of these sequelae of COVID-19. However, the risk of several 
individual long-COVID features were significantly associated with prior vaccination (but did 
not survive correction for multiple comparisons): myalgia (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67-0.91), 
fatigue (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.97), and pain (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81-0.99), with potentially 
additional protection after a second dose of the vaccine against abnormal breathing (HR 0.89, 
95% CI 0.81-0.98) and cognitive symptoms (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76-0.99). Relative 
differences in the incidence of individual long-COVID features might explain why our

This is nonsense. 3 deaths linked to the J&amp;J vaccine out of 15 million+ doses administered. That's basically negligible, and actually lower than the risk of death from childhood MMR vaccines. The pause was bureaucratic insanity.

&gt; The mRNA shot's effectiveness does wane rapidly

This is a qualitative statement. It appears to wane, but I haven't seen any data that would indicate that ""rapidly"" applies here. Some of the apparent reduction in efficacy may be caused by the prevalence of Delta rather than immunity waning.

Their hesitancy comes from misinformation, which you seem to be interested in spreading. So you're part of the problem, we're trying to be part of the solution. 

&gt; But it is juvenile to suggest the choice was without unknown risk.

No, it's not. Believing you are subjecting yourself to increased risk by vaccination is actually what's juvenile.

The abstract is below:‚Äã

Popular press articles have asserted that those with certain political orientations are less likely to wear face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose that this relation is due to differential information shared by political parties rather than values associated with face mask wearing. We further propose that, when assessed together, political party affiliation (e.g., Republican, Democrat) but not political ideology (e.g., conservative, liberal) predicts face mask wearing, and this effect is mediated by perceptions of efficacy doubts but not perceptions that face masks infringe upon the wearer's independence. We performed a three-wave, time-separated survey study with 226 participants. Each proposal was supported. When assessed together, political party affiliation but not political ideology significantly predicted face mask wearing, and a significant indirect effect was observed via perceptions of efficacy doubts but not independence. Our results support that face mask wearing is a unique preventative action, which should be understood using political theory.",,,,1635442007,{},hielqsj,True,t3_qhs05p,False,False,t3_qhs05p,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qhs05p/are_face_masks_a_partisan_issue_during_the/hielqsj/,1635616708.0,13,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like, this time last year, I was weirded out by the idea of a ‚Äúrushed‚Äù vaccine (possibly pushed through with negligence by Trump appointees? my concerns were vague and untrue, but not IMO entirely unfounded) and didn‚Äôt imagine I‚Äôd want to be in the first wave. In reality, after seeing lots of people I know get earlier access to the vaccine - nurses, teachers, doctors, etc - and realizing that all these people are people I consider reasonably intelligent, I looked into how the Covid vaccine got developed so fast and after like 10 seconds even I understood better. By the time my turn came around I signed up the first day I was eligible. 

I think this is why visibility on this choice is so important. I‚Äôm a far-left progressive who considers myself pretty decently intelligent, raised and still living in a heavily blue area - not some anti-mask ‚Äúfaith over fear‚Äù reactionary, and *I* was on the fence until I was shoved out of my pre-emptive hesitancy by the sheer volume of ‚Äúreasonable people‚Äù I knew who were getting the shot the moment they could. All those Facebook photos of people with their ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù stickers, their vaccine-day outfits, etc - it felt like a sea every time I opened my feed, and I knew these people were not stupid or crazy, and so I started to question my own feelings more and examine what they were actually rooted in (spoiler: not science). So, when my 7-year old gets his shot, I will tell the world about it. Likewise, I speak about the shot as though I assume everyone will jump at it the moment they can. I use positive and apolitical language when the topic comes up. Not rude or aggressive, but more like, if I were to encounter someone who was against the vaccine, I‚Äôd be politely baffled.

My fervent hope is that once ‚Äúall your kid‚Äôs friends‚Äù have had the shot, it will feel more and more ridiculous to remain ‚Äúhesitant.‚Äù For those who are actually hesitant, at least. For those who are anti-vaccine hiding behind the excuse of hesitancy, nothing short of school/business mandates will potentially sway them and I don‚Äôt concern myself with trying to change their minds.

Like 0% accurate. It is as accurate as public reported numbers, it may be retroactively fixed but it's the same with everything.

USA had 1.2 million excess deaths(140k are accounted for via overdose and accidental death increases) so deaths are roughly 1 million.

Russia death toll is at minimum 3 times higher(They admitted that) so roughly 700k now 250k.

India is reporting 450k dead from covid.

The Delta wave in India had 5 million excess deaths. Yes. 5 million. 3.4 - 4.4 million are attributed to Covid. India had 4 million deaths IN A SINGLE WAVE. Overall Indias numbers are about 10-12x higher then official numbers.

Every single country is underreported, the more rich the country the more accurate the numbers in general but they are still undercounted. Country like US seems to get a lot of cases, but if they are reporting 1.5k deaths and another country is reporting 1.5k deaths it isn't hitting the other country mysteriously worse when usa shows 100k and say russia shows 30k cases. Certain countries hit capacity and at a specific point you can not test more people.

For US the number is about 300k daily cases, same for India, for somewhere like Russia it is a fraction, for poorer countries even worse especially early on. Countries are helping others with testing etc.

The official death toll of Covid-19 is roughly 5 million.

Taking what we KNOW and I need to stress KNOW not guessing, at a minimum the death toll for covid exceed 10 million world wide ONLY looking at top 10 countries. Covid is closer to 10-15 million worse wide at this point.

Covid at 0.6% death rate would mean IIRC 48 million would die. OG Covid was 0.6 they believe, Alpha was 0.8% they believe and Delta is showing to be 150-230% worse then OG Covid so roughly 1.2-1.5% mortality. 

Covid had the potential to kill at a minimum 48 million globally(not counting long covid etc) and Delta can kill up to 100 million globally.

So while 10-15 million may sound scary or ""Way higher then you expect"" but really... 48 million would have died in the first wave had all countries yet it ""Wash over"" them. Our collective work has stretched out death to the point by the time vaccines started only 6-8 million died, now after delta and at 10-15 million deaths and massive vaccination drive more will continue to die.

Perhaps covid if you include all countries and all deaths when the pandemic is ""Officially"" over we will end up with about 20 million deaths.

48 million OG Covid, 140 million with Delta. Our collective work saved potentially 28 million to 100 million people.

We should be happy about this. Why did I tell you all that? I dunno this was about Papua New Guinea. There deaths are massively underreported. 

They have a population of roughly 9 million and only 28k cases reported, likely had they had testing the same as states they would have confirmed about 1 million cases by now. Realistically probably 2 - 3 million were infected and 18,000-30,000 people died.

Also take any number I said with a grain of salt, this is all just stuff publicly known from excess death figures and assuming covid over a broad base does remain consistent in death rate, and also assumes most countries had the same number of infections given the same level of restrictions and adherence to those restrictions.",,,,1635444654,{},hiesm8c,False,t3_qguvny,False,True,t1_hibeef0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qguvny/mass_burial_to_relieve_overflowing_papua_new/hiesm8c/,1635620772.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My state of CT should be following a similar pattern by that line of reasoning, as we had a vigorous early vaccination rate. We had a small rise during the late summer Delta wave but have been recently flat to declining, with hospitalizations slowly going down as well. This is also as the weather here is starting to turn less outdoor friendly.

I took a look at the breakdown of infections in CT by age demographic, as that should show the first signs of a collapsing vaccine protection since the oldest population got the first shots , and yet there's no appreciable uptick in the elderly infection rate, even though they not only have the weakest immune systems but also the oldest protection from vaccination.

I think taking a more granular look at infection numbers is important, as well as taking into account the severity of prior waves. 80% vaccination sounds great on paper, but if the remaining 20% has only a small chunk of that which has any prior immunity from previous infection, that's still a large amount of people that can drive a wave.

So there can be a benefit to switching. 

My guess is that Pfizer and Moderna are interchangeable, being the same type of vaccine, where J&amp;J is a different type. Switching from Pfizer to Moderna may not make a difference, but switching from J&amp;J to Moderna looks like it does.
