She asked her science teacher who said ""That virus is in China and not here so don't worry."" I am a pharmacist and I knew it would come here. 

The USA was doubly disadvantaged. 1) it looks to have arrived in USA before it was even declared in China. Just as well that Washington scientist thought to go back and check tests for flu back in December/January. 2) There didn't seem to be anyone knowledgeable in the White House and they were not prepared to give power to the health authorities. The third thing was the number of Americans trying to get home before the planes stopped flying and lots of people were crammed together.

Opportunities were lost but the saddest thing is the conspiracy theorists and that it became political instead of just a health issue.",,,,1631153518,{},hc4vmlh,False,t3_pk1ta1,False,True,t1_hc1qgro,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pk1ta1/spain_to_us_tourists_want_to_visit_you_must_show/hc4vmlh/,1631243401.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But in those rare cases when a fully vaccinated person gets infected, data suggests it's older adults and those with multiple underlying medical conditions who are most at risk of serious illness.  
&gt;  
&gt;As of August 30, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has received reports of 12,908 severe breakthrough cases of Covid-19 among fully vaccinated people that resulted in hospitalization or death. For the more than 173 million people who were fully vaccinated by that date, that represents a less than a 1 in 13,000 chance of experiencing a severe breakthrough case of Covid-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;About 70% of breakthrough cases resulting in hospitalization were among adults 65 and older and about 87% of breakthrough cases resulting in death were among adults 65 and older, the CDC data suggests.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚Äã Unvaccinated adults in the United States are 17 times more likely to be hospitalized for Covid-19 than fully vaccinated adults, and patients hospitalized with a breakthrough case tend to be older and more likely to have at least three underlying medical conditions, according to a preprint study the CDC posted last week.

You posted shit and then posted a link to prove what you said but the actual article say otherwise. 

You don't have to reconfigure you covid knowledge base.. You need to throw it out as its clear you have not comprehension.

You just read the abstract and not the who paper and then formed a complete misunderstanding of the study based off that.. You truly are showing how stupid you are. lol.  So not only are you not willing to accept that what you believe and said was wrong, you will continue to believe what you do after admitting you didn't read the study.

Next you will tell me how ivermectin is a miracle drug. 

You aren't arguing against wikipedia drs here.  You are arguing with people that actaully read the studies and article completely and update thier understanding based on in.. In comparison, you couldn't even with a wikipedia janitor as you wouldn't even be willing to read a few pages of txt to actually learn something.

Like really.. You are arguing against fact based on what you read in an abstract when the study clearly confirm what i and others are saying.

I didn't particularly have anything against Moderna, and in retrospect now the latest data seems to indicate it offers a higher level of protection (at least through shot #2).  It's most likely due to the higher dose Moderna uses (100ug shot#1, 50ug shot#2) compared to Pfizer( 30ug for all/any shots). 

I just had seen the initial data that Pfizer released in late July from their clinical trial on the benefits of a 3rd shot, of which the numbers were looking quite good (estimated 500%-2000% increase in antibodies/titers after 3rd dose).  With the delta variant starting to really take over and creep numbers back up, and breakthrough infections starting to become more common, and my wife was also starting back teaching at school (and I'm one of the states with cannot require masks in schools), so I was expecting to be exposed.  Decided I wasn't waiting until it was recommended to get a booster and just went for it.

The TV crew went the next AM to ask the principal  and low and behold they were just sending home half the 7th grade for another + case.   Perfect timing for them to interview the principal and parents...  Really rained on their 'success, we reopened' messaging.

Since then they have numerous kids leaving sick every day.. no testing encouraged    

Today the school emails they bought some Abbott rapid tests and want permission to test as needed.  Which of course means off-label... 1 not 2 per student 36hrs apart.    So very odd...  they.are clear the Abbott tests are not being reported to anybody , and for that reason take them.

* They analyzed data from thousands of people in nine states and hundreds of hospitals and clinics.

* Because the research continued as Delta variant spread, the table S1 (in the appendix, linked in the document) specifies when, in different regions, different variants became more or less common.

&gt;The effectiveness of full messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination (‚â•14 days after the second dose) was 89% (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 87 to 91) against laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to hospitalization, 90% (95% CI, 85 to 93) against infection leading to an ICU admission, and 91% (95% CI, 89 to 93) against infection leading to an emergency department or urgent care clinic visit.  
&gt;  
&gt;The effectiveness of full vaccination with respect to a Covid-19‚Äìassociated hospitalization or emergency department or urgent care clinic visit was similar with the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines and ranged from 81% to 95% among adults 85 years of age or older, persons with chronic medical conditions, and Black or Hispanic adults.  
&gt;  
&gt;...Our findings complement those in other recent studies of the effectiveness of mRNA-based vaccines with respect to Covid-19‚Äìassociated hospitalization6,7 and expand our knowledge of the clinical protection offered by Covid-19 vaccines in at least four ways.  
&gt;  
&gt;First, mRNA-based vaccines were highly effective among adults who were 85 years of age or older and persons with chronic medical conditions. This finding is reassuring, given that these groups can have impaired immune responses to other vaccines and are most at risk for severe and prolonged manifestations of Covid-19 and death.  
&gt;  
&gt;Second, in Black adults and Hispanic adults, who have been disproportionately affected by Covid-19, mRNA-based vaccines were similarly effective with respect to Covid-19‚Äìassociated hospitalization and an emergency department or urgent care clinic visit.  
&gt;  
&gt;Third, the effectiveness of full mRNA-based vaccination remained consistently high at least until 112 days after the second dose, which was the longest interval since vaccination during our study period.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fourth, we examined the effectiveness of all three authorized Covid-19 vaccines in the United States.  
&gt;  
&gt;This study complements other published estimates of the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine, and it confirms that the effectiveness of full vaccination with mRNA-1273 is very similar to that of BNT162b2 with respect to both hospital and emergency department or urgent care outcomes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Among adults 50 years of age or older, the effectiveness of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was 73% with respect to a Covid-19‚Äìassociated emergency department or urgent care visit and 68% with respect to Covid-19‚Äìassociated hospitalization; these estimates were lower than those for full vaccination with the mRNA-based vaccines, but, pending further research, this finding should be interpreted with caution because of the relatively small number of observations.",,,,1631180085,{},hc5vix6,False,t3_pkqr1h,False,False,t3_pkqr1h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pkqr1h/effectiveness_of_covid19_vaccines_in_ambulatory/hc5vix6/,1631262428.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CIA had a fake vaccination program to collect DNA of people they thought would be near Bin Laden.

I have some anecdotal toughts on this subject, based on what I see here in Denmark.

So in Denmark we Vaccinated around 40% of the whole population from June to now. Mainly pfizer and probably 20% moderna. So we recently demoted Corona to not a serious illness anymore, and opened up, school started, no mask mandate and so on. 

The results:

Delta R was for the first time in a looong time less than R = 1.

We currently have 100 cases/1M population, and around 0,0-0,5 deaths/1M population. Which I think is impressive for a full open society.

Here is what I think is happening:

1. We still have a strong immunity because we all are newly vaxxed
2. Scandinavian people dont get to close to each other of nature.

Yes, I acknowledge I might be mistaken (it was actually slightly before the first cases were officially recorded in my country, although there were lots of similar reports of covid-like illness at the same time). 

I'd like to take an antibody test out of curiosity, but I'm not sure whether it would show anything given that I would now be a good 18 months plus since infection. I think I'd need to take a T-cell test to have a better idea, although these are quite expensive (and also have only moderate accuracy, from what I understand).

&gt;as far as I know, you're not significantly more likely to get long-term side effects from the vaccine.

Do we know if that's ever been studied? And what about the most dangerous side-effect of all - death. Yes, I appreciate it's incredibly rare (as are my chances of dying due to covid itself).

No, not really. That‚Äôs just called contributing to herd immunity.

Also, have you ever thought that the mask mandate might be part of WHY your area has such a low case rate? Getting the vaccine doesn‚Äôt really keep you from spreading the virus and all of it‚Äôs variants to other, more vulnerable people, it just strengthens your immune system so it‚Äôs not as serious should you catch the virus. The masks are what help prevent the actual spread of the virus. I‚Äôm very pro-vaccine, but I think you‚Äôre putting too much faith in their abilities.

There are likely people more susceptible to this phenomenon. It happens naturally with caloric deficit and illness. In other words, being sick could accelerate some women to have an early period, and the vaccine does model an illness. 

I'd expect the same if they got severe covid, except then they'd also have covid. 

If correct, I would predict this to be transient and harmless; an inconvenience for most people. I'd also be curious to see if they could try timing the vaccine to be taken on the first day of the period, that way the cycle is not disturbed. 

This isn't medical advice, I'm just speculating out loud on this forum for discussion purposes. I understand the hesitancy with regards to fertility and pregnancy. My current thinking is to compare that assessment with natural covid infection. The time for thinking that we might not be exposed has passed. We will all be exposed.

You can read the PDF of a letter to the editor that [discusses the paper here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7404744/pdf/BCP-9999-na.pdf).

This paragraph is (probably) the meaty part:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;While the findings by Caly and colleagues provide some promise,several pharmacokinetic factors limit the immediate translation oftheir findings, and there is no evidence that the 5ŒºM concentration ofivermectin used by Caly and colleagues in their in vitro SARS-CoV-2experiment, can be achieved in vivo. First, the pharmacokinetics ofivermectin in humans is well described,3‚Äì5 and even with the highestreported dose of approximately 1700 Œºg/kg (i.e., 8.5 times the FDA -approved dose of 200 Œºg/kg), the maximum plasma concentration was only 0.28ŒºM.5 Second, 93% of ivermectin is bound to plasma proteins that limit its cellular uptake by endothelial cells.6 Considering both the total plasma concentration and protein binding, the freeplasma concentration of ivermectin would be 250 times lower thanthe concentration required to reduce viral replication of SARS-CoV-2in vitro (Figure 1). Third, whilst there is no data on the tissue penetration of ivermectin in human lungs, the total concentration of ivermectin in calves injected with 200 Œºg/kg reached only 100 ng/g (approx.0.1ŒºM) in lung tissue, which suggests that its accumulation would notbe sufficient to achieve the antiviral effect with conventional doses.7 **Although high doses of ivermectin in adults or children are well tolerated,5,8 the clinical effects of ivermectin at a concentration of5ŒºM range are unknown and may be associated with toxicity.** **Consequently, ivermectin has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but this effect is unlikely to be observed in vivo using current dosing**

‚ÄúPending clarification of data reliability in the study by Elgazzar et al,3 we turn to the second claim made in the press2 that conclusions are reversed if this study is removed. If Figure 3 in the study by Bryant et al1 is reanalyzed to exclude the study by Elgazzar,3 there is still a clear result, showing a 49% reduction in mortality in favor of ivermectin (aRR = 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.27‚Äì0.95) (Figure ‚Äã(Figure1).1). Similarly, if we conduct the same sensitivity analysis in Figure 15 (prophylaxis outcome), there was an 87% reduction in COVID-19 infection in favor of ivermectin (aRR = 0.13, 95% confidence interval 0.08‚Äì0.21) (Figure ‚Äã(Figure2),2), virtually unchanged from the previous analysis. Revised Figures are shown below.

The mutation and extinction event you reference was sited in march 2020 and was pre vaccines and pre natual immunity.

I don't care if you believe me.   I also dont care if dont agree with the article you linked which clearly backs up what i'm saying.  

You keep saying you base everything on your primary source yet you clearly don't comprehend what the article you link says. 

""""The initial period of rapid diversification into region-specific phylogenies that ended in February 2020 was followed by a major extinction event and global homogenization concomitant with the spread of D614G in the spike protein, ending in March 2020. ... The extinction of the earliest partitions, 1 and 2, corresponds to the advent of S|D614G, which became fixed in all other partitions and was globally ubiquitous by June 2020 """" 

You stated above ""There was a diversification of mutations followed by the emergence of the D614G structure in the spike protein after an extinction event due to the vaccine."" which is not true as vaccines where in early stage trials. 

""The results show that the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic is characterized primarily by purifying selection, but a small set of sites appear to evolve under positive selection.""

This means the majority of mutations is just random, lateral changes rather than any adaptions. Certain adaptions however seem to be so advantageous that they are selected for in the new environment.

[],,Sapphyr-Ashes,,,[],,,,text,t2_blkntsyc,False,False,,"&gt;Universities are caught between the demands of their faculty for greater safety precautions, and the fear of losing students, and the revenue they bring, if schools return to another year of online education.  
  
‚ÄúI think everybody agrees that the idea is to have people physically back in the classroom,‚Äù said Peter McDonough,  general counsel for the American Council on Education, an organization of colleges and universities. ‚ÄúThe turning on a dime to provide online education last year and the previous spring semester was only seen as temporary.‚Äù  
  
For some faculty, the new year brings not a return to normal but a strong sense that things could go off the rails. In the first weeks of class, case counts have risen at schools including Duke, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Arizona State, Liberty University, the University of Arkansas, the University of North Florida and the University of Texas at San Antonio.  
  
‚ÄúIt seems like a repeat,‚Äù said Michael Atzmon, an engineering professor at the University of Michigan. ‚ÄúOn the one hand, we have the vaccine. On the other hand, we have Delta.‚Äù  
  
Dr. Atzmon helped organize a petition asking the university to be more open to online teaching. It was signed by more than 700 faculty members and instructors.  
  
In a response to the petition, Michigan‚Äôs president, Mark Schlissel, said on Thursday that, given the ‚Äústellar‚Äù rate of vaccination at the Ann Arbor campus (92 percent for students, 90 percent for faculty), the classroom was ‚Äúperhaps the safest place to be‚Äù on campus.  
  
Dr. Schlissel suggested that faculty would just have to get used to the idea that there would be Covid cases on campus. ‚ÄúA pandemic is unsettling, it‚Äôs unpredictable, and yes, it involves an unavoidable level of risk,‚Äù he said.  
There are signs of defiance against state policies. The three big public universities in Arizona ‚Äî University of Arizona, Arizona State and Northern Arizona University ‚Äî are tiptoeing around the ban on masks and requiring them in class. If all students have to wear masks, university officials believe that they are obeying Gov. Doug Ducey‚Äôs order not to discriminate against students who choose not to be vaccinated.  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of a cat-and-mouse game,‚Äù said Peter Lake, an education law professor at Stetson University.  
  
Professors said that Delta blindsided them, like much of the world. They enthusiastically signed up to teach in-person classes in March, they said, before reports of breakthrough infections of vaccinated people became common. Now their institutions are making it hard, if not impossible, for them to back out.  
A few have sacrificed their jobs. Cody Luedtke, a biology instructor and lab coordinator at Perimeter College, part of Georgia State University, said she cried at the thought of teaching in a classroom where masks were not required.  
  
When she refused to teach, she was fired, she said. ‚ÄúI just couldn‚Äôt perform a job duty that went against my morals and my desire to protect my students and the broader community,‚Äù she said.  
  
Irwin Bernstein, an 88-year-old psychology professor, said the University of Georgia had lured him out of retirement this fall. But when he posted a ‚ÄúNo mask, No class‚Äù sign in his classroom, his department head told him to take it down ‚Äúsince I was in violation of the governor‚Äôs order.‚Äù  
  
At his next class, a student resisted wearing a mask, saying it was uncomfortable, he recalled. He announced that he was retiring ‚Äî again ‚Äî and walked out of class.  
Timothy Wilson, an engineering professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, resigned on the first day of class, revealing in an online essay that he was H.I.V.-positive and thought the university‚Äôs optional mask policy was ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù  
  
James Tierney, an assistant teaching professor of economics at Penn State, said that he supported the school‚Äôs mask mandate, but said that it was hard to hear students asking questions under their face coverings in his 600-student introductory class in macroeconomics.  
  
And when students let their masks slip down their faces, ‚ÄúI have to play the bad guy,‚Äù he said.  
  
But the university‚Äôs reluctance to impose a vaccine mandate was ‚Äúthe tipping point,‚Äù he said. He resigned in protest, effective Dec. 31, to give the school time to find a replacement.  
  
Professors say that the lack of clear rules this year has made it harder to function. Last year, the rules may have been draconian ‚Äî possible expulsion for attending parties, for instance ‚Äî but they were also clear and effective, the professors said.  
  
Last fall, ‚ÄúI could call the police if I wanted to,‚Äù said Leslie Kaplan, who teaches folklore at the University of North Florida. This year, she has to use the art of persuasion.  
  
To prepare for discussing Covid at freshman orientation, Dr. Kaplan read two books about how to influence people. She brought in a recent graduate who had the virus and an epidemiologist. She talked about the importance of looking out for one another, and implored students to put their political differences aside.  
  
Only a handful of students came to her freshman orientation sessions unmasked, Dr. Kaplan said, and she credited her campaign.  
Others have suggested more tangible inducements. The University of Texas at Austin told professors that they could offer nonacademic rewards, like cookies, to cajole students to wear masks. (A university spokeswoman, Eliska Padilla, said this was informal, not an incentive program.)  
  
Despite the emotional appeals and subtle hints, some students do their own thing.  
  
Alex Vargas, a senior at the University of Texas, is not vaccinated and, in the first week of school, he was the only person not wearing a mask in his small engineering class.  
  
The professor, who was wearing a mask, called for a vote in class on whether students wanted him to wear a mask or ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt care,‚Äù Mr. Vargas recalled. The ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt cares‚Äù won by a vote or two, and the professor said he would keep his mask on, Mr. Vargas said.  
  
‚ÄúThere were no snarky remarks, no ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not going to talk to you, not going to look at you,‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Vargas, the chairman of the Young Conservatives of Texas on campus, said, of his own choice to go unmasked. ‚ÄúIt was just, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs his choice, move on.‚Äô‚Äù",,,,1631160081,{},hc57omg,False,t3_pk6gvf,False,True,t1_hc57o0p,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pk6gvf/the_masked_professor_vs_the_unmasked_student/hc57omg/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,1029d0d9637a35fdbdbd76792c93b9092fa7f59b,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1631160096.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,,

&gt;  
&gt;Matthew Boedy, an associate professor of rhetoric and composition, sent out a raw emotional appeal to his students at the University of North Georgia just before classes began: The Covid-19 Delta variant was rampaging through the state, filling up hospital beds. He would teach class in the equivalent of full body armor ‚Äî vaccinated and masked.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;So he was stunned in late August when more than two-thirds of the first-year students in his writing class did not take the hint and showed up unmasked.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;It was impossible to tell who was vaccinated and who was not. ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt a visual hellscape, like hospitals, it‚Äôs more of an emotional hellscape,‚Äù Dr. Boedy said.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;North Georgia is not requiring its students to be vaccinated or masked this fall. And as in-person classes return at almost every university in the country, after almost a year and a half of emergency pivoting to online learning, many professors are finding teaching a nerve-racking experience.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The American College Health Association recommends vaccination requirements for all on-campus higher education students for the fall semester. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends face coverings, regardless of vaccine status, for indoor public spaces in areas where the rate of infection is high.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;But this is not how it has worked out on more than a few campuses.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;More than 1,000 colleges and universities have adopted vaccination requirements for at least some students and staff, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education. In an indication of how political vaccination has become, the schools tend to be clustered in states that voted for President Biden in the last election.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;But at some campuses, particularly in Republican-led states with high rates of contagion ‚Äî like the state systems in Georgia, Texas and Florida ‚Äî vaccination is optional and mask wearing, while recommended, cannot be enforced. Professors are told they can tell students that they are ‚Äústrongly encouraged‚Äù or ‚Äúexpected‚Äù to put on masks, but cannot force students to do so. And teachers cannot ask students who have Covid-like symptoms to leave the classroom.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;At least nine states ‚Äî Arizona, Arkansas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Florida, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Tennessee ‚Äî have banned or restricted school mask mandates.

When surges happen, we certainly should be careful but the reality is if vaccinated people aren't clogging up ICU beds, they should be able to live their lives. As information changes, I'm also more than willing to adjust my life. However, saying that 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 of even contracting COVID with mild symptoms is 'too high' is pretty absurd to me.

I'd really like to emphasize that the whole reason COVID is actually a problem is because it cripples our hospital infrastructure. I also think this viewpoint is very narrow minded in that it completely disregards how serious the consequences are for continuing to live in such a restricted way.

I think that the vaccine is by far the most important aspect of living normally and that the epidemiologists are in agreement. I'm 100% for requiring proof of vaccination and I feel grateful that where I live this is a requirement in bars, restaurants, and venues and there are mask mandates on our subways.

That said, I'm still going to go to weddings of loved ones. I'm still going to visit my family. I'm still going to go on vacation. I'm also still going to wear a mask. I'm also doing at home COVID tests once a week. And I also don't do stuff if I'm having any kind of symptoms of a cold.

Given the same vaccination status, Covid19 infects older people far easier and much more likely to result in in a severe disease.. IIRC the factors are very large (&gt;100x risk difference between 75-year old and 18 year old), so a vaccinated 75-year old is STILL running larger risk of severe Covid than an unvaccinated 18-year old..

This combination of non-uniform vaccinations (old ages are far more vaccinated) and risk (old ages are at much higher risk) results in vaccinated people being *overrepresented*  in both case stats and, especially, hospitalization stats..  This makes vaccines *seem* less effective than they actually are.

Correct risk estimates would require partitioning the numbers by age groups...

Looking at National Geographic, what National Geographic means is essentially (as far as I can tell), the fastest from novel discovery of a virus to a new vaccine for said virus.

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/why-coronavirus-vaccine-could-take-way-longer-than-a-year

That's a bit different from the fastest time a vaccine has been created and then used.

For example, the flu virus was isolated in like 1933 or so, but the first vaccine (to be widely deployed) wasn't created until 1942.

While they were certainly researching the virus and how to create a vaccine like that - that's basic R&amp;D. It isn't anything specific to a particular vaccine. In that case, that would push us back to 2003 for the COVID vaccines (research started with SARS, which is a different strain but very very similar). If we go by a specific vaccine, 1942 to 1943/1945 and late 1952 to early 1954 would be faster.

No one in the vaccine group had any trouble with their pregnancy over the course of the study. They also tested it on female rats and did not find any problems, either with fertility or pregnancy.

The Pfizer vaccine FDA report doesn't give a nice summary like this, but they do report 23 people became pregnant during the trial. They report 2 adverse events related to pregnancy, both in the placebo group.

Both companies say they will continue to monitor pregnant people. In general, there is no know reason why a vaccine would affect fertility. I don't believe any ever has before. While mRNA technology is new-ish, it's not so radically different that there would be any reason to believe fertility would be affected.

&gt;	However, vaccinated people with Delta might remain infectious for a shorter period, according to researchers in Singapore who tracked viral loads for each day of COVID-19 infection among people who had and hadn‚Äôt been vaccinated. Delta viral loads were similar for both groups for the first week of infection, but dropped quickly after day 7 in vaccinated people4. ‚ÄúGiven the high virus levels seen in the first week of illness with Delta, measures such as masks and hand hygiene which can reduce transmission are important for everyone, regardless of vaccination status,‚Äù says co-author Barnaby Young, an infectious-disease clinician at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in Singapore.

&gt;One massive analysis of Delta transmission comes from the UK REACT-1 programme, led by a team at Imperial College London, which tests more than 100,000 UK volunteers every few weeks. The team ran Ct analyses for samples received in May, June and July, when Delta was rapidly replacing other variants to become the dominant driver of COVID-19 in the country. The results suggested that among people testing positive, those who had been vaccinated had a lower viral load on average than did unvaccinated people. Paul Elliott, an epidemiologist at Imperial, says that these results differ from other Ct studies because this study sampled the population at random and included people who tested positive without showing symptoms.

&gt;These findings ‚Äî along with an increase in cases in younger people who have not yet received both jabs ‚Äî underscore the effectiveness of double vaccination against Delta, Elliott says. ‚ÄúWe think it‚Äôs really, really important to get as many people double vaccinated, and particularly those younger groups, as soon as possible.‚Äù

&gt;The special meeting was posted shortly after the school board emerged from a closed session Wednesday for which the only listed item was ‚Äúanticipated litigation.‚Äù

&gt;The nation‚Äôs second-largest school system has been sued multiple times over its COVID-safety measures, which are among the most strict and sweeping in the nation. A vaccine mandate also could bring a lawsuit, district officials have acknowledged to The Times.

&gt;To date, none of the litigation has thwarted L.A. Unified from such steps as ordering all students and employees to be tested each week for the coronavirus and requiring all employees to be vaccinated.

&gt;The board would not likely have approved a special meeting over a vaccine mandate if it wasn‚Äôt clear that the board would approve it. The board has yet to discuss a vaccine mandate in open session, but it has apparently come up in at least two closed sessions, according to district sources.

&gt;A district statement on Wednesday foreshadowed likely approval: ‚ÄúThe Los Angeles Unified Board of Education will vote at their next meeting on whether to mandate vaccines for all eligible students. Science clearly shows that vaccinations are an essential part of protecting our communities. Further details will be forthcoming after the vote.‚Äù

&gt;School board member Nick Melvoin on Wednesday left no doubt where he stands.

&gt;‚ÄúOur goal is to keep kids and teachers as safe as possible and in the classroom,‚Äù Melvoin said. ‚ÄúA medical and scientific consensus has emerged that the best way to protect everyone in our schools and communities is for all those who are eligible to get vaccinated. This policy is the best way to make that happen.‚Äù

&gt;Melvoin also has noted ‚Äúinaction at the state level‚Äù as a reason for L.A. Unified to to take action on its own.

&gt;Education officials across the state are beginning to grapple with mandating student COVID vaccination, a measure that could help prevent school infections and keep classrooms open, but would probably ignite pushback.

&gt;School board President Kelly Gonez said last week that such a mandate would be a wise step to take ‚Äúwithin a reasonable timeline.‚Äù Although the board could make a student vaccine mandate decision relatively soon, its effective date would depend on many factors, including allowing time for education efforts and outreach to families, she said.

&gt;Such a move would propel Los Angeles ‚Äî once again ‚Äî into the national spotlight for COVID safety measures that are among the most aggressive in the country. The nation‚Äôs second-largest school system has moved faster and more comprehensively than most others, testing all students and employees for infection every week, requiring masks indoors and outdoors and ordering employees to get vaccinated.

&gt;The district has won praise for creating a safer learning environment, but also faced criticism for rules that have led to disruptive quarantines, which have hindered efforts to make up for in-person learning time lost when campuses were closed for more than a year.

&gt;People 12 and older have been eligible, under a federal emergency authorization, to receive the vaccine in L.A. County for nearly four months, but many have not. As of Aug. 29, 48% of county residents 12 to 15 years old and 57% of residents ages 16 to 17 were fully vaccinated. In the 12-to-17 age group, hospitalization rates were 10 times higher among the unvaccinated than among the fully vaccinated, according to research highlighted this month by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

&gt;Already, the L.A. teachers union has voiced strong support for a student vaccine mandate ‚Äî and is negotiating for tighter quarantine rules.


&gt;The district‚Äôs previous safety mandates, including coronavirus testing and employee vaccinations, already have faced legal challenges. So far, the litigation has added to district costs, but not stopped or delayed these policies. The public testimony at nearly every board meeting has included lengthy stretches during which anti-vaccine parents implore officials to not, as they put it, place their children at grave risk by giving them vaccinations. Some parents also assert a legal right to make such choices for themselves.

&gt;Other districts have faced repeated protests over mandates to wear masks, let alone submit to vaccines. Indoor masks at schools are a state requirement, but governors of some states, including Texas and Florida, have refused to allow school systems to mandate face coverings, with the issue going to court.

&gt;So far, Culver City Unified appears to be the only state school system to have approved a student vaccine mandate, and it has yet to take effect. That district has set a Nov. 19 deadline in the expectation that the vaccine will have received full approval from the Food and Drug Administration by then for students 12 and older. The Oakland Board of Education is scheduled to discuss a student vaccine mandate on Wednesday.

&gt;In Los Angeles, one major player, United Teachers Los Angeles, which represents more than 30,000 teachers, counselors, nurses and librarians ‚Äî has already weighed in. In late August, union negotiators demanded mandatory vaccinations for eligible students in a contract proposal. Days later, the union dropped the demand ‚Äî after the district refused to make it part of bargaining.

&gt;California school districts have clear authority to act if they want to, said Debra Duardo, superintendent of the Los Angeles County Office of Education, which provides support and oversight for the county‚Äôs 80 K-12 districts.

&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôve mandated other vaccinations, as you know,‚Äù Duardo said, mentioning the polio vaccine and the Tdap, which provides protection against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. The imperative is ‚Äúto ensure public safety, so school districts are able to require their students to be vaccinated.""",,,,1631153369,{},hc4vbxs,True,t3_pkodf6,False,True,t3_pkodf6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pkodf6/los_angeles_unified_board_of_education_the/hc4vbxs/,1631243240.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In other words, they weeded out studies where the methods and results were flawed in the way that you mentioned and in other ways. Below is just one part of that part of the paper. You make it seem like they just collected all of the studies and averaged out the results, but, and maybe I‚Äôm just dumb, that‚Äôs seems clearly not what they did. And on a personal note, I‚Äôm provax and the last thing I would like to do is give any ammunition to the anti-vaxxers. However, bias exists and bias can affect smart people as well. And in a divided nation, it can be very difficult to admit that those you vehemently disagree with on nearly all subjects might, on rare occasion, be right like the proverbial broken clock.

Trial sequential analysis

When a meta-analysis is subjected to repeated statistical evaluation, there is an exaggerated risk that ‚Äúnaive‚Äù point estimates and confidence intervals will yield spurious inferences. In a meta-analysis, it is important to minimize the risk of making a false-positive or false-negative conclusion. There is a trade-off between the risk of observing a false-positive result (type I error) and the risk of observing a false-negative result (type II error). Conventional meta-analysis methods (eg, in RevMan) also do not take into account the amount of available evidence. Therefore, we examined the reliability and conclusiveness of the available evidence using trial sequential analyses (TSA).41‚Äì43 The DerSimonian‚ÄìLaird (DL) method was used because this is most often used in meta-analytic practice and was also used in the primary meta-analysis.30

The TSA was used to calculate the required information size (IS) to demonstrate or reject a relative reduction in the risk (RRR) of death in the ivermectin group, as found in the primary meta-analysis. We assumed the estimated event proportion in the control group from the meta-analysis because this is the best and most representative available estimate. Recommended type I and II error rates of 5% and 10% were used, respectively (power of 90%),43 powering the result on the effect observed in the primary meta-analyses. We did not identify any large COVID-19 trials powered on all-cause mortality, so powering on some external meaningful difference was not possible. Any small RRR is meaningful in this context, given the scale of the pandemic, but the required IS would be unfeasibly high for this analysis if powered on a small difference. The only reliable data on ivermectin in its repurposed role for treatment against COVID-19 will be from the primary meta-analysis. Therefore, assuming it does not widely deviate from other published systematic reviews, a pragmatic decision was therefore made to power on the pooled meta-analysis effect estimate for all-cause mortality a priori. This is more reflective of a true meaningful difference. We used a model variance-based estimate to correct for heterogeneity. A continuity correction of 0.01 was used in trials that reported zero events in one or both arms. The required IS is the sample size required for a reliable and conclusive meta-analysis and is at least as large as that needed in a single powered RCT. The heterogeneity corrected required IS was used to construct sequential monitoring boundaries based on the O'Brien‚ÄìFleming type alpha-spending function for the cumulative z-scores (corresponding to the cumulative meta-analysis),43 analogous to interim monitoring in an RCT, to determine when sufficient evidence had been accrued. These monitoring boundaries are relatively insensitive to the number of repeated significance tests. They can be used to further contextualize the original meta-analysis and enhance our certainty around its conclusions. We used a two-sided test, so also considered futility boundaries (to test for no statistically significant difference) and the possibility that ivermectin could harm. Sensitivity analyses were performed excluding the trial of Fonseca,44 which was a cause of substantial heterogeneity (but retained in the core analysis because it was at low risk of bias). Its removal dramatically reduced I2 and D2 (diversity) estimates, thus reducing the model variance-based estimate to correct for heterogeneity. Two further sensitivity analyses were performed using 2 alternative random effect models, namely the Biggerstaff‚ÄìTweedie (BT) and Sidik‚ÄìJonkman (SJ) methods.43

It's a model of the UK, but much of the same findings will apply everywhere else, so it should be interesting wherever you are: https://twitter.com/JamesWard73/status/1436043734181896202

It's fascinating because it shows how different booster strategies would have an impact, and how, counterintuitively, being very aggressive with boosters might actually be counterproductive. He's found that a programme of rapid boosters (for the most vulnerable) followed by quite a slow programme of boosters for everyone else (running into next Spring) would have the optimal outcome.

The only criticism I have is I think he may have over-estimated waning protection against hospitalisation, he has it as a constant decline of about 2% per month, yet real-world data (including studies that showed a rapid fall in protection against infection) have shown really quite sticky protection against hospitalisation (e.g. a recent study from Bahrain that showed efficacy against infection falling to zero, still had efficacy against hospitalisation as being 90%). The other flaw is one he acknowledged here: https://twitter.com/JamesWard73/status/1436045598554218499 so, with a bit of luck the central projections are slightly on the pessimistic side, but nothing that a tweak to the assumptions wouldn't fix (if it was proven to be required).",,,,1631218711,{},hc82ms4,False,t3_pksoeb,False,False,t3_pksoeb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pksoeb/daily_discussion_thread_september_09_2021/hc82ms4/,1631308679.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact is that nobody *knows* what causes Alzheimer's, yet. There's even a lot of debate among researchers over the extent to which amyloid plaques are a cause or just a correlated effect.

All we have currently are a number of things that are associated with greater Alzheimer's risk, including poor sleeping habits, high-sugar diets, and lack of mental stimulation as we age.

This is similar to how my school district handles any/all  vaccines necessary to contain outbreaks such as MMR. The contention is that covid shouldn't be on the list.

No vaccines are mandatory for staff - none. They don't want to deal with belief exemptions, so just opt out. However, upon hire, all employees must consent to a policy designed to mitigate outbreaks. If you're not comfortable with vaccines, no problem. You just can't come on any district property until the outbreak is over. 

You can use all PTO, regardless of the type, and stay away. No work from home either. After you're out of leave, it's unpaid. Absentee policy kicks in, it'll give you another week, perhaps two. After that, it's either FMLA or you're spot is permanently replaced. Reapply in the future. 

Vaccinated? Come to work. Catch the contagion? Bonus paid time off for recovery. Quarantined? Work from home.

Take for example a school classroom which may have an outbreak with a few students positive but a symptomatic.

I call this ""quarantine"" even though it's not strict and I'm not cowering in my home.

I want you to think about what that means in real terms.  That's not the average starting pay.  That's the average pay for professionals with 25+ years working the same job (there are no promotions when you have a teaching career, you just keep the same title for the rest of your life - teacher.).  

And that's average pay for career workers in a job that usually requires at least a masters degree, certainly one or more bachelor's degrees, and six figures of student debt to even audition for.   

That average pay includes teachers trying to live indoors in cities like New York, or LA or San Francisco where the average cost of a home is north of a million dollars.  

While there may possibly be lower paying jobs that require a masters degree and professional certifications to practice, I'm hard pressed to think of any offhand.  

Most teachers I know work evenings and weekends planning and preparing,  work summers training and preparing, and put in hours that are, averaged over a year, not that different than my own as a salaried professional who makes a whole lot more than they do.  

Stop shitting on teachers.   If you're imagining it's cushy and high paying, give it a try.   Put in some student teaching hours and see how long you last.

1. More eligible people need to be vaccinated.  Requiring vaccines for certain activities and employment is going to help make that happen for more people.

2. Kids under 12 need to have a vaccine approved for them, and that vaccine needs to be distributed.

3. People in areas not taking precautions need to take precautions -- mask wearing, social distancing, washing hands, etc. for a little while.

4. We need to finalize the booster plan.  While breakthrough cases severe enough to require hospitalization are rare, the current thought seems to be that we should be able to do better than we are now by distributing boosters.

Obviously, all four of those are not happening overnight and some of them will only happen to varying degrees.

Just because the delta variant made that worse doesn't mean they jumped the gun on removing that guidance.

And it's not like it was hard to see that the idiots would be doing everything they could to skirt their continued guidance of having to wear masks. Since it was on the honor system, and there are at least 170m dishonorable people in the U.S., the idiots all took their masks off.

It was a mistake and it was one that wasn't based on science. Or maybe for some reason they didn't account for the idiots making it worse, but from the moment the guidance was changed, the idiots made it worse. And wasn't it like a month ago the CDC reversed course?

Anyway when they changed their guidance to the misguided suggestions most states with mandates still in effect buckled and removed theirs and updated to fall in line with CDC guidance. In my state our R governor said when we got to 70% vaccination that we'd remove the mandates. Well we weren't even close when the CDC announced those updated guidelines. And sure, my local state isn't the CDC but health departments from every state get their direction from the CDC so it was really just an irresponsible move.

Also, if the Trump years didn't teach you that the CDC, like any other governmental institution, is a political tool to be wielded then I'm not sure how to wake you up to that. I can say I won't pee on the toilet seat anymore but how would anyone know it's me?

Here's a thing that some people like to do - when we get to talking about some part of dealing with the pandemic they don't like (wearing masks, distancing, vaccines, quarantine, etc) people use words like ""endure this misery forever"" which makes everything sound more dramatic. 

I'm curious how many people actually think this will go on forever. I certainly don't.  I'm just trying to survive and roll with what is happening as things develop. We don't know everything about covid. We don't have an end date on this pandemic. Yes, people are tired. Just because I did x,y,z things correctly doesn't mean the pandemic ends for me or anyone else. But people throwing around words like forever makes it more dramatic and doesn't help. It is using ""forever"" as an excuse to throw one's hands up and say whatever is convenient - ""I'm not doing this anymore"" or ""I don't care about your kid with a disability"".

The same thing for an 80-year-old, whose vaccinated risk profile is close to that of an unvaccinated 50-year-old.

When you calculate the vaccine effectiveness for different age groups, you find a different picture. While in all ages, the rate of severe cases is 3.1x higher in unvaccinated individuals than fully vaccinated individuals, it becomes much higher once you break it down into finer groups: 

* In the age group 50-59, the vaccine is 94.2% effective against severe disease, and your chances of being hospitalized are 5.4x greater if you're unvaccinated
* In the age group 60-69, the vaccine is 93.2% effective against severe disease, and your chances of being hospitalized are 12.5x greater if you're unvaccinated
* In the age group 70-79, the vaccine is 95.6.6% effective against severe disease, and your chances of being hospitalized are 20.3x greater if you're unvaccinated
* In the age group 80-89, the vaccine is 90.7% effective against severe disease, and your chances of being hospitalized are 18.3x greater if you're unvaccinated
* In the age group 90+, the vaccine is 93.5% effective against severe disease, and your chances of being hospitalized are 30.4x greater if you're unvaccinated

Here is a quote from that video of Dr. Souza describing Crisis Standard of Care:

&gt; The mechanism of implementing Crisis Level of Care is unconscionable in the wealthiest nation in the world. Absolutely unconscionable and has never happened in western medicine. 

....

&gt;There's a plan that we need to activate Crisis Standards of Care: **Once a crisis is declared then we activate our plan and our plan involves scoring people in the Emergency Department. So, individual humans would receive a score based on their severity of illness that determines whether or not they qualify for not admission to the Intensive Care Unit, but a trial of admission to the Intensive Care Unit. And that means they're re-scored at 72 hours and if things are going in the wrong direction for them and someone with a better score needs the bed we would de-allocate the resource.**

&gt;That is, as I said, unconscionable, never done in these United States, and would represent a complete and total failure of our ability to work together to prevent that from happening. If it occurs.

Absolutely not. People who haven't taken the vaccine and require care are morally equal to anyone else in terms of deserving treatment. That's the reason why triage protocols only consider the potential patient outcomes and nothing else.

With the intense push for vaccine passports and mandates for many jobs, I'm wondering why it's not as acceptable to show a negative Covid test as it is to show you are vaccinated. We have rapid testing available and the technology and access could surely be improved upon substantially if we heavily invested in it. Also, it is interesting that there are numerous cases of people still catching Covid while being vaccinated, so not like that is fool-proof. If the whole point is that having and spreading Covid is bad, then why can't we emphasize having negative Covid tests as much as being vaccinated? Not like our government can't create billions of dollars out of thin air to make this an easy reality if they so desired. 

I'm extremely skeptical of the pharmaceutical industry and our government as they have each shown over decades that they value profit and control over almost all else. It makes me question how much the financial incentive and desire to control more aspects of our lives  plays a role in this. 

I would love to hear your thoughts on this! Seems fishy to say the least. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

[],,ElementalSentimental,,,[],,,,text,t2_8pcc82x1,False,False,,"&gt;Even though you can still catch Covid after being double vaccinated?

If you have a BMI of 40, you *can* still run a mile (or you can train to do so without losing half your bodyweight). You are much, much less likely to do so than someone who has a BMI of 20.

Banning the unvaccinated doesn't mean that there is suddenly zero risk of COVID; but the vaccinated catch COVID less frequently, and have milder symptoms for less time, even if they have similar viral loads.

That means:

1. Vaccinated travellers feel safer and are more likely to buy tickets;
2. The airline isn't taking on any unnecessary risk by allowing unvaccinated travellers (who have more chance of being infected, and remaining infected, spreading disease to others);
3. The airline is less likely to be sued by passengers who do get sick, because they have taken precautions - and any passengers who get sick will also be less likely to suffer serious consequences, meaning that they will be less inclined to bother suing, and any payout would be less if the airline were found liable).

So in this case, by banning the unvaccinated, the airline gets to have happier customers spending more money, is less likely to see its flights cancelled due to being super-spreader events, and is less likely to get sued after the fact.

Part of the reason this thing keeps going on what seems like forever is because we can't seem to face the problems in our own backyard. I live just outside of Boston, but anytime I pointed out just how little people were masking &amp; distancing while going out unnecessarily (especially last summer) I was shouted down. It was happening both in Boston and in cities/towns surrounding it.

People told me it's not possible, that people in this area understand and follow the guidelines, everything they could to deny the reality happening right in front of us. I pointed out the insane beach crowds without masks, half the people in crowded grocery aisles without masks, parks where everyone was acting like there wasn't a global pandemic, **MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF PEOPLE NOT WEARING MASKS PROPERLY**, etc and people refused to accept what their eyes saw.

A lot of people's heads go in the sand, because they don't like to face reality--and it happens on both sides. Bottom line: if it happens in your area then it is a reflection of your area, whether you want to admit it or not.

I'm a rural area, but there's still about 3,000 students at our local K-12 school. Our school board this year decided that masks will be optional. They've since seen a huge uptick in COVID cases, because most students have optioned not to wear masks...obviously. Parents are sending their symptomatic kids to school, even after it was confirmed they tested positive. They decided to make masks optional because a significant portion of the school district's population is comprised of anti-mask, anti-vax parents. They didn't say that, of course, but that's exactly what it is because that's how our school board tends to work. Whatever decision is going to piss off the least amount of people, regardless of the repercussions. Last year we had mask requirements, full remote learning, and hybrid learning. This year...""Let's pretend like COVID went away and it's not a thing anymore! Delta variant? What's that?""

Last year we had a large group of parents create a Facebook group, and organize street-side demonstrations in protest of students potentially having to wear masks when they went back to school. They felt that as parents it should be their decision whether or not their child wears a mask all day long. Yet previously, they made sure their kids had all the vaccination requirements for public school in the first place, and were fine in the past with the school making whatever decisions they needed to for their child while they were there.

It takes a lot of balls to get up in front of a crowd of people with that same mentality and start speaking against what they believe, and then just have to take it as you're laughed at while in the spotlight.

If two months later I get put on quarantine again I am still out of sick days because teachers only get x days per school year (varies per district). There is no CARES money this year to protect us. Last year we had 80 hrs of sick leave protection for covid specifically. At the point where I hit zero and need days off, I am no longer meeting the stipulations of my teaching contract (x days per year worked), so my paycheck is docked. This year some districts will shrug and say you cannot prove you got covid at school.  This hasn't played out in our district yet but I am hoping the union will push back more.

Before taking the vaccine, I think it's reasonable for me to be reassured that the benefits outweigh the risks. Unfortunately, whilst it's easy to find score of articles regurgitating the same ""Medical professionals say the benefits of the vaccines far outweigh the risks for most people"", I've found it very difficult to find any resources which actually allow me to calculate those risks and perform that comparison myself. I'm *particularly* eager to do this because I'm fairly certain that I already caught and recovered from covid right at the start of the pandemic (unverified because testing wasn't widely available at that point, but the symptoms matched pretty perfectly), which I believe considerably alters my risk profile (by massively reducing my chances of reinfection/hospitalisation/death, and [increasing the likelihood of adverse effects of the vaccine](https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/vaccine-after-effects-more-common-in-those-who-already-had-covid)).

To quickly summarise, I am:

 * 28 years old
 * Male
 * White
 * 186cm
 * 80kg
 * No known comorbidities
 * Very healthy lifestyle (vegetarian diet, cardio+resistance exercise every day, non-smoker)

I would love to be able to enter that type of information somewhere to calculate my risk of hospitalisation or death due to covid, and my risk of side effects or death due to the vaccine. In the former case, the [QCovid](https://qcovid.org/) risk calculator is almost exactly what I'm looking for, except for the fact that it's based on data published in the first few months of the pandemic only. I can't find anything remotely similar for the vaccines, other than [fact-checking articles](https://fullfact.org/online/risk-children-death-covid/) describing some of the risks without any age/health status adjustment. Neither allows for adjustment by previous infection status either, which is perhaps even more important.

Based on those two (limited) sources, I can calculate that - even if I'm mistaken about being previously infected - I have a 1 in 333,333 risk of dying due to covid, compared with a 1 in 92,000 risk of dying due to blood clots due to the vaccine (a risk which I guess increases when you take into account a second jab, a third booster, etc). Based on that alone, I already feel justified in saying that **for me personally** the risks of the vaccine outweigh the benefits (I accept that the risk profile is very different for different people), and that therefore refusing the vaccine is the rational decision. However, I'm willing and eager to update that conclusion based on new and better data sources, if they exist. So can anybody point me in the right direction, and convince that getting the vaccine is actually the more rational decision?",,,,1631202669,{},hc6zoa3,False,t3_pksoeb,False,True,t3_pksoeb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pksoeb/daily_discussion_thread_september_09_2021/hc6zoa3/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,22c6534606cc0276269d7681c08cd4ed98f59461,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1631202686.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,,

[],,TrollfaceMcGee,,,[],,,,text,t2_44w7g,False,False,,"I can't really say for sure whether it would be any better to get Moderna for the third dose vs Pfizer, but just noting that Moderna was testing using the 50ug amount as their booster, which is the same as their second dose amount vs 100ug which would have been the first dose amount.

This is just my opinion, but I think probably the biggest part over which one you choose is just getting the third dose of either ~three or more months after the first two were done as it seems to trigger another good immune response to help ensure longer lasting/stronger protection.  I equate it to the same reason pretty much all childhood immunizations have 3-4 total shots, with the last dose usually being a few months after the previous ones.   I'm sure a lot of testing went into those childhood ones to determine that schedule, and unfortunately due to the dire urgency these COVID ones had to be rushed out without that same luxury, but you can probably assume the same logic for both.

Personally I don't think you'd be giving up any protection going with Pfizer for the third dose though.  I did take the semi-quantitative antibody test that Labcorp offers right at three weeks after my third Pfizer dose just to see if my antibody levels were high, and while those numbers don't prove any certain level of protection, my count was above the highest threshold they test for so I felt more confident after seeing that.  There have been a good bit of recent studies done that have correlated persons having higher antibody levels with being much less likely to end up with severe symptoms/being hospitalized, and in some cases being totally asymptomatic as the antibodies/immune system were able to neutralize the virus before it replicate too much and cause the severe issues.",,,,1631202327,{},hc6yujm,False,t3_pioafk,False,True,t1_hc6b37h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pioafk/fauci_says_us_plans_to_start_covid19_vaccine/hc6yujm/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,4662c67f6cd314c3c9388d2926d631d9a5ee5242,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1631202339.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,,

It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

I included the part about Tylenol to illustrate that it was a slightly hypocritical position. 


Instead, I think I‚Äôm just going to try and explain this to you because much like I was before I met my in-laws you‚Äôre probably just ignorant. In the United States and I‚Äôm guessing other countries probably work the same way, but definitely in the United States it‚Äôs not like your religion point of view is handed down to you from one person. Christians, specifically evangelical Christians go to church on Sunday listen to a sermon, then go to Bible studies throughout the week. Bible studies are led by, sometimes pastors, but often just their fellow churchgoers. They all talk about Bible and current events and try and decide what their worldview is based on their interpretations of certain Bible verses that they think are applicable. So when a bunch of people are sitting around and decide that they use the board and fetus cells despite the fact that they don‚Äôt really understand how that worked, and this is against their religion because they‚Äôre against abortion, that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs decided that this vaccine is against their religion.


Are they wrong? Objectively yes. They have no understanding of how any of this works. They have zero understanding of science, and they are willfully ignorant of it and it‚Äôs working. If you try to explain it to them they shut down get angry at you and tell you something along the lines of ‚Äúwe‚Äôre doing what‚Äôs right in the eyes of God‚Äú.

Point is; in the general population, there may not be a difference in clinical outcomes, that is, the amount of new infections that cause hospitalization, and in turn deaths, in either case. The breakthrough infection deaths are almost exclusively among the elderly and otherwise compromised, and they don't have the best of prognosis over any length of time. So we'll likely continue to see these numbers, 3rd shot or not, so long as the delta variant is circulating freely with vaccination rates still too low to curb the spread.

Polio is really not a good comparison; the polio virus has been eradicated for over 30 years in the developed world. We vaccinate children as a precaution, and the polio vaccine is something like 99% lifetime effective after that one shot. If polio were live and spreading at covid rates, with a vaccine with waning efficacy over time you'd see a very different picture.",,,,1631217022,{},hc7ygaj,False,t3_pkyyju,False,True,t1_hc7rig8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pkyyju/israeli_study_finds_third_shot_provides/hc7ygaj/,1631306183.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is exactly my takeaway. Upon what is he basing that? There has been shown to be some waning immunity. But there is no indication that the waning will continue, or that it will get worse.

There are other theories that the effectiveness of the vaccine declines after 6 months and then stabilizes, and another theory that [it actually increases](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/08/30/1032520934/immunity-to-covid-19-could-last-longer-than-youd-think).

* The first part of this is creating a policy that federal workers must get vaccinated or be terminated. Since he is the head of the executive branch, he has the authority to set guidelines like that.

* The second part is instructing any contractor that does business with the federal government or healthcare agency that receives Medicare/Medicaid dollars to make the same policy within their own companies. If those companies want to continue to do business with the federal government, they will need to comply with this policy.

* The third part is instructing OSHA to implement a policy that requires any employer that has more than 100 employees to require vaccinations or testing. The penalty for not doing so is a fine.

[],,Gatsu871113,,,[],,,,text,t2_ilqrvpr,False,False,[],"Well vaccine efficacy in lowering the chance of severe illness and hospitalization is proven in my opinion.  That's probably the conclusion that you and I both reached, to at least be decidedly convinced that it was the right thing to do as individuals.  ... hence, we got vaccinated.  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
There is a huge misunderstanding that not many people are spending time interrogating though.  The whole ""can't go to a concert (or go on a flight) because you aren't vaccinated"" makes very limited sense given the information available to people.  The media spends absolutely zero time or effort on the distinction between  vaccinating people to reduce spread directly, and vaccinating people to reduce spread indirectly and reduce mortality.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I imagine a person at a conference, wedding, concert or on a flight.  Are we telling them that they have to be vaccinated because they are metaphorically ""spouts of extreme nuclear radiation"", and vaccinated people *arent*?  The difference between trabsmissibility of Delta (and probably Mu too) between vaccinated and unvaccinated people is very small.  
  
So if unvaccinated people aren't uniquely subject to having a nuclear meltdown and infecting hundreds of people whereas vaccinated aren't... are we mandating that these people get vaccinated so they don't spontaneously become symptomatic and decline from a condition of ""feeling good"", to ""put me on my deathbed"" over the course of 3-5 hours?  It is quite obvious to me that their status as unvaccinated people is anything is a higher risk position to choose, but the real consequence for them is that depending on their age and comorbidities, they're only manipulating their chances of severe illness.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
The big glaring externality here, since most COVID infection is now Delta variant infection, is that a person who chooses not to be vaccinated and does have severe illness, and ends up in a hospital is one more person who can infect healthcare workers and cohabitators.  We have to be honest about the average person's rate of hospitalization too.  Last I checked (it could be different now) the hospitalization rate averaged across all risk categories, was 0.5 percent.  1 in 200.  
ie.  We mandate the vaccine for each 200 person sample size, to reduce the exposure of a COVID infected patient to a healthcare worker and their housemates by 1.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
Is that good ROI?  How does the situation change moving forward since we are putting selection pressure against replication of variants that don't spread as well among vaccinated people?  
  
The NHS did an interesting study on its nurses and they measured transmission from vaccinated nurses to their vaccinated housemates.  They didn't wait for symptoms, they did blanket testing at set intervals.  I think it was like once per week for their housemates and much more often for the nurses themselves.  
The study was pre-Delta variant, and vaccinated-to-vaccinated transmission was only about 35%.  So the vaccine seemed to help a lot.  
  
Post-Delta appearance, we are seeing a study (the one I linked) that is under peer review telling us the vaccine isn't reducing the spread from vaccinated people to others.  Or at least, it is doing little to reduce spread, or results could be considered within the margin of error.  
  
I have more data in mind thay informs my impression of how well the vaccine is reducing spread, and I am not overly impressed.  I'm vaccinated for my own benefit still.  I advise others to get vaccinated.  The misinformation hype train about ending spread and curbing new variants through increasing pressure on people to be vaccinated via mandates is not advisable in my opinion.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  

I foresee more variants arising and plenty of unfettered and unappreciated spread (spread and replication go hand in hand) coming from vaccinated people running around acting as though they aren't part of this system.  
  
Then once some bureaucrat updates the people and the MSM starts pounding the masses with ""new information"", they'll have to find something else to blame for the fact COVID still exists.

Otherwise how can you verify an anti-vax person vs a vaxxed person? You can't until you admit them.  
  
So in emergency rooms, when they are checking everyone in, if you who proof of vax you will get admitted ahead of someone who is unvaxxed.  
  
This sounds extreme but I don't think people understand how bad things are going to get. The case loads that are already overloading some hospitals are going to keep getting worse, just like last year, until end of January 2022. Then it will slowly get less worse for several months until hospitals are back on par with the care they can provide and how many people need it.  
  
That is a likely situation imo. Areas that are being hit hardest today could get a lot more restrictive on gathering, masks, vaccines, etc and that could change our trajectory but my assumption is we are going to have to see some areas in the US go through what happened in India before we see significant change.  
  
It also seems possible that because of how fast delta spreads we could see the worst effects much sooner than january 2022 and the because covid has infected everyone, killing who knows how many, things might ~~be better~~ less worse sooner than expected because of the increased resistance to future infections....? That seems like wishful thinking. That should be happening this year but the virus didn't come back the same as before, we should expect it to keep coming back differently every year for at least 5 years and we should be trying like hell to prevent the spread in every reasonable way possible.  
  
Reasonable is currently standing farther apart, wearing a mask and getting a vaccine.

Looking at the census data, 18.1% of people in Colorado are &lt;12 years old (so they aren't eligible to get vaccinated yet). And most likely 0% of &lt;12yo people are vaccinated. Also, it's no secret that &lt;12yo are MUCH less likely to be hospitalized in the first place.

So I propose a much more fair comparison would be to remove children from the above altogether:

* Colorado population (according to this data): 5,763,976
* Colorado pop excluding &lt;12yo (by removing 18.1%): 4,720,695
* Number of vaccinated people (&gt;12yo): 3,079,652
* Number of unvacc'd people (&gt;12yo): 1,641,043
* New hospitalized case rate of Vaccd: 109 cases / 3,079,652 people (per 100,000) = **3.53** (Same as before)
* New hospitalized case rate for non-vac: 355 cases / 1,641,043 people (per 100,000) = **21.63**!!

I think this normalized the data and provides a fair comparison since NO children (&lt;12yo) are represented in the vaccinated group, but ALL children are represented in the unvaccinated group. This is now comparing apples to apples, since kids won't skew the numbers.

Before it was a 3.5 rate vs 13.2 rate of hospitalization by vaccination status = ""3.7 times less likely to be hospitalized"".  
Normalized data by removing uneligible children is now 3.53 vs 21.63 = **""6.1 times less likely to be hospitalized""**

I would imagine we would find something similar if we do the same for total deaths.

Feedback is appreciated.

-----

__TL:DR - It's unfair to include non-eligible children in the statistics since it skews the data in favor of non-vaccd. If we normalize the data by removing all people &lt;12 years old, the numbers are more likely to be 6.1 times less likely to be hospitalized (almost twice as much!).",,,,1631208825,{},hc7ejbw,False,t3_pkw8el,False,True,t3_pkw8el,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pkw8el/colorado_rolls_out_breakthrough_case_data_to_show/hc7ejbw/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,df2adeb7445c9d3337aaf90cb3323676b86a0577,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1631208837.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,,

[],,stillobsessed,,,[],,,,text,t2_j54oj,False,False,[],"There is a conceivable reason why you might get poked more than once during a vaccination, but given your description it seems unlikely.

When you give an intramuscular injection, you want the injection to go into muscle (where it will stay in one place for a bit), not a blood vessel (where it goes all over the body).   A somewhat old-school practice to confirm proper needle placement is called ""aspiration"": the needle is inserted and then you pull back a little on the plunger to see if you see blood (indicating that you hit a blood vessel); if you see blood, you pull the needle, discard the syringe, and start over at a different spot.

This has been discouraged for a while because it hurts more (which discourages people from coming back for another shot) and it's not believed to make much of a difference to vaccine safety or effectiveness: 

&gt; Aspiration before injection of vaccines or toxoids (i.e., pulling back on the syringe plunger after needle insertion but before injection) is not necessary because no large blood vessels are present at the recommended injection sites, and a process that includes aspiration might be more painful for infants

*but* 

now some suspect that injecting mRNA covid vaccines into a blood vessel might be the trigger for myocarditis (and it's been shown to be a myocarditis trigger in mice: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34406358/ so it's not entirely out of the question) and have called for a return to this old-school practice.",,,,1631203244,{},hc712e3,False,t3_pksoeb,False,False,t1_hc6h0yb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pksoeb/daily_discussion_thread_september_09_2021/hc712e3/,1631285380.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have some mixed feelings about this study.  This doesn't really help our case (by ""our"", I mean people like myself who strongly advocate for masking.)

The absolute risk reduction was only 1%.  (The relative risk reduction was 9.3%).

For vaccines, the absolute risk reduction is 1.2% for Moderna and 0.84% for Pfizer.  However the relative risk reduction for Mrna vaccines is about 95%. 

I think it is more important to encourage vaccination than masking.  Probably still important to promote both, but vaccination makes a profound difference and this study suggests that while promoting masking DOES make a difference, it is not anywhere near as large a difference as vaccination.

And I just want to add that this masking study was designed to see if **promoting** mask use ""works"".

The spread of the highly infectious variant has pushed the country‚Äôs daily average caseload over 150,000 for the first time since late January, overwhelming hospitals in hard-hit areas and killing roughly 1,500 people a day.

Mr. Biden, who was briefed by his team of coronavirus advisers on Wednesday afternoon, is set to deliver a speech at 5 p.m. Eastern that will address about six areas where his administration can encourage ‚Äî or, at this point, push ‚Äî more eligible Americans to receive vaccines, according to the White House.

Officials offered few specifics, stressing that the plan was still coming together. But two officials familiar with the plan said that it would include new federal requirements for vaccination, and that its underlying message would be that the only way to return to some sense of normalcy was to get as many people vaccinated as possible.

‚ÄúWe know that increasing vaccinations will stop the spread of the pandemic, will get the pandemic under control, will return people to normal life,‚Äù Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Wednesday. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what our objective is, so we want to be specific about what we‚Äôre trying to achieve.‚Äù

The Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs decision last month to grant full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has already prompted the Pentagon to require members of the military to be vaccinated. Mr. Biden said at the time that the approval should sweep away any lingering doubts about vaccination and spur more mandates.

When asked if Mr. Biden would be adding more detail to existing policies or would outline measures that would have an immediate and broad effect on Americans, Ms. Psaki replied: ‚ÄúIt depends on if you‚Äôre vaccinated or not.‚Äù

Administration officials see signs that more people in the United States are open to receiving shots ‚Äî some 14 million got their first shots in August, four million more than in July, Ms. Psaki said. But about 27 percent of the eligible U.S. population age 12 and older have not received any Covid vaccinations, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In some of the hardest-hit states, the unvaccinated percentage is higher: 42 percent in Texas, for instance, and 38 percent in Florida.

About 1.3 million fully vaccinated people have received a third shot after federal officials approved them for people with compromised immune systems. Mr. Biden has publicly supported the idea of broadening the availability of third shots as boosters for much more of the population, but health experts have advised the White House to hold off promoting that for now.
On Wednesday, Ms. Psaki said that the White House was working toward a plan for boosters, but did not give a time frame. She told reporters that Mr. Biden had chosen Thursday to deliver an extensive speech on the virus because he understood it was ‚Äútop of mind for Americans‚Äù as they return to schools and offices.

The president will also be seeking to course-correct after a difficult month for his administration, directing the public away from a chaotic and violent end to the war in Afghanistan and back toward his administration‚Äôs efforts to curb a pandemic that has upended every facet of American life.

But amid renewed fears of the virus‚Äôs damaging effect on the economy and the prevalence of a troublesome variant, even Mr. Biden‚Äôs allies say it will take more than a speech to ease concerns that the virus has once again spiraled out of a president‚Äôs control.

‚ÄúHe ran on competence, bringing adults back into the room,‚Äù said Nick Rathod, a former domestic policy adviser to President Barack Obama. ‚ÄúThis is something that he needs to take control of and show his level of competency.

I don't think the woman in the background was smirking because she found the fact that his grandma had died directly funny instead of the notion that the reason she died was due to anti maskers as I've seen many saying. 

Personally I think it was the kind of smirk you give when someone says something you totally disagree with and you roll your eyes and smirk at such a ridiculous statement, or when you see someone on a talent show using a dead relative as a sob story to garner affection (not that that was what he was doing). 

She did it just as he said that his grandma died ""because people weren't wearing masks"". To her that is stupid and just doesn't compute. In that context, she's no worse than any of the other anti maskers we've seen so many of, i.e. willfully stupid and utterly deserving of scorn and ridicule.

What exactly is the goal now? Wait for kids to be able to get vaccinated and then things can go back to normal?

I agree: deny services that they chose to not get, but having people forcefully vaccinating them would fulfill their doomsday fantasies. Let people lie in the beds they make and keep them from harming everyone else, while not denying their rights. (note: rights not luxuries)

It's like saying ""other than having to sell everything i own to pay for not dying, I've really had the same experience as my cousin up North"" (yes, an exaggeration, to make the point - but not unheard of which in an of itself is telling)

I've had two children and one life saving surgery (including multi day hospital stays). I'm scheduled for another non-optional but not yet love threatening surgery later this year. My bill for everything: $0


&gt;As Americans who have to pay 100% of our premium (independent contractors), my husband and I pay a little over $11,000 per year in premiums alone.

Not sure why you pay so much but I expect provincial differences will play into it. Until recently however the premium for a resident of BC was around $70/mo. Usually paid by employers, it's now been entirely eliminated.


&gt; Even pre-pandemic, we often wait weeks to see a doctor. Even pre-pandemic, we can only be ‚Äúseen‚Äù sooner if we agree to a Teledoc or video chat appointment with a doctor that is not always our actual doctor.

This is not uncommon here as finding a dedicated family doctor / GP is hard. However with that said walk ins take people every day and the wait (here at least) isn't too bad (on average, pre-pandemic).


I'm sure there are anecdotal stories that are exemplars of either side of the (care in Canada is awesome/sucks spectrum), but on the whole it is a good system that saves thousands of lives every day, and does not result in a life-altering financial burden.

I expect if you took the *actual* experiences of Americans and Canadians, across the spectrum, and over time, you'd find on average the level of care is comparable and the individual cost is significantly lower. And for those on the lower end of the economic spectrum the difference would be stark (especially if you were to account for those that didn't seek or receive care due to the prohibitive costs).",,,,1631208241,{},hc7d4bz,False,t3_pkylxo,False,False,t1_hc76dw9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pkylxo/patients_forced_to_wait_thousands_of_minutes_in/hc7d4bz/,1631292938.0,20,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,
