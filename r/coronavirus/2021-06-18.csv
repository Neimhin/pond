This is despite the UK having 80% of its population vaccinated (50% fully vaccinated with 2 doses). While mostly circulating in the unvaccinated young community, there is still a great level of spread through fully vaccinated people.
Our cases are dramatically rising and our estimated R rate is currently 2.
Hospitalisations are going up.
This is from very low levels, and I think at the rate it is increasing, the vaccines will win out before the spread has spiralled too far out of control.
I believe I saw a figure that said 100 of 800 people who were hospitalised had actually been fully vaccinated. However the vast majority of the people which go on to hospital and then die have still not been vaccinated.
Our vaccine program should be done soon, and I believe that once it is, there will be sufficient suppression of the virus to stop it's spread without any major restrictions needed.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Friday that he understands Italy after Rome halted the export of a batch of 250,000 doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. In halting the departure of the jabs, which came from a plant near Rome, Italy became the first EU country to use a new European mechanism on export controls. The European Commission authorised the move in light of AstraZeneca's failure to supply the vaccines it had pledged to deliver in Europe and the fact that Australia is not a vulnerable country. ""In Italy, people are dying at the rate of 300 a day. So I can certainly understand the high level of anxiety that would exist in Italy and in many countries across Europe,"" AFP quoted Morrison as saying. ""They are in an unbridled crisis situation.

It was a beautiful night last night in Seattle.  The power was interrupted because of an errant tree branch and was not predicted to come back for hours.

My buddies family had recently reached full vaccination as they started to vax children over 12.  In celebration they brought a full take out meal over and our families shared a sunny evening avoiding the kitchen and just hanging out eating dinner.

It was fantastic.  It was this moment... this bookend to isolation and masks and avoidance and worry.  

And at the end my friend and I went through some boxes of board games I have stacked in my living room to see if there were any he wanted to take with him.  

You see, my older brother had died towards the end of the pandemic of an odd heart attack. He was out of work and had not been to the doctor in a while.  I was being responsible and even though it broke my heart I avoided the funeral.  My SIL was not so cautious, and in her grief let her guard down.  She died of COVID a few weeks later.  

The board games were in my living room because people knew that over the decades my brother Buck and I had played geeky board games together since our childhoods 60 years ago.  We connected and argued and laughed over them in every family event I can remember.  We missed last summers gaming because we wanted to be safe.

So at the end of a perfect post-covid day, I realized these boxes of games sitting in my living room was the last physical remnant of all the times spent with my brother.  These boxes of games, shared out with friends and added to my own collection marked the last time I would be making stories with my brother. 

It had shifted to remembering stories.  In a way my brothers tombstone was sitting in my living room.  This struck me hard last night.

It is never going back to the way it was.  Never.  But it is getting better.  Be safe everyone.",,,1624110919,{},h2bo1s6,False,t3_o3a98e,False,False,t3_o3a98e,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o3a98e/daily_discussion_thread_june_19_2021/h2bo1s6/,1624430343,22,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

I added that in for any third-party readers, as people seem to be consuming medical information and taking it as fact without consulting professionals.

&gt; Check back to 2009. There were reported deaths after females received the vaccine. Fainting, bloodclots...oh yeah ""unconfirmed"" deaths even though there were doctors questioning the safety of the drug

So Gardasil, in the US, was approved in 2006 for women aged 9-26. This was extended in 2009 to cover both men and women. I will focus on Gardasil, not Gardasil-9, as that was the vaccine used during the year you cited (2009).

With Gardasil, there were 183 reports of death submitted to VAERS out of 80 million doses administered. That sounds like a lot, but remember - just like COVID vaccines, anyone can submit to VAERS, and it doesn't have to be related to the vaccine at all. Of the 183 reports, only 67 deaths were confirmed (as in - they were only able to obtain death certificates or autopsy reports for 67 of the 183). 

When reviewing the data, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/hpv/hpv-safety-faqs.html) concluded that there was no ""pattern of death occurring with respect to time after vaccination, and there was no consistent vaccine dose number or combination of vaccines given among the reports. In summary, the evidence did not suggest a causal link between Gardasil and the reported deaths.""

This position is not solely held or stated by the CDC - numerous academic papers have, again and again, asserted that there is no such link. 

[""Despite the inevitable publication of case reports raising the potential association between HPV vaccination and a range of severe chronic conditions of poorly defined aetiology such as multiple sclerosis, evidence from these well-conducted population-based studies has consistently not identified any new or concerning safety issues.""](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40264-013-0039-5#Sec22)

In a large scale study of 71,177 people, they concluded that [""The results suggest no causal association between the HPV vaccines and reported symptoms.""](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405852117300708)

[""While safety concerns about HPV vaccines have been raised, these have systematically been investigated: to date, the WHO's GACVS has not found any safety issue that would alter any of the current recommendations for the use of the vaccine""](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055804/)


From the BMJ, [""In this nationwide cohort study, with more than 500 000 doses of HPV vaccines, no evidence was found to support an association between HPV vaccination and serious adverse events using both cohort analysis and self-controlled risk interval analysis""](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.m4931)

Now, one of the examples that people bring up is the Tarsell family. They'll even say that since the NVICP awarded compensation, that it must mean that the vaccine's role in her death is proven. In reality, making such a conclusion wouldn't be appropriate. There are articles online that detail the legal circumstances and the reasons why compensation was awarded.  

&gt; Blood clots

From a study with over 500,000 women who received a HPV vaccine, [""Our results, which were consistent after adjustment for oral contraceptive use and in girls and young women as well as mid-adult women, do not provide support for an increased risk of VTE following quadrivalent HPV vaccination""](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1886177)

&gt; Fainting

Yep, people faint! It happens at higher than baseline rates with all sorts of vaccines. As per the CDC, [""Because the ingredients of these three vaccines are different, yet fainting is seen with all of them, scientists think that fainting is due to the vaccination process and not to the vaccines themselves""](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/fainting.html)

From surveillance data from Australia, they concluded that[ ""AESI, apart from syncope, were reported rarely""](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X20308252) and that ""Other AESI including autoimmune disease, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, primary ovarian insufficiency, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome and venous thromboembolism, were reported at low rates and analysis did not reveal unexpected patterns that would suggest causal association."" They also say that ""A high rate of syncope [fainting] was reported as an early concern but later found to be consistent with expected rates""

&gt; glass particles

Concerning, but note that:

1. This happens more frequently than you think. It's unfortunate, but manufacturing is not perfect, and things break or go wrong. [Here's](https://archive.triblive.com/news/wire-stories/ranbaxy-recalls-generic-lipitor-doses-for-glass-shards/) a [couple](https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/par-pharmaceutical-inc-issues-voluntary-nationwide-recall-one-lot-mycophenolate-mofetil-injection) examples.

2. This was a voluntary recall issued by Merck.

3. [Out of the 743k vials of the vaccine that were part of the recall, Merck estimates that ""approximately ten of those vials could have glass particles in them""](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2013/s1220-gardasil-vaccine.html)

4. I could not find a single case where someone was impacted by this.

As an aside, I haven't even addressed the other factor to HPV vaccines - the reductions in risk of getting penile or cervical cancer or genital warts.

Does cast doubt on everyone assuming immunity for years. The many accounts of reinfection on the longhaul subreddit also has me convinced. Not many flu/cold-like viruses induce loss of taste/smell.

Also you posted something that is merely speculation. It's just theorizing based on evidence of seroconversion and antibody titers shortly after clearing infection, speculation based on memory B cell duration for measles and mumps. It also only shows evidence for durations of 1 year: ""In early studies, challenge of volunteers with the 229E coronavirus strain led to complete resistance to reinfection and shedding by the same virus for at least 1 y"". That was a 1 year challenge study. The rest of the paper is extrapolating and talking about ethics of challenge studies.

The R-value of sars-cov-2 matches that of other coronaviruses. It wouldn't surprise me if antibody response (memory B cell mediated, even) matches that of other coronaviruses. In any case, there doesn't seem strong evidence one way or the other. But my money is on immunity waning at 9m and typically no longer present past 1-1.5y. We do have some evidence of reinfections - enough anecdotes can't be ignored.

Forget which one, but the island has a policy of needing a negative test on arrival for the fully vaccinated, or else 5 days of quarantine on arrival for the unvaccinated.

This person was fully vaccinated BUT they had AstraZeneca as their first shot and Pfizer as their second. Canada allows mixing shots and supposedly mixing AZ with an mRNA vaccine yields better results so people have been doing that.

Thing is, this island country says that only vaccines as approved by the WHO count as 'fully vaccinated', and since the WHO doesn't state that mixing vaccine brands is allowed the person is considered unvaccinated and has to quarantine for 5 days.

I'm not sure how common mixing vaccines are in countries. I don't think it is in the US. Apparently, they have at least some in Canada, and I heard someone say they were in the UK and their second shot was whatever was available. 

I'd consider them fully vaccinated even if they had different doses or more than the length of time specified between shots -- for example, the UK was trying to vaccinate a lot of people with just one shot first and then moving on to second shots, so the shots are more spread out than recommended by the WHO -- but apparently, some countries might not.

|Total stock|Cumulative lost doses|
|:-|:-|
|204,090|8,621|

Note: Since March 22, syringes with a low dead volume have been used across the country, allowing an average of 6.8 doses to be extracted from a Pfizer vial (registered as 6 doses per vial) and 11.5 doses from an AstraZeneca and Moderna vial (10 doses per vial, including losses). This results in the actual stock being around 15 percent higher than noted in the tables.

BY AGE GROUP

The percentage shows the number of persons within the relevant age group who have received at least 1 dose.

Clearly the research that went into using the modified mRNA bases was valid. It is likely that the mRNA is being destroyed or modified before being able to create enough of the spike proteins. 

Most other vaccines use inactivated virus particles. Novavax uses a stabilized spike protein, but delivers it directly (it is made in a lab; it does not use your own cells to generate it).",,,1624136842,{},h2d1j85,False,t3_o3a98e,False,False,t1_h2d0ox9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o3a98e/daily_discussion_thread_june_19_2021/h2d1j85/,1624456298,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Like, you are sitting in the waiting room. There are people waiting with you. You will get a shot, but you are well prepared. The shot is necessary because‚Ä¶ and so on. Talk to you like you would calm and convince a child to like the shot. Be clear to you, that you will not die. 
Third: do not avoid these situations. Do not flee or talk your self out. I had like 10-15 of these situations in the past years, Training like I said‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm absolutely better. When I tell people I might faint, afterwards they seem to thing I exaggerated. But they are proud and I‚Äôm proud as well. Now I trust my body and gain confidence. Once in a while, I fled or had to move out of the situation. But it is getting less and less.

[],,Viewfromthe31stfloor,,,[],,,,text,t2_3nelaphm,False,True,[],"&gt;This much is clear: The coronavirus is becoming more transmissible. Ever since the virus emerged in China, it has been gaining mutations that help it spread more easily among humans. The Alpha variant, first detected in the United Kingdom last year, is 50 percent more transmissible than the original version, and now the Delta variant, first detected in India, is at least 40 percent more transmissible than Alpha.

&gt;What‚Äôs less certain, however, is how the virus‚Äôs increased transmissibility will affect the pandemic in the United States. Alpha‚Äôs arrival prompted worries about a new surge in the spring, but one never came. The proportion of Alpha cases kept going up, but the total number of cases kept going down. People got vaccinated. Alpha became dominant in the U.S. Cases fell even further. The virus had become more biologically transmissible, but it wasn‚Äôt being transmitted to more people.

&gt;There was one notable and confusing exception: In April, Michigan experienced a spike in cases that experts believe was indeed fueled by Alpha. The fact that the variant had such different consequences for Michigan than it did for the rest of the country shows just how difficult it is to make predictions. Vaccines protect against Alpha, but fears about the variants that slightly erode vaccine protection, Beta and Gamma, have also quieted; neither is causing significant case spikes among the vaccinated. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs ever a time that we needed to be humble, it‚Äôs around this issue,‚Äù says Michael Osterholm, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota.

&gt;Delta has gotten so much attention because it has the most troubling collection of traits yet: It is markedly more transmissible than Alpha, can sicken a large proportion of people who have had only one dose of a vaccine (though not those who have had two), and may even cause more severe disease. All of this is enough to be a warning, especially as Delta is now responsible for 10 percent of U.S. cases and rising. But as with Alpha, which was also suspected to be more severe, how the variant ends up behaving in the real world will depend on more than its biology. It will also depend on how we‚Äîthe virus‚Äôs hosts‚Äîchoose to behave, how many more people we vaccinate, and, to some extent, how lucky we get.",,,1624055593,{},h29g81n,False,t3_o31q1v,False,False,t3_o31q1v,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o31q1v/expect_the_unexpected_from_the_delta_variant/h29g81n/,1624386085,29,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

How frequently does that sort of entirely ineffective immune response happen with other viruses? I understand the difference between a precise, controlled response to the spike protein that we get from the current vaccines and the variable response we get from natural infection. To me, though, it seems like a leap to say that the completely ineffective immune response would occur with enough frequency to say that natural immunity would be significant less effective than say the J+J vaccine? We‚Äôve seen that people who have been naturally infected are reinfected at a rate of much less than 30%, which would make natural immunity better than J+J at preventing infection.

My point is, is kinda pointless to be comparing the vaccines in scenarios like ‚Äúthis one is good this one is not‚Äù when the most important part of the vaccines are to reduce deaths, and as I‚Äôve said, both of them do that.

[],,Vegaviguera,,,[],,,,text,t2_32oyd1fc,False,False,[],"&gt;**On substance, what are the main points the court makes?**  
&gt;  
&gt;First, the case was urgent and needed to be handled in emergency proceedings ‚Äì quote: ‚Äúprima facie, the delays of the vaccination may have damaging consequences on individual freedoms of the EU citizens and, as a consequence, on the economic life of the EU and the Member States. Those are downsides that are sufficiently serious to justify an immediate decision on the number of doses of vaccine that AstraZeneca had to deliver to the EU‚Äù (p. 36, n¬∞ 17).  
&gt;  
&gt;Second, AstraZeneca breached the agreement by:  
&gt;  
&gt;choosing not to use the all the manufacturing sites at its disposal to manufacture and deliver the vaccines to the Member States, especially the site located in the UK - quote: ‚ÄúAstraZeneca intentionally chose not to use the means at its disposal to manufacture and deliver the vaccines (‚Ä¶)‚Äù (p. 50, n¬∞ 46).  
&gt;  
&gt;prioritising the UK over the EU and thereby violating its warranty that it was not under any obligation that conflicts with the terms of the agreement with the EU - quote: ‚Äúthe delays can be explained by the obligations towards the UK prioritised by AstraZeneca, which substantially conflicted with the agreement with the EU and impeded the complete fulfillment thereof. Therebyn AstraZeneca has ‚Äì apparently ‚Äì deliberately breached its contractual warranty, contained in Article 13.1(e) of the APA‚Äù (p. 51, n¬∞ 48).  
&gt;  
&gt;Because of those breaches, AstraZeneca was ordered today by the Court of First Instance of Brussels to deliver to the EU and its Member States 50 million doses in three installments until September 27th with a 10 Euro penalty for each dose not delivered in due time. Quote: ‚ÄúIn view of its behavior since the negotiations and the multiple aborted communications, one can fear that AstraZeneca will not comply with this judgment or, at least, not in a reasonable time to preserve the rights of the EU. It is justified to pair the aforementioned sentencing with a penalty. (‚Ä¶) To compel AstraZeneca to perform its obligations, we pair the sentencing with a penalty (‚Ä¶) of 10 ‚Ç¨ per missing dose at each deadline (‚Ä¶) Therefore, of AstraZeneca does not deliver any dose at each of the three deadlines, it will be liable towards the EU for a penalty of 500.000.000 ‚Ç¨, this amount being the de facto cap of the penalty‚Äù (p. 63, nos 75 and 76).  
&gt;  
&gt;**What did the court decide on the question of the UK sites?**  
&gt;  
&gt;According to the Belgian judge, AZ committed a serious breach of the contract by not using the UK site, which  should have been used as stipulated in the contract  quote: ‚ÄúThe choice to monopolize the Oxford Biomedica site for the UK and therefore to deprive the EU from a manufacturing site mentioned in the agreement is even more damaging that its yield is twice as high as the yield of Novsaep, Catalent and Halix (‚Ä¶).  
&gt;  
&gt;In view of the magnitude of the delays experienced by AZ and the difficulties of the manufacturing sites of Novasep and Catalent a pharmaceutical company normally diligent and prudent placed under the same circumstances of a health crisis would not have deliberately chosen to deprive the European Union of all the supplies from the contractual manufacturing site with the highest yield ‚Äì as AZ did‚Äù (pp. 50 and 51, n¬∞ 46).",,,1624098483,{},h2b7bky,True,t3_o3d0kb,False,True,t3_o3d0kb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o3d0kb/belgian_court_orders_astrazeneca_to_deliver/h2b7bky/,1624421721,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Sure, but they did inform that they were coming way behind. Probably a bit later than they should've done. The largest issue I believe was countries hoarding ingredients. The biggest offender there was the US, and those ingredients went to Pfizer so uts no surprise they did a good job.

Exclusive | Coronavirus: Hong Kong study finds ‚Äòsubstantial‚Äô antibody-level difference between BioNTech, Sinovac jab recipients  
Amount of antibodies does not directly reflect individual‚Äôs level of protection, but researcher notes increasing evidence that higher levels generally correspond with greater immunity against infection  
Objective of study was to estimate incidence of natural infections over time and level of population immunity due to infections and vaccinations

A major Hong Kong study has found ‚Äúsubstantially higher‚Äù levels of antibodies in people vaccinated against Covid-19 with BioNTech jabs, compared with those who received the Chinese-made Sinovac vaccine.  
The presence of antibodies is a sign that the vaccine is working to protect the individual from the coronavirus.  
But the study‚Äôs findings have raised questions about a government plan to shorten the quarantine period for vaccinated travellers arriving in Hong Kong.  
Lead researcher Professor Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist with the University of Hong Kong (HKU), told the Post the results also suggested that some of those who had received the Sinovac vaccine might need a booster shot.

The government-commissioned study was conducted by HKU‚Äôs school of public health and involved tracking the antibody responses of 1,000 people who received either vaccine. Supported by the Health and Medical Research Fund, the objective of the study was to estimate the incidence of natural infections over time and the level of population immunity due to infections and vaccinations.  
The details of the findings would be published first in academic journals, Cowling said.  
‚ÄúWe do see substantially higher antibody responses in people who received the BioNTech vaccine, consistent with the higher levels of clinical protection reported in the large phase-three clinical trial of that vaccine, compared to the phase-three clinical trial of the Sinovac vaccine,‚Äù he said.

The German-made BioNTech vaccine has been reported to have a 95 per cent efficacy rate, while the mark for Sinovac is 50.7 per cent.   
Hong Kong has administered more than 3 million doses of vaccines to residents since late February, comprising 1.7 million BioNTech jabs and 1.3 million Sinovac shots. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and her top officials received the mainland-made vaccine when it arrived in the city in February. 

Cowling said preliminary findings from about 100 participants in the study were in line with the efficacy rates published by the pharmaceutical firms.   
Antibodies are proteins generated by the human body‚Äôs immune system to identify and neutralise foreign objects such as the coronavirus. Their presence could indicate a prior infection, or that a vaccine is working.   
The amount of antibodies does not directly reflect the individual‚Äôs level of protection, but Cowling said there was increasing evidence that higher levels generally corresponded with greater immunity against infection.   
He explained that a higher amount of antibodies usually took longer to dissipate and subside, meaning the period of protection provided by a vaccine could be longer. 

But even when antibodies were no longer detectable, some people might still be able to mount a robust defence against a virus that attacked them.  
Cowling said that during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, for example, some elderly people showed signs of protection, perhaps because they were exposed to a similar virus strain when they were young.   
A recent study by Chinese University of 111 individuals who received either Sinovac or BioNTech jabs found all of them were able to generate antibodies against Covid-19.   
Lam said her administration was looking into using antibody screening, such as a finger prick blood test, to shorten the current 14-day hotel quarantine for most overseas arrivals. 

Government scientific advisers have recommended cutting the quarantine period to seven days for vaccinated travellers arriving from medium-risk countries if, upon arrival, they test positive for Covid-19 antibodies and negative for the virus itself.   
Officials were also considering a separate quarantine waiver for fully vaccinated business travellers from non-high-risk places as Hong Kong‚Äôs Covid-19 situation eased, but health experts have suggested these travellers should also clear an antibody test.   
Cowling said he supported the ‚Äúinclusion of antibody testing to shorten quarantine‚Äù.  
He added: ‚ÄúI think it will be justified to offer exemption of quarantine for fully vaccinated people who have a positive test for antibodies and a negative test for the virus, because of the very low risk of infection in this group.‚Äù 

But he noted that his findings showed there could be issues in rolling out the antibody tests for travellers because in some cases, testing might fail to pick up small amounts of antibodies generated by the Sinovac vaccine.   
The study results come at a time when the city‚Äôs health authorities are expected to look at procuring vaccine supplies to provide booster shots that improve protection against the virus.  
Both vaccines available in Hong Kong require two jabs.   
Since Sinovac recipients have a lower level of antibodies, Cowling believed his study showed the need for a third dose of the vaccine to lengthen the protection period for some people.   
Further research was needed to determine the exact timing and effectiveness of booster shots, he said.",,,1624101139,{},h2ba71o,False,t3_o34m8a,False,True,t1_h2atwi4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o34m8a/antibody_response_stronger_with_biontech_vaccine/h2ba71o/,1624423241,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Current regulations require Chinese nationals to provide ‚Äúcompelling reasons‚Äù to enter France and then quarantine themselves for seven days after arriving, if granted entry.

The official website of the Chinese Embassy in France issued an announcement on June 14 to remind Chinese citizens of the new French regulations. A staff member in the Chinese Embassy in France told Radio Free Asia (RFA) that Beijing will implement ‚Äúreciprocal sanctions,‚Äù that is, when French people enter China, China won‚Äôt recognize their vaccination with non-Chinese vaccines.

Mainland Chinese media reported the regime‚Äôs retaliatory measures against France on June 15, adding that travelers from France are required to be quarantined upon arrival for 28 days, which is much longer than France requires of Chinese nationals. The reports claimed that the China-made vaccines weren‚Äôt being accepted by France and the EU for political reasons, even as they had abeen approved by the World Health Organization (WHO).

When the European Union starts its ‚ÄúEU Digital COVID Certificate‚Äù program on July 1, the Chinese regime‚Äôs embassy in France says it will retaliate against the bloc‚Äôs decision to exclude Chinese-made vaccines from the system by implementing tighter regulations on French travelers seeking to enter China.

All EU member countries, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland, are included in the program, which will streamline information about the COVID-19 health status of travelers, such as test results, recovery status, or vaccination status, to help them move more efficiently around the bloc‚Äôs member countries, which have differing entry requirements.

Chinese-made vaccines aren‚Äôt included in the program, as they haven‚Äôt been approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). However, some EU member states, such as Greece, Cyprus, Hungary, and Serbia, have individually accepted Chinese vaccines. Russian-made vaccines also aren‚Äôt recognized by the program.

The creation of the digital certificates was approved by the EU Parliament on June 9. The certification includes a QR code and is issued by individual EU nations. All EU countries are required to recognize the certificates issued by other EU countries.

In line with the EU‚Äôs decision, France implemented new entry regulations for COVID-19 on June 9. People who have been vaccinated will no longer need to provide ‚Äúcompelling reasons‚Äù to enter France, nor need to be quarantined.

Around 12 to 35% of covid patients still have symptoms such as fatigue a month after infection. This condition is known as long covid. Some 4 to 7 million Americans are likely to have contracted it already.

Long covid can severely disable people to the point of being entirely housebound or bedbound. It can get worse if people try to exercise beyond their capacity.

Most long covid patients can no longer work full time or work at all. 1.7 to 4.9% of the labour force could be forced to work part time and a further 0.55% to 1.6% could be forced to stop working altogether.

This could be a negative shock to the labour market larger than the global financial crisis (GFC). The GFC caused around 3.1% of the workforce to work part time and 1.6% to leave the work force. It took a decade for the labour market to recover from the GFC.

Unlike the GFC, this will be a permanent decrease in the labour supply. This would in turn shrink the potential size of the economy and lead to inflation. The economy may never recover these gains unless an effective treatment is found for long covid.

No one has yet quantified the economic impact, which is being masked by the many other major economic events happening now. The labour market shortfalls in covid exposed industries provide some evidence that long covid is already having an impact.

Because this is an unforeseen event, it could force central banks to unexpectedly slam the brakes early, abruptly slowing the economy. This might be avoided if governments provide support to persons who are already unemployed to temporarily do the jobs of these long covid patients until they get better.

Research is needed into long covid to find a cure for these people. Policy is also needed to provide a supportive environment for them to return to work once they are healthy enough.",,,1624132024,{},h2csje1,True,t3_o3o8ds,False,True,t3_o3o8ds,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o3o8ds/could_long_covid_alone_do_as_much_economic_damage/h2csje1/,1624451306,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The newspaper also found that the number of deaths as a proportion of hospital admissions one week earlier is also remaining very low.  
The death rate had never been lower than 10% of the number of admissions one week earlier before April, but it has since remained consistently at or below this level.

&gt;Two weeks after the second dose, the differences in vaccine effectiveness by variant were more modest, with the Pfizer/BioNTech jab offering 88% protection against symptomatic disease with the Delta variant, compared with 94% protection against the Alpha variant. For the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, the figures were 67% and 74% respectively.PHE has previously noted there may be a number of reasons why the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has lower figures for either variant, including that it takes longer to reach maximum effectiveness.

Yes, AZ is slightly less effective against the delta variant but OP was talking about the Northeast which is majority Pfizer where that vaccine is only 6% less effective.

**Some vaccine experts having second thoughts about rushing to inoculate kids**

By¬†Melissa Healy | Staff Writer¬†

June 18, 2021 3 AM PT

From the earliest days of the pandemic, doctors and public health officials have seen widespread vaccination as the most effective way to stop COVID-19 in its tracks. But a growing contingent of medical experts is now questioning whether that conventional wisdom ought to apply to children.

Their doubts are not borne of conspiracy beliefs, but couched in the carefully calibrated language of risk and benefit. And they‚Äôre expected to get a public airing next week as advisors to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ponder a spate of post-vaccine heart problems in adolescents and young adults.
No one is arguing that COVID-19 immunizations for kids should stop altogether. Rather, a debate has erupted over the need to inoculate healthy children as soon as possible and according to the two-dose regimen authorized by the Food and Drug Administration.

The vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have been administered safely to millions of adults and been vetted in several thousand adolescents. But neither has been subjected to exhaustive testing in diverse pediatric populations, as is typically required for a vaccine intended for universal use in kids.

The FDA authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use in adolescents as young as 12 on May 10. In the weeks that have followed, the safety monitoring systems managed by the FDA and CDC detected dozens of cases of a possible side effect in newly vaccinated teens: an inflammation of the heart muscle known as myocarditis.

The cases typically developed in older adolescents, most of them boys, three to four days after they got a second dose. Virtually all were considered mild, presenting as chest pain and tightness that resolved after treatment with over-the-counter medications. None of the patients appear to have died or suffered serious cardiac malfunction, though it‚Äôs too early to know whether they will suffer long-term effects.

As of June 10, the government‚Äôs vaccine monitoring systems detected 226 cases of myocarditis or a related condition called pericarditis after vaccination in people younger than 30. Normally, fewer than 100 cases would be expected for this age group, said Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, deputy director of the CDC‚Äôs Immunization Safety Office.

More investigation is needed to determine whether the vaccine caused these heart problems or if the timing was merely a coincidence, he said.

Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine specialist at Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia, said the reports will give the CDC‚Äôs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices an opportunity to ‚Äúgive people a clinic on relative risk‚Äù ‚Äî as it did after the COVID-19 vaccine made by Johnson &amp; Johnson was linked to a rare blood-clotting disorder in younger women but still deemed safe for use.

Offit said he doubts the myocarditis cases will upend the long-standing certainty that kids should be vaccinated quickly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd give it to my child in a second,‚Äù he said.

Others aren‚Äôt so sure. The possibility that children getting the vaccine ‚Äî especially a second dose ‚Äî could put their hearts at risk has amplified calls for more debate before parents, schools and others embrace the conviction that all healthy children need to get vaccinated.

It‚Äôs not just the prospect of a surprise side effect that has prompted the sudden surge in vaccine caution.

As the pandemic appears to be winding down across the United States and its limited toll on children has been tallied, it‚Äôs no longer clear that immunizing children will bring the outbreak to a faster close, said Dr. Martin Makary, a public health expert at Johns Hopkins University.
Makary is urging his colleagues to ‚Äúthink twice‚Äù before recommending universal COVID-19 vaccination of healthy kids. Given the data in hand, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no compelling case for it right now,‚Äù he wrote this month in MedPage, a website widely read by physicians.

In an interview, Makary said his concerns might be allayed with a more thorough examination of the safety data.
‚ÄúBut no one is thinking like this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve converted now from being pro-vaccine to vaccine fanaticism.‚Äù

Given the general decline in new infections and hospitalizations, there‚Äôs time for a thorough FDA vetting of the vaccines for children and adolescents, Makary said. Even if it takes months, it could wind up protecting more children from harm.
The emerging debate threatens to divide a community that‚Äôs largely been united by the pandemic.

From the moment that the first COVID-19 vaccine started going into Americans‚Äô arms, one certainty has seemed almost beyond questioning: As soon as enough doses were available, the nation‚Äôs children would roll up their sleeves.

There are strong arguments for that position too.

Although it‚Äôs clear COVID-19 has largely spared children from severe illness, the CDC says 456 American kids have died of the disease, though that is considered a conservative estimate.

At least 20,000 ‚Äî and as many as 100,000 ‚Äî kids have been hospitalized with COVID-19. Indeed, the CDC reports that even as adult hospitalizations declined in March and April, the rate at which adolescents were admitted ticked upward. Nearly one-third were treated in intensive care units, undercutting the argument that severe illness rarely happens in this age group.

COVID-19‚Äôs toll on some children also lingers well beyond a bout of infection. As of mid-May, at least 4,018 in the U.S. have developed a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MISC, that frequently appears four to six weeks after a child has cleared his or her infection and typically requires hospitalization.

Myocarditis is common in these very sick children, and roughly 1% die.

If COVID-19 were a disease seen only in children, statistics such as these would galvanize medical professionals and public health officials to find a way to protect them, New York pediatrician Dr. Risa Hoshino wrote in a MedPage commentary sparked in part by Makary‚Äôs views.

By any definition, COVID-19 has been an emergency for the nation‚Äôs children and the FDA‚Äôs emergency use authorization is an ‚Äúappropriate pathway‚Äù for getting vaccines to young Americans, she added.

At Children‚Äôs Hospital Los Angeles, pediatric cardiologist Dr. Jodie Votava-Smith has seen the wreckage of COVID-19 firsthand, and she has no doubts about the value of vaccinating kids.
In the last month, she has helped treat a patient who developed myocarditis after a dose of vaccine, she said. The child‚Äôs symptoms were mild and readily treated with ibuprofen.

Votava-Smith said her assessment of vaccines‚Äô value has been more profoundly shaped by the dozens of children treated at CHLA for serious heart muscle inflammation as a result of having COVID-19. These children were severely ill and now face potentially enduring health effects. The disease was the cause of their misery, she said, not the vaccine.
The mother of two children who are 5 and 7, Votava-Smith said she ‚Äúcan‚Äôt wait‚Äù to get them vaccinated. ‚ÄúThey know they‚Äôll be getting their shot when it‚Äôs their turn,‚Äù she said.

Dr. H. Cody Meissner, a Tufts University pediatrician who advises the FDA on vaccines, said it‚Äôs a mistake to evaluate COVID-19 vaccines for children in the same way as it was cleared for emergency use in adults.

‚ÄúThe risk calculation for vaccinating an adult is pretty easy,‚Äù he said. When as many as 4,000 adults a day were dying of COVID-19, ‚Äúeven if there was a little risk of vaccine, most people would accept that.‚Äù
But for children, he said, ‚Äúthe calculus is a bit different.‚Äù Although they seem to contract the coronavirus pretty readily, they‚Äôre far less likely than adults to get sick or die. So even if instances of post-vaccination myocarditis are rare, they still change the risk-benefit analysis.

‚ÄúThe data are not sufficient to say that the benefit of these COVID-19 vaccines outweighs the risk in children and adolescents,‚Äù Meissner said. ‚ÄúWe may get there. But we‚Äôre not there now.‚Äù

Work on mRNA vaccines did begin years ago, as a way to beat other coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS. The research never needed to be **finished** because those never reached the level of pandemic that this coronavirus did. But, once COVID-19 became a thing, the mRNA research was able to be revived and utilized. 

The corners that were cut to bring this thing to market so quickly were actually fairly reasonable - they didn‚Äôt cut corners around clinical testing, but around red tape and paperwork. Plus, a lot of work was able to be done in parallel, because for a year, literally the entire world was focused on this problem.

From there it continues to travel south east into the Benelux regions encompassing port cities like Rotterdam and Antwerp, as well as larger cities like Amsterdam and Brussels. From there it roughly follows the Rhine river in Germany covering the heavily industrial regions of Germany in North-Rhineland Westphalia. This is includes industrial hubs like the Ruhrpott region, Dusseldorf and Cologne. Then it continues onto Frankfurt, then the southern German economic hubs of Stuttgart and Munich. From there it crosses the Alps through Switzerland and covers the northern regions of Italy, finally encompassing larger North Italian cities like Milan and Turin, finally ending around the port of Genova. 

Within this space you have something like roughly half of Europe's industrial output and lot of population density.

You need proof of your vaccination, go to a relevant pharmacy (in some places not all pharmacies offer the service) and they will enter your data (after you have signed a data protection thingy) and then they will print out a QR-code on paper.

That piece of paper is, in theory, already you digital certificate. If you want it more comfortable, you simply download one of the two official apps at home, and use your smartphone to scan the paper QR-code into your phone.

If you are not German, there is an outside chance that the pharmacy might feel unsure that they will get their fee from the government; so in the worst case scenario you might have to pay yourself (24 Euros max.).

Case 63357. Unvaccinated. Spread Covid to 14 close contacts - 10 unvaccinated, 1 with 1 dose, 3 with both doses. Confirmed 17 May, last close contact (to use Vietnam's terms, F1) to test positive did so on 26 May. 

Case 64132. Fully vaccinated. Spread Covid to 10 close contacts - 1 unvaccinated, 1 with 1 dose, 8 with both doses. Confirmed 10 June, last F1 tested positive on 17 June. Caveat: he is 74 - vaccine less effective? 

Case 63160. Fully vaccinated. Spread Covid to 14 close contacts - 11 unvaccinated, 3 with both doses. Caveat: he works in a prison.

Yes, it's great that the UK has invested so much in sequencing as it allows for new potential threats to be discovered sooner.

However, it doesn't take a lot of sequencing to get a rough estimate of what the dominant variants are in a country. Even sequencing just 100 samples can tell you if a certain variant is extremely dominant, barely present or somewhere in between.

The Alpha variant was first discovered in the UK and it most likely emerged there. Since Alpha is more transmissible than the variants it was competing with, eventually all countries where Alpha was introduced saw it out compete existing variants. We know that Alpha became dominant in the UK well before it became dominant elsewhere. That strongly suggests that it was present in the UK first. It was detected early, thanks to abundant sequencing, but that doesn't change the matter.

As for Delta, that one most likely originated in India and was the cause of their grueling surge. It's been dominant there for a while. It caught the UK earlier than many other countries because there is a lot of travel between the UK and India because of the shared history of these countries.
