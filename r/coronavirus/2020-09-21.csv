Sandnes' municipal chief physician Hans Petter Torvik emphasizes that there has been an increase in infection throughout the region.

He states that the infection has been linked to labor immigration and private companies.

\- So far we have had good control of the transmission routes. What is special today is that I received a phone call from Helse Førde that a woman from Sandens had been admitted to hospital, says Torvik.

&amp;#x200B;

**The infection tracking shows that a bus with pensioners has been on a trip in southern Norway and returned to Stavanger yesterday.**

**Of the 41 people on the bus, 31 have tested positive.**

&amp;#x200B;

The infected are distributed as follows:

15 in Stavanger

6 and Sola

5 in Sandnes

4 in Randaberg

1 in Hå

And some outside the region.

&amp;#x200B;

Mayor of Stavanger Kari Nessa Nordtun (Labor Party) confirms to VG that 31 people are infected, not 29 who were first reported.

\- Exactly they were quickly identified. The bus was informed that the person who was admitted tested positive, says municipal chief physician Torvik.

The bus was redirected and everyone was tested. Everyone is in quarantine.

\- We have good control of all those infected, says Torvik and states that there is no great danger of further spread of infection.

&amp;#x200B;

**Expecting more clusters**

Mayor of Stavanger Kari Nessa Nordtun (Labor Party) states that the bus trip was arranged by a company.

\- Do you know how the infection got on the bus in the first place?

\- We are in a premature phase of infection tracking to be able to say anything about it. It is also not certain we will find out, says Nessa Nordtun to VG.

All those infected are followed up by the municipal health service. The infected in Stavanger have mild symptoms, but the mayor emphasizes that it is still early in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

**Nessa Nordtun states that the municipality expects more local clusters.**

\- Ever since March, our region has been absolutely fantastic. Therefore, we have had very low infection rates compared to other large cities. But now we are being put to the test again. There is infection in our region and it can spread quickly, says mayor of Stavanger Kari Nessa Nordtun (Labor).

&amp;#x200B;

If that happens, it will affect our entire region, she warns.

\- This means that we have to press the big button. We do not want this, she says.

She states that Stavanger has had an infection cluster linked to a private event.

What degree do you have? You sound like a fucking man-child, my god. Go take a random sample and get back to me on that estimate. 

I'm really unsure what stupid thing you are trying to say in your second sentence? You do know that there have been preventative measures in places so these people have been unable to gather indoors at restaurants and bars? Their interactions are limited even though they complain about hoaxes and masks. Even though there are a lot of them they are not all friends and neighbors with each other, and their sane friends and neighbors will not want to gather unsafely with them. The people in the most delusional age range actually don't have many close friends and family. Most of their unsafe interaction comes from going to restaurants and bars.

So, they don't have as many people to hang out with in unsafe conditions, and they don't have as  many places to hang out with other unsafe strangers. Thus the spread is limited despite the amount of them that exist.

Even then it's not that limited; 200,000 people have died because of people like them. If there were only 5% of people were acting like it's all a big hoax, together with the preventative closures, then there sure as hell would be a lot fewer cases and deaths than there are. That's just basic math.

Maybe those experiences have helped me when growing up be a little more empathetic and compassionate when it comes to stuff like BLM and can avoid the misunderstanding of the ALM thing. Anyways im sorry again you've experienced what's probably one of the worst things of Canada. It's alright, but definitely not the best, we have a long ways to go too.

He noted that this virus is new and, so far, the cases of reinfected patients are minimal. “It cannot be said that everyone who has had this disease will suffer a reinfection. It all depends on the immunity they have generated due to COVID-19 ”, he explained.

He argued that in the case of the Hong Kong patient, the first to be reported as a reinfection case, it was shown that he was still asymptomatic, despite having presented a first picture of COVID-19. As for the US patient, this required respiratory support because the second infection was more complex.

In this sense, the Sisol Salud specialist considered that a second COVID-19 infection can be mild or complex; Everything will depend on the level of defense that the patient's body has produced.

Likewise, he stated that reinfection can be prevented by complying with measures such as correct hand washing, not touching the face, social distancing, the use of a mask and the use of a face shield. ",,,1600801667,{},g68quym,True,t3_ixtyaj,False,True,t3_ixtyaj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ixtyaj/chronic_disease_patients_are_prone_to_covid19/g68quym/,1600802700,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

&gt; As the coronavirus pandemic continues to haunt policymakers and the public around the world, a lot of hope is being placed in finding an effective and safe vaccine against Covid-19.

&gt; The chances of finding an effective vaccine soon are not that high, one expert told CNBC.

&gt; “I would see the vaccine as only helping (the situation),” Fisher told CNBC’s Capital Connection. “It’s not going to be the fairytale (ending) everyone wants it to be where we’ll have an 100% effective vaccine and 100% of people will take it, and they’ll all receive it over the course of a month and we can go back to our way of life.”

&gt; He argued that there was a “pretty low benchmark” when it came to the efficacy of a vaccine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for instance, said at the end of June that it expected “a Covid-19 vaccine would prevent disease or decrease its severity in at least 50% of people who are vaccinated.”

&gt; “This means that for half the people that get the vaccine it wouldn’t work,” Fisher said. “Most people aren’t expecting this to be 100% effective. So I think you need to have the non-pharmacological interventions, such as the mask wearing and the limiting of gatherings and things like that for a long time to come.”

&gt;1. “The spikes in the positive COVID tests are coming out of our 2 major universities in the county that recently started upbringing approximately 60,000 new students into the area. Both universities already have very strict mask mandates. The response should be concentrated on the problem area, not the entire population of the county as is being suggested. 

I agree with this. San Diego is in a similar boat, where the main contributor to our spike is cases reported out of SDSU from out of area students bringing it in from other counties/states. I think it is time to stop punishing those that are following the mandates and guidelines with lockdowns, and time to start fining the violators. No arrests necessary, just fines.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;2. “I find it interesting that the nation is demanding police reform, yet every time there is any crisis the response is, pass a law and let the police worry about it. Then, the only resource provided to the police is arrest or citation. I believe we can do better than that. 

This is a common straw man of the ""Defund the Police"" movement. I don't speak for everybody, because I don't at all doubt that there are fringe elements that really do feel that the entire law enforcement establishment should be completely dismantled, but my understanding has been that the majority of supporters simply feel that the police are the wrong tool for a lot of the jobs we assign to them, and that the funding that we assign to them to do those jobs they are ill-trained to perform should be redirected to new or existing groups that are better equipped. He has basically laid out the main argument of ""Defund the Police"" as his suggestion for what we should do, which is create new crisis response teams with some of the out-sized budget allocated to police as a catch all so that we have more options than just arrest and citation. We can do better, and defunding the police is how.

The federal government has given Utah hundreds of millions of dollars to address this issue, Utah County received over 100 million of that, and still, the best we can do with the resources and options that money could provide is dump the problem on the police by criminalizing it. 

This is a massive misstatement. Yes, millions were allocated, and I don't know where it all went. That's very likely valid as a criticism. However, regardless of how much money was or was not spent, if the experts decide that one of the best tools, from both a cost and effectiveness standpoint is to issue a mandate, it is law enforcement's job to enforce that mandate. Even if the department's funds were cut to follow a ""Defund the Police"" course of action, this would still fall firmly under their purview, considering that many violators of these mandates are demonstrably violent.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;4. “The issue for me is not the mask, it is the approach. When we first entered into this pandemic a health order was issued that restricted gatherings larger than 10 people. We had citizens calling the police on fellow citizens for holding family gatherings in public places as well as private property. We had incidents of public disorder between citizens due to the order. A mask mandate will generate the same responses. 

I'm not sure what his point here is. That this will create work? Of course it will. So does creating a vaccine, but you don't see researchers throwing up their hands and saying that they shouldn't have to do it. Any course of action the government takes to contain the virus will require work. If it doesn't create work, than the government is doing nothing and the virus is not being contained. Should we stop bothering the police when people are breaking the law because they would have to actually do their jobs?

I can perhaps sympathize with his department in one thing, which is that some of that funding that the state and county received should probably be allocated to enforcement if that is the course the state/county decides to take. If their work increases due to a requirement to enforce pandemic related measures, then their payroll goes up, and that should be accommodated. Maybe. I don't know what emergency funding they may have access to - it's possible that such funds already exist outside of the funds received specifically for COVID. For example, if there is a major disaster and they are required to provide additional manpower for an extended period to serve and protect, one assumes that funds exist to cover that. COVID is no different.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; “The real mandate should be to our elected officials to address the specific problem in the specific areas that are affected **with a community-based approach that promotes buy-in and acceptance from the community**,” Sheriff Smith added.

State officials mandated in-person opened schools regardless of local outbreaks - few covid measures taken. This lead to texas teachers association (public unions are outlawed) to sue the state for not fulfilling any standards set for teacher and student protection.

 We've consistently gotten worse at testing. California reported 150,000 tests yesterday, Texas reported 29,000, down from 65,000 at our peak. 

County officials across the state deny the virus is even a problem, insisting on high school and college football. Our universities had thousands of infected students by only 3 weeks into August.

Let's talk about how the Pfizer Phase 1 trial was successful, was not sped up, was not influenced by politicians, and was well-tolerated across all participants.

Let's talk about how, in that study, the vaccine produced 1.6 to 3.8 times the number of antibodies (measured by GMTs) as were produced in people who were actually infected -- and yes, this doesn't mean it works, we'll get to that.

Let's talk about how the vaccine induced CD4+ and (more importantly) CD8+ T-cell responses against the spike protein that surrounds SARS-CoV-2, and how CD8+ T-cells are thought to be important to immunity -- and yes, this doesn't mean it works, we'll get to that.

Let's talk about how the rhesus challenge study prevented lung infections at a rate of 100% despite being dosed directly with a high viral load, and how it also cleared the nose at 100% after three days -- and yes, this doesn't mean it works, we'll get to that.

So after we talk about all these positive data points, let's talk about what's happening now and why we don't need to wait ""years"" for results on a vaccine trial:

- We're already intimately familiar with coronaviruses and have already done a lot of the legwork during previous outbreaks while funding was available
- This time, funding is much more readily available both up-front and ongoing, removing the financial roadblocks that stopped previous work
- There is an active worldwide spread that is much more rapid than anything we've seen in the last 100 years, providing cases to study faster than ever

There has rarely been a point that we had to perform an entire Phase 3 trial to completion to determine efficacy -- we make these trials so big so that we can have enough people get infected to compare the inoculated group to the control group, and the faster that happens, the faster we can prove how efficacious the vaccine is within a confidence interval that gets stronger as the numbers grow.

So, yes, we can have the 150-175 infections we need to get a good read on efficacy late next month, and then we can continue studying for the entire 26 month duration of the Phase 3 trial for extremely rare potential side effects and -- more importantly -- duration of immunity while we roll out this vaccine to slow the spread of a disease that is killing a thousand people a day.

But by all means, tell me more about how the following sources are false flags and the scientists are anti-science.

What is a “pretty clear pattern”? The fact that we have a small increase in confirmed cases in week 38. It’s worrying for sure, but definitely not a “clear pattern”. That’s something completely different. Like the pattern seen in France or Spain.

You can’t go numb to it all because that is what the Trump admin wants. They want to reopen without a plan (I am for reopening if done with a plan and safely and certain federal mandates in place). They want us to normalize mass deaths and carry on as if it’s ok, when it isn’t. 

First world nations around the world have crushed the virus...Germany, South Korea, New Zealand, etc just to name a few. Their lives are mostly back to normal with proper regulations put in place.

Democrats failed to bring some key economic demands in the first CARES Act. Namely, both parties should have allocated to pay furloughed employees paychecks like they did in Europe. They took McConnell at his word that there would be a second. But of course, McConnell's word is somewhere between Dark Matter and his non existent chin. 


The only good thing they brought to the CARES act that has carried popular support is the $600 plus up. That is where all their leverage is. If they fail to get that, they really have nothing to brag to working class Americans about. 


The Democrats are more than willing to exchange the $600 plus up for immunity. They are experiencing pressure to compromise too. They've already came down from $3 trillion. 

I think immunity will come in 2021. Our Economy is a dumpster fire. Both parties are operating as if a shut down will never reoccur. So, if the businesses are to exist, they must be exempted from being sued into Oblivion when the inevitable happens.

Are you saying that the reason 80-90% of the native americans died from disease imported by europeans was because they were weaker than you?

Funnily enough, history proves me right. Bones in the ground shows clearly how the elderly or weakened individuals die first, while those who tend them survives. Then the next layer of dead are the people who act as doctors/caretakers in the culture, and finally everybody else *until there are so few left that social distance is enforced by nature*. 

It is amazing how many times people can be told that you are being lied to because of a cloudy fear of mass panic without people starting to think for themselves. 

Gaining immunity to a new disease naturally, takes up to 300-400 years. In case you haven't noticed, that means generational inheritance of immunity reactions have to survive through natural selection before the desired results become possible.

With many cases going undiagnosed early on, and 7 million confirmed US cases, that puts US cases of Coronavirus, at a minimum, at ~75 million. In other words we have had nearly 20% of the entire country get coronavirus. Epidemiologists estimated we need 60% - 70% infection rate for it to mostly stop spreading on its own as most people will have already been infected. At that point infections will be linear instead of exponential.

So if it's true, it means coronavirus is nearly over and a vaccine is unnecessary. At the rate of current active known infections and assessed infections, we will hit ~40% in mere months at which point the number of new cases will plummet to low levels even if we chose to reopen everything. We will then hit 60% to 70% around October next year. Total deaths will be at 600k or less. Excess deaths will be around 800k.

It'll be tragic, but at this point in the run of the virus going 100% after a vaccine would become pointless.

I don't believe we've had 75m cases. I believe it's far, far lower than that. I'd put estimates at closer to 10m personally, but I admit I could be way off base in the 10m estimate.

There was a meta analysis of  51 different studies ""on the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.""(Tom Jefferson, Ruth Foxlee, Chris Del Mar, Liz Dooley, Eliana Ferroni, Bill Hewak, Adi Prabhala, Sree Nair, and Alex Rivetti, “Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses: systematic review”, BMJ. 2008 Jan 12; 336(7635): 77–80.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2190272/) It showed:

Masks were more effective than washing your hands 10x/day (68% vs 55%) at stopping viral transmission
Global and highly resource intensive measures such as screening at entry ports and social distancing lacked proper evaluation. The handful of studies (mostly done during the SARS epidemic) did not allow us to reach any firm conclusions

Min W. Fong, Huizhi Gao, Jessica Y. Wong, Jingyi Xiao, Eunice Y.C. Shiu, Sukhyun Ryu, and Benjamin J. Cowling, “Nonpharmaceutical Measures for Pandemic Influenza in Nonhealthcare Settings—Social Distancing Measures”, CDC Emerging Infectious Diseases Volume 26, Number 5—May 2020. https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0995_article

Conducted a review of 11 simulation studies and 4 observational studies on 6 measures.  Authors unable to find any clinical studies:  “We were unable to identify randomized controlled trials for the listed social distancing measures”
Overall, our systematic reviews suggested that social distancing measures could be effective interventions to reduce transmission and mitigate the impact of an influenza pandemic. However, the evidence base for these measures was derived largely from observational studies and simulation studies; thus, the overall quality of evidence is relatively low.

This study looked at 65 studies on workplace closures and reduction of the spread of influenza. (Ahmed, F., Zviedrite, N. &amp; Uzicanin, A. Effectiveness of workplace social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission: a systematic review. BMC Public Health 18, 518 (2018). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-018-5446-1.) It found:

[],,Rheticule,,,[],,,,text,t2_1563yo,False,False,[],"Ok, so you're talking about a theoretical vaccine with 0 impact on transmissibility but a large impact on severity. 

In some ways that actually might be worse from a reduction of intervention perspective, because in that circumstance, while the vaccine is being rolled out (keep in mind rolling out a vaccine is going to take a long time to get to everyone in the population) it's not actually that protective of the population (though obviously you'd treat at risk first). 

Sterilizing vaccines would provide a force multiplier effect to any restrictions we have. After 25% of the population is vaccinated, it removes a large enough segment of the population (especially if we target front line people, people that interact with others the most, etc) as a viral vector that restrictions can be lifted pretty quickly (though not fully). So basically, as more and more people get vaccinated, restrictions are lifted one at a time while keeping R below 1 (as above).

For a vaccine that is protective by not sterilizing, you can't actually remove ANY restrictions until you feel like you can remove them all. And when is that? If 50% of your population is vaccinated, that means the other 50% are just as susceptible to the virus as they always have been, and if you remove all restrictions the virus turns back into a runaway freight train, and you've sacrificed a significant number of their lives. So what is the right number? When do you say ""I'm cool with sacrificing a % of the unvaccinated's lives so those with the vaccine can return to normal""?

Basically, protective vaccines only benefit the receiver of the vaccine (fuck you I got mine!) where sterilizing protect everyone in your society.",,,1600806225,{},g6903d8,False,t3_ixozvf,False,True,t1_g68xih6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ixozvf/coronavirus_vaccine_wont_bring_about_fairytale/g6903d8/,1600807976,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I mean, I'm sorry if you don't like hearing this, but participating in a debate (or just figuring out which ideas are merit-able and which aren't) requires some awareness about and education regarding what is expected between the debating parties and how to find source material.

If that offends you, while it may SOUND harsh, your offense is irrelevant.  I'm sorry to inform you of this, but we're just discussing facts and a long-established process.  I'm not making up rules as I go.  Therefore you have nothing to be offended by.  I learned this by getting a combined InfoScience/ComputerScience bachelor's degree, the former being research-oriented.

There's a lot of 100-level college research classes (or comparable information for non-scholarly experts) available on YouTube, or information available at your local library, if knowing how to find sources for claims and being able to judge the validity of a source is important to you.

Lmao. Mask wearing will never be “cool,” and regardless - it’s not a valid reason to wear a mask. Again, only morons would take this action based on a football coach. 😂 

Canada having zero deaths for one day doesn’t really prove much of anything... could simply be an outlier, among other potential issues with how “cases” and such are reported/affirmed.

So, to be clear, because tiny island New Zealand (outlier) and Taiwan (another tiny territory which China claims) are doing better... you chose to extrapolate that to “every country but USA is mostly back to normal?”  🤣 Idk where you live, but many places in America are looking just as normal. Some never even changed.

&gt; The only way to not be aware that the US is doing horribly is to be paying zero attention to the news 

Or I can see the data that shows there are dozens of countries that are in a similar situation or are worse off than America?

&gt; or to be silo-ing yourself and only paying attention to a partisan or agenda driven news source.

[],,albertonovillo,,,[],,,,text,t2_4yikr1xa,False,False,[],"When a country gives information about deaths or infections, most of the times they do not give data of the very same day. I suppose worldometers give the information of the covid infections known of the very same day and not of the last days.

Therefore, you can see 4000 new cases (or something like that) but 10000 covid cases more than yesterday (a backlog of other days)

The thing is most of the countries do not give this information but they only say the number they got that day.

Worldometers now gives much more information about Spain and they briefly explain:

&gt; **10,799 new cases** and **241 new deaths** in [**Spain**](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/spain/) of which 3125 cases already validated by the Ministry of Health. Data are provisional and subject to change. From Sept. 16 onward (with the exception of Saturday, Sept. 19 and Sunday, Sept. 20), figures for daily new cases only include cases already validated by the Ministry of Health in the daily PDF report. Since the validation process takes time to complete, additional cases are expected to be added retroactively once the weekly historical dataset revision is released by the Ministry of Health on Friday, Sept. 25. Data up to Sept. 15 reflects the latest release of the official ""Historical Series of Cases by Autonomous Community"" dataset released by the Ministry of Health. 

Also, Spain is not a federation but works like one and every 'Comunidad Autonoma' does his own report, and has his own rythm so you can see that in todays numbers there is no new case of Comunidad Valenciana, other days it happens with other Comunidades. This is also why some days there is an increase of infections or deaths like last week in which Pais Vasco had added something like 200 deaths in only a couple of days.

1.  Humans being social was no less true in the 60s, but cities like St. Louis and Detroit still collapsed and have barely begun to recover.

2. Even leaving aside the complete collapse of the city, that doesn't mean that the City of Chicago as an institution couldn't go bankrupt/insolvent.  Absent some massive outside bailout, it's hard to see how that doesn't happen at this point.  Again, that doesn't mean the city will go full Detroit, but it could result in cuts in city services that simply make the city a worse place to live for a while.
3. Parts of Chicago are doing just fine now.  Other parts most certainly are not.  There are neighborhoods of the city where the population is 25% of what it was in 1960.

Apprenticeships also count as education so some people leave to do that, army jobs also count as a reason not to go to college. I think full time employment may also be one but I'm not really sure.

I dropped out of my a levels twice. The first time I wasn't challenged because I was just renrolling straight away in the new academic year with September 19 first years. I dropped out again in October 2019 by just not showing up to college without making anything official (I was 17 and working a 7.5 hour a week cleaning job) and was never challenged on it save for a few emails from teachers asking where I was. This was at the largest and one of the most well funded colleges in my county, it was more like a small university. 

I know plenty of people that stopped going at 16/17 and were never questioned so it seems that while you can't officially leave education until you're 18, you definitely can.

If you're planning on going to university then 16-18 a levels and Btecs are critical.

The lockdown initially was to stop/slow the crazy spread and get it into a state that contact tracing would help (though the USA skipped that part).

Subtract 0.5 for a mask mandate"" etc. The only problem was, we had no idea what those numbers were, so it was more like ""subtract x"" and ""Subtract y"". 

The other fun caveat here is that the R value will be degrading as you go in general without any intervention as it burns through the populace (it's not that it is 6 until it reaches 70% then suddenly 0, it will slowly degrade as the more susceptible people are burned through). 

Now with a vaccine, you will be subtracting from the R value the more of your population is vaccinated, so as that happens, you will be opening stuff up to keep the rate of infection as close to 1 as possible (to give your economy the best chance of survival).

https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2020/04/13/understanding-covid-19-with-genetic-sequencing/

&gt;Labs at the Yale Center for Genome Analysis are working to study two key areas of COVID-19 genomic research. &gt;One hurdle is to sequence the genome of the virus itself, SARS-CoV-2, in order to track the mutations in the virus. The other key focus is to explore the genes of infected patients. This analysis can be used to understand why some people get more severe symptoms than others, as well as, help with the development of new treatments in the future. 

&gt;“By studying coronavirus, we can identify the unique genetic code,” said Shrikant Mane, director of the YCGA and the Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory. “The genetic code actually can say who is becoming ill, for example, and what type of illness they are having or what types of symptoms they are having, and whether all those symptoms are caused by the COVID-19 virus, and how the human immune system is responding.”

&gt;Mane’s group does work that includes the sequencing of the virus’ genome itself. They have recently started receiving samples from hospital patients in order to access the virus’ DNA. According to Mane, the sequencing itself is fairly straightforward, and they have not faced too many technical challenges on that front.

&gt;his sequencing work will be a part of a study that Mane’s lab is conducting, which is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. He says they hope to collect about 1,000 patient samples and sequence the SARS-CoV-2 genome from them.

There hasn’t really been a clear plan for the vaccine roll-out and the subsequent reduction of restrictions communicated to the public. So when I read experts saying that a vaccine *won’t* necessarily lead to such reductions, I get somewhat worried that there will be some tunnel vision down the road.

They know that the average person is not aware of the two current strains of Covid, so they use the word to make people think that “immunity” is completely impossible (as opposed to conditionally impossible, much like the flu), and get lots of clicks and ad revenue by doing so.

Am I lonely?  Sure.  I'm trapped in my home by myself.  But I'm also free of depression for the first time in 20 years, and it's purely because I have the time to work out whenever I want to now.

My lack of knowledge concerning vaccines might be somewhat apparent here, but I was mostly trying to oppose the narrative that a widely distributed protective vaccine did *not* warrant a full release of all restrictions. 

There was an article in r/Covid19 (yesterday?) where the authors stated (I’m paraphrasing):

&gt;Even though a vaccine is fully distributed, it might not drop infection rates down to where we want them, since the vaccine might ultimately, for some, only protect them from severe disease and not stop them from shedding the virus. Therefore, a vaccine is not guaranteed to put an end to restrictions. 

Stopping Covid19 has no intristic value to it, stopping death and disability has. If we can dampen the pandemic, or the effects of an infection, to even ”bad flu season” levels, then I don’t see how there’s an argument for further restrictions. 

I realise that this specific article doesn’t concern this specific argument, so I might be somewhat off topic here.

The reason they will help the healthcare workers and not you is because they are disposable.  To get the maximum effect, you are supposed to dispose of them after one use.  There are enough masks in the world for healthcare workers to do that, but not for everyone else.  Therefore, if you are reduced to using your single N95 mask for months at a time, then yes - there is a concern that it will just be a vector for cross contamination.  
  
That was the initial thinking, at least - and I'd argue that it was at least plausibly valid early on.

The most important thing to understand is that this is actually to be expected. There is a long lag — as long as six weeks, experts told me — between when a person gets infected and when their death would be reported in the official tally.

“Why aren’t today’s deaths trending in the same way today’s cases are trending? That’s completely not the way to think about it,” Eleanor Murray, an epidemiologist at Boston University, told me. “Today’s cases represent infections that probably happened a week or two ago. Today’s deaths represent cases that were diagnosed possibly up to a month ago, so infections that were up to six weeks ago or more.”

“Some people do get infected and die quickly, but the majority of people who die, it takes a while,” Murray continued. “It’s not a matter of a one-week lag between cases and deaths. We expect something more on the order of a four-, five-, six-week lag.”

&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt; No alternative diagnosis can fully explain the illness. 
&gt;
&gt;So, by December 31st, there were 27 cases of unknown pneumonia, in a city of 12 million, where no one died yet... In winter..... I doubt any doctor would've given second thought on it and just said.. you got pneumonia, and prescribed the necessary medicine.. I doubt they would've gone through the effort to really test for a new virus.

None of the criteria the WHO lists is a test. The whole point of the alert system is when patients have acute respiratory distress syndrome and no explainable illness, an alert should be raised. Saying ""infectious pneumonia"" instead of viral ARDS is literally giving a different name to the same thing, considering they were already giving patients antibiotics and none had improved. Those cases met the WHO criteria exactly and when 30 health care workers developed lung infections by Jan 10th, there was no excuse for not sending an alert and confirming H2H.

&gt;&gt; Why did China wait until the 12th to send the genome sequence to the WHO? 
&gt;
&gt;I did mention above that I read an article that talked about the one week delay. And it sounded more like someone in a higher position wanted to get the credit for ""finding"" the genome, so they ordered the lower lab to hold off for ""confirmation""

Wuhan Institute of Virology had already sequenced the virus' genome by January 2nd, Shanghai confirmed it by January 5th. The highest lab was WIV, which was also ordered to bite their tongues. Good thing they did, because the lower lab was shut down after publishing the genome sequence. 


&gt;It was reported that one of the criteria for promotion in the CPC is to have more evidence of your worth. In the scientific departments, that includes published papers in reputable journals. 

This was not publication in a journal, it was uploading the genome sequence to an online database and telling citizens to wash your hands, wear a mask, etc. Read the article you cited from scmp again. 


&gt;And regarding the lab closing down, as you mentioned earlier, only level 4 lab can handle the new infectious virus. This lab was level 3. There was the directive for all labs not qualified to handle the virus to either destroy it or transport it to another lab. In the SCMP article I posted, this lab did get permission to study it, by the end of January.


Look at the timeline again. I'll even save you some trouble:

&gt;On 1 January 2020, a genetic sequencing company was notified by the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee that further sequencing of novel coronavirus samples were no longer allowed, existing samples must be destroyed and all data must be kept secret.[[306]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_January_2020#cite_note-caixintrace-306)

Now from the citation:

&gt;According to a source from a gene sequencing company, on January 1, 2020, he received a call from an official from the Hubei Provincial Health Commission, informing him that if samples of new coronary pneumonia cases in Wuhan are sent for inspection, they cannot be tested again; samples of existing cases It must be destroyed, sample information cannot be disclosed, relevant papers and related data cannot be released to the outside world, ""If you detect it in the future, you must report it to us.""

Further guidance was issued on January 3rd for all labs not qualified to transfer their samples to designated labs.

But the lab in Shanghai reported their research after January 3rd and before January 12th (their closure). **If they were closed for disobeying the directive, then why were they not closed when they reported the results of their research (January 5th) but instead were shut down 12 hours after publishing their results online (January 11th&amp;12th)?**


&gt;On January 2, the hospital told its staff not to take pictures and leave evidence of discussing this disease. So, basically, they heard that Dr. Li got called in for questioning after he posted about the virus, so they told their doctors to not post about the virus.

Do you not see the problem with that?

&gt;Also, there is a definition for limited h2h transmission and sustained h2h transmission. A lot of the press releases I read translated specifically says no evidence for sustained. I don't think families count as sustained transmission.

Sustained H2H transmission is community transmission. Evidence of sustained transmission from the Seafood market area was there, it was just silenced at numerous levels (Hospital supervisory board, Wuhan police force, Hubei Provincial Health Commission). 


By December 30th it was clear this is a sars-like coronavirus, by January 5th it was undeniable, by January 7th the CCP admitted that fact publicly, yet they still only acknowledged the possibility of H2H transmission cannot be overlooked.

That's not what I said, you may need to reread the comment.

What you're doing is trying to paint anyone who thinks the US did a bad job responding to the virus (which is indisputable) as a liberal (and the implications the reader draws from that) and it's pretty transparent.

You don't have to be liberal to look objectively at the data and see that the US has done an absolutely abysmal job protecting its population regardless of how you adjust for population or other factors.

I don't derive any joy from that fact. It reflects on community that I'm a part of. Not trying to accept it, reflect on it, and learn from it does our society and my community no good.

It’s also an easy out for politicians, they don’t have to enforce any substantive restrictions but can point to their mask policy and enforcement as evidence they are taking this seriously. 

May I remind you I’m merely stating the opposition and don’t personally care much about masks, it only bothers me when people think the science around their effectiveness is as as clear as something like climate change. So many have falsely convinced that masks are this ultimate protective shield. I personally don’t think theyre use is warranted outdoors and not in a crowd, as transmission is very rare in these circumstances. If you defend wearing them in these circumstances than you should also defend the idea of people wearing masks during flu season once the pandemic is over.

Why do you think they haven’t recommended masks in the Netherlands and many other countries? Are their experts just wrong unlike your chosen experts? 

The top health experts in the Netherlands and other countries don’t think the masks usage by the general public is beneficial. They probably are moderately effective in optimal conditions and with the right materials, but even that has yet to be completely proven.

these articles are meant to manage expectations but completely ignore the psychology of frustration and relative deprivation... most of them simply regurgitate the same information about the challenges of vaccine roll-out, effectiveness not being a 100% guarantee, etc. but simply find a new scary headline to repackage it in so they can get more clicks. 

for the time being, we live in a system where the media has a profit incentive and that incentive leads them to publish more doom-and-gloom reporting, interspersed with kernels of more hopeful stuff. this type of intermittent reinforcement is a very powerful tool that, for example, keeps gamblers constantly coming back to casinos, and it keeps Americans constantly refreshing and scrolling for more news. i'm succumbing it to myself. 

the fact is, we simply don't know how much of a challenge these roll-out obstacles will pose or what the gaps in a vaccine's effectiveness are, because we're not at that stage yet. moderna and pfizer are not currently producing at full capacity. vaccines that need to be kept cold need to be stored at the temperature of dry ice, something that is done on a daily basis across the country to transport food and medical supplies. 

we also don't know how the virus will behave in the winter- whether apocalyptic spikes are truly coming. cold weather will likely reduce large gatherings and superspreader events- instead, people will see their families in smaller gatherings that spread the virus on a smaller scale. estimating seasonal transmissibility factors based on winter in the Southern Hemisphere is also difficult, as those countries experience a milder winter that would lead to fewer behavioral changes (and also probably a milder increase in infectiousness... who knows). 

cases are up 11% in the last week in the US. tests reported are up over 25% and the positivity rate has dropped by around 0.5%. in all likelihood, the true number of infections is actually dropping slightly right now, despite what the media reporting will tell you. 

and if the vaccine doesn't work, or COVID continues to circulate at high levels for a long time... we'll adapt to that too, and find better, safer ways to return to schools, workplaces, and fun social events. the lockdowns and persistent restrictions are in place now because our entire world is a built environment for non-COVID times and we are unprepared to send people back to their lives in this environment. if it becomes clear that we're in this for a longer haul, changes will be made to these environments to make things more manageable. these changes might also be better in terms of environmental impact than simply returning back to normal.

things are unbelievably scary right now and probably will be for the foreseeable future given the radical actions needed to combat climate change. but you will not be locked down forever and you will not be unable to see your friends without a mask forever. people will be trying to connect with each other literally until the last dying days of human civilization and we'll get to do that again soon. 

keep supporting your neighbors and working together for change, and try to stop reading all the fucking news. better days are ahead and we got this.

However i have been pulling my data from [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as they have the data clearly and easily displayed for all countries as well as links to the sources where they are pulling their data. which tends to be the country or provincial data now if you trust that or not is up to you but those are the official numbers being published. 

First we can look at the US active cases.
 
* Date      Active cases  % change From previous day 
* 14 Sept   2,531,535
* 15 Sept   2,526,528    99.802%
* 16 Sept   2,514,706    99.532%
* 17 Sept   2,524,297   100.381%
* 18 Sept   2,537,886   100.538%
* 19 Sept   2,547,634   100.384%
* 20 Sept   2,554,237   100.259%
* 21 Sept   2,542,189    99.528%   7 day average =  100.061

So the US active covid cases are growing at an average of 0.061% every day. This growth rate changes daily but it has been trending downward. 

Now lets look at Canadas numbers over the same period. 

* Date    Active cases   % change from previous day. 
* Sept 14   7607    
* Sept 15   7775     102.208%
* Sept 16   8105     104.244%
* Sept 17   8558     105.589%
* Sept 18   8983     104.966%
* Sept 19   9376     104.375%
* Sept 20   9741     103.893%
* Sept 21   10653   109.363% 7 day average = 104.953%

Canadas active cases are growing by 4.953% daily and that number is trending up. We haven't seen an average growth rate this high since April 11. If we continue on the trend we are heading down things do not look good for us canadians. 

The current US active case numbers are still far worse than Canadas currently. However looking at where we are headed it wont remain that way for long.

Now, Covid is moving to the Midwest and the Great Plains.

Up until now, government demand has limited the collapse of the economy. 


Government demand induced at the very top to the very top. Skipping over me and You. 


Government demand is needed to keep the Economy from collapsing. However, if it was distributed to the consumer, your wife, the consumer would be better equipped to simulate the economy prior to it collapsing. 

The fact we don't have have successfully executed capital injections has everything to do with the fact they never intended for consumer capital injections. In theory, they don't believe in the government to industry ones either but here we are. But the FED looked at the 2008 crisis, and decided it needed to invent a new avenue to pursue it's mandate on the economy. And they have taken action for better or for worse. 


Now, for worse, the actual Government we elect must take the needed action of injecting consumers. Otherwise small business collapses. And any idea of an efficient Economy driven by consumer demand collapses with it. 

The more there are only a few large companies propped up by government loans and the more they are looking to the government as the dominant demand, the more we resemble the 1970s planned economy.",,,1600802403,{},g68sc32,False,t3_ixm3sh,False,True,t1_g68p6eh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ixm3sh/vast_majority_of_americans_want_more_economic_aid/g68sc32/,1600803552,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,
