Who  would have thought that Australians are now struggling to ""pass freely""  back into their own country? Re-entering and living in your nation is a  basic aspect of citizenship. A right of return is recognised in  international law, enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights. 

But  the problem for stranded Australians is that you can't argue a UN  treaty in an Australian court. Citizenship rights - and many other  freedoms - aren't guaranteed under their law. Australia lacks a human  rights charter or explicit protections in its constitution. 

So  in an emergency situation, the government can make something a criminal  offence overnight. At the height of the pandemic last year, the  government beefed up its Biosecurity Act to give the health minister  near unconditional powers bypassing parliament. 

That's  why citizens now trying to flee a danger zone can face jail for trying  to come home. A legal challenge to this two-week ban will take time and  be costly - public outrage and pressure may be the only effective  remedy.""

Great. Have you shared this enlightened view with any frontline healthcare workers? Any virologists or epidemiologists? Any of the families of the 3 million dead thus far? Or any of the high-risk people you're potentially exposing because you think wearing a mask or getting a couple of shots is an overreaction?

Really. You couldn't possibly have ignored the pandemic this past year unless you were dead, since it affected every aspect of society whether you personally thought it was overblown or not. But how much time do you spend each day thinking about polio, tetanus, mumps, smallpox, and all the other illnesses we've suppressed with vaccines?

*To discover exactly how to attack SARS-CoV-2 safely and efficiently, our vaccine candidate Biovacc-19 was designed by first carefully analysing the biochemistry of the Spike. We ascertained that it is highly unusual in several respects, unlike any other CoV in its clade. The SARS-CoV-2 general mode of action is as a co-receptor dependent phagocyte. But data shows that simultaneously it is capable of binding to ACE2 receptors in its receptor binding domain. In short, SARS-CoV-2 is possessed of dual action capability.* In this paper we argue that the likelihood of this being the result of natural processes is very small. *The spike has six inserts which are unique fingerprints with five salient features* indicative of purposive manipulation. *We then add to the bio-chemistry a diachronic dimension by analysing a sequence of four linked published research projects which, we suggest, show by deduction how, where, when and by whom the SARS-CoV-2 Spike acquired its special characteristics. This reconstructed historical aetiology meets the criteria of means, timing, agent and place to produce sufficient confidence to reverse the burden of proof. Henceforth, those who would maintain that the Covid-19 pandemic arose from zoonotic transfer need to explain precisely why this more parsimonious account is wrong before asserting that their evidence is persuasive, most especially when, as we also show, there are puzzling errors in their use of evidence.*",,,1619956875,{},gwnh84m,False,t3_n344bm,False,True,t3_n344bm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n344bm/a_timeline_to_a_pandemic_virus/gwnh84m/,1619979875,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I really liked the appointments system too. It's good not to elbow people to get to stuff, or wait in a queue to try things. I read Bijenkorf is actually keeping it because it was such a positive experience for their clients. Some furniture shops said they'd keep it too because they can give their customers more attention.

I wouldn't count on the numbers in India by the way. I talk to people from multiple European countries with good health systems and many do not test when they get symptoms unless they have serious symptoms that are pretty clearly covid-like. My mom was shocked I test when I get sore throat or running nose. Netherlands and a few other countries have high enough testing rates that I'd consider them pretty reliable.

The hysteria on social media has to do with specific passages in the Pfizer protocol. Specifically, wording on Page 67 and Page 68.

I get Page 67 wording. Or at least I think I do. But I could use some help interpreting the wording on Page 68.

Bottom of Page 67:  
“A female is found to be pregnant while being exposed or having been exposed to study intervention due to environmental exposure. Below are examples of environmental exposure during pregnancy: • A female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact.”

So that last sentence says an environmental exposure occurs if the woman is exposed to the vaccine through inhalation or skin contact — like if an open vial of vaccine was accidentally spilled.

So Page 67 is pretty straightforward.

But then the top of Page 68 says this:  
“A male family member or healthcare provider who has been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact then exposes his female partner prior to or around the time of conception.”

How is this to be interpreted? If a man is exposed to the vaccine accidentally through inhalation or skin contact, does it somehow get into his sperm? Why would a female partner have to report an EDP (Exposure During Pregnancy) because her mate got exposed?

Some anti-vaxxers on Twitter are getting hysterical over this. Page 67 seems easy enough to explain, but what about Page 68? What am I not considering here? Can the vaccine work it’s way into the man’s semen?",,,1619955374,{},gwnemql,False,t3_n2ihqg,False,True,t3_n2ihqg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n2ihqg/covid19_vaccine_does_not_make_people_dangerous_to/gwnemql/,1619978369,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

If I were to guess, it was a mix of institutionalized racism (those dirty chinese), western exceptionalism (won't happen here) and political delusion.

I remember very well how respected news outlets were almost cheering at the prospect of millions of chinese deaths and the inevitable fall of the chinese government. At the same time reassuring us that won't happen here because we are democratic and have the best health care. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As much as one might want to talk about the Chinese suppressing early info about the virus, when they put an entire province of 60 million people into hard lockdown on Jan 23, and varying degrees of softer lockdowns in the entire rest of the country, essentially self-destructing their own economy for the first quarter of 2020, and the response from the rest of the world is a shrug and carry on as before?

I hope there will be hard questions one day, but I won't hold by breath. Most likely they will blame China or Trump, when most western leaders were barely better. 

Sure, the Chinese weren't completely transparent but they provided key information that should have raised the alarms. The nCoV was related to SARS. If that was not enough they closed down Wuhan. If our leader weren't able to read that, they are imbeciles, evil or both.

Would it be okay if I cancelled my 2nd Covid dose at one place and got it at another?

Currently supposed to get my 2nd Moderna dose tomorrow at Walgreens, the only issue though is that the Walgreens is 6 miles away from my place and it's going to storm all tomorrow so I can't get there easily (would have to bus for over an hour).

I can schedule my 2nd dose at a much closer location tomorrow through my University. But I'm not sure if cancelling one at Walgreens could hurt their stock of doses or something, I know they have to freeze the vaccines.

The fact that more young people are in the hospital than old people is obviously due to the vaccine and it doesn't really say anything. I still think there is some value to pointing out that more young people are getting hospitalized and dying, but they should really contextualize it better.

Like, hey, comparing last Dec to this Apr in Michigan, young people have +60% more cases and +175% more deaths (so the cases are getting more lethal) which sounds scary, but their cases weren't very lethal to begin with. That's like, 70 deaths instead of 25 deaths. Out of tens of thousands of cases.

Meanwhile, old people deaths have dropped -75% so instead of thousands of them dying, a few hundred of them are dying (they still die way more than young people). ~1800 old people saved by the vax, 50 extra young people lost. That's pretty decent overall.

But still, worth pointing out that to people in their 20s or 30s, their odds of dying if they catch covid seem to have jumped from 1 in 2,000 to something like 1 in 900. Still sounds pretty low, but that's ignoring the odds of unknown lasting effects, or a trip to the hospital, those are odds of *dying*. The odds are getting worse. And the virus is more prevalent amongst the young and more contagious than ever.

It needs to be said because although young people are a very small part of the overall death number, the old people don't really need to be told to take it seriously and get their shot, they already do. And it's not good to allow the virus to propagate a lot even if it isn't killing many people, that's how we get more variants. It's so easy to just get a shot and not take that chance (or foist the chance on anyone else) yet there are still people who don't wanna do it...",,,1619991739,{},gwpowxu,False,t3_n2hns4,False,True,t1_gwpe77q,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n2hns4/michigan_is_now_hospitalizing_more_people_under/gwpowxu/,1620025242,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You could do it with a hard stick (fines or jailtime for refusal), a soft stick (refusing services / creating restrictions for non-vaccinated individuals), or a carrot (a big stimulus check contingent on vaccination status). The fact that childhood vaccination rates in the above states are 99%+ shows that mandates work. 

For a disease like COVID-19, we probably won't meaningfully mandate vaccination in any of the above forms. While in a couple of months virtually all deaths from COVID would be completely prevented in a counterfactual future with mandatory vaccinations, we will reach a ""societally acceptable"" level of death with voluntary vaccinations where people won't accept the political implications of more aggressive vaccination efforts. 

For a disease like smallpox (or alternatively SARS/MERS-level IFR in a virus as contagious as SARS-CoV-2), it would absolutely make sense to mandate vaccination.

CDC and MDPH together were very late to update tonight. 7 day average for first doses down a 3rd day in a row, lowest since April 2nd. 

**CDC** update on first dose shots:

51,448 first dose shots. Last week 55,489. 

7 day rolling avg is now 43,612. 44,190 yesterday. 

3,909,748 MA residents have first doses - 56.72% (3,858,300  - 55.98% yesterday)

70.56% of adults now

At this rate, the first dose shots:

On

May 15th - 4,520,322

May 31st - 5,218,121

June 15th - 5,872,307

**Eligible population numbers (based on 5,540,726 population)**

On

May 15th - 81.58%

May 31st - 94.18%

June 15th - 105.98%

80% on 5/13 (- 7 days)

90% on 5/26 (- 11 days)

95% on 6/2 (- 14 days)

**Total population numbers (based on 6,892,503 population)**

On

May 15th - 65.58%

May 31st - 75.71%

June 15th - 85.20%

60% on 5/7 (- 6 days)

70% on 5/22 (- 9 days)

75% on 5/30 (- 12 days)

80% on 6/7 (- 14 days)

**Fully vaccinated estimates**

Using the date for 95% of adults with dose 1, if all of them get a second dose 31 days later (1 month for Moderna), plus an additional 14 days for immunity to kick in, that will put us at a date of: Saturday, July 17th (- 14 days), for 95% of adults fully vaccinated.

Notes: 

* If the Pfizer EUA is expanded to age 12, the eligible population will be increased to 6,020,000+. I will also make the change for the MA total population to 7,029,917 (from 2020 census) at that time.

Like the U.S. and all of its biggest states, California is too diverse and large a place to characterize as a monolith, and those who keep comparing it to others based on its lockdown strategies--  in this post and in others-- aren’t looking into the details.  In 2018, the C.D.C. rated every county in the nation from least to most socially-vulnerable, based on their households’ crowdedness, transportation access, poverty, and other measures of inequity.  The table below shows that there’s a pretty strong correlation between a city’s vulnerability score and how bad they fared during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.

I did the same analysis for the vaccine rollout.  Within states, there’s a weaker, yet relatively significant, correlation; even in California, where we’ve really pushed for equity on this front.  Other things can certainly explain the disparities in dose administration, but some of the metrics that the C.D.C.’s vulnerability score analyzes-- education level, poverty, and the like-- may affect someone’s ability and willingness to get the shot.  I suspect that’s reflected here.

Conclusion?  For all the talk about the winter surge, California did a pretty decent job.  More than half of its population live in what the C.D.C. classifies as “highly-vulnerable” counties, compared to about a quarter of Floridians; this pandemic should’ve done a bigger number on them.  And while I can’t say whether or not California did enough, their relatively aggressive campaign for equity in the vaccine distribution will surely pay dividends for the state as it looks to end its pandemic.

And, in an ideal world, we wouldn’t have so much inequity and vulnerability in the first place.  I hope that, as we emerge, our leaders can see that we’re only as strong as our weakest link; that they take the lessons we’ve learned in this mess, and enact policies that may lead to positive change.",,,1619916006,{},gwlutfq,False,t3_n2d649,False,False,t3_n2d649,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n2d649/daily_discussion_thread_may_01_2021/gwlutfq/,1619945588,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Imagine being so condescending as to call other people naive when you just dropped the “The Roman Empire lasted over a decade” of logical falsehoods. Coronavirus’ have been known and researched for about a century and research on vaccines for SARS go back to 2003 with the initial outbreak. 

Of the 3 vaccines with EUA in the US, 85% of the vaccines purchased were developed explicitly with proprietary technology developed in the US by Moderna and licensed to BioNTech (then funded by the American bio pharmaceutical company Pfizer). The fundamentals of stabilizing an mRNA vaccine and deploying it to the globe would not have happened without American bio pharmaceuticals full stop. 

Not to mention that the mRNA vaccines approved for emergency use in the US cannot be deployed without cold chain infrastructure the developing world just doesn’t have. The US is sending doses out to other countries by the hundreds of millions once they are approved for emergency use by FDA so don’t give me this “the US is selfish and is prolonging the pandemic” bullshit. 

Americans are going to get vaccinated 7 months before everyone else because we contributed more than anyone else to the development of the vaccines currently approved and in use in the US and we paid for their development and deployment.

Page 17 - Spotlight: Emergency Measures

 International human rights law permits, in an emergency that threatens the life of the nation, that certain rights can be derogated. The emergency must be officially proclaimed, and such measures must: 

• only be taken to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation; 

• not be inconsistent with other obligations under international law; 

• be time-limited; and 

• not discriminate. No derogation is permitted from certain specified rights, including the right to life. 

Other States have not formally declared a state of emergency but have adopted emergency measures to combat the virus. Where these measures impact human rights, they must not discriminate, be provided for by law and necessary and proportionate to meet the public health crisis. 

So unless i'm reading that incorrectly and please correct me if wrong, the United Nations does mention that in extreme cases when the threat of life to a nation is in play then measures to restrict movement are allowed so long as they are not permenant i.e. lasting after the pandemic is over or if it branches out into anything futher than what is passed etc. So Australia banning people entering their country from India due to an extremeely dangerous variant of a pandemic is acceptable as their is a very real threat and danger to the lives of Australia's inhabitants.",,,1619911620,{},gwlmss8,False,t3_n2c9xp,False,True,t1_gwl3ze2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n2c9xp/covid_australians_could_face_jail_or_fines_if/gwlmss8/,1619941214,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

To my knowledge research on using mRNA for vaccinations has been  conducted since roughly 2004 and the main reason is because mRNA should  actually be safer than the traditional vaccine method. The mRNA method  excludes the risks that come with injecting someone with what is  supposed to be an inert virus, namely, the risk that the virus actually  does cause the disease in the person being vaccinated. That and long  term effects should be significantly less likely if not completely  impossible since the mRNA that causes the production of the dummy spike  proteins is degraded and flushed out of the system within hours of the  injection, thus meaning it can’t do anything else since it’s gone.  That’s why most researchers aren’t concerned with side effects surfacing  beyond 6 weeks at the maximum since everything that was in the vaccine should be out of your body by then. As far as the getting Covid after getting a shot is concerned, I see people say it's tons of people as if it's happening all over the place but I've found nothing actually detailing any of this information since it's all in pieces.

Three of the domestic cases are the husband, son and daughter of a housekeeping employee at the Novotel Taipei Taoyuan International Airport hotel, the CECC said.

The employee, a Taiwanese woman in her 60s, tested positive last Friday, while her three family members tested positive on Sunday after showing symptoms of COVID-19, according to the CECC.
The fourth domestic case is the young daughter of a China Airlines (CAL) pilot who tested positive on April 26, the CECC said.

The pilot's other child, a boy also under the age of 5, was confirmed Saturday to have contracted COVID-19, while the children's mother has tested negative so far, according to the CECC.

As of Sunday, four Novotel hotel employees, three of their family members, 10 CAL pilots, and seven of the pilots' relatives had tested positive for COVID-19, according to the CECC.

The cases of the Novotel employees, their family members, and the pilots' relatives are deemed as domestic cases, but the CECC has not yet classified the pilots' infections, including one that was confirmed in Australia.

The imported COVID-19 case reported Sunday was that of an Indonesian man in his 20s, who came to Taiwan to study and tested positive for the disease shortly after he completed his mandatory 14-day quarantine, the CECC said.

To date, Taiwan has recorded 1,137 cases of COVID-19, 997 of which have been classified as imported. Of the total, 1,055 have recovered, 12 have died, and 70 are in the hospital, according to CECC statistics as of Sunday.

That they are somehow misjudging how dangerous the virus is, how likely they are to catch it - or perhaps they they are mis-evaluatimg the risk of the virus compared with some other effect of their behaviour (such as doing less exercises due to covid lockdown). Or perhaps you think they have not correctly adjusted for the age related risk profile - that younger people are misjudging their own personal risk of death by looking at population level statistics which are skewed heavily toward older people? Perhaps you also include risk of injury and/or hospitalization with this too?

It is not clear to me why you believe that people are misjudging the risks. Is it because they are taking action that you think would be unwarranted given the nature and extent of the risk? Or is it simply the fear element that you are identifying? I think maybe your argument is something like ""if you really cared about risks of that magnitude you would also be worried about these other similarly proportioned risks, since you are here complaining about the coivd risk and not the other things then you must be misevaluating your actual risk""?

I think for me personally there are three main concerns in this regards. Firstly, the best way for me to avoid spreading the virus to someone else who may have much higher risk is for me to avoid catching the virus. Cannot spread a virus I do not have. Secondly we so not yet know the long term health impacts of sars-cov2. If we look at SARS itself then there was widespread long-term injury caused to younger people. There is mounting evidence that even initally mild cases of covid19 in younger people can result in longer term injury, although even here it is much more common in older people. Even initially mild cases can lead to long term symptoms, there doesn't seem to be much correlatioj between the severity initial symptoms and the occurrence of long term symptoms. Thirdly, it is quite an unpleasant disease to experince, even if no injury is caused. Althoug most younger people have mild or no symptoms, still many do not - the chances of having symptoms is at least 1 in 5 even for a 20year old. I don't really want to spread it to old colleagues and for them to have a very unpleasant few weeks even if doesn't lead then to have long term injury or death. Many of us have large networks of friends, family, etc, the chances of someone close to us being injured starts to become quite high.

Even worse - regardless of the health risks directly associated with current strains - we have seen so far the emergence of multiple improved strains of the virus. The rate of emergence of these new strains is highly correlated with the number of people who catch the virus.

I wonder if it is perhaps you who is making an error here - rather than others misevaluating the risks - perhaps you are misevaluating the kinds of risks that people might be concerned about?",,,1619950062,{},gwn4sju,False,t3_n2wma2,False,False,t1_gwmsd96,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n2wma2/the_political_vaccine_divide_in_washington_state/gwn4sju/,1619972947,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

We also will be getting a million doses on Moderna, so next week we get 3 million doses, which is the equivalent of about 10% of our eligible population, or 7.5% of our total. We can most likely administer close to about 3 mil next week alone, which would put the country at almost exactly 40% of our population (probably a bit under) with their first dose.

My hope is we can start getting our Moderna supply from the U.S. plant as well instead of Europe, as it hasn't been the MOST consistent coming out of their European facility. 

What's the feel in the United States regarding Canada/Mexico starting to get supply produced in the United States? We still have the appetite for vaccines here in Canada, I don't imagine we'll hit the wall Alabama is hitting until we get to about 70% of eligible adults, right now we're at 40, increasing by about a percent a day. If the United States was comfortable with sending a bigger cut of what is produced in U.S. facilities, we would most likely tear through it.

Honestly I think a big reason why we are so hungry for the vaccines is envy, seeing the unrestrained supply in the U.S. while we adhere to some very strict lockdowns for essentially a year, it's hard not to feel envious.

Here’s the protocol on Pfizer’s website.

Bottom of Page 67:  
“A female is found to be pregnant while being exposed or having been exposed to study intervention due to environmental exposure. Below are examples of environmental exposure during pregnancy:   

• A female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact.”

So that last sentence says an environmental exposure occurs if the woman is exposed to the vaccine through inhalation or skin contact — like if an open vial of vaccine was accidentally spilled.

So Page 67 is pretty straightforward.

But then the top of Page 68 says this:  
“A male family member or healthcare provider who has been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact then exposes his female partner prior to or around the time of conception.”

How is this to be interpreted? If a man is exposed to the vaccine accidentally through inhalation or skin contact, does it somehow get into his sperm? Why would a female partner have to report an EDP (Exposure During Pregnancy) because her mate got exposed this way?

This completely skewed peoples understanding of their own health, and government institutions pushed this.

Today you have a massive growing movement of 'HAES' health at every size people claiming you can be fat and healthy.

You have big magazines featuring morbidly obese 'models,' and celebrating their looks. 

Obesity is a large factor in why COVID took so many lives, if you have studied the data on it you would know this to be true.

Practically no one is aggressively against obese people for their reckless choices and its impacts on others in society, and yet there are so many parallels between the negative outcomes of obesity and covid.

Also, obesity is more serious than covid. It has claimed many more, and it will continue to claim many more.

I raise this because it shows that the concern really isn't a deep conviction based on principle that those who take up hospital beds due to reckless decision making should be educated, and if still resistant then compelled. If it was we have a greater cross over of those combating obesity and un-vaccinated, and we don't.

One you are having with yourself. 

All I did was challenge how you ignored a cause of death of children. 

So how about you stop saying this is not killing children since you know that it is. 

Yes the numbers are small. I hope they drop down to zero soon. 

But Ontario has over a million kids and all of Canada has even more. So even though the risk is thankfully really low, it is still real.

And swimming pools are only that risky because irresponsible adults don't watch their kids and/or fence them off properly. 

I actually like swimming pools because they are a safe place to teach children how to swim, which in a world where most people live by water is a vital skill. 

And swimming pools can be made safe. 

Viruses are different. They can have explosive and exponential growth and become deadlier over time. 

But they can also be beaten with vaccines and masks. 

And people are fighting those efforts and that is putting completely innocent children all over the world at risk for no good reason. 

I don't agree when people exaggerate the risk due to children. 

But downplaying the risk is not acceptable either. 

Both of them make it more likely for people to not take disease like measles and polio seriously, and those viruses absolutely target children and have a much greater risk of injury and death. 

But there actually have been countries (namely the ones that took COVID-19 seriously) that have not had any pediatric deaths. 

Just not yours or mine and certainly not Brazil.  

Because at the end of the day, whatever judges decide about custody, a few parents are still going to be losing their children because people are spreading lies about viruses and that is enough to get kids killed.",,,1619977732,{},gwotqh4,False,t3_n26k1w,False,False,t1_gwlcf5i,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n26k1w/a_court_ruling_puts_covid19_hoax_belief_at_centre/gwotqh4/,1620007868,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

IANAD, but seems to me that taking Ibuprofen and acetaminophen prior to getting the vaccine to prevent side effects is not a good idea afterwards either if you aren't truly suffering for the same reasons - dampening your body's immunoresponse by reducing severity of symptoms.

In my case, not sure I really needed it, I was trying to prevent my headache from getting worse (I suffer migraines and the same pressure build up felt the same).

Either way I am just glad to be fully vaccinated.

But I do wish this was more evident in the literature. None of it said to avoid NSAIDs and analgesics prior to getting the second shot, no one asked me if I had taken any prior to getting jabbed, not did anyone say ""Take em if you need em, but only if you need em.""

But amid a new surge of cases in the state, one of the country’s worst surges, Dr. Ramirez was blunt about her past assessment.

&gt;”I was wrong,” she said.

&gt;With nearly 100,000 people, the Fairbanks metropolitan area is Alaska’s second largest and the largest in the state’s vast interior. According to a New York Times database, the number of new coronavirus cases in the borough of which Fairbanks is the seat,  North Star, has risen by 253 percent over the past two weeks. The positivity rate has doubled since March, to about 10 percent from 5 percent, and hospitalizations at Fairbanks Memorial Hospital, the area’s only hospital, have hit a record number.

&gt;”This place is on fire with Covid,” Dr. Barb Creighton, an internist at Fairbanks Memorial Hospital, said at the meeting.

&gt;Experts are unsure what is driving the surge, though a low vaccination rate certainly plays a role. Thirty-six percent of Alaskans are fully vaccinated, and in some boroughs that number is over 50 percent, but in the Fairbanks area just 29 percent of the population has been fully vaccinated.

&gt;There is no big outbreak or two big outbreaks that are really driving this,” said Dr. Joe McLaughlin, the state epidemiologist for Alaska. “We have cases and clusters being associated with a wide range of different settings.”

&gt;With two-thirds of the older population in Fairbanks having received at least one dose of a vaccine, those who have recently been hospitalized in Fairbanks are younger than the Covid patients during the winter, when there was a peak in case numbers. Dr. Creighton said people who were hospitalized in April tended to be in their 40s and 50s and were unvaccinated because they were waiting to see what side effects might come from receiving a Covid-19 vaccine.

&gt;”We are seeing them stay longer because they are not dying,” Dr. Creighton said. “We are giving them noninvasive ventilation and they are staying for two, three weeks and turning around, which I’ve never been more proud of.”

&gt;But while those older patients during the winter peak were largely grateful to be receiving care, those hospitalized now feel differently.

&gt;”Some of these folks are folks that are anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers, and they don’t believe they have Covid or are sick because of it, and our staff is getting pretty angry folks,” Shelley Ebenal, the chief executive of the health care system, Foundation Health Partners, said, imploring the system’s trustees to share their appreciation of the hospital staff with them.

&gt;She sounded a dire warning: “We are not out of Covid, and our staff in particular is not out of Covid. Our morale is really low.”",,,1619985073,{},gwpbfsh,True,t3_n3ed3g,False,False,t3_n3ed3g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n3ed3g/the_virus_is_surging_in_alaskas_interior/gwpbfsh/,1620017710,25,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Nepal: 28.6 Million

Bhutan: ~763,000

Maldives: ~530,000

Let’s say recycling is really important. I don’t know the numbers overall how important but it’s something that we generally need to participate in. But they have mechanical sorters for waste that pulls out the recycling. If the government puts incentives for people/companies to invent better and better tech in this area, we don’t need people to participate.

There was better forward projecting, information sharing with the states, cold chain optimization (allowing states to bid/trade supplies to better match their capacity) and so on that definitely accelerated things a bit in the early days. I'd attribute at least a 10-20% faster vaccination rate to this - which while it may not sound like a lot probably works out to at least a couple of thousand lives saved.

The writer you reference.. David Nikel.. his bio

""I was born in the U.K. but moved to Norway in 2011 and haven't looked back. I run a website and podcast about Norway, authored the Moon Norway travel guidebook, and spend my free time touring the country to discover more about the people and places of this unique corner of the world. I write for Forbes with an outsider's inside perspective on Norway &amp; Scandinavia.""

Nice. No questions here about his ability to balance the evidence at hand. I know what I would have done for a pay check when I was a hippy traveller. It wasn't pretty.

Now, the evidence against. 

""New claims that the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was engineered have been dismissed by scientific and intelligence experts.""

'Consensus' is not science, it is paradigm. Ideally, it is the TRANSIENT acceptance of an OBJECTIVE scientific hypothesis with which the current evidence leads. Unfortunately, today's science (and especially Covid science) is mixed with politics, fame, money and power, not to mention censorship, so you'll have to forgive me if I don't jump on any 'consensus views'. 


""Virologists, however, note that similar sections appear naturally in other viruses.""

This wasn't disputed in the paper. It was the incredibly unusual COMBINATION of these sections, which allows SARS-COV2 to possess dual action capability, multiplying it's virulence to humans specifically, many many fold.


""However, intelligence sources from Britain’s MI5 dismissed the idea as “rumor and conspiracy,” according to the Times of London""

Solid rebuttal here. No further comment required.


""senior officials in the Trump administration have amplified rumors that the virus emerged from a virology lab in Wuhan""

Ah yes, token Trump smear. Come on David, you're better than that.


""An analysis of the first 41 Covid-19 patients published in medical journal the Lancet found that in 27 cases, there had been direct exposure to the Wuhan market, although not with the first known case""

Yes, this creates a hypothesis of zoonotic origin. Now, the rest of the data please? (Albeit the black swan situation for the remaining 14 cases.. that had no link to the market, or earlier cases whatsoever). CCP? Hello? Oh that's all the information the west were allowed for a whole YEAR! And any requests for more us just plain racist!


""Anthony Fauci, director of U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has stated there is no scientific evidence for the claims, while leading researchers from the World Health Organization and Galveston National Laboratory also dismissed the rumours.""

Of course of course. Dr Fauci can't have a week pass without some useless hot air from his mouth can he. Not to mention his and the WHO's funding ties to gain of function research. Pfft, couldn't possibly be OUR science that did this.

——————————————-

 That’s exactly what the bottom of Page 67 says — they consider an “environmental exposure during pregnancy .... exposed to the study intervention (the vaccine) through inhalation or skin contact.”

Page 67 says nothing about getting the vaccine from another person. It explicitly says through inhalation or skin contact, like if an opened vial spilled.

Top of Page 68 is different. That talks about a guy — who has been exposed the same way — being MAYBE capable of affecting a pregnancy.

This is likely due to an abundance of caution when it comes to drug testing and pregnant women. The government is telling them to keep an extra special eye on pregnant women. Which is a good thing.

I found this on the web. I especially like Slide 3 for addressing your concerns. Pregnant women are a “special” population:

The reality is that there has always been a huge difference between indoor and outdoor transmission.

If we do not strictly hold them accountable, people would lack vigilance, leading to unpredictable consequences. One person fails to exercise vigilance, the whole society might suffer,"" Chinh said at a meeting on Covid-19 fighting on Sunday morning.

He noted that party chiefs and chairmen of cities and provinces are responsible for the situation in their own localities.

Chinh said records showed that a lot of people in Da Nang City, Ba Ria-Vung Tau and Khanh Hoa Province had broken Covid-19 preventative regulations in the last few days. Meanwhile, Dong Thap, Vinh Long and Tien Giang provinces have been slow in establishing Covid-19 testing facilities.

""If we are careless, we will have to pay high prices in terms of human lives, money losses, development opportunities, and reputation.""

After over a month without new community transmission cases, 24 have been found since Thursday in four localities including 12 in Ha Nam Province, six in Vinh Phuc Province, three in Hanoi, two in Hung Yen Province, all in the north, and one in Ho Chi Minh City.

The six cases in Vinh Phuc are female staff of Sunny Dong Son bar in northern Vinh Phuc Province. They came in close contact with five Chinese experts, four of whom were confirmed positive for the coronavirus after returning to China.

Upon entering Vietnam, the Chinese experts were sent to 14-day centralized quarantine in Yen Bai Province. After completing their centralized quarantine period and testing negative thrice, the group continued to have their health monitored for 14 days at Bao Yen Hotel in Yen Bai under supervision of local medical staff. However, the experts had left their hotel and visited many localities like Lao Cai, Vinh Phuc, Lai Chau and Yen Bai provinces, all in northern Vietnam.

The remaining cases in Ha Nam, Hanoi, Hung Yen and HCMC are all linked to a Ha Nam man who returned from Japan and tested positive after completing his two-week centralized quarantine in Da Nang City. This man failed to quarantine himself in Ha Nam for another 14 days as required.

The resurgence of community transmissions came as Vietnamese are undertaking the four-day holiday that began on Friday, seeing top tourist destinations in Vietnam overrun by holiday crowds.

Imagine you are building a house. Typically you might need a carpenter, electrician, plumber, engineer, and some other people(I don't know what goes into building a house fully). You trust those people because (for the most part) they specialize in what they are good at and you don't have to worry so much about somebody doing something wrong.

Now imagine you are building a house, except this time you are having the landscaper do the plumbing. Yeah they might have a SUPER basic basis of knowledge on what they have to do, but they are going to make mistakes and possibly completely misunderstand what they are doing/they might just do it wrong.

Now let's add a third layer. Let's have all of these people work for a company. Youve heard great things about this company before and have a sense of trust with them. So when they come to work on your house, they seem like they are doing their job. I mean they are supposed to be able to build good houses right? Well at a closer inspection, you notice that the landscaper is completely lost on what they are doing because they were assigned to work on the plumbing. Then you notice other problems like nobody is wearing proper safety gear and other people are doing jobs they weren't trained/learned how to do. 

Now, normally you would do something to get a different company in who actually know what they are doing until you realize that the contract you signed blocks you from doing that and you have to give rave reviews from hear on out.

I may use a shortened versij of this in conversation because it can be difficult to track in real time. But, in the end, the house and company don't really matter. It is the people who work on the house that are important. While they might know all of this stuff in one area of constitution, they might be almost compleatly blind in another.

To my knowledge, it is somewhat the same in science/medicine. A surgeon might be the BEST surgeon in the world, but if you go to them for advice in how to treat your child's cancer, they probably won't know the best practices, treatments, or causes at all. So instead you go to somebody who specializes in treating childhood cancer.

You don't go to the landscaper to set up the plumbing in your house, and you don't go to the surgeon to diagnose childhood cancer.",,,1619978787,{},gwowq6g,False,t3_n32y2t,False,False,t1_gwnsjjd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n32y2t/italian_police_arrest_two_antivaxxers_for_fire/gwowq6g/,1620009501,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

1 child out of millions in the entire province.  It's moved up from not a cause of death for any people to last place on the cause of death list for children.  Congrats.  You're ""technically correct"" in the sense that it's possible for kids to die from the virus.  Just like it's possible for them to die from moose attacks.

&gt; So how about you stop saying this is not killing children since you know that it is. 

Because you're being disingenuous.  It's not ""killing children"" in any significant way.  It's more dangerous to go to a fucking playground and do the monkey bars or swim in a pool.  This is such a negligible risk that it's outrageous that you would fucking argue it's something to even consider.

&gt; Viruses are different. They can have explosive and exponential growth and become deadlier over time. 

No.  Endemic viruses literally can't be controlled, and they become less deadly over time as they generally mutate toward infectiveness and less lethality because it increases their ability to reproduce.  Also people build immunity to viruses over time as they encounter them more.

 

&gt;I don't agree when people exaggerate the risk due to children.  
&gt;  
&gt;But downplaying the risk is not acceptable either.

Funny, because when I said 1 in a million, I wasn't downplaying it.  That's actually how likely it is for a child to die from this virus.  You're exaggerating the risk even though you're pretending to be rational.

&gt; Both of them make it more likely for people to not take disease like measles and polio seriously, and those viruses absolutely target children and have a much greater risk of injury and death. 

This isn't about fucking polio.  What are you going to do next, bring up AIDS?  This fucking virus doesn't kill kids.  That's all there is to it.  Stop pretending it's something that it's not.

We lost our lives, how? Covid test was positive. The filming team did what was necessary, in 4 days they stayed at home. Then he had to be taken to the hospital, when his breathing problem started. He was taken to intensive care at the hospital first, and then he was intubated. During this period, he had an oxygen problem, CRP rates and others deteriorated. The cytokine storm hit and passed. So all other organs were damaged; heart stopped for 10 minutes, for example. I do not extend it; We lost my dear brother Cemal, who had no health problems before and had no complaints about an organ, 25 days after his test was positive. "" used the expression.

The boy has been placed in quarantine since April 25 after the pilot tested positive for COVID-19, Chen said.

The three imported cases, meanwhile, came from the Philippines and Indonesia, according to the health minister, who also heads the CECC.

The three latest patients are all men in their 40s, and include two Taiwanese nationals and one Philippine fishing worker, according to the CECC.

Saturday's four new cases bring the total number of cases in the country to 1,132 since the outbreak began in 2020. Of the total, 12 have died, while 67 are isolated for treatment in hospitals.

""Patient 2950"" and ""Patient 2951"" are F1 cases of Covid-19 patients linked to a Ha Nam man who returned from Japan and tested positive after completing his two-week centralized quarantine in Da Nang City.

With the two new infections, northern Ha Nam Province, around 60 kilometers from Hanoi, has recorded 18 patients since Thursday.

Six other cases, numbered from 2957 to 2962, are female staff of Sunny Dong Son bar in Phuc Yen Town of northern Vinh Phuc Province. They came in close contact with five Chinese experts of Trung Bac A Minerals JSC, four of whom were confirmed positive for the coronavirus after returning to China.

Vinh Phuc has identified 92 F1 cases, 178 F2 cases and 57 F3 cases of the six patients. 104 people in Vinh Phuc have been isolated, of which 10 are isolated in the Hanoi-based National Hospital of Tropical Diseases and the remaining in medical facilities of the province.

The eight new patients are being treated at the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases.

After entering Vietnam, the Chinese experts were sent to Nhu Nguyet 2 hotel in Yen Bai Town for 14-day centralized quarantine from April 9 to 23. They had their samples taken for coronavirus testing thrice, with all results negative.

After completing their centralized quarantine period, the group was handed to Trung Bac A Company and continued to have their health monitored for 14 days at Bao Yen Hotel in Nghia Lo Town, Yen Bai Province under supervision of local medical staff.

Vu Hien Hanh, vice chairwoman of Yen Bai, said the experts had voluntarily left their hotel and visited many localities like Lao Cai, Vinh Phuc, Lai Chau and Yen Bai provinces, all in northern Vietnam, from April 23 to 25.

On April 28, they returned to China through Huu Nghi border gate in Lang Son Province.

The resurgence of community transmissions came as Vietnamese are undertaking the four-day holiday that began on Friday, seeing top tourist destinations in Vietnam overrun by holiday crowds.

Consider the fact that in rural areas, medical resources are scarce. So it takes much less before an area gets overwhelmed compared to an urban area.

[],,tractiontiresadvised,,,[],,,,text,t2_2md6zqzx,False,False,[],"&gt; Historically we haven't used mRNA vaccines, so I was only trying to say that it's not really a 1 to 1 comparison between these new ones and old vaccines that have been proven safe.

Their statement holds true for not just ""traditional"" inactivated-virus vaccines, but also the newer types like adenovirus-vector and protein-subunit vaccines. I don't think there's a reason that it wouldn't also hold true for mRNA vaccines as well.

(Note also that we're not trying to give everybody on the planet the same vaccine at the same time. Millions of people across the world are getting the Sputnik and Sinovac vaccines, for example.)

I'm not an expert in the field, but have been spending the last few months reading and listening to people who are. So I'll dig up some of their stuff in case you're interested....

For some background, the medicinal chemist Derek Lowe wrote a good [summary](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/04/15/coronavirus-vaccine-prospects) last spring on different types of vaccines were being developed for SARS-CoV-2. The [things that have gone wrong with vaccines in the past](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/06/15/what-might-go-wrong) include Antibody-Dependent Enhancement and autoimmune issues such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. (Ah, I'd forgotten about ADE! The scientists were all nervous about that possibility last summer.) Those would have popped up during the phase 2/3 clinical trials.

The CDC has a good [historical writeup](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html) (click the ""open all"" button for full info) on vaccines which had either real or suspected safety issues.

The virologist/professor Vincent Racaniello has an excellent group-discussion podcast called This Week in Virology. Most of their episodes are long and rambly, but the one where they [intereviewed Paul Offit](https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-720/) about vaccines is of particular interest. He's also got a COVID-related livestream series called ""Virus Q&amp;A with A&amp;V"" (last episode is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_uVzYxB4rA)). Pretty much every episode somebody asks about the possibility of long-term issues from the mRNA platform; their answer is something along the lines that mRNA naturally degrades in a couple of days so it doesn't have the ability to hang out in your cells to do something weird later on.",,,1619986672,{},gwpeoze,False,t3_n2hns4,False,False,t1_gwofuvw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n2hns4/michigan_is_now_hospitalizing_more_people_under/gwpeoze/,1620019576,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
