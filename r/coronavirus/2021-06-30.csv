""Although the UK has a high vaccination rate, they also did a strict top-down age/vulnerability-based approach. This means that they have extremely high vaccination levels at the &gt;50 age brackets, but essentially no immunity at the lower age brackets. So when things reopened, there were plenty of naive hosts still waiting to be infected in the lower age groups. Compare this to the US, for example, where there were age-based restrictions when supplies were constrained, but then embarked on a more heterogenous 'come and get it' approach. The differences are reflected in how peoples' social networks tend to interact - if you're 60, you're probably not out raging with 25 year olds at the pub, you're probably mostly spending significant amounts of time around other 60 year old people, excluding any younger individuals that you live with/care for - in the UK, this means 60 year olds are hanging around with other immune 60 year olds and that immunity isn't providing much protection for the 25 year olds that are all raging at the pub. In the US, people in the lower age brackets were able to get vaccinated earlier, meaning that you had heterogenous immunity and so it's harder for chains of transmission to start.""",,,1625105052,{},h3muj31,False,t3_ob4edl,False,False,t1_h3me2ur,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ob4edl/uk_records_26068_new_covid_cases_highest_since/h3muj31/,1625357440,26,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I understand that they greatly reduce the severity of symptoms and that is great, but they also **definitely** reduce the contraction of the virus, which is the main measure of efficacy cited on this subreddit from scientific studies. Also by extension, reduction in symptoms reduces the virus’ ability to spread if you aren’t coughing, sneezing or generally expelling as many viral particles into the air around you.

I know that reducing the strain on healthcare is a major goal by reducing symptoms, but reducing spread is definitely a HUGE goal as well. If the virus spreads without resistance through the masses then you end up with all sorts of variants that could be worse than the original virus. Surprise surprise that is the situation we are currently in with all the new *variants of concern* popping up across the globe.

If a space faring race, far beyond our technology, showed up on our doorstep they could likely take what we they want because there’d be no way we could stop them. Now, would they? I think I that depends on why they were on a leisurely drive through the galaxy. 

It would be awesome if/when a benevolent race of space hippies were to grace us with their knowledge of the universe. However it’s probably more likely they’re out looking for groceries (meat) or resources (our water, metals, slaves, etc.). I say that from a terrestrial animalistic POV bc that’s the only frame of reference we have at this point. 

The thing is that people believe that space is so big that nothing could travel in their lifetimes to get anywhere because of the limits of the speed of light. There are a few holes in that theory and we may be a lot closer than many people realize. We’ve stopped light (photons) and CERN observed neutrinos smoking the speed of light by orders of magnitude. However that’s in our current spacetime fabric. 

When we have better understanding of gravity and antimatter, which may be a few decades away, humans could likely be on our own leisurely drive through the galaxy.

Their main concern is that even with 75-80% coverage we could still have enough cases to overwhelm the health system and be forced to use masking and lockdowns again.

Yes but this is the key issue.  That's still not a fully open back to normal border and we could be talking for five years at least.  The hope had been once vaccination was done we'd be able to fully open.  

&gt;NZ already eliminated measles within NZ which required 95% vaccination rates.

Actually NZ has never come close to achieving those rates and we have been well behind the US for decades.  The US requires vaccination to attend public schools. NZ has never made it compulsory.  

The most recent data shows 88% of 5-year olds are fully immunised, but for older cohorts the number is much lower with a study by the WHO placing Measles immunity for people born from 1980 to 2000 at 77-83%.  

&gt;But the modelling also shows 93%+ vaccinated will achieve herd immunity with the Pfizer vaccine.

And we have never come within 10% of that number for the whole population for any other vaccine.  The most recent poll found 77% of adults eligible for the Covid vaccine would take it.  And some adults who will take it are hesitant about giving it to their kids, who make up 15% of the population.  

Also the study from Te Punaha Matatini found that we need 97% coverage to achieve herd immunity.  You can see the article about the study [here](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/125589173/covid19-new-data-suggests-herd-immunity-unachievable-in-new-zealand?fbclid=IwAR1K-tjCNglDXXoZ_ZGDOVLV1qn1CHFbX53AHslubDQIh5WiLd8zzygbgOo).",,,1625139342,{},h3o6rq2,False,t3_obcu5g,False,True,t1_h3o50cu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/obcu5g/some_delta_variant_cases_in_alabama_among/h3o6rq2/,1625382049,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; Currently, there are no data on the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in people who received monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma as part of COVID-19 treatment. Based on the estimated half-life of such therapies and evidence suggesting that reinfection is uncommon in the 90 days after initial infection, vaccination should be deferred for at least 90 days. This is a precautionary measure until additional information becomes available, to avoid potential interference of the antibody therapy with vaccine-induced immune responses. This recommendation applies to people who receive passive antibody therapy before receiving any vaccine dose and to those who receive passive antibody therapy after the first dose of an mRNA vaccine but before the second dose, in which case the second dose should be deferred for at least 90 days following receipt of the antibody therapy. Receipt of passive antibody therapy in the past 90 days is not a contraindication to receipt of COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 vaccine doses received within 90 days after receipt of passive antibody therapy do not need to be repeated.

For others, they just don’t think they personally need it. Just like there’s a million different reasons why people chose to get vaccinated - it’s not all the same reason

At the end of the day, the way I see it is I did my part. I wore a mask for a year even though I couldn’t see any of my friends because of the virus, you couldn’t see people’s faces which too a lot of people is a big deal. Some people don’t want their faces to be seen because of acne or something else which is entirely fine if that’s what they choose. To me, it’s just nice being able to see people’s reactions and smile - that’s a part of being human that I feel like you somewhat lose with the masks on.

Yes, there are other ways to show you are excited with a mask on but it’s just not the same to me. I got vaccinated and did my part. If someone else isn’t vaccinated, who more than likely isn’t even going to be wearing a mask, what more can I do?

I know you could say wear a mask but I don’t want to wear one for the rest of my life because of someone else’s decision they made for themselves. The CDC says you are safe and others are so that’s what I go by.

Some people on this sub though act like if you are vaccinated and don’t wear a mask that you’re killing people or something by your decision. Telling people to mask up but still get the vaccine are two messages that conflict

Clean and disinfect surfaces in the areas that the sick person used (such as the bedroom and bathroom) if you enter these areas less than 24 hours after the person is no longer sick. Wear a mask when you enter the room, open windows and use fans to help increase airflow, and always use disinfectants safely.

Almost **half of children who contract covid-19 may have lasting symptoms**, which should factor into decisions on reopening schools, reports Helen Thomson

Evidence from the first study of long covid in children suggests that more than half of children aged between 6 and 16 years old who contract the virus have **at least one symptom lasting more than 120 days, with 42.6 per cent impaired by these symptoms during daily activities**. These interim results are based on periodic assessments of 129 children in **Italy** who were diagnosed with covid-19 between March and November 2020 at the Gemelli University Hospital in Rome (medRxiv, doi.org/fv9t).

The **UK Office** for National Statistics's latest report estimates that **12.9 per cent of UK children aged 2 to 11, and 14.5 per cent of children aged 12 to 16, still have symptoms five weeks after their first infection**. Almost 500,000 UK children have tested positive for covid-19 since March 2020.",,,1625164679,{},h3pnukr,False,t3_obghv8,False,True,t1_h3pi66x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/obghv8/delta_plus_variant_found_in_louisiana/h3pnukr/,1625409882,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Then the mutant becomes the dominant strain.

 There was a paper posted here recently where they talk about the above and calculate based on the mutation rate of sars-cov-2 how long it will take to get single, double, triple, and 4 way mutations.

[],,friends_in_sweden,,,[],,,,text,t2_53hbxlwz,False,False,[],"This pandemic has really altered my world view considerably, especially regarding scientific expertise. Living in a country (Sweden) that was called an ['open-air experiment'](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/business/sweden-economy-coronavirus.html) where [96.000 people were predicted to die by June 2020](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20062133v1) (real number was around 6.000), [while at the same time other modelers said we would have herd immunity in Stockholm by May](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/matematikprofessorn-ungefar-30-procent-i-stockholm-ar-smittade) (still waiting on that). [Now, in terms of death, Sweden looks like an average European country](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=latest&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=Confirmed+deaths&amp;Interval=Cumulative&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=SWE~European+Union). 

This made me realize a few things that I hope to take forward into the future.

1. People who speak with certainty in highly uncertain situations are overestimating their ability to analyze the situation. Predictions have routinely been wrong all the time. [Just look at the sheer range of predictions made for the US on May 21st.](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1401994679613366275/photo/1) 
2. We've fallen into unscientific traps of confusing correlation with causation. For the last year there has been a tendency of associating every change in the pandemic trajectory with specific events or behaviors. Pictures of people at the beach in Florida lead to overly certain predictions of a coming rise and cases. I am sure people think that the winter wave in the US was caused by the holidays, but this isn't really true because in places like the mid-west cases started rising rapidly in October.  The truth is there is probably a ton of randomness that causes the virus to peak in different places and in different times, and despite uncertainty being a fundamental part of science, public health officials seemed reluctant to just say 'we don't know'. 
3. Lastly, this pandemic has showed me that people have varying levels of numeracy. I don't really blame lay-people who aren't interested in statistics to know off the back of their hand the problems of using CFR as a measure of anything or why reported cases might not equal true cases -- I do however expect journalists and scientists to know these difference.  I've seen some truly horrible hot takes that with a little statistical criticism can be easily shown to be misleading. Eric Feigl-Ding is the worst at this, with his gish gallop of stats that are impossible to assess without spending hours doing it. 

I think my perspective is also warped because I am viewing all of these debates through media and Twitter. I have to constantly remind myself that this is a self-selected group that represents different fringes and are the type of people who don't go nuts speaking publicly on highly contentious issues. There is probably a deeper reservoir of experts who are much more nuanced (and boring for the media) but that is hidden for most people.",,,1625124585,{},h3npm9m,False,t3_obg91g,False,False,t3_obg91g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/obg91g/daily_discussion_thread_july_01_2021/h3npm9m/,1625373427,49,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

We knew very early on single layer cloth masks were about 10-20% and triple layers about 40%.

This study is not talking about individual protection. People are reading this as if the study is talking about your protection from the virus or spreading, this is not what the study is about at all.

It is linking reported mask usage to infection levels and it made a 25% difference.

You have people wearing varying levels of masks, skirting rules, refusing masks and other factors in play.

Individual protection remains, a N95 is going to reduce your chance by 95% or more. That say eyes are also a way people are infected so distance or barriers matter there as well, we also see studies showing people with glasses were infected way less. Likely because less likely to touch eyes, less spit/droplets in eyes etc. 

Forgetting the eyes the mask is still filtering out 95% of it and providing you 95% infection.

Also when Redfield made those remarks, that was before the true efficacy of the vaccines were known.

To this day people still don't understand masks, how the virus spreads and are misreading articles.

This has nothing to do with individual protection, or the protection you offer others. People wearing masks lower, improperly, no distance, skirting rules, refusal to wear are why masks were only 25% effective.

**Millions in vaccines for Cape Verde, Indonesia and Covax programme**  
News release | 01-07-2021 | 12:00

This week, the Netherlands will send 150,000 vaccines to Cape Verde and deliveries to the Covax programme will start. In addition, the Netherlands will donate approximately 3 million vaccines to Indonesia. This was decided by Minister Hugo de Jonge of Health, Welfare and Sport (VWS) in consultation with Minister Sigrid Kaag of Foreign Affairs (BZ). Through a large delivery of over one million AstraZeneca vaccines, it is now possible to provide aid to Cape Verde and start with an initial quantity of 500,000 vaccines to the Covax programme. The vaccines for Indonesia will follow later.

*Cape Verde*  
The corona situation in the Cape Verde islands is serious. The number of daily infections is high and the pressure on the hospitals is high. The Cape Verdean government has therefore asked the Netherlands for help in combating the corona virus. Minister De Jonge has answered this request for help by releasing 150,000 doses of AstraZeneca for Cape Verde.

As with Suriname, the large Cape Verde community in the Netherlands means there is a lot of traffic and contact between the Netherlands and Cape Verde. The vaccines will be transported together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

In addition to the donation of vaccines to Cape Verde, the Erasmus Medical Centre, the Municipality of Rotterdam and the Rotterdam Safety Region will ensure that a medical assistance team will be on the islands to assist with the vaccinations.

*Indonesia*  
The corona situation is also very serious in Indonesia, with which the Netherlands has a special relationship. The Asian country is being hit hard by the delta variant of the virus. During a conversation with her Indonesian colleague Retno Marsudi, Minister Kaag of Foreign Affairs therefore offered help in the form of at least 3 million vaccines. These vaccines will be delivered later this year.  

*Covax*  
The Netherlands, in cooperation with Sweden, has now also started a donation programme to Covax, the global facility for access to vaccines for low- and middle-income countries. An initial quantity of 500,000 vaccines has now been made available. This number will increase significantly in the coming weeks when supplies for the Netherlands become available. Eventually tens of millions of vaccines will be donated through Covax.

Hypochondriasis, in which medically unexplained somatic symptoms are accompanied by the fear or belief that one has an undiagnosed disease, is equally prevalent in men and women.

From: Hypochondriacal concerns and attitudes toward illness in males and females https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1487388/

Objective: To review the published studies on the sex distribution of hypochondriasis, and to examine sex differences in hypochondriacal concerns and in attitudes toward illness.

In our study, we found no substantial differences between males and females in hypochondriacal concerns and attitudes toward illness.


---

Part of the reason women are seen as Hypochondriacs is that they are often not believed when they state they are having problems. 

For example lets look at Brain tumors. In the UK women were more likely than men to see 10 or more months pass between their first visit to a doctor and diagnosis –and to have made more than five visits to a doctor prior to diagnosis.

I would hope that people realise that one's country has a duty of care firstly for it's own but so much of this is not about the individual (be that individual person or country) but about the whole. Getting the world vaccinated is in everyone's interest both morally, fiscally and from a health perspective.

&gt; but I do think delaying the speed of vaccinations towards the tail end of total vaccination, might be worth it, if it can mean allowing medical personnel in 3rd world countries to be vaccinated

I doubt that would even be needed given the scale of purchases that have been made. Simply divert unneeded supply to elsewhere (granted this doesn't work in all cases). And it's going to be terrible to see as we hit the tail end to see so much wastage of unused vaccine. Most western nations purchased far more than they need (in total and not all has been delivered) and the level of output is far easier to maintain than to ramp up.

There is absolutely tons of info out there on the health of males vs females, the effects of sterilizing them, drugs, etc. I know they do not simply omit the females. I assume mice are treated at least similarly. 

Potentially they are switching them over into more cancer studies and break up the genders because females are so prone to hormones related cancers and tumors if they aren't spayed with current genetics, I don't know. Or they just need a lot of females for breast cancer type testing because it's such a common diseases in people too? They definitely wouldn't just throw out half of their lab rat supply for nothing, so the females are doing something for them. 

And while it isn't at all a good thing to take them out of the study like that (rats are supposed to be people with tiny lifespans and women have estrus cycles, so what's the problem with rats having shorter ones exactly??) I do understand it to a degree. They should be studying the genders with that separation in mind but still include both. Female rats definitely act way crazier, and their cycle just puts more craziness into it. Males are blobs in comparison, so a behavioral study on one is very inaccurate. Although I don't think it happens as often for health/drug studies, it would be slightly more acceptable, because it would matter mostly on things that effected hormones physically, but not on other drugs or health issues.

Your conclusion is accurate, but basically everything above your last paragraph is inaccurate or misleading.

&gt; In field use, the Phizer vaccine shows a 0.46% failure rate.

What's a ""failure rate""?  Googling Pfizer alongside that number returns mostly just stock numbers.  Adding ""vaccine"" to the mix doesn't get you anything relevant (the 0.46% pings on random other numbers that aren't efficacy related) aside from [this](https://www.italy24news.com/business/59474.html), but I'm not totally sure this was well translated.  Pretty sure when they say 0.46%, they meant to say 46%.  Which is obviously not the number you're trying to get at.

If I had to guess, I'd say this is probably a rudimentary calculation of [breakthrough cases/total vaccinated].  Now, when I use the CDC numbers it's way lower than 0.46%, but I wouldn't be surprised if wherever you got that number from lost some 0s along the way.

Which brings me to the next part:

&gt;This is a 10th of what the advertised failure rate is.

Until we know what a ""failure"" rate is, we can't be comparing it against [1-efficacy rate].  I'm willing to bet large sums of money, that whatever this 0.46% number you're using is, it isn't [1-efficacy rate].


&gt;So when people say you only have a 95% protection, of the remaining 5% that is considered a failure, 90% of those are asymptomatic and the person will never even notice they got the infection.

This is wholly inaccurate.  The 95% efficacy rate is comparing symptomatic cases vs. symptomatic cases.  If Joe in Placebo Group or Steve in Experimental Group have a close contact with an individual and go in for a COVID test and come back positive, but never develop any symptoms, they aren't counted as a case.  Different studies had different definitions on what exactly constituted ""symptomatic COVID,"" but the top line number you see refers to reduction in symptomatic COVID.  So when it ""fails"" 5% of the time, those are all symptomatic cases.  Could it be a &gt;95% reduction in death and hospitilization? Sure, but we don't have great data from the studies on that (due to low N values in the placebo group), and it's hard to pull good data from real world because of how much bias gets introduced when allowing people to self sort into vaccinated vs. unvaccinated.",,,1625154783,{},h3p0rn5,False,t3_obkhg4,False,False,t1_h3op7ag,/r/Coronavirus/comments/obkhg4/its_time_to_rethink_onesizefitsall_approach_to/h3p0rn5/,1625397241,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

A novel variant of concern (VOC) named CAL.20C (B.1.427/B.1.429), originally detected in California, carries spike glycoprotein mutations S13I in the signal peptide, W152C in the N-terminal domain (NTD), and L452R in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Plasma from individuals vaccinated with a Wuhan-1 isolate-based mRNA vaccine or convalescent individuals exhibited neutralizing titers, which were reduced 2-3.5 fold against the B.1.427/B.1.429 variant relative to wildtype pseudoviruses. The L452R mutation reduced neutralizing activity of 14 out of 34 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The S13I and W152C mutations resulted in total loss of neutralization for 10 out of 10 NTD-specific mAbs since the NTD antigenic supersite was remodeled by a shift of the signal peptide cleavage site and formation of a new disulphide bond, as revealed by mass spectrometry and structural studies.",,,1625172383,{},h3q5pqm,True,t3_obut26,False,False,t3_obut26,/r/Coronavirus/comments/obut26/sarscov2_immune_evasion_by_the_b1427b1429_variant/h3q5pqm/,1625419841,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Sure, you have fewer future accidents. You also have lower engagement and less learning. You end up with less healthy people with less developed problem solving skills.

I can't even buy a decent chemistry set for my kids without building it myself.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant internal RNA modification, influencing transcript fate and function in uninfected and virus-infected cells. Installation of m6A by the nuclear RNA methyltransferase METTL3 occurs cotranscriptionally; however, the genomes of some cytoplasmic RNA viruses are also m6A-modified. How the cellular m6A modification machinery impacts coronavirus replication, which occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm, is unknown. Here we show that replication of SARS-CoV-2, the agent responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, and a seasonal human β-coronavirus HCoV-OC43, can be suppressed by depletion of METTL3 or cytoplasmic m6A reader proteins YTHDF1 and YTHDF3 and by a highly specific small molecule METTL3 inhibitor. Reduction of infectious titer correlates with decreased synthesis of viral RNAs and the essential nucleocapsid (N) protein. Sites of m6A modification on genomic and subgenomic RNAs of both viruses were mapped by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (meRIP-seq). Levels of host factors involved in m6A installation, removal, and recognition were unchanged by HCoV-OC43 infection; however, nuclear localization of METTL3 and cytoplasmic m6A readers YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 increased. This establishes that coronavirus RNAs are m6A-modified and host m6A pathway components control β-coronavirus replication. Moreover, it illustrates the therapeutic potential of targeting the m6A pathway to restrict coronavirus reproduction.",,,1625170062,{},h3q0aw4,True,t3_obu13t,False,False,t3_obu13t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/obu13t/targeting_the_m6a_rna_modification_pathway_blocks/h3q0aw4/,1625416844,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

We found that a large proportion of survivors of COVID-19 in our cohort had persistent symptoms 6 months after their initial illness. Although it has previously been reported that patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 frequently suffer long-term symptoms20,21,22,23, we found that more than half of home-isolated, mildly to moderately ill patients with COVID-19 still suffered symptoms 6 months after infection. It is worrying that non-hospitalized, young people (16–30 years old) suffer potentially severe symptoms, such as concentration and memory problems, dyspnea and fatigue, half a year after infection. Particularly for students, such symptoms might interfere with their learning and study progress.


Sixty-one percent (189/312) of the total patient population had persistent symptoms 6 months after initial COVID-19 illness, with the most common symptoms being fatigue (37%), difficulty concentrating (26%), disturbed smell and/or taste (25%), memory problems (24%) and dyspnea (21%). Whereas the frequency of most symptoms increased with age in the study population, disturbed smell and/or taste was more frequent in people younger than 46 years old (Table 2).

I'll grant you that heart disease isn't transmissible, at least not in the conventional sense.

All the statistics and arguments above were for self harm and self-injury from the virus. It was not about transmission.

I haven't seen any primary medical journal articles about transmission by vaccinated people. From what I can tell, extrapolation from known data would say that r0 for The vaccinated is very close to zero. Given only about 0.4% of vaccinated get significantly sick, I would imagine that only those people have any service risk of transmitting the virus. But that's the speculation.

Again talking about the alpha variant if 90% of infections are asymptomatic, post vaccination, we pretty much know that asymptomatic infection is very unlikely to spread the virus.

This is where the Delta variant is actually worrisome, it appears to be significantly more easily transmitted.

Among the vaccinated though, at 80% efficacy of the vaccine, you're still at almost no chance of at large population spread.

Ministers plan quarantine-free travel for the double-vaccinated

There is a a cross-government push to reopen foreign travel in time to give families the chance to book a holiday abroad

JONATHAN BORG/ALAMY

Ministers are aiming to introduce quarantine-free travel for double-vaccinated holidaymakers by July 26, the first full week of the school holidays, The Times has learnt.
The plans to exempt people with two doses of the Covid vaccine from the need to quarantine from amber-list countries, which would open up travel to all of Europe, will be phased in.
At first the relaxation would only apply to UK residents with access to the NHS but a deal to extend it to all citizens of the European Union is close to being signed.

UK ambassadors in Europe have also been told to make lobbying for the lifting of restrictions on British holidaymakers their priority as the green list is expanded this month.
It is part of a cross-government push to reopen foreign travel in time to give families the chance to book a holiday abroad after 16 months of coronavirus restrictions. “The big focus for us is Europe now,” a government source said. “All European ambassadors have been told to go lobby.”

However, there are several operational obstacles that could delay the plans. The Home Office has not yet decided whether the verification of Covid certification will take place before passengers travel, at border control, or via spot checks by officials who at the moment are checking on people who are supposed to be quarantining.
Vision Box, the company that operates all of the UK’s e-passport gates, said that it had the technology ready to scan vaccination certificates from both the UK and the EU.
Mitul Ruparelia, vice-president of Vision Box, told The Times that while Britain was “leading with the digitalisation” of coronavirus paperwork, the Home Office had not yet given the firm the go-ahead to enable e-gates to check vaccine passports.

He said: “We are confident that using the Vision Box platform checks can be easily enabled on the e-gates to deal with any future threat or pandemic to the country.”
The UK is close to agreeing to a deal with Brussels that will ensure British holidaymakers can use the NHS app to prove they have been double-jabbed.

Under a mutual recognition arrangement, all EU countries would recognise the NHS app as a vaccine certificate, while the UK would recognise the EU’s digital green card. The app would also prove travellers’ Covid status through testing, enabling them to go to countries that allow quarantine-free travel under condition of a negative PCR test, such as Spain.

At present the UK government is having to co-ordinate with individual countries that have chosen to accept the NHS app as a vaccine certificate.

Boris Johnson will also push for Germany to relax its rules on UK travellers when he meets Angela Merkel at Chequers tomorrow. Germany bans most arrivals from the UK, with those who do travel forced to quarantine for 14 days with no exemptions.

Southern European states such as Spain, which are heavily reliant on British tourists, have already pushed back on Merkel’s plans for a blanket EU-wide quarantine on all UK arrivals.
However, the prospects of travel being reopened between the UK and the United States this summer appear to be less positive. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said there were problems devising a vaccine certificate for travellers from countries such as the US that did not have a digitised system and did not recognise the same vaccine types.

“The US does not recognise AstraZeneca, because AstraZeneca hasn’t applied for the licence,” he said.

“On the other side we don’t have any particular system to recognise vaccine status from the United States because they don’t have a digitised system. They have 50 separate systems.”
Government sources said Sajid Javid’s appointment as health secretary had brought forward the government’s target date for introducing quarantine-free travel for vaccinated travellers.
A minister said: “The intention is that it will be in place by the first week of the summer holidays.”

Another Conservative MP said: “We’re basing quite a lot of hope on Sajid Javid, we think his return to government will make a big change in the government’s approach to international travel.”

A senior government source said: “No final decision has been made on timing yet. There are various issues that need to be worked through and we are waiting for public health advice on exemptions and operational factors.

“Those need to be worked through before we set out further details but the expectation is it will be the end of July or the beginning of August.”",,,1625153636,{},h3oy6xa,False,t3_obitbd,False,True,t1_h3o5zge,/r/Coronavirus/comments/obitbd/ministers_plan_quarantinefree_travel_for_the/h3oy6xa/,1625395913,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Yes you cannot control, but you can work through similarities and more.

604,000 ÷ 33,600,000 = 0.0179 

Let's look up the numbers for Washington state who was the epicenter of this whole thing: 454,000 cases and 5984 deaths
5984 ÷ 454,000 = 0.013

Multiple those numbers by 100 to turn them into a percentage:
Washington has a 1.31% covid mortality rate (or 98.69% survival rate) and the USA has a 1.79% covid mortality rate (or 98.21% survival rate)

If you averaged out the covid survival rates I linked to earlier it averaged out to a 98.51% survival rate which is pretty much the same percentages I just obtained from the raw numbers.

The speed with which Alpha drove out the classic strain was absurd.  Delta drives out Alpha even faster.  It's actually pretty bizarre - since Delta entered the UK, alpha cases have dropped from 2000/day to maybe 100/day, while delta is up from import levels to 10k+/day.  There's no credible mechanic by which they can directly compete: what we're seeing is alpha being quickly destroyed by limited vaccinations and NPI's while delta is much less affected.  And the same is seen in essentially every country that has sequencing and any Delta presence.

Most other lineages (VOC's) are a tier down from Alpha, and maybe one or two are on par with it.  Only Gamma is a tier above alpha, and maybe able compete with Delta - or at least, we can't tell for sure that it'll be driven out in the same way.

This did not occur.  [Here's the Pfizer study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577).  No mention of periodic or routine testing for COVID-19. 

Here's the major point regarding what counted as ""Confirmed COVID-19"" for the study:

&gt;Confirmed Covid-19 was defined according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria as the **presence of at least one of the following symptoms**: fever, new or increased cough, new or increased shortness of breath, chills, new or increased muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, diarrhea, or vomiting, **combined with a respiratory specimen obtained during the symptomatic period or within 4 days before or after** it that was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid amplification–based testing, either at the central laboratory or at a local testing facility (using a protocol-defined acceptable test).

So like I was saying above asymptomatic cases would not count in either arm of the study.  You needed both, symptoms and a positive test.

&gt;In the real world, only ~1/2% of those vaccinated ever turn up in a medical setting with symptoms.

This is a relatively large hedge.  ""Turning up in a medical setting"" is very different from ""knowing they have it.""  Many that would not be ""silent infections"" would also not ""turn up in a medical setting.""  Aside from my wife's positive test (which she got as a precaution before traveling), she didn't turn up in a medical setting, either.

I mean, sure, when you're defining ""failure rate"" as ""needs to go see the doctor,"" sure, I can buy a half a percent, shit for many age ranges, that's the ""failure rate"" without a vaccine.  Truckloads of people have no need to see a doctor when infected.",,,1625159309,{},h3pbapo,False,t3_obkhg4,False,True,t1_h3p793z,/r/Coronavirus/comments/obkhg4/its_time_to_rethink_onesizefitsall_approach_to/h3pbapo/,1625402894,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

By the way, I live in Indonesia and even though there is a substantial spike here, the actual evidence on the ground is fairly thin that it is being driven by Delta, but the media have been really wanting to push this angle since before the spike even started.

They found less than 200 Delta cases in Jakarta. They didn’t say how many they sequenced, but given how many people are infected there, it doesn’t seem like a very high number. This was reported as “87% of the new variants are Delta cases” Which if you focus on the percentage number sounds very scary but that’s actually not a particularly surprising or even very relevant number. One would expect the new variants to be mostly Delta. The 87% number doesn’t reflect the percentage of total infected, however I’m sure a lot of people drew that conclusion.

They fail to address the hard question ""do you trust science?"", which is different from  ""do you trust scientists? People who trust sciences, STEM, are those who have been taking more precautions. 

We live in a society where everyone feel free to have one opinion in everything. Science, on the others hand, tends to contradicts that idea by leaving space only to the experts to have an opinion on a subject. That is the real fight. That spans from STEM to economy. Social sciences in this respect are an oddity because they don't rely in mathematics or models. They don't aim to predict but to interpret a  really that has already occured, thus  indeed they could be open to debate by ""well versed non expert"", if that really exists. 

To be honest most of the conservatives, the Christian ones in particular, don't trust science because scientists are usually progressive and so they don't see a scientist but a political rival expressing an opinion, which should be open to debate accordingly.

I have seen the loss of basic knowledge and social skills with the underprivileged children, and I know not everyone is lucky enough to be mentored by me for 2 months, but I would still not send my kid to school if I had one in this situation, it's just not worth the risk.

That's where I got the 912,000 number.  I inferred the million deaths from the fact that the number was calculated using data from May 10th and earlier.  I assumed the extra 88,000 in the past month and a half.   Though could be a bit high though, honestly. There are various sources that arrive at similar conclusions over different time series. 

Relying on covid diagnosis reporting is extremely unreliable.   There are political pressures to under or over report. Lack of access to tests (especially early on).  Inconsistent requirements for asserting that covid was the cause of death.   All these factors mean that counting the number of reported deaths is not a good way to actually understand the scope.  

So to better understand the actual numbers, you need to aggregate and analyze the data. I can link to articles that explain this as well,  but if you're interested, you can Google it.

&gt;
&gt; *Next week, the Netherlands will send 150,000 vaccines to Cape Verde and deliveries to the Covax program will start.  In addition, the Netherlands will donate approximately 3 million vaccines to Indonesia.  This was decided by Minister Hugo de Jonge of Health, Welfare and Sport (VWS) in consultation with Minister Sigrid Kaag of Foreign Affairs (BZ).  With a large delivery of over one million AstraZeneca vaccines, it is now possible to provide aid to Cape Verde and start the Covax program with an initial batch of 500,000 vaccines.  The vaccines for Indonesia will follow later.*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; **Cape Verde**
&gt;
&gt; The corona situation on the Cape Verde islands is serious.  The number of daily infections is high and the pressure on hospitals is great.  The Cape Verdean government has therefore asked the Netherlands to help fight the Coronavirus.  Minister De Jonge has answered this request for help by releasing 150,000 doses of AstraZeneca for Cape Verde.
&gt;
&gt; As with Suriname, it is also important that due to the large Cape Verdean community in the Netherlands, there is a lot of traffic and contact between the Netherlands and Cape Verde.  The transport of the vaccines will be carried out together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
&gt;
&gt; In addition to the donation of vaccines to Cape Verde, the Erasmus Medical Center, the Municipality of Rotterdam and the Rotterdam Security Region will ensure that a medical aid team on the islands will support the injection.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; **Indonesia**
&gt;
&gt; The corona situation is also very serious in Indonesia, with which the Netherlands has a special relationship.  The Asian country is being hit hard by the delta variant of the virus.  During a conversation with her Indonesian colleague Retno Marsudi, Minister Kaag of Foreign Affairs therefore offered help in the form of at least 3 million vaccines.  These vaccines will be delivered later this year.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; **Covax**
&gt;
&gt; The Netherlands, in collaboration with Sweden, has now also started a donation program to Covax, the worldwide facility for access to vaccines for low and middle-income countries.  An initial quantity of 500,000 vaccines has now been made available.  This number will increase significantly in the coming weeks when deliveries for the Netherlands become available.  Ultimately, tens of millions of vaccines will be donated through Covax.

**Company emphasizes that in people 60 and younger, vaccine was 77 percent effective against moderate to severe disease**

&gt; The latest coronavirus vaccine — developed by the German firm CureVac — turned in disappointing results Wednesday, falling short of the 50 percent efficacy threshold for success defined by some regulators.

&gt; Hopes had been high for CureVac’s shots, which use messenger RNA technology similar to the highly effective Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines but comes with easier storage requirements. But the final analysis, reported in a company news release, revealed that the two-dose regimen was only 48 percent effective overall in preventing people from falling ill with at least one symptom in a trial.

&gt; CureVac laid out a possible path to salvage its vaccine, emphasizing its utility in people 18 to 60 years old. In that age group, overall efficacy was 53 percent, with much stronger protection against moderate and severe cases of illness. For people in that group, it completely protected against hospitalization and death, and offered 77 percent protection against moderate and severe disease.

&gt; The implications, if any, for other messenger RNA vaccines were unclear because of key differences between CureVac’s vaccine and earlier messenger RNA vaccines. The other mRNA vaccines used higher doses and also contained chemical modifications to the RNA. So far, the other mRNA vaccines have retained efficacy against many variants in real world and laboratory tests.

&gt; But CureVac executives argued that the results reflected the complicated context in which the vaccine was tested, with the pandemic dominated by variants, and there were no comparable clinical trials of other messenger RNA vaccines. They also pointed out that they counted even very mild cases of illness.

&gt;  “Variants may account for some of their poor efficacy, but the modified [messenger RNA] vaccines have shown good efficacy against variants,” Drew Weissman, a University of Pennsylvania scientist, wrote in an email. Weissman co-invented a method of modifying messenger RNA that is being utilized in the other mRNA vaccines.

&gt; Weissman’s research has shown that using messenger RNA without the modifications can interfere with T cells involved in developing a robust immune response.

&gt; Franz-Werner Haas, CureVac’s chief executive, said in an interview that CureVac is in discussion with the European Medicines Agency about the data, with an emphasis on the data showing the vaccine’s performance in people 18 to 60 years old. The European Commission ordered 225 million doses, with an option to buy 180 million more.

&gt;  “For that core group population, 18 to 60, this is where we can really see the benefit, this is where we are heading,” Haas said.

&gt; But with other coronavirus vaccines so far proving themselves decisively in clinical trials, CureVac’s results may pose a challenge to the world’s regulators. They will have to weigh data that fell short of expectations against the urgency to get more doses into people’s arms as variants spread. CureVac is not planning to seek emergency authorization of its vaccine in the United States.

TL;DR Delta no more deadly than Alpha

Even if I accept that 20% of severe cases lead to these long term effects (no studies have been done to my knowledge of long term effects of post-vaccinated delta variant cases) , it is only severe cases that have these long term effects.

To be clear, no 20% of infections don't lead to long term effects, nor do  20% of detected infections lead to long term effects, it's 20% of severe hospitalized cases in the un-vaccinated lead to long term effects, and that's for the alpha variant. 

Unless you have a study on Delta I'm unaware of?

Lets assume 20% of the \~4000 infection after vaccination lead to long term harm, out of the 174 million vaccinated. That's a rate of 4.6/million. Now we'll multiply by the ratio of the efficacy rates of the vaccine vs alpha vs delta variants. Call that a factor of 4.

So 18/million will suffer long term injury by infection by Delta after vaccination (a gross over estimate, but we'll go with it for now)

Israel is certainly finding that breakthrough cases happen. The good news is that they are likely to be mild. Avoiding hospitalization and death is great. But considering that even mild and asymptomatic cases can result in long covid and brain tissue loss, I’d like evidence that the vaccine prevents that before I am comfortable with masking ending.

Of the 50 new cases, 47 were domestically transmitted. Thursday marked the seventh consecutive day Taiwan has reported case totals under 100, CECC data shows.

Speaking at the CECC press briefing, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said cluster infections continue to be the focus of prevention efforts in Taiwan, though the cluster in Pingtung County caused by the Delta variant seems to be contained.

No new cases in the cluster were confirmed on Thursday, Chen said, adding that the CECC has determined how two patients in the cluster, whose infection source was previously unknown, became infected.


The two patients, a farmer and his wife, visited Fangliao General Hospital in Pingtung at the same time as another person who has also tested positive, and the two parties were in consultation rooms that were separated by only one room, said CECC official Lo Yi-chun (羅一鈞).

Although there are no surveillance cameras in the waiting area outside the rooms -- meaning that whether or not the patients conversed or sat next to each other is unknown -- Lo said the CECC has determined that it is ""highly likely"" the farmer and his wife were infected by this other patient.

The couple have no link to other people in the cluster who also visited the hospital, Lo said.

The cluster, which has recorded 15 patients to date, originated with a woman and her grandson who returned to Taiwan from Peru on June 6.


Of the 47 new domestic cases reported Thursday, 20 were in New Taipei and 18 in Taipei.

Taoyuan reported five cases, Kaohsiung two, while there was one each in Hsinchu City and Hsinchu County.

Three had unclear links to other cases, 16 are being investigated and 28 had a known source of infection, the CECC said.

The three imported cases, meanwhile, involved migrant fishermen from Indonesia and the Philippines who tested positive while in quarantine, the CECC said.


The 13 deaths reported Thursday were seven men and six women, in their 50s to 80s, who passed away between June 17 and June 30, the CECC said.
To date, Taiwan has confirmed a total of 14,853 COVID-19 cases, over 13,400 of which are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 cases in a single day since the beginning of the pandemic.
The number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths in the country has risen to 661, with all except 12 recorded since May 15, CECC data shows.

Yet this Scottish-specific study suggests we're all doomed.

I was curious what the difference was. Are Scots perhaps more susceptible to Covid than the other British nations? And when we delve into Public Health Scotland's ""report"", we find the answer: ""Cases were tagged if they attended either a EURO 2020 organised event, such as a match at Hampden or Wembley Stadium or the Fanzone at Glasgow Green, **or an informal gathering, such as a pub or a house party** to watch a match."" (my emphasis) So basically, if someone watched any Euros match with friends, and subsequently tested positive, this study linked ""football"" to their case.

Now, consider: if you take the demographic ""recently tested positive for Covid in Scotland"", and ask them ""did you watch England v Scotland with one or more friends"", the number of people answering ""no"" in that group will be very very small indeed.

The Scottish government really does seem to have been pushing the most contrarian approach throughout the whole epidemic, and now with Westminster's direction of travel clearly in favour of opening up, in my view this is just more contrarianism that doesn't help anyone.

 • Currently those fully vaccinated in the UK are older people. Older people are at a higher risk of breakthrough infections. No vaccine is 100% effective at preventing hospitalisations, but according to comprehensive study, AZ is 93% effective at preventing severe disease. That means you'd still expect to see up to 7% patients hospitalised. Since those who are at risk of being hospitalised are also the ones who are fully vaccinated, it makes sense that a significant portion of the hospitalisations are coming from that 7%.

 • while the number of cases have been on an upwards trend in the UK over the last month, hospitalisations and deaths have remained remarkably low. If vaccines do not work then we would have seen a rise. The curve is more or less flat.

Look at the graph halfway through the article. (I linked it directly earlier but Automod did not like that). Notice how, even accounting for the two week lag between cases, hospitalisations, and deaths, the curve for hospitalisations and deaths has remained flat.

An honest assessment of the data wouldn't conclude that Sweden is the bad outlier among three, but that Finland and Norway are the two outliers among the entire region.

When you exclude the places with population &lt; 1 million, Worldometers has 35 countries in Europe. Pretty much all of them wound up in the 1000 - 2000 COVID deaths per capita range. Some were a little higher on this range (Hungary, Czechia, Bulgaria) and some a little lower (Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland, Russia - although we think the latter's data is suspect).

There were basically only 4 countries that didn't look like the rest of Europe on this list - Denmark, Belarus, Finland, Norway. The latter two were especially unusual at &lt;200 deaths/capita.

Sweden ranked right in the middle of this list - #19 out of 35. It's a disingenuous argument IMO to fault them for not being like the two outliers because of cherry-picked similarities. Sweden was hit hard and heavy early in 2020, before much was well-understood, especially concerning how best to protect nursing homes. Much of their mortality came from that period. I don't think you would entertain the argument that egg should be on the faces of New York and Massachusetts (who also got hit hard and heavy early on) because they had worse COVID deaths per capita than Florida.

Using nation-wide population density to group Sweden with Norway and Finland also distorts and mischaracterizes the true level of vulnerability, i.e. the density where people actually live. The biggest metro area in Sweden (Stockholm) is a good deal denser than Oslo or Helsinki. On top of that, while Sweden's overall population density (25) is close to that of Finland (18) and Norway (15), it's also closer to countries that did way worse than Sweden like Bulgaria (64) and Bosnia (64), than any of them are to Italy (206) and the U.K. (281).

There is absolutely no way, right now, to control for the endless confounding factors and be able to say ""X country should have done better because Y country was able to"". We're years, maybe decades away from getting to that point of precision. The experts today can't do it and neither can you.

The second part is, have you listened to the podcast, besides Ivermectin, is there any credence to the other things they're discussing, and are the sources they have cited outdated or disproven, kinda like the ""vaccine and autism"" paper? 

Again, thanks for the reply, and any insight into what they said would be awesome.",,,1625150262,{},h3or2o6,False,t3_obg91g,False,False,t1_h3oovon,/r/Coronavirus/comments/obg91g/daily_discussion_thread_july_01_2021/h3or2o6/,1625392283,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It’s just like speeding. Many people speed despite the fact that their actions could and often do hurt and kill other people. They could choose not speed but still do. Most people in fact in this country do speed. Does it make them a bad person? No
