[],,califuture,,,[],,,,text,t2_da76k2e,False,False,,"I totally agree that people should get vaccinated to protect other people.  But you sound like the sooner I get vaccinated, the better I am protecting the people around me.  It is not that simple.  Even if I am only thinking of others' welfare and not my own, it makes sense for me to delay vaccination.  Here's why.

 I am in a state that the CDC is currently pacing in the lowest prevalence category.  There are 3 levels of ""minimal,"" and my state is in the lowest of the 3 levels.  That means there are very, very, very few cases of flu in my area.  My chance of catching flu right now, &amp; thus posing a risk to other people, is therefore also very, very, very low.  If I get vaccinated now I will make myself 50% less likely to catch the flu, so my chance of catching the flu will go down from tiny to extra-tiny. Meanwhile, as time passes, my immunity will decline by 10% a month.  If the flu peaks around here in, say, January, my level of protection will be down to around 10%.  That means that by the time there's a real risk of me catching the flu and passing it on, I will be almost as vulnerable to the flu as an unvaccinated person.  If there's a lot of flu around, my chance of catching and becoming contagious is pretty high, even with the old, worn-out vaccination on board.

5.1 MILLION people are confirmed dead from covid, likely millions more if you go by expected deaths vs actual deaths, and that is WITH lockdowns and massive public safety measures. 

You think it's overblown because you haven't been personally affected.

Now don’t get me wrong, everything that you have mentioned previously to another redditor does have merit, however the problem that i have against your argument regarding having cops getting vaccinated by law is that that law in particular is gonna have unintended consequences, and it’s not a good one. Why? Well let me ask you these questions: do you know how long it takes to train competent cops? Do you know how long it takes to recruit new officers to work at a particular station? Ooo and here’s the one million dollar question: if all those cops were to be fired for not complying to the mandate how long do you think it’s gonna take for the LAPD to start fully staffing competent cops who are one vaccinated, and two are willing deal with incredibly shitty people throughout the scope of their employment? Now once you find the answers to the following questions, ask yourself this: how long do you think is gonna take for LA county to realize that they have shot themselves in the foot for legislating a silly mandate that is gonna eventually lead to high crime rates? As a Californian who lives in LA county myself, that is deeply concerning for me. Yes it is important that we should get as many people vaccinated as possible but i personally think it’s a bad idea to tell people what to do with their bodies through a mandate. It gonna make people become more reluctant to get the vaccine and can make the people starting questioning their authority figure(s)’ motives for issuing the mandate in the first place. 

Also another flaw that i found with your argument is that i have been hearing from a lot of sources (word of mouth, news stations(yahoo new, msnbc, etc.) that there has been reports of people fabricating fake vaccine cards to get around the vaccine mandate. Im kind of curious if you are aware of that piece of information. 

P.S. i had to call you out stating that you like following orders because it gave me the impression that you must be the type who would follow any law, no matter how silly or unconscionable it can be to a right minded person. As a Californian myself who is fully vaccinated with moderna, i don’t like the mandate cause this can potentially lead to high crime rates throughout LA county, and law enforcement will be unable to quell the chaos all because of a dumb vaccine mandate telling you that you cannot work, dine out, or go to public places unless you are vaccinated. It’s sounds incredibly classist and discriminatory toward the people who are unvaccinated and/or towards people who choose to not get the vaccine for whatever the reason may be.

The only way a variant can effectively make vaccines not as effective is by mutating it's spike proteins. Coronsviruses have a proofread mechanism as they mutate so that the spike proteins stay relatively the same otherwise they will not be able to bind to our receptors as easily and make us sick. 

Variants can only become more contagious, so the reasons efficacy went down a tiny bit with Delta is due to us being exposed to a higher viral load thus upping the chances of it slipping by the cracks but it wasn't significant enough to be a huge impact for those double vaxxed. 

We don't need a delta specific vaccine, our current ones were designed extremely well.

Honestly, internet stranger. I mean no harm and I am just bringing up conversation, you are very passionate, and I respect that. But you also must respect that other people are passionate for their believes and of course the information surrounding COVID, this just seems like a huge battle for the morally correct!

For one, I have been to 3 major hospitals within the UK, including the cancer ward. Funnily enough I was diagnosed just before the pandemic hit. No treatment delays, and my oncologist team have been available within 48 hours if needs be.

I had my well-being specialist assigned to the COVID wards and that has been the only major downside. I have two family members also battling terminal cancers and have not seen a reduction in their care. Maybe we are lucky, but I tend not to look beyond my own circle because all that does is cause stress and anxiety.

I have done my part and got vaccinated, but even for someone like myself and the position I am in, I forgive those who select to opt away from vaccines,

To me, this shows the fragility of our care systems and how susceptible they are. In the grand scheme of things, COVID isn't a high mortality pathogen, but it does require ICU care for a lot of cases, I am not unwise to that.

But, from where I am standing your anger is better directed at those above and in charge. They let it reach this level and the incompetence surrounding the flow of money to fund hospitals and care is drastically immoral. If COVID eventually becomes another seasonable respiratory infection, which it likely will. We will probably see more cost cutting to health care systems, as they have learned short cuts and ways around treatments.

There is no conspiracy, because that would suggest it was hidden. They're doing it in plain sight.

You can go on and on (vaccinated, but ignoring masks vs unvaccinated, but observing social distancing and masks), but treating unvaccinated last is not a magical and fair solution - maybe it's more fair, but it depends on your point of view.

You mix different, compare different things. E.g.

Comparing vaccinated in NL with 87% seropositivity in Mumbai. Why not add for those in NL who got Covid already? Starting to get to the level of Mumbai. You are comparing different things. Didn't the Mumbai sero test include adults over 18? The 76% vaccinated in NL is for all people. Adult vaccinated people in NL is higher. 87%? Also Mumbay is not NL.  


You mix 7 days averages with single days averages. You more or less throw in random values, e.g. the single day 20% positive test share.

You base your 42% growth on new cases, without taking into account other factors like testing. Number of cases is not the best indicator, e.g. it does depend on number of tests.   


You could have been looking at hospitalizations, or deaths, e.g. [hospitalizations](https://coronadashboard.government.nl/landelijk/ziekenhuis-opnames) Yes, hospitalizations is lagging the cases with about a week, but since you compare since beginning of October why not use it?

He sees a threatening trend: ""With a daily increase of 10 to 30 patients due to the Covid infection alone, we no longer have that much room for improvement."" **Hesse's intensive care units could be overloaded in the next seven to ten days, he fears.** The Giessen University Clinic reported on Friday that its intensive care capacities were exhausted: **All 18 beds for Covid patients were occupied - and so were all the others.** [...] Nurse Sharon Afacan and her colleagues have long been preparing for overtime - even on the holidays. But the tension leaves its mark: ""In my private life I notice that I am now more tense and impatient."" Nevertheless, she continues to feel for her patients, she says with a view to the unvaccinated. ""Ultimately, it is people who are sick. I hope that those who survive will change something in life and think differently.""

&gt; Her colleague finds it unjust that the nursing staff has to pay for this learning process when it comes to vaccination. **""The people [Querdenker] are demonstrating for their freedom,"" she says, ""and I should give up my complete freedom and step in again and again to save the people.""** https://www.hessenschau.de/gesellschaft/covid-intensivpfleger-am-limit-es-ist-frustrierend-die-ausreden-zu-hoeren,intensivpflege-corona-100.html

Uninfected individuals cannot transmit; therefore, the vaccines are also effective at preventing transmission. There may be additional benefit, beyond that due to prevention of infection, if some of those individuals who become infected despite vaccination are also at a reduced risk of transmitting (for example, because of reduced duration or level of viral shedding). A household transmission study in England found that household contacts of cases vaccinated with a single dose had approximately 35 to 50% reduced risk of becoming a confirmed case of COVID-19. This study used routine testing data so would only include household contacts that developed symptoms and went on to request a test via pillar 2. It cannot exclude asymptomatic secondary cases or mildly symptomatic cases who chose not to request a COVID-19 test (16). Data from Scotland has also shown that household contacts of vaccinated healthcare workers are at reduced risk of becoming a case, which is in line with the studies on infection (17). Both of these studies relate to a period when the Alpha variant dominated. An analysis from the ONS Community Infection Survey found that contacts of vaccinated index cases had around 65-80% reduced odds of testing positive with the Alpha variant and 35-65% reduced odds of testing positive with the Delta variant compare to contacts of unvaccinated index cases (18).

Do you have some data showing outdoor spread is common? It's not feasible, but given how rare outdoor transmission appears to be, it seems like a unvaccinated population with no indoor contacts would have less spread than a vaccinated population with normal indoor contacts. Better ventilation in indoor spaces is an approximation of this, but it's likely a lot better than not trying.

&gt; the ""test and trace"" (which has never worked if you can't keep your borders shut)

Contact tracing is a technique for keeping low cases low and getting early warning for when they are no longer low. It can be combined with testing at borders and requiring foreigners to participate in the contact tracing system. Of course, it doesn't work very well in the United States because the general population won't go along with it for multiple reasons.

Will there still be exposure quarentines? 

Remember, hospitals threw the safety of their staff out the window completly with COVID.

Its not necessarily that nurses didn't trust the vaccine, it was that nurses didn't trust the hospital, and with damn reason. Hospitals just wanted vaccines in arms so they could drop all other safety and PTO protocols and get them back to getting abused at work as quickly as possible.

Removing bias is neither as impossible or as difficult as you make it sound. Just ask yourself: does this article leave it to the reader to form their own conclusions? Or does it form a conclusion and give it to the reader? Asking the same questions as a writer will sanity check your content so you can remove yourself from it and give only the facts.

The truth is *never* as simple as ""this person also worked with hate groups"". Adding this kind of simplified, out-of-context notation colors the whole article in a way that may or may not be truthful. Instead, just name the group and leave it to readers to form a judgment of that group. Non-news articles can and will cover that group's actions, and there will probably be some truth to both sides of the argument for people to consider in forming that judgment.

It's interesting to me that you immediately concluded I have a ""side"" based on my previous comment. This total exclusion of room for nuance is exactly the problem with modern journalism. No, it does not imply a ""side"" to simply give the facts without including some sort of value judgment. Withholding personal viewpoints from news articles is called journalistic integrity.

He looked like a cross between a young Errol Flynn and Cary Elwes (*Princess Bride*). So yeah, too good looking to be believed! He stood in the empty hallway with me clinging semi- conscious to his knees, and said, ""Well I know I'm good looking, but there's no need to grovel!"" (Corny sense of humor, though. Pity.) 

When I was finally able gasp that I was sick, he effortlessly lifted me into his arms and carried me to the student project center (a room with nothing but carpet and carpeted risers, meant for study and club meetings), and set me near the window to look at me. My jeans rode up over my ankles, and he bemusedly noticed that I didn't shave my legs. It was the middle of winter, and I was a virgin, so what did he expect?! 

A girlfriend who was as near to our school mother, a lesbian, and a staunch advocate of women's rights noticed him fondling my ankle through the window. She bustled in like a bear, yelling ""Get your hands off her! What the hell are you doing?! She's sick!"" 

My young Errol Flynn leapt off me, muttering ""I didn't know,"" and ""What could I do,"" as she loosened my collar and tested my forehead. 

""She's got a fever! Pick her up, and bring her to the nurse, like you should have in the first place!"" She wagged her finger at him: ""And I'll be watching, so don't pull any more stupidity on the way!""

My dream-boy hoisted me into his arms as I protested feverishly, and nervously carried me a football field's length across the school to the nurse's office. 

Funny, because when the nurse saw him carry me in, she said nearly the same thing with the same look as our den mother: ""Put her down!"" Apparently he was something of a Don Juan. 

Anyway, turns out I had a 103 fever, was sent home from school, and stayed home for two weeks, completely bedridden.

Truckmaker Volvo Group and carmaker Volvo Cars were both forced to stop production for several weeks, not because of conditions in Sweden but due to lack of parts and difficulties in their supply chains elsewhere in Europe.”

https://www.ft.com/content/93105160-dcb4-4721-9e58-a7b262cd4b6e

“The global shortage of semiconductors will have a substantial impact on the Volvo Group’s production in the second quarter. In the beginning of the quarter, the Group will implement stop days across its global truck manufacturing operations. In total, these are currently estimated to between two and four weeks depending on production site. In addition, disturbances are also expected to impact the Group’s other business areas.”

[],,helembad,,,[],,,,text,t2_s0xb5,False,False,[],"The Berlin virologist Christian Drosten criticises the claim that the poor Corona situation is due to the unvaccinated. He puts forward a different thesis.

Berlin - Time and again, politicians speak of a ""pandemic of the unvaccinated"". World Medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery recently even warned . Behind this is the accusation that mainly vaccination refusers contribute to the bad Corona situation - and are also responsible for tightened measures. Berlin virologist Christian Drosten disagrees: ""We don't have a pandemic of the unvaccinated, we have a pandemic,"" he stresses. There is a pandemic ""to which everyone contributes - including the vaccinated, albeit somewhat less"".

Drosten sees a core problem in the fact that the existing vaccinations can only withstand the delta variant of the coronavirus to a limited extent. ""After two or three months, the spread protection of the vaccination begins to decline,"" he says. Older people in particular had already been vaccinated in the spring, he adds. ""They are now gradually losing their spread protection, and they are becoming more and more so,"" Drosten says. A second problem, however, actually has to do with the fact that there are a larger number of unvaccinated people. Among those over 60, the rate of fully vaccinated people is 86 per cent, he said. ""That is insane, that is really dangerous,"" Drosten continues. 

Drosten: Booster campaign could prevent worse things from happening

A possible way out of the worsening pandemic situation
. ""What we could do now would be to carry out a booster campaign with great vigour, a campaign for third-party vaccinations among all those who have already been vaccinated, starting with the elderly,"" says Drosten. In this way, it might be possible to guarantee herd protection for the duration of the winter. Ideally, both would succeed: boosting and closing existing vaccination gaps. But the question remains how many people will go along with it. 

Drosten: Demands for more tests are unrealistic

There are not many other options:
Drosten considers this unrealistic. And for a noticeable testing effect, ten million tests per week would be needed, as in the spring. For lack of alternatives, Drosten says, we will have to resort to contact-restricting measures again. He does not know whether this is legally tenable. What would then remain would ultimately be a lockdown for the unvaccinated. ""Whether this will reduce the incidence in November - I have my doubts,"" says Drosten.

Sagging trust in institutions, politicization of vaccines and the rising of racist scum from the rocks they hid under, all are vastly helped along by the slow, but obvious fall of representative democracies as a beacon of hope for an eventual end of poverty. It's not only when it comes to stopping certain aspects of Biden's agenda, that QOPers and corporate Democrats appear to be on the same side. That's just an expression of their shared belief, that democracy doesn't need to work out for the many.

 Allowing that to happen, allowing that to go on for decades now, it's tantamount to a betrayal of the very idea of Democracy, while simultaneously and with no observable shame proudly standing up to the world's public and declaring the US to be the guiding light of it. It's not only American democracy, that's suffering as a result. We're watching the death throes of an age here. The contagion of this pandemic of the mind is the undue influence of money on politics - a phrase that apparently has replaced the term corruption, when we're talking about the US and its allies, that is the byproduct of historically unparalleled income and wealth inequality. 

A large part of that wealth was and still is accumulated by the exploitation of natural resources with wanton disregard for future generation and even the habitability of the planet. There is no ethical justification for it, there is no scientific justification for it. And thus, ethics and science themselves already have a target on their back, while simultaneously being glorified by people who're working to the same ends from a different angle. The common denominator here is distraction from the game itself, the common goal to keep the money flowing. 

It's common knowledge that big corporate donors mostly hedge their bets. While that's true enough, it might be time to realize that nevertheless they're all funding the same system. Common people ending up as collateral damage is par for the course, the only thing that has changed is that damage not being exported to some hellhole of a country far, far away. No need to, not anymore, when the reality of the situation even in the most wealthy nations mostly just amounts to stuff to post on r/ABoringDystopia for many, if not most. 

Opinions like those expressed in the comment I'm replying to are all fine and dandy, but they fail to address this root cause and it's symptomatic. Precisely because it's obvious and ubiquitous, it gets censored out already in the mind of the speaker the second somebody comments in public. It's a sort of deference to a failing system, just as much as it is too frightening a prospect to contemplate. The ending of an age, I said. The ending of the age when democracy, capitalism and science were so closely linked, that it was easy to delude yourself into thinking that it can't be any other way. 

It's death throes we're watching, the question is which organs can be donated to the future and it's becoming more and more obvious how that's boiling down to a 'choose two out of three at best' situation. The QOPers have chosen just one, corporate democrats have opted for electric shocks to keep the corpse wiggling. If there's any hope left, it's with those who choose a new democracy in alliance with science and are willing to let go of the notion that capitalism needs to be in that mix somehow. It's nonsensical, when it's blatantly obvious, that the riches acquired by capitalism get invested in the dismantling of democracy and the denunciation of science all too easily.",,,,1636957596,{},hkow3yr,False,t3_qtwjst,False,True,t1_hkmr6w9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qtwjst/analysis_flu_shots_uptake_is_now_partisan_it/hkow3yr/,1637263616.0,-2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was merely giving you MY personal take on this situation and how people decide for themselves, this is for both pro and anti vax, I have no problem with either because of how I view the situation.

Post after post focuses on the DEATHS, it is always the deaths. Because 5 million is a big number. But objectively speaking, focusing on the infected and expected recovered, we have done exceptional well. Lockdowns and public health measures have helped, there is no doubting that. But this is why people will roll the dice because the risk is minimal to THEMSELVES. This is what I meant by selfish and why it is also selfish to force limitations into the people that make this decision.

That’s why I thought it was important to give my own perspective because you have people who think differently to you, this shouldn’t be punished and basic human rights should not be void because of it.

Couple the fatalism with a realistic outlook on life and death, and the vaccine becomes somewhat untrustworthy, or null because it is worth the risk without.

No amount of science and proof of the vaccines safety will adjust people’s selfish outlook, and sometimes that’s okay? Even with other people’s lives on the line.

Because when things actually get serious, people will only look out for themselves and those closest around them. This entire situation validates the true megalomaniacs from either side of the pond. 

But my entire point boils down to this, we have people that prefer a natural approach and things to unravel without intervention. It’s not possible to say, but if a worldwide poll was to be taken, I think we’d all be shocked by the percentage that would allow COVID to rip through communities and let the deaths pile up. Who knows the numbers but this is why it mostly acceptable to be without the vaccine for some. 

Let’s say 40/50 million people die if we continued as normal, no lockdowns and no public restrictions. Herd immunity is strong and we come out the other side. That’s a 0.6% loss to society and some people find that more tantalising than trusting a freshly made vaccine. It’s something alien and people have a hard time trusting material being pumped in to their body.

Just a personal opinion at the end of the day, and I decided that I would like to minimise the risk to others and also to myself knowing my current health. 

People should never have their decision over their own health removed. Because this is just a softer approach to that, it will spiral and enforcement will get worse, and that validates a lot of anti vax folk.

Breaking it down this way makes it easier to understand anyone’s individual decision.

We have arrived to the point where people are losing their rights because they dont want to consent to a certian form of a medical procedure. The only harsher measure that exists is a state mandated vaccination without the consent of individuals. Getting vaccinated is a personal choice! Or at least it should have been. 

Why take away the most basic rights? Like people are some children that understand only ""do this, or else the punishment will come"". Do the executive and legislative branches of goverment think the people enjoy this crisis? Repression, repression and more and more repression. 

The average age of people who die because of coronavirus is higher than the average life expectancy in several EU countries! And saying that young people die too is entirely correct but young people also die from all kinds of other diseases or accidents that are preventable, but for example, state will not mandate a obligatory alcohol test before driving a car or outright ban the sale of alcohol. And rightly so, everyone makes his own decisions and the state shouId not be telling people all the time what to do! 

I dont want to be rude or blunt but there always has to be space for basic human rights, right? Restricting the personal freedom and the freedom of movement along with the right to work should be the last possible measure that is taken. Prison its the last possible measure for criminal offenders exactly because it takes away your freedom of movement and to an extent s lot of other rights. Last possible measure!

I realise that getting vaccinated is the best solution to keep people from dying, having the worst symptoms, infecting others, keeping hospitals from collapsing and so on but do we really need to force people into doing it by taking away their most basic rights? 

Why does the state has the urge to be opressive so directly, if they could just mandate, that in case of maximum capacity in the hospitals, vaccinated people will take priority or unvaccinated will have to foot the whole bill of the hospital visit or some shit like that? 

Everyone should have a choice how to live and what to do. Vulnerable groups are just that- vulnerable. It pains me to say it but that is, to an extent, their problem. And de facto locking people up for the sake of protecting the vulnerable group is nonsensical. People should discover in themselves and trough others the obligation towards those, not being forced to it or they will never learn. 

Before you tag me as an antivaxxer, I am vaccinated but only because I chose to do it. I hate being ill, I love my (elder) relatives and friends, I miss hanging out with people, travelling, going to sports matches and I believe that getting vaccinated is the best way to do it. But not in this kind of manner when a state, the very entity that is the guardian of all of its people is forcing something upon them, threatening with dire consequences if they dont do something just because they said so. I believe that kind of mentality is ill fated and can be catastrophic in certian cases. 

Educate, not punish the people for their ignorance.

&gt; **Less than ten percent of the available beds are still free [in Hesse].** In the Rhine-Main area and in the Odenwald it is particularly scarce, says Andreas Schäfer from the Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine. He sees a threatening trend: ""With a daily increase of 10 to 30 patients due to the Covid infection alone, we no longer have that much room for improvement."" **Hesse's intensive care units could be overloaded in the next seven to ten days, he fears.** The Giessen University Clinic reported on Friday that its intensive care capacities were exhausted: **All 18 beds for Covid patients were occupied - and so were all the others. [...]** Nurse Sharon Afacan and her colleagues have long been preparing for overtime - even on the holidays. But the tension leaves its mark: ""In my private life I notice that I am now more tense and impatient."" Nevertheless, she continues to feel for her patients, she says with a view to the unvaccinated. ""Ultimately, it is people who are sick. I hope that those who survive will change something in life and think differently.""

&gt; Her colleague finds it unjust that the nursing staff has to pay for this learning process when it comes to vaccination. **""The people [Querdenker] are demonstrating for their freedom,"" she says, ""and I should give up my complete freedom and step in again and again to save the people.""**

That people would go on board with restrictions for the vaccinated is a NoCovid myth or wishful thinking.

Also, since you copied this twice, I'll copy my answer from the other thread for the record.

&gt; So even now, half of the population finds current measures sufficient or too strong. Meanwhile the other half includes a LOT of different measures including 2G and mandatory vaccination (the latest ZDF poll even specifically asked about them as possible stronger measures as well). I, for one, would vote for stronger measures because I'd support 2G everywhere and 3G on the workplace, and ideally the vaccination mandate.

&gt; Another recent poll detalizes possible measures. Restrictions for the vaccinated are not even specified in the list, and only 10% polled want ""other"" measures which _could_ or could not include them. https://politik.watson.de/deutschland/exklusiv/458956143-umfrage-grosse-mehrheit-wirft-bundesregierung-vor-zu-wenig-gegen-corona-zu-tun",,,,1636975440,{},hkpi5fa,False,t3_qtovo2,False,True,t1_hknbw4a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qtovo2/antivaxxers_and_politicians_push_germany_to_the/hkpi5fa/,1637277290.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The corona numbers continue to rise - where are the hotspots? New data from the Luca app provide clues. A part of the gastronomy should not be happy about that.



Almost three quarters of all corona warnings from the health authorities in Germany that were generated from the Luca app system went to visitors to bars and clubs. This emerges from an anonymous evaluation for October, in which over 181,000 warning messages were analyzed. Warning notices via app and calls to users of the app by the health department were recorded.

Almost half of the warnings concerned clubs: 49.1 percent,
almost a quarter of bars: 23.2 percent.

Restaurants, culture and sports are not likely to be corona hotspots

In contrast, comparatively few warning messages were sent to restaurant guests. They received 10.9 percent of all warning messages.
Almost 9 percent of the warnings went to the visitors of events and festivals.
Retailers (1.0 percent), cinemas (1.7 percent) and theaters, museums and cultural institutions (together 0.9 percent) hardly played a role. The areas of sport (0.8 percent) and fun / swimming pools (0.6 percent) also did not turn out to be hotspots.

The Luca app is intended to replace the mess of paper that would result from an analogue recording of visitor contact details. This contact recording is required by law in most federal states. It cannot be done by the federal corona warning app, which anonymously records dangerous risk encounters. In addition to Luca, apps such as eGuest or Vida also offer contact recording.
Luca app continues to be criticized by data protection experts

With the help of the Luca system, the health authorities can choose between two different levels when making contact. On the one hand, users can be informed digitally about a general risk of infection. If there were several people at a location recorded with the Luca app who later tested positive for the coronavirus, the health authorities can also issue a targeted infection warning and point the people at risk to test centers in the area.

The Luca app has been criticized by data protectionists primarily because of a concept of central data storage. In addition, the use in the health authorities is very different, since some responsible people doubt the effectiveness of the Luca system.
Hamburg is the pioneer in use. Almost 69,000 warning messages were triggered there by the health department in November alone.",,,,1636974421,{},hkpgvjy,True,t3_que13b,False,False,t3_que13b,/r/Coronavirus/comments/que13b/corona_hotspots_luca_app_often_warns_after_going/hkpgvjy/,1637276299.0,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Idk either. Everything around covid is highly emotionalized, many hard fronts. Even when i list official health committees advice and give the source, if its unpopular i get downvotes. But its more important to be accurate than popular. For example WHOs advice to rather give first shots to poor countries than to booster 30yo in rich countries is very unpopular here (in some groups) or to still mask up even if vaccinated if incidence is high.

The bureaucratic difficulties are very high even for native speakers. It is my strong opinion that without vaccination sites, in a scenario where only GPs vaccinate, i wouldnt have gotten my shot anywhere close to the time i got it. My mum even had to go to the GP 3 times to get her flu shot because the lady at the front desk was ill informed.

As you suggest, the decline in childhood vaccinations has multiple causes. 

In 2020 and early 2021, we had a drop in childhood vaccinations primarily due to lack of access to care. People who lost their jobs also lost their health insurance; many also moved or became homeless. At the same time, the number of patients pediatric practices could see dropped because of the need to keep everyone distanced and isolated. Many free clinics that provided services for at-risk populations closed because of budget cuts or pandemic restrictions. 

About needles: Every conceivable medical supply has been out of stock somewhere at some point in the pandemic, but thankfully, standard hypodermic needles have not been a big problem. 

[There is a special ""low dead space syringe"" that's very helpful in squeezing a sixth dose out of the nominally five-dose Pfizer vaccine vials.](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/11/966712940/short-on-syringes-japan-may-waste-millions-of-pfizer-vaccine-doses) Those special syringes have been in short supply everywhere since the start of 2021. 

There have also been supply chain issues with certain types of the sterile glass vials used to store vaccines; thankfully that hasn't been a big problem for childhood vaccines in the USA because they don't need the cryo-vials used for extremely low temperature storage.  The childhood vaccines are also enormous production runs with multi-year supply contracts, which helped.",,,,1636944302,{},hko7ypq,False,t3_qtwjst,False,False,t1_hknm7wr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qtwjst/analysis_flu_shots_uptake_is_now_partisan_it/hko7ypq/,1637249221.0,20,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Making a delta-specific vaccine might be useful for places where people are still having a hard time getting their first dose. But the places that Pfizer and Moderna make the most money from, most people who want a vaccine have it, so boosters are the only relevant part. 

Another thing they might be able to do a Delta specific shot with slightly lower the dosage to improve safety while maintaining effectiveness against Delta. So I wouldn't rule out a Delta variant  specific as being useless, but getting as much safety data on it as we have with the other mRNA vaccines is impossible. 

There might also the concern that if you get vaccinated with a Delta-specifc vaccine and a super Delta comes out, you might not be able to get booster for that so easily if the Delta antibodies are effectiveish (similar to how people who get the flu vaccine every year may have weaker protection in a given year where the flu only changes a little compared to someone who only got a flu shot that year specific for that stain).

A lockdown will be done for the *first time* in USA eventually.  

Taking a vacation for 2 weeks is healthy.  If we plan ahead for it there is no reason people cannot have supplies stockpiled.  We could, for example, plan on starting July 4th 2023.  Could be over for 99% of counties by Monday July 17th 2023.

With a thorough mass testing campaign small towns and counties could quarantine as a group.  We can pick up and drop off trailers without the driver making contact with anyone.  So we can barricade the roads but open them briefly for caravans of tractor trailers.  At state lines drivers can switch trailers right on the interstate.  Emergency services will need to train a double redundant team.  The lockdown crew quarantines the 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after.  

For most people it takes 2 weeks of relaxation (or telecommuting).  Compare that to getting vaccinated every year from 2025 to 2045.  That adds up to 20 days of feeling sick and sore.

The vaccine makes you less likely to get infected. If you are infected, it makes it less likely for you to develop symptoms. If you develop symptoms, it makes those symptoms less harmful.

Because you are less likely to a) get infected, b) stay ill for long, and c) cough around a lot in the meantime, you are also less likely to infect others.

However, if you *are* infected, you *can* infect others.

Also, a classic example of Bayes’ theorem in action: if more people are vaccinated, the ratio of vaccinated people in hospitals will increase. That doesn’t mean the vaccine doesn’t work. It’s like saying: most people getting injured in car accidents were wearing their seatbelts, so clearly seatbelts don’t help.

It's pointless to spend most of our effort on attempting to reach the 18% that NOPE out of vaccination.  You have MORE vaccinated people now than unvaccinated.  The most effective thing we can do is to make sure those that are vaccinated are completely out of the equation in terms of getting sick or transmitting.  That's easy AF to achieve because those people have no problem getting boosted.  You're going to have far better results taking 70% of people out of the equation completely by brining their VE against infection up to 95% (from 50-70) than reaching maybe 1-2% of those 18% who will not get vaccinated under any circumstances.

This entire conversation is dumb AF.  All blame should be on Tedros who started the crusade on boosters right after Biden's administration put forth a boosting plan.  Subsequently boosters were torpedoed by the FDA and CDC.  They can bullshit us all they want about lack of data, but the data was clearly there.  Israel were the only ones that gave 0 fucks and did the right thing.  Look at them sitting pretty at 0.5% positivity rate now.  Last week the FDA asked Pfizer to refile and boosters are likely to get authorized for everyone shortly.

Of course the entire freaking hoopla, mixed messaging, and infighting in the scientific community over vaccine efficacy against infection/spread...  The usual day late and dollar short approach that has been plaguing us since the pandemic began.

This study makes very weird choices.  To my eye, choices that are bad enough that I find it difficult to understand how it made it through review.

(1)  In their country study, they're looking at confirmed case rates in a particular week and comparing that to vaccination rates.  But this would mostly be measuring whether a country was before, during, or after its delta-related surge.

(2)  Their analysis of US counties is just a boxplot and bar chart.  Why aren't they including some manner of actual analysis that can generate an estimate of statistical discernibility?

(3)  Even if we treat using figures instead of analysis as acceptable, the figures of the US counties show what appears to my eye to be an obvious downward slope -- relatively highly-vaccinated counties are doing better.  Frankly, I think this is why they're not showing any estimates of statistical discernibility here.

(4)  Their analyses of countries and counties don't weight by population size, which means low-population countries/counties are over-represented in the data.  Low-population countries/counties are inevitably going to have noisier levels of both vaccination rates and covid.

(5)  They're reporting percent of counties that had an increase.  Why? This is dumb.

In many countries the traditional 70% has been reached for herd immunity - but it’s not enough. Also, in the UK health security report, they are showing that seropositivity for COVID antibodies (whether post-infection or post vaccine - though they can distinguish between the two) is over 96% of the adult population. Yet case numbers are high. I’m beginning to think herd immunity is simply not possible with this virus (like it isn’t with the common cold) unless we manage to vaccinate everybody - from babies to those medically exempted. If anyone is left uncovered, variants can and will form and continue to infect people. And variants can surely form amongst the vaccinated who do get infected and sick, right?

To simplify a lot: If a vaccine, say, halves the chance of becoming infected, but things like opening up of the society makes one 10 times more exposed to the virus, the end result is that one is 5 times more likely to get infected. The reason we don't see such fivefold numbers is cos the vaccines are more likely to result in asymptomatic infections, which means less testing.

Also while vaccines may halve the probability of infection, it doesn't mean the probability in any given exposure drops from 65% to 15%, but something like from 2% to 1%, or in long time exposure something like from 21% to 11% (the Dutch study of spread within households).

Many other factors make a bigger difference. The seasonal variation alone was huge already before the vaccinations.

der Impfschutz nicht mehr so belastbar ist, schon nach

I am NOT saying don’t get vaccinated, even if you’ve had covid (hybrid immunity is incredibly potent), but it’s not doing anyone any favors to understate how long natural immunity lasts either. 

It is also worth noting that vaccine immunity tends to produce a more consistent immune response than natural immunity as well. Both tend to last at least 6 months.

Some people are under the impression once vaccinated they dont have to care anymore. For them everyone unvaccinated is stupid or an antivaxxer. They exclude people whos immune system doesnt work properly, heavy burden on hospitals once the incidence is high, which will cause even vaccinated, who need ICU for other reasons to suffer. The matter is more complicated than black n white. Europe is an current example of what unfortunately happens with low vaccination rate and indoor activities under delta. Obviously some measures like using masks for everyone seems reasonable while putting ""lockdown"" on unvaccinated while vaccinated have more freedoms, as currently on plan in germany, it depends on incidence, hospitalisations etc. The vaccinated can not be excluded from infection chains albeit they play a smaller role.

I recommend reading the comments here: https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/py05pd/no_significant_difference_in_viral_load_between/

Your post is known and heavily discussed. While viral load is similar it has to be said that vaccinated people less often get infected, are infected for a shorter time and less often show symptoms. If you cough you obviously transmit more viruses.
This study can be interpreted that vaccinated can be a risk for the unvaccinated in a mixxed setting where only the unvaccinated are tested but both have access. They then may be infected, less likely, but still, from the vaccinated. However the vaccinated are less likely to infect, to get infected and to get severily ill.

My point that case data matters and it should be collected and made transparent.  The best policy choices to make based on that data is another matter.  

WRT that, you’re right that most cases in vaccinated people are mild but if we had stopped tracking we wouldn’t now appreciate the value of boosters.

Then the monumentally grotesque decision to say people should be denied boosters for ""mild"" infections, even though getting knocked on your ass for a week plus long covid plus transmission was a damn good reason to allow that for a vaccine as safe as these.

And what ""message"" it sent to delusional antivaxxers claiming boosters would make them not get first shots... There was a single internet poll and they took that as gospel. That was completely nonmedical and shouldn't have been part of the decision *at all*. Same for global vaccine equity, which very much drove the decisions of some of them.
