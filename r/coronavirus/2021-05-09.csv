The resident, who had already received his two doses of vaccine, was nevertheless infected.


A patient from a nursing home in Borsbeek (province of Antwerp), who had already received his two doses of the vaccine, died after being infected with the Indian variant. The information has been confirmed by the Flemish Health Agency.


The death occurred in the Compostela nursing home in Borsbeek, where two patients were infected with this Indian variant. One of these two patients, who was considered by doctors to be fragile, did not survive.


After this death, the mayor decided to quarantine the nursing home. ""It is not known through whom these residents were infected with this Indian variant. We are still carrying out checks. For virologists, it is not easy to give an answer because all the residents have been vaccinated"" , underlines Dis Van Berckelaer, mayor of Borsbeek.


Virologist Marc Van Ranst reacted. ""In the first wave, there was a peak of 100 deaths per day in nursing homes. We are currently down to less than one per day. It is thanks to the vaccination,"" he said. on the waves of VRT.


And the virologist stressed the value of vaccination: ""It may not be 100% effective, but we are not far from that threshold.""


As Mr Van Ranst admits, vaccination may be less effective against some variants. ""The figures show that the Indian variant is perhaps 15% more contagious than the English variant, which itself was more contagious than the original virus.""",,,1620604233,{},gxjvzg6,True,t3_n8qtiz,False,False,t3_n8qtiz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n8qtiz/a_death_due_to_the_indian_variant_in_a_nursing/gxjvzg6/,1620640180,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

Using my dad as an example, he was set to get the JNJ shot in early April. After that was canceled he is only this week getting his Pfizer dose. I had to really pry to get him to take off work for the JNJ dose and after that fell through he is only now getting the Pfizer/Moderna vaccine now that it is readily available through walk-ins.

It's a complicated issue.

However, it's also extremely obvious that many political leaders are completely ignoring anything that scientists say and making their own plans to do whatever they want.  As a result, I don't have much faith for example in Texas where I live because I know many political decisions are being made in bad faith.

&gt; Efficacy is the degree to which a vaccine prevents disease, and possibly also transmission, under ideal and controlled circumstances ‚Äì comparing a vaccinated group with a placebo group. Effectiveness meanwhile refers to how well it performs in the real world. (First paragraph)

https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section6.html

&gt; Vaccine efficacy/effectiveness is interpreted as the proportionate reduction in disease among the vaccinated group. So a VE of 90% indicates a 90% reduction in disease occurrence among the vaccinated group, or a 90% reduction from the number of cases you would expect if they have not been vaccinated. (Section 6.2 paragraph 4)

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00075-X/fulltext

&gt; Rather, a 95% vaccine efficacy means that instead of 1000 COVID-19 cases in a population of 100‚Äà000 without vaccine (from the placebo arm of the abovementioned trials, approximately 1% would be ill with COVID-19 and 99% would not) we would expect 50 cases (99¬∑95% of the population is disease-free, at least for 3 months) (Paragraph 2). 



So yes I stand by what I stand your paragraph here: 

&gt; If you're vaccinated with, let's say, CoronaVac (Sinovac) you get 67% protection against symptomatic Sars-Cov-II, so in the 33% of cases that you do get the rona and become symptomatic you have good chances of having the mild inconvenience of being sick for a few days or a week, but those unvaccinated people close to you can still catch the rona from you, and be put in serious danger.

Is factually wrong or horrifyingly worded. I have no idea which is which, but the interpretation it gives is that each people are protected by 67% and they have a 33% of catching the disease every time they get in contact with the virus. 

Again, this is wrong because this is not how immunity works. Vaccine efficacy/effectiveness is a statistical tool measuring immunity across a population. The chance that people develop immunity following a vaccine within the time period measured. 

The difference between efficacy and effectiveness is simply the control and where the observation was conducted. Efficacy -&gt; controlled trials  whereas effectiveness is within the general population and is not controlled.",,,1620656433,{},gxlznum,False,t3_n8sgw5,False,True,t1_gxlvpql,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n8sgw5/to_mask_or_not_to_mask_with_vaccines_and_new/gxlznum/,1620685212,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It's not possible, at least not in the current climate.  But for the people who are hesitant that DO have that baseline understanding, better explanation might make a difference.

Someone is trying to explain it to you instead of saying it can't be explained to you so just do it.

I agree with you - people need to trust science and come to the conclusion that when the experts are all agreeing, we need to listen and trust. When my mechanic tells me my intake manifold is cracked, I do not demand to see it, I don't demand an explanation of what it is, its function in my car and how it cracked in the first place - but my mechanic does explain it a little to me anyway - I listen to what I can understand, nod along politely when he starts going into details I can't follow and ultimately tell him ""do what you need to - here's my credit card!"" I couldn't fix it if I had him and 10 other mechanics around me walking me through it, ""here is what you owe me"" is literally the only information I actually need! lol - but a little explanation makes the price tag feel a bit better! Its depressing that this is a more common scenario than people trusting scientists! But right now the understanding that science should be trusted does not exist for so many people.  I am hoping (naively and obnoxiously optimistically) that when people see for themselves that science was right and this vaccine is safe and effective, they may be more open to trusting science.

Overall I think that a lot of good will was lost with the CDC last year.  Remember how confusing their discussions of mask-wearing were at the beginning of the pandemic?  How about the recent information where the CDC admitted that COVID can be airborne?  Even if someone pays attention to the science it's hard to know just how much of an actual risk things are.  As a result, I can understand people being extremely cautious with their kids.  It's going to take time for a lot of people to become more comfortable with reducing precautions.  I don't mind getting a stinkeye every once in a while if I'm unmasked in a park.

Now we're stuck with impossible choices. Example: my roommate and the family whose young kids I babysit are separately going on week-long vacations out of state soon. Some of them are vaccinated. But to my understanding, with the vaccine, you can still catch any strain of the virus; you'll just be asymptomatic. So any of them could catch the virus, come home, inevitably be in close contact with me, after incubation either have symptoms or more likely not, and by then I would have no way to avoid catching it and spreading it to my parents, whom it could easily kill. This isn't an unusual situation. We have a whole country full of similar problems. Just getting groceries is a risk for a lot of people. Wearing a mask isn't that difficult.

* You can gather indoors with fully vaccinated people without wearing a mask or staying 6 feet apart.
* You can gather indoors with unvaccinated people of any age from one other household (for example, visiting with relatives who all live together) without masks or staying 6 feet apart, unless any of those people or anyone they live with has an [increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html).
* You can gather or conduct activities outdoors **without** wearing a mask except in certain crowded settings and venues.
* If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.
* You need to pay close attention to [the situation at your international destination](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/map-and-travel-notices.html)¬†before traveling outside the United States.
   * You do NOT need to get tested **before** leaving the United States unless your destination requires it.
   * You still need to [show a negative test result](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-international-air-travelers.html)¬†or documentation of recovery from COVID-19 **before** boarding an international flight to the United States.
   * You should still get tested 3-5 days **after** international travel.
   * You do NOT need to self-quarantine **after** arriving in the United States.
* If you‚Äôve been around someone who has COVID-19, you do not need to stay away from others or get tested unless you have symptoms.
   * However, if you live in a group setting (like a correctional or detention facility or group home) and are around someone who has COVID-19, you should still get tested, even if you don‚Äôt have symptoms.

""

So basically no masks outdoors unless in a crowded venue, and no masks indoors with other vaxxed people or with one unvaxxed household.

Combined with the article talking about further relaxing just feeds into my point about the risk profile changing favourably to relax mask mandates. 

But don't worry, you can still wear your mask for much longer.

&gt;The primary efficacy analysis included **symptomatic COVID-19** in seronegative participants with a nucleic acid amplification test-positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine.

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32661-1/fulltext

And the US trial didn't regularly sample anyone, and it still had a markedly lower efficacy than the mRNA vaccines. 

The real answer is probably a combo of factors. Different trials have slightly different definitions of symptomatic COVID, so it's possible that AZ's trials allowed more barely symptomatic cases to be included in the analysis, which would tend to depress the efficacy slightly. And AZ is probably better with a longer interval, which wasn't specifically trialed (though there were some post hoc subgroups that showed that it might be a better option), so the shorter interval being used would tend to drag down the trial efficacy as well. And probably most importantly, most of the real-world analysis is based on one dose; so it's totally possible that AZ and the mRNA vaccines are fairly equivalent after 1 dose, but the 2nd dose of the mRNA vaccines brings the efficacy up in the to 90+% range, whereas AZ stays a bit lower.

Nobody is debating the effectiveness of masks, particularly as a tool for the UNvaccinated. However, there is very much a question of their necessity for those who are vaccinated. We know that vaccines result in extraordinarily high protection against illness and even initial infection. Even with breakthrough infections, viral loads are so minor that the odds of transmission or significant illness are extremely low. Combine that with the community impact of having 60+% of adults vaccinated and even more immune after previous natural infection, and you‚Äôre looking at an entirely different picture than before vaccinations started. It‚Äôs one in which masks don‚Äôt make a meaningful difference.

Your argument is rooted in an unfounded distrust of vaccines. Their effectiveness is a monumental breakthrough in medicine. It‚Äôs critical that we are all clear that vaccines can and will end the pandemic. That will happen as quickly as we can get people vaccinated.

* Those same states have begun declining the bulk of their vaccine allocation, which I understand as further evidence that they don't have arms in which to put those doses
* Moreover, the ""number of people with one shot"" seems to be catching up to the ""number of people fully vaccinated"", again implying that they're running out of new people wanting the shot

Assuming that there isn't some other factor here (I dunno, like a substantial number of people just waiting until June to get vaccinated for some reason), this leads me to think they're going to be left with a substantial population without any immunity.

I applied the same thinking to New England and California, places where they have vaccinations levels in the 50% range and climbing. That suggests they'll have relatively few people without any immunity.

2, there are many different levels and types of risk. The risk of covid is both at a far higher level--there were periods during the winter surge when it was ***the #1 killer*** of Americans--and a different type, because it is uniquely preventable.

Since the spike protein is what makes covid as contagious as it is, that seems unlikely. Additionally, coronaviruses mutate at a slower pace than something like the flu. Also, all data that we have shows natural and vaccination-induced immunity for coronaviruses to be very robust. For example, there are people who still have immunity from SARS in 2003. Finally, here in the US, we will have booster shots this fall for the most-worrisome variants that have cropped up so far.

As for the cars thing, people frequently make that comparison because they assume that everyone must agree that the risks of driving outweigh the benefits.

Additionally, medical and pharmacological research in the US has historically been focused on the outcomes of white people so black people sometimes have worse outcomes with the exact same treatment. Doctors and researchers have become aware of this and changes are happening, but the distrust still lingers especially for older black Americans. This is also true for research in fields outside of medicine.

After doing so, you can choose to make an appointment to get the vaccine. You state the city and the vaccination centre you wish to go to. After that, you are either put on a waiting list if there are a lot of people ahead of you, and after you get your turn (or the centre had enough room so no waiting list) you are asked to choose a date and time (you can only select a date and time when there is enough room). You can also add other people on your account, say, your grandma, so you don't have to create a separate account just for her.

Gyms shut for some activities. But we can still eat out, shop, work in the office if there are only 50% there. 

The cases we have are all clusters around the imported cases in airports and the quarantine hotels and from the maritime ports. 

Clusters are so far all linked cases after a day or two. So fingers crossed no silent random cases in the community. 

The big issue is our huge reliance on the workers we fly in and out of India. The Indian variant has caused three clusters and seems to be very infectious. We have had at least six cases where the fully vaccinated have caught it in the covid hospitals and from contact in the airports, with some of those symptomatic. So that is very concerning. Last week we shut the border to India somewhat and increased SHN to three weeks. But the country simply can‚Äôt run without the cheap Labour. 

If our travel was with a less out of control region we would be looking at opening up to travel bubbles as the vaccine rolls out. So far we have around 30% vaccinated and most with both doses. I don‚Äôt think hesitancy is that much of an issue. The roll out is slow because we cant get enough vaccines to do it quicker. We did not order AZ so as fully Pfizer and Moderna. We have a big shipment of Sinovac sitting in a warehouse as it is still not approved and it is unlikely it will be as efficacy is considerably down.

All of these proteins are going to be existing together in moving fluid and each will have a different affinity for binding with each other. For the virus to survive it needs to have high affinity binding between the spike and ACE2 in order to attach to cells and be taken up. For the immune system, they need to have a high affinity binding between antibodies and the spike protein to prevent the virus from being able to bind ACE2. The actual neutralization of the virus is going to be a complex process that depends on concentrations of antibodies, viral load, etc etc. 

In general though each individual antibody has a short sequence (or protein conformation) that it recognizes to a very high specificity and affinity. This means that small changes have the potential to greatly effect antibody binding since they are made to be so specific. This is protected against though by generating polyclonal responses to a lot of epitopes and also the process of somatic hypermutation where antibodies are selected to mutate to higher affinities. On the other hand receptors typically will recognize larger regions of proteins to varying affinities, and their function may or may not depend on how tightly the receptor binds to its target. In this case, ACE2 is an entry receptor, meaning the main necessity for the virus is to attach to the cell, this may be able to happen at a lower affinity and therefore be more protected from mutation. Remember as well that mutations can improve binding to the receptor as we have seen with variants like B.1.1.7 which can also impact antibody binding (though it doesn't look like that happened with that variant) because they are more sequence dependent than the receptor is.

Basically, the answer is that it is a complex process and definitely cannot be simplified down to ""spike can't mutate because then it won't bind ACE2"" that may be unlikely, but definitely is possible.",,,1620669414,{},gxmu1wm,False,t3_n94zxm,False,False,t1_gxmsoux,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n94zxm/no_evidence_that_pfizer_vaccine_needs_updating/gxmu1wm/,1620702121,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

Below is a view of whether states are supply constrained or demand constrained. Based on current run rate of doses administered (7-day moving average for each state) and the available supply (doses delivered minus doses administered), I calculate ""days of supply"" as a proxy for likely constraint. 

If there are more than 21 days of supply, I assume that the state is demand constrained: the state is probably not able to effectively use all of its doses. 

If there are between 14 and 21 days of supply, it is unclear whether that state is either demand constrained or supply constrained (or just has bad logistics). 

if there are less than 14 days of supply, then I assume the state is supply constrained - if they had more doses, they could probably get more shots in arms. 

Hawaii has become supply constrained, but this is mostly due to their inconsistent reporting of doses which causes their 7-day rate to ""pop"" when they do a data dump. I do not view them as actually supply constrained. 

8 states became demand constrained (noted with an asterisk below): Rhode Island, Utah, Washington, Virginia, Maine, Oregon, Iowa, New Jersey, 

3 states moved from ""supply constrained"" to ""unclear"": Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Massachusetts

While it should be no surprise to anyone that we are now almost completely demand constrained, it is interesting to see which states are growing above-normal excess supply. I expect the quality of this data to decline in coming weeks as states are now telling the Federal Government ""no more"" - so the doses on hand should begin to better match demand over time.

Then the teacher's union told the CDC what to say and they issued guidance VERBATIM from those emails.  Then they misreported a bunch of deaths as COVID and quietly corrected them.  Then they passed trillions of dollars of legislation based on scaring the shit out of people, and gave a bunch of non-COVID related money to their cronies and some of us are going to be stuck with the tax bill (Oh yes, and they are screwing up the economy with inflation, labor shortages  and supply chain issues, and they are ruining a generation of children who will have a horrible education while many private schools around the Nation stayed open full time without significant health impact).  Then they told us to get vaccinated and we can go about our business, but apparently we cannot even though the data suggests otherwise. In the meantime, a bunch of Americans believe this virus is more deadly and dangerous than it is and are so scared of their own shadow, they can't even get back into society.  Yes, it is a serious virus and many did actually die of it.  I know a number of people who did, just like a knew a number of people who died of the flu and flu related symptoms over the years.  But they couldn't even stick with the facts which are bad enough - they had to make it worse than it really is to carry out an agenda.  Polls show that the Left thinks this is more deadly than it really is.  No wonder you advocate FORCING people to submit to a government that lied its way through this pandemic.

It's only a ""gray area"" because they cant force masking on others anymore.

It's not gray, it's pretty black and white. Once the mandate is gone, I won't give you shit for wearing a mask, you don't give me shit for not. The problem becomes when the people wearing masks start saying they want everyone else to wear masks (or in some select insane cases want everyone to not wear masks) around them. 

I hope we do some masking in public spaces for a bit longer, at least until we can see how covid does in fall, but I recognize that I don't really have much of a say at all if others do it.

So it's not gray, having control over only what you can do is as black and white as it gets, it only gets complicated when you want to compel masking on others because suddenly you aren't dealing with your own free will.

[Between March 1, 2020, and January 2, 2021, the United States experienced 2,801,439 deaths, or 522,368 excess deaths](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/948641).

So if excess deaths are around 550-580k (including the time from January to now), how do we get from there to 900k?

The only explanation I can think of (and if Fauci is going to say something like this in a press conference it sure would be nice if he'd give an explanation) is if a large number of ""non-excess"" deaths were caused by Covid. For example people that were statistically going to die of a heart attack or stroke actually died of Covid instead. So maybe there are 600k ""excess"" deaths and 300k other deaths caused by Covid, adding up to 900k.

If this is the case, over the next couple of years we should see statistically lower deaths, essentially a large group of deaths were front-loaded into 2020 and 2021.",,,1620681938,{},gxnng0m,False,t3_n9715y,False,False,t1_gxnigm3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n9715y/fauci_says_theres_no_doubt_we_have_been/gxnng0m/,1620717582,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Personally I think it was wrong of them to put the J&amp;J vaccine on hold for blood clots. Some medications can cause blood clots too but nobody has ever called for them to be banned or questioned the effectiveness of medications altogether. For some reason some people just turn into complete idiots where vaccines are concerned and it's the strangest thing to me.

Excerpt: 

&gt; Appointments are no longer needed for Angelenos to get COVID-19 vaccinations at any site run by the city, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced Sunday.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe stand at a critical juncture in our fight to end this pandemic, and our City will keep doing everything possible to knock down barriers to vaccine access and deliver doses directly to all Angelenos,‚Äù Garcetti said in a statement.

&gt; The move is intended to give people who don‚Äôt have the time or technological resources to navigate online booking platforms a chance to get the shot.

&gt; That comes a week after the city stopped requiring appointments for some walk-up and mobile locations. Now, appointment-free options are also available at the city‚Äôs drive-through sites ‚Äî the Crenshaw Christian Center, Hansen Dam and Dodger Stadium ‚Äî which are open Monday through Saturday. People can still sign up ahead of time if they prefer.

&gt; The city is prepared to give out about 255,000 shots this week and expects to receive 42,000 doses of Moderna vaccine, 54,000 of Pfizer vaccine and 27,000 doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, officials said.

&gt; The city has also extended the hours of vaccination sites at Pierce College and L.A. Southwest College from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. so that more people can get shots after work. A third night clinic is being added at Green Meadows Recreation Center in South L.A. this week and will be open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., the city announced.",,,1620598536,{},gxjlk8x,True,t3_n8ouh3,False,False,t3_n8ouh3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n8ouh3/beginning_monday_la_will_offer_appointmentfree/gxjlk8x/,1620634788,17,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

One element is the loss of control involved; while flying may be safer than driving numerically, it also involves the willing surrender of one's autonomy to participate. Many people convince themselves that they are less likely to get into a car accident because they, personally, are in control of the vehicle -- or at the very least that they can imagine themselves reacting to an accident in such a way that they would be spared death or serious injury; a commercial jetliner is another matter altogether, as passengers have no meaningful control over anything that happens (except negatively -- they can always make the situation worse, but seldom better) and have few reassuring options for how to respond in the event of an accident.

Following on that, people over-evaluate the risks of flying because of the comparative aggregate severity of the accidents that happen in the one mode of transport vs. the other. There are countless car accidents daily that produce no injuries whatsoever, to say nothing of those that people still manage to survive otherwise. One hears of comparatively few commercial jetliner crashes in which everything turns out fine, in comparison; the perception, at least, is that if the fates have determined you will be in a plane crash, you are almost certainly going to die in the process. This perception (again, rightly or wrongly) is bolstered by experiential factors; almost everyone who drives has been involved in or at least seen some sort of modest, trivial car accident, while virtually nobody who flies can say the same about a jetliner.

**About Belgium and the Indian variant**

20 days ago, around the 20th of April, a group of Indian students in Belgium was identified as a cluster. Half of those approx. 40 students were infected.

Problem is, they lost track of one of the infected students. I don't know if they finally found him or if he reported to authorities...


**About Belgium and COVID19**

Big cities and virus entry points are : Antwerp, Brussels, Li√®ge.

Once something new concerning COVID happens in just one of those cities, it's 100% guaranteed that it will spread to the entire country.

Keep in mind too that Belgium is one of the cores of EU. If we Belgians fail here, it will also impact the whole West Europe.

This is what the UK Government had to say about restrictions on public gatherings in their preparedness plan for an influenza of a fatality rate of 2.5% (similar to COVID-19):

&gt; Public gatherings

&gt;**There is very limited evidence that restrictions on mass gatherings will have any significant effect on influenza virus transmission**14. Large public gatherings or crowded events where people may be in close proximity are an important indicator of ‚Äònormality‚Äô and may help maintain public morale during a pandemic. The social and economic consequences of advising cancellation or postponement of large gatherings are likely to be considerable for event organisers, contributors and participants. **There is also a lack of scientific evidence on the impact of internal travel restrictions on transmission** and attempts to impose such restrictions would have wide-reaching implications for business and welfare.

&gt; For these reasons, the working presumption will be that Government will not impose any such restrictions. The emphasis will instead be on encouraging all those who have symptoms to follow the advice to stay at home and avoid spreading their illness.

To highlight this, consider the history of seat belt usage in the United States. There was no law that required that seat belts be installed in vehicles in the United States until 1961, in Wisconsin. Why did it take so long? Well, socially, they weren't used often, even when vehicle manufacturers did install them. Over time (through the 40s, 50s, and 60s), it became more common for vehicle manufacturers to include seat belts and for people to actually use them.

Social norms inform what laws are adopted.

Today, seat belts are uncontroversial. They are required to be included in every vehicle produced in the United States. Every jurisdiction requires the usage of seat belts. Because they have been required for so long, they have become uncontroversial and widely accepted.

Laws inform what social norms are acceptable.

As you can see, Moderna is both the applicant and the assignee of the patent.

It is in the public interest to protect patent holders to encourage innovation, but in this case the need to vaccinate people as quickly as possible to save lives and mitigate the potential emergence of variants that evade current vaccines takes precedence. I would believe this even if the patents were held by ""Mr. Moderna"" and ""Ms. Pfizer"" (or the inventors listed on the patents) and those ""individuals"" were manufacturing the vaccine in their basements.

It's ok, and also the vaccines are not 100% effective so it's also ok to have some nagging doubts off and on.

Then, they had to plan to distribute it. A lot of places didn‚Äôt have the coolers and refused to buy them. After that, who should give the vaccine? The hospital? Hospitals are not the same here as they are in the west. You don‚Äôt go see your doctor there. There‚Äôs small clinics everywhere here. But again, who gives the vaccine? The internal med doc? The ENT? The GP? The TCM doc? 

And how to decide who gets it? 72 million doses, yea, great start, but everyone needs two and there‚Äôs 126million people over here. 

This country is mostly old people. They should go first. Yea, that makes sense. Except, they‚Äôre not the ones catching and spreading it. Most of the infections here are young people who are ignoring lockdown and refusing to wear masks or cooperate in any way (also, those that work in shitty offices that refuse to go remote even when it‚Äôs very possible). Old people are generally isolated here and don‚Äôt go out nearly as much as the younger generation. So who should get the vaccine first? They can‚Äôt decide. 

Now obviously most of the doses will go to Tokyo and Osaka, but these are major metropolitan areas that are divided into wards and cities. So which government handles distribution? Japan govt? Tokyo? The city government? 

Even better, Japan has watched other countries just get it out there and GET PEOPLE VACCINATED by any and all means. They knew it was an issue that was going to have to be solved and all the talk about is the f*ing Olympics. I‚Äôm so tired of it. 

I have half a mind to believe they‚Äôre loving the fact that they can cancel visas and keep the borders locked right now... but that‚Äôs tinfoil-hat territory.

I went to this electronics warehouse for a pick up. In and out in 2mins. That sort of thing. But there was a well distanced queue of about 10 people due to them taking people's names and adresses in case something happens. Alright. No biggie. 

The people at the desk were an old couple and you could hear the staff guy telling the instructions loud and clear all the way back to me. Yet, they kept asking every single step and it took *for-fucking-ever.*

*""Ok next I need your phone number."" - ""My phone number or her phone number?"" - ""Either phone number please. We need to be able to reach you in case something happens."" - ""Won't we learn about it on the news anyway?"" - ""No I need your number"".*

And so on. And the line kept getting bigger. Literally every single thing they wanted to discuss. And then at the end, turns out they somehow gave the wrong info as I heard the clerk go ""Well now I have to do everything again!""... But that wasn't even the actually bad part. It was annoying but it didn't bring me here. 

But the guy in front of me, ca. 70yo, already looking like trouble tbh, refused to give his number or email adress. He made a huge stink of not giving it out to anyone, and then when they insisted, he suddenly changed directions and said that he doesn't have either of them. When they told him that he can't come in unless he gives his data, he suddenly started shouting **""Who are YOU to tell ME what to do and where to GO?!""** He kept shouting *""Who said this?? Who mandated this??""* to which the clerk calmly responded, the state and the city. The guy then got told to leave and he kept shouting on his way out.

&gt; If you're vaccinated with, let's say, CoronaVac (Sinovac) you get 67% protection against symptomatic Sars-Cov-II, so in the 33% of cases that you do get the rona and become symptomatic you have good chances of having the mild inconvenience of being sick for a few days or a week, but those unvaccinated people close to you can still catch the rona from you, and be put in serious danger.


On the other hand, I don't see how me saying that individually people either become immune or not to the virus following a vaccine contradicts the fact that efficacy/effectiveness is measured in percentage and is not binary. If a population gets vaccinated with a vaccine that has a 67% efficacy/effectiveness, then the chance of these individuals seroconverting is 67%, and they have a 33% of not seroconverting and thus not being immune.

All of my extended family except for the 2 youngest and one uncle's branch are fully vaccinated and we finally celebrated our first family holiday (Mother's day) together since covid started (minus the uncle who dropped off a gift).  All of the adults were happy to finally be able to safely see each other again. The sad part was my (almost 4yo) niece who crawled into my lap and curled up when my cousins arrived. She was scared because she hadn't seen them in so long and told me she ""didn't like different people"". She did eventually warm up to the rest of the family some, but it was really sad to see. My parents and I have been part of my brothers covid bubble so we've had pretty regular contact with them and my nieces, but this was the first time she had seen my cousins or Aunt/Uncle in over a year and it was pretty heartbreaking. I hope she will do better once she starts kindergarten/preschool.

[],,IronEngineer,,,[],,,,text,t2_4b7xe,False,False,[],"The CDC guidance regarding schools was impacted by the many political interests trying to get schools opened long before the teachers union piped up to keep them closed.  I know many households that are sending their kids to private schools now because they are open full time when the public schools are not.  The reasoning is that they are two parent working households.  Without a baby sitter, even working from home is difficult when you have kids running around.  These people have called representatives demanding they push for schools to open and have contributed money to lobbying campaigns pushing for the same.  Some of my coworkers started making a fuss about it as early as last October, before the vaccine even same out.

I remember in February that there were several political analysts predicting that if Biden didn't get public schools open in the next couple months, he would lose a lot of the political support he had to go after other political pursuits and get bills passed.  It was shortly after that the CDC changed guidance on a dime regarding schools.  The new guidance is that if kids are kept 3 ft apart in closed unventilated spaces such as classrooms,  that qualifies a safe environment.  This was needed because there's not enough room in the classroom to maintain 6 ft separation between kids.  It is rather telling how fast the CDC rolled over on their position once the Biden administration said they would push for schools to open.

My point being that a lot of the CDC's messaging and guidance is driven by economic impact and societal needs.

&gt;  
&gt;This progenitor viral genome has three bases that differ from the Wuhan strains. The researchers think that both the Wuhan and other of the earliest genomes to be sampled were actually variants of the progenitor coronavirus (CoV), which diverged into ŒΩ and Œ± lineages.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Diversity pre-existing the earliest case  
&gt;  
&gt;The Wuhan strain underwent three consecutive mutations, Œ±1, Œ±2, and Œ±3, but these are not found in the closely related CoVs, all of which have the same base at these three positions. The ŒΩ variants of the progenitor CoV do not show the other 47 variants at these positions, making them unlikely to be the ancestral lineage for the Wuhan-1 virus or other early samples. The first ŒΩ mutant was picked up almost two months after the Wuhan-1 strain.  
&gt;  
&gt;There were multiple occurrences of the progenitor CoV, both in China and the USA, from January 2020 onwards. Synonymous progenitor CoV samples were found in many other samples collected within two weeks of the Wuhan-1 strain.  
&gt;  
&gt;While these were mostly Chinese and Asian (almost 90/130), they were found in all continents sampled and persisted up to April 2020 in Europe.  
&gt;  
&gt;These findings suggest that the progenitor CoV was already spreading extensively before and after the first official reports of the emergence of a novel coronavirus in China. In other words, the Wuhan-1 strain is unlikely to be the original SARS-CoV-2 ancestor from which all currently circulating strains are derived.",,,1620662390,{},gxmdczt,True,t3_n98jpc,False,True,t3_n98jpc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n98jpc/the_ancestor_of_sarscov2s_wuhan_strain_was/gxmdczt/,1620692884,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Should they be denied the right to vote because they are infirm and don't have someone who can spend entire days helping with their affairs?

One alternative is for the state to provide sufficient assistance to help that person get their ID renewed. Yet that assistance is never included in this Republican-crafted voting laws.

Assuming you're in the US, you don't have an option on the masks - they are required in both the airports and on the planes. That right there goes a LONG way towards helping prevent transmission. 

I flew Delta - they handed me a single packaged antibacterial wipe as soon as I stepped on board. I quickly wiped down the area around me, but definitely didn't go into every nook and cranny.

Also, the planes themselves looked extremely clean, definitely much cleaner than they ever were in the before times, and it's not like I was licking the tray table or anything... 

Here's a nickel's worth of free advice - make it a point to go out and do things in the world before you get on the plane. Go to some stores and walk around. Eat at a restaurant - if you're not comfortable eating indoors yet, find a patio and at least have an appetizer and a drink or something.

* COVID has shown to be able to spread to house pets and other mammals (mink etc.) and have also shown to be able to spread back to humans.

* Sometimes people who have previously had COVID can get re-infected and antibodies may only be good for ~6 months.

* It is said that people who are vaccinated will need a booster within 12 months and as of now many have already skipped their 2nd shot.

* Though people who are vaccinated are very unlikely to get severely ill they can still potentially be asymptomatic carries. 

* Many anti-vaxxers will not get vaccinated and in order to achieve herd immunity we would need ~80 or so vaccinated we may not get there.

* So far most mutations still seem covered by existing vaccines but for how long? COVID seems to quickly mutate and the ability to move between species increases the lilelyhood that we will see a mutation not covered by existing vaccines. 

* In many countries in the world they have significant other pressing issues and may not take COVID vaccines very seriously and we need everyone vaccinated to make COVID go away entirely.

So it seems likely that there will be both human and non-human vehicles for COVID to remain in existence for a very very long time and during that time mutations could allow it to spread to vaccinated people.

Add to this all the geo-political and regional issues like many countries having limited access to vaccines, the vaccines in those areas being generally bad in comparison to the ones in the us, patent issues around the various vaccine technologies etc. etc. ...

Which confirms a whole stack of data points that AZ has the better cellular response, while Pfizer has the better antibody response.

&gt;A mutation of a COVID-19 strain that is thought to have originated in Brazil has been detected in Florida, health department officials said last week.  
&gt;  
&gt;[The Florida Sun-Sentinel](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/coronavirus/fl-ne-new-covid-variant-in-florida-20210506-bfroysqt2nedblfwip62arx42y-story.html) reported that two cases of the so-called P2 variant have been recorded in the state so far, one in a 74-year-old and one in a 51-year-old. The strain is believed to be a slight mutation of the Brazilian¬†one that has vexed health authorities in the country for months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Of particular concern to authorities is the strain's mutation, which experts say allows it to reinfect patients who previously had milder cases of COVID-19 and developed antibodies, including younger people who dealt with weaker or asymptomatic cases of the disease.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We have just two cases in Florida that have the extra mutation, and what that means remains to be seen,‚Äù Marco Salemi, a professor with the University of Florida‚Äôs Emerging Pathogens Institute, told the Sun-Sentinel. ‚ÄúIf in a month from now we go from two cases to 500, that will be concerning.""",,,1620672005,{},gxn08a1,True,t3_n9ckg2,False,True,t3_n9ckg2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n9ckg2/new_mutation_of_brazilian_covid19_variant/gxn08a1/,1620705493,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

They complained about the cooling and the costs...   so when AstraZeneca fell through, the EU was in deep shit, and now Germany, the country that developed the first vaccine and test, is over two months behind of the US.

‚Äû

The US ordered 600 million doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine in July, while the EU waited until November to place an order of half that size.
‚ÄúAt some point it became clear that it would not be possible to deliver so quickly,‚Äù Tuereci told Spiegel. ‚ÄúBy then it was already too late to place follow-on orders.‚Äù
‚Äû

The EU has been fighting over equal shares of a little piece of pie and Talking about vaccine inequity, which is kind of like someone that lives paycheck to paycheck talking about the plight of the poor. 

The EU should have split the buying up into several groups of like minded countries, which is what we see is happening now anyway to some degree.

The efficacy of BioNTech's vaccine against variants is still pretty good.

However, not everyone in the world will get the vaccine (vaccine hesitancy + access). If only 60% of the population is vaccinated, I'd rather it was with a vaccine stopping 85-90% of transmission than 60-70%.

We can already see the importance of better vaccines: Seychelles and Maldives both [have vaccinated a greater percentage](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/) of their population than Israel. But they did it with a mix of Sinopharm and Astrazeneca. Cases have increased recently in both Seychelles and Maldives. The infection statistics [are coherent with the phase 3 efficacies of those vaccines](https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1389955259410354177?s=20). The vaccines will reduce the death toll for sure, but don't prevent significant waves.

If new variants keep coming, BioNTech's vaccine then might look like Sinopharm/Astrazeneca today: good vaccines, preventing lots of deaths, but not good enough to prevent new waves (even after vaccinating most people).",,,1620679520,{},gxnhyt8,False,t3_n94zxm,False,True,t1_gxmegms,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n94zxm/no_evidence_that_pfizer_vaccine_needs_updating/gxnhyt8/,1620714756,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There are a lot of these examples you can just find. A big assumption is that younger people won't notice their lungs getting scarred some, and that people may heal their lungs over time.  
That has not been determined and therefore I'd rather not get it.   
 
Similarly for children there was a recent study that showed a biomarker in many who contracted the virus. You can see the discussion from /r/COVID19 in this [thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ky9zc5/chop_researchers_find_elevated_biomarker_related/). The main idea being that perhaps these are only signs of an active or recent infection, and the body will recover in time. Or it may cause long term damage. We just don't know yet.  
  
So I think it'd be wise for all of us to still try and not get this virus. And effectively what that means is keeping our foot on the gas until case numbers around us drop to nothing.

Can't generalize whole Europe. The only common thing in all EU countries is that vaccines are bought by countries through common EU treaty, each country gets a proportional share of vaccines from the whole batch bought by EU. How it's distributed inside the country is each country own business.

Here in Estonia we prioritized elderly, teachers, and healthcare workers. In January only 80+ old were eligible, now 50+ old, from 17th May everyone older than 18 will be allowed. To set up an appointment you can either call your family doctor or register on national healthcare website. When your registered time comes, you just go and get your shot. Plus I know that many people in so called ""danger groups""/""frontline workers"" got a call/mail from health department saying that vaccine shot is already reserved for them. So there wasn't much problems with administering doses, we were always limited only by supply.

But I'd say Estonia is a bit of an exception to the rule - we had centralized online healthcare system where almost all citizens are registered and can apply for appointments set up many years before the whole covid things.

I understand, and I don't deny that's a risk. The fact that Moderna is developing a booster would suggest that getting the vaccine now would not be sufficient to fully ameliorate that risk.

If everybody was isolated as an individual, two weeks would absolutely do it. The math becomes exponentially more complicated, however, because people live with others. For example, let's imagine that the hypothetical time from exposure to viral clearance was 10 days. (A nice round number for easy math). Well, we all wait for ten days - but on day 10, right before I'm clear, I infect my spouse. So now we have to wait 10 more days. And on day 10, right before she's clear, she infects our kid. So now we have to wait 10 more days. And on day 10, right before the kid is clear, she infects her brother ...

Now, it is unlikely that we'd get that unlucky? Absolutely. But unlikely things happen. And if you have one billion families of four, well, a couple of them are going to behave in extremely unlikely ways. 

To be absolutely, 100% certain no humans had SARS-COV-2, you'd have to isolate long enough to insure the longest possible chain of transmission burned itself out. 

But also we don't generally use to term ""eradicate"" with viruses that have non-human hosts. Smallpox is eradicated because no living thing anywhere on earth has it, it only exists (knock on wood) in two refrigerators, one in Atlanta and one in Russia. 

But despite the fact that there hasn't been a known case of SARS classic in 16 years, it's not considered eradicated because the assumption is that the virus is still out there in an animal reservoir that we haven't identified - the same way Ebola disappeared for 15 years after it was discovered in outbreaks in the Sudan and Zaire, but eventually a new chain of infection was started when somebody got exposed to an animal who carried it.",,,1620663531,{},gxmg2mf,False,t3_n8y662,False,False,t1_gxmaiit,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n8y662/daily_discussion_thread_may_10_2021/gxmg2mf/,1620694362,18,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That's super cool! Maybe you can point out the deficiency in my understanding here?   
It seems counterintuitive to me that a mutation would cause a **decrease** in affinity to certain epitopes (namely the ones present in convalescent and vaccinated individuals) while keeping the **same** (or greater) affinity to human ACE2.  One would think that ACE2 would be ""harder"" to bind to (more complex) than the relatively simple proteins on the antibodies (not to mention, as you say, the antibodies are rather polyclonal nature, and you only need a handful to 'stick'). But please correct me if I'm missing something important.

Of course the real kicker (to me) is that such a specifically mutated virus **still** has to gain entry through the cell membrane (Furin cleavage). So that mechanism must remain intact with any mutation, or you have a non-viable virus.    


I suppose when you get at the scale of the amount infections taking place, especially in a place like India, it seems that just about any mutation that's physically possible within the scope of a 'viable' virus (there's a lot of disagreement in general about just how many possible mutations there even are in the RBD) will eventually present itself.  My take is , there's not guarantee that when you get to those mutations that do escape immunity, that the virus just happens to hang onto its worst characteristics. (i.e. greatly reduced transmissibility or that it causes at most mild illness).",,,1620668198,{},gxmr5zl,False,t3_n94zxm,False,False,t1_gxmlru0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n94zxm/no_evidence_that_pfizer_vaccine_needs_updating/gxmr5zl/,1620700563,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Participants: 43,548 multinational participants 16 and older 

43,448 of those 43,548 participants received injections 

-	8 participants injected with BNT162b2, contacted covid at least 7 days after the second dose 
-	162 participants in the placebo group injected with saline, contracted covid

This was the trial that allowed Pfizer and Biontech to ask for FDA approval for emergency distribution

It goes into depth about everything from the biomechanics of BNT162b2 and method of action in the human body to Pfizer‚Äôs part in the trials and BioNtechs synthesis to their shared work in the data analysis

""We have no evidence masks work against the coronavirus"", though certainly true at the beginning (Because, well, we didn't have evidence of basically anything at that time) was taken to mean ""masks don't work"".

The same thing here for the vaccine. At this point we have evidence to point to the fact that the protection afforded by the vaccine lasts 8 months (or whenever the first trial was started). That doesn't mean it lasts ONLY 8 months, it means that we only started testing it 8 months ago, so it's impossible to say with any certainly that it will last longer. We absolutely might need a booster after 12 months, or after 18 months, or maybe immunity lasts for 10 years. We don't know, so the conservative approach right now is ""plan for the worst case scenario and go from there"".

The problem is now people are running around saying ""it's impossible to vaccinate our way out of this, because immunity only lasts 8 months, so we won't be able to vaccinate everyone before starting again!""

Though right now science has to remain neutral in the ""we don't know how long it lasts"" sense, from a layman's perspective, there is good reason to think immunity should last a good amount of time, because COVID-19 is fairly stable from a mutations perspective, and because we're targeting a protein required to penetrate cells.

Previous evidence suggests that schools can be reopened safely if community spread is low and public health guidelines are followed. However, in Texas, reopenings often occurred alongside high community spread and at near capacity, making it difficult to meet social distancing recommendations. Using event-study models and hand-collected instruction modality and start dates for all school districts, we find robust evidence that reopening Texas schools gradually but substantially accelerated the community spread of COVID-19. Results from our preferred specification imply that school reopenings led to at least 43,000 additional COVID-19 cases and 800 additional fatalities within the first two months. We then use SafeGraph mobility data to provide evidence that spillovers to adults‚Äô behaviors contributed to these large effects. Median time spent outside the home on a typical weekday increased substantially in neighborhoods with large numbers of school-age children, suggesting a return to in-person work or increased outside-of-home leisure activities among parents.",,,1620659236,{},gxm5zv0,True,t3_n972zl,False,False,t3_n972zl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n972zl/school_reopenings_mobility_and_covid19_spread/gxm5zv0/,1620688787,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Combination of both - it is true that there is a lower approval/confidence rate of vaccines in Japan that is often attributed to the MMR vaccine in 1990, IIRC its ~30% vs 50%+ in the US. Japan also only recently has asked prefectural governments to set up vaccination locations, so there may not have even been infrastructure available, for both giving shots and storing shots. I know the government has been equipping locations with freezers for the Pfizer shot, but are currently supplying those for the other two shots (higher temp compared to Pfizer). I‚Äôm not sure on the exact timeframe but Japan currently also only has approved the Pfizer vaccine, and is slated to look at Moderna and AstraZeneca later this month.

So now, we need about 71% vaccination coverage for herd immunity in urban areas, 98% on cruise ships.

In the U.S., I think we'll eventually see that 71% in urban areas, which are [mostly around 50%](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html) of those eligible vaccinated. But we're seeing lots of rural areas in the US where opposition to vaccination has become part of religious/political identity, and vaccination campaigns are topping off around 20-30% penetration to date. States are cutting way back on vaccine orders, as people, especially in rural areas, just aren't showing up.

The variants of concern like P.1 and B.1.617.2 appear to be more transmissible, are more likely to evade existing antibodies from vaccination or prior infection, and pose worse health outcomes to younger cohorts. If that means R0\~4 and E\~0.8 (with current vaccines), that pushes the threshold for herd immunity up to 94%. I don't think we'll hit that threshold for voluntary vaccination even among the best-educated populations.

There will be boosters, especially from the mRNA vaccine manufacturers. They'll take similar timescales for efficacy testing (4-5 months) as the existing ones, and while there won't be the same sorts of delays for ramping up manufacturing or creating distribution networks, it still will take 5+ months for everyone who wants them to get boosters.

Yes, this is a far fetched concept. But at the rate how the world is fighting covid at the moment. We just got the vaccine for the first version of covid. I don't know how it is in your country. But mine, the majority of the population hasn't gotten and supply isnt there. I don't know how far behind we are in finding a vaccine for the current covid version and whether covid is just going to mutate even further. 
I don't know much about how viruses work. But from what i have seen. Restriction ease up and now numbers of infected here are worse than last year. 
I'm all for staying home but people have a false sense of security when restrictions ease. Even people who we feel have common sense to stay home go out for some random reason and get infected.
Right now my idea seems cute. But what if the world looks at what china did to some parts of the country of locking the people up and now china has little if not no reported cases.

No idea, but you should remember that nowadays those vaccinations don't require vaccinating millions in short order, just children as scheduled based on age or other factors.

With standard vaccines, you only need to vaccinate 1-2% of population each year and you can't actually do it too early and too rapidly, because children can't be vaccinated against some diseases at too young an age.
