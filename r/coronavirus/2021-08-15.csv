&gt;never felt I ‚Äúneeded‚Äù booze, but it was always hard to stop at just one or two drinks. That would lead to my drinking and driving, feeling like shit in the mornings, abnormal liver function tests‚Ä¶

This, minus the driving, is literally where I am. I've had health issues in the past that have flared up my liver (over use/need for antibiotics with double pneumonia, twice) and each time I have a blood test for my damn lisinopril (blood pressure medication) sure enough there are abnormal liver function tests. Starts all the same, a drink or two (in private) and it leafs to that urge just to take a drink whenever I feel like a drink would make me feel better. My boss and I could/can (odd situation) have a glass or two of scotch, or split a bottle of wine, and I'd be fine going home. I come home with the wrong company still awake, then the screws come off. 

&gt;Haven‚Äôt found a new job since!

&gt;Finally at a place where if I stick to beer/wine and don‚Äôt have much of it, I‚Äôm alright. But the temptation is looming in the background and something to always be aware of. 


Same here, I've interviewed like mad, and nothing. Wish I could force myself to find CS/coding/tech interesting, just so I'm not some other person forced to leave my hometown, and that hasn't helped when looking at nothing other than the salary (as that's literally all I care about when it comes to a job) and realizing all it affords is the same part of town (a suburban hellhole) or the lowest of the low, I just can't see faking an interest in showing up for a piss ant paycheck. Doing my due diligence to sell myself out to the legal and investing industries. Bad part is, I've even told some close friends, those who do have a concern that I'm so self aware of my habits being situational, if I had my own place in the right part of town (to go back to school), I doubt I'd even pull a cork. Then the self medicating days begin and... 

&gt;Not to be dramatic: You‚Äôre younger and have a little more time. It sounds like you‚Äôve got opportunities! Seize them and don‚Äôt succumb to how easy it is to numb ourselves with booze. The older you get, the faster time goes by. Don‚Äôt let the bottle get in the way of living your life

No worries and thank you! I'm around mid 20s, lost quite a few years with some personal health and taking care of a few family members. Opportunities are there, just have to do some searching and thinking outside of the box, standard route, that thing will never work. So many times, of course when I've had a few, there's a scene in the movie Bohemian Rhapsody when Freddie leaves Paul I think of, in relation to people, vices, situations, and I hope I can do that to move on.

I don't think that's true or at least that is not my understanding. Vaccine efficacy only tells us how many less people we expect to see infected vs an unvaccinated group. So if you had two groups of a thousand people and in the unvaccinated group 100 got infected you would expect only 21 to get infected in the vaccinated group if the efficacy were 79%.

The issue, for some, hinges upon ""Civil Liberties"" and ""you can't tell me what to do"" approaches.  During the downturn in COVID Cases, several groups moved to ban mask mandates so that, in the future, people would never again be subjected to being forced to wear a mask.  A lot of these measures went through: COVID was in a downturn, it was a political hot button nobody wanted to touch, and everyone thought ""it won't matter anyway, COVID is on its way out""

Politicians, now, will not ""destroy"" their political careers by going against their party or their constituents.

&gt;The new requirement is the most aggressive step the city has taken yet to curb a surge in cases caused by the delta variant. As the first major U.S. city to require anyone partaking in certain indoor activities or large outdoor gatherings to show proof they‚Äôve been inoculated, all eyes are on the five boroughs. People will have to show proof that they have had at least one vaccine dose and business owners are burdened with enforcing the rules.

&gt;The simplest way to prove you've gotten the shot is simply to show your vaccination card ‚Äî the same piece of paper you get from health providers and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Taking a picture of that card at home and then showing the image to the bouncer at the club can also work.

&gt;New York City offers a streamlined way of showing a photo through its NYC COVID Safe App, in which people can store images of their vaccine cards and then display them in the app when needed. You can also use the state's Excelsior Pass app.

&gt;Data shows that about 67.5% of adults in New York City are fully vaccinated and 72.4% have had at least one dose.

&gt;All of New York City is now a ""high transmission"" area, per the CDC ‚Äî and the transmission rate (total new cases per 100,000 people over the prior seven days) is up almost 16% in just the last week alone, according to the city health department's latest update Friday. The same holds true for all of New Jersey counties and much of Connecticut.

&gt;Virtually every important infection metric in the city is getting worse too, with the daily average of reported cases seeing a 59% increase from the average two weeks ago, according to New York Times data. COVID patients in intensive care have also tripled in the last month and now stand at 289, more than 3.5 times what they were this time in July.

&gt;NYC is among 90% of the country that meets the CDC's guidelines recommending people wear masks indoors, whether they are vaccinated or not, but there will be no mask mandate from the city.

They set up camp inside the epithelial cells lining the inside of your nose or sinuses and start reproducing about a day later. Your immune system will notice that something's wrong with those cells. If you've already been vaccinated, you have immune memory and your body's immune system will start producing lots of the right sorts of antibodies to fight off the infection within the next day or so. In the meantime, you might feel mildly crappy.

On the other hand if you haven't been vaccinated, your immune system goes ""Oh crap, invaders. Now what?"" and spends over a week trying to figure out what's going on. And then once your immune system does figure out what's going on, there's a chance that it overreacts and *that's* what lands you in the hospital and/or gives you long COVID.

As for testing positive for COVID-19, measles or tetanus, that's going to depend on what you're testing for. Most ""COVID tests"" are PCR tests. These detect the RNA which is inside of every virus particle. If you have an active infection, they'll find it; you may also test positive if you have a recent infection. (Note that PCR can't distinguish between virus particles which are capable of replication and virus particles which are broken because your immune system stomped them flat.) You would not expect to get a positive PCR test for measles or tetanus unless you have a current/recent infection or perhaps a very recent vaccination.

If you want to find out whether you have immunity to something like measles or tetanus, you would do a [different test](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=167&amp;ContentID=mmr_antibody) to see if your blood contains any antibodies which resulted from prior infections or vaccination.",,,,1629098208,{},h94ok1p,False,t3_p439w3,False,True,t1_h8yemfx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p439w3/daily_discussion_thread_august_14_2021/h94ok1p/,1629170594.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Developing its own vaccine has been a major goal, although Taiwan has also ordered millions of shots from Moderna Inc¬†(MRNA.O)¬†and AstraZeneca PLC¬†(AZN.L), and is due next week to start injecting its first domestically-developed vaccine, made by Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp¬†(6547.TWO).

The health ministry, explaining the rejection of the request for emergency use authorisation, or EUA, said the antibodies engendered by UBI's vaccine candidate did not match up with those prompted by the AstraZeneca vaccine.

However, the ministry said, UBI planned Phase III trials in India.

Health Minister Chen Shih-chung expressed regret that the EUA had not been granted.

""We still have to follow certain standards,"" he told reporters.

UBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In June, the company had said it would seek an EUA in Taiwan and that Phase II tests showed no major adverse effects for its vaccine candidate, which, it said, generated a good immune response.

About 40% of Taiwan's 23.5 million people have received at least one dose of the two required by the vaccine regimen.

However, unlike some other parts of Asia, Taiwan faces no huge pressure to vaccinate the populace.
The pandemic is well under control in Taiwan, with only a handful of domestic infections reported daily following tough controls adopted after a spike in cases that began in mid-May.

The government has drawn criticism from opposition parties after President Tsai Ing-wen pledged that month to start administering domestically developed vaccines in July, before results of second clinical trials were released.

Later, Tsai said Taiwan would strictly scrutinise the process according to global scientific norms and put safety first.

&gt;The governor, Kate Brown, said that hospitals were at risk of becoming overwhelmed, with 733 Oregonians hospitalized with severe cases of Covid-19, including 185 in intensive care.

&gt;The surge comes despite Oregon‚Äôs relatively high rate of vaccination, a fact that Ms. Brown noted in a videotaped address.

&gt;‚ÄùI know this is not the summer many of us envisioned with over 2.5 million Oregonians vaccinated against Covid-19,‚Äù Ms. Brown said. ‚ÄúThe harsh and frustrating reality is that the Delta variant has changed everything.‚Äù
Ms. Brown said that up to 1,500 National Guard members could be deployed to help at hospitals around the state, and that she had reached out to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for further support and funding.

&gt;The highly transmissible Delta variant of the virus has driven infections and hospitalizations to all-time highs in some Southern states, so much so that ‚Äúpandemic of the unvaccinated‚Äù has become Biden administration shorthand for the latest wave. But it has also begun to hammer states with relatively high rates of vaccination, like Oregon and Hawaii.

&gt;In recent days, those two states have recorded their highest number of cases since the start of the pandemic. The seven-day average of cases in Hawaii has been above 500 for nearly a week, about double the peak the state reached in August 2020.

&gt;Oregon narrowly surpassed its highest previous average, reaching a seven-day average of 1,540 cases on Thursday, according to a New York Times database. Over the past two weeks, hospitalizations have risen nearly 130 percent in Oregon and 140 percent in Hawaii.

&gt;This week Ms. Brown announced a statewide indoor mask mandate, which took effect on Friday. Under the new rules, everyone older than 5 needs to wear a mask in most indoor settings; children older than 2 will need to wear them on public transportation.

&gt;Hawaii has had the country‚Äôs fewest reported cases per capita for most of the pandemic.

&gt;But this week, Gov. David Ige imposed new social distancing and gathering restrictions. Before that, Mr. Ige announced that state and county employees would have to show proof of vaccination by Monday or be tested weekly.

&gt;The vast majority of people hospitalized with Covid-19 in Hawaii had not been vaccinated, according to a message on Twitter from the state‚Äôs lieutenant governor on Tuesday.

&gt;Also this week, the police in Honolulu arrested two travelers accused of using falsified vaccination cards to avoid the 10-day quarantine that otherwise would have been required when they entered the state. Officials said they had acted on a tip from the community.

&gt;Although Hawaii has prosecuted travelers accused of violating quarantine rules, this is the first case involving falsified vaccination cards.

There's this distorted self-perception that we are individually above average when it comes to toughness, pain tolerance, disease resistance, etc simply by willing it to be so. (Obvs there are exceptions, eg, people that know they don't do pain well, or catch a cold at the slightest provocation, etc.)

Given the above, anyone suggesting otherwise is a wimp, weak, inferior, etc.

For example. I think my pain tolerance is average. I had a physiotherapist suggest to a PT student that my tolerance was pretty high. I laughed because I don't see it. Give me a headache and I'll just want to slink away.

I might be above average at the odd thing. But there's no way that I'm better than average at everything I could possibly think of simply because I grit my teeth, take a deep breath and bear down until my face turns purple. Sure, I'm willing to try some things outside my comfort zone; other things I leave to the experts.

Mask mandates were dropped way too soon and were almost certainly political in hindsight. Restriction fatigue and outright repudiation were the most likely causes. 

Following the science means changing as the science does. We now have a variant that is 5X more virulent than an already virulent virus so maybe social distancing and masks coming back as the floor of restrictions isn't such a bad thing. 

No one's asking you to be a basement dweller or other strawmen you'd like to throw up. But I do think social distancing, masks indoors, and keeping up with hygiene would be an effective way to combat spread. 

I'd love to hear how this low barrier to entry into modern society with the intent of not spreading the virus is somehow a huge problem to your everyday life. 

There's a ton of people in these forums talking about how ""they did their part"" and now it's not up to them. Slice it any way you'd like, but that IS selfish behavior.

i.e. Lambda is a variant that can reinfect people who have already been sick before.  This includes vaccinated and unvaccinated, and is why masks are critical now.

Delta shows similar behavior in its ability to reinfect, though delta also has a mutation that allows it to copy much faster.

1. only desperate schools are going to consider hiring people without teaching experience. You'd be at the bottom of the pile and will have to deal with a lot of red tape.

3. It's a freaking hard job, your teaching degree will give you some of the tools to make it through

4. It will help you network so you have a pool of experts to ask for help from.

&gt;While some breakthrough cases among those who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 are inevitable, they are unlikely to result in hospitalization or death. But one important question about breakthrough infection that remains unanswered is: Can the vaccinated develop so-called long Covid?

&gt;Long Covid refers to a set of symptoms ‚Äî such as severe fatigue, brain fog, headache, muscle pain and sleep problems ‚Äî that can persist for weeks or months after the active infection has ended. The syndrome is poorly understood, but studies suggest that between 10 and 30 percent of adults who catch the virus may experience long Covid, including those who experienced only mild illness or no symptoms at all.

&gt;But the vast majority of data collected about long Covid has been in the unvaccinated population. The risk of developing long Covid for the fully vaccinated who get infected after vaccination hasn‚Äôt been studied.

&gt;While preliminary research suggests that it is, in fact, possible for a breakthrough case to lead to symptoms that can persist for weeks to months, there are still more questions than answers. What percent of breakthrough cases result in lingering symptoms? How many of those people recover? Are the persistent symptoms after breakthrough infection as severe as those that occur in the unvaccinated?
‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt think there is enough data,‚Äù said Dr. Zijian Chen, medical director at the Center for Post-Covid Care at Mount Sinai Health System in New York. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too early to tell. The population of people getting sick post vaccination isn‚Äôt that high right now, and there‚Äôs no good tracking mechanism for these patients.‚Äù

That's like saying the only way to learn to drive is to get in the driver's seat and go. You wouldn't teach your kid that way and expect good results, so don't expect adults starting a really difficult job to do that as well. 

Particularly in the younger grades just keeping 20 kids alive is a feat. Now teach them to read. 

Teaching is not like other jobs. You are holding 20+ minds in your hands, often with no one else to help you and you are beholden to all of their parents.

Currently we are at 75% of the population fully vaccinated and aiming for 80% by the end of the month, while simultaneously gradually loosening restrictions with social activities and border controls. 

More than just getting shots in arms though, the biggest challenge is changing the mindset. We have struggled with removing the focus from daily case numbers to starting to focus on vaccination rates, severe cases and deaths and only now are starting to see comms and people's perspectives move away from just case numbers.

&gt;After Mr. DeSantis threatened to withhold school funds, the Biden administration stepped in. Officials said they supported the mask mandate and would allow the schools to use funds from pandemic relief measures to replace the salaries.

&gt;Educators in Florida are aware of the negative impact of so much time away from in-person schooling for many students, including mental health risks and declining academic performance, she said. That made the mask mandate all the more important, along with on-site testing measures, vaccination access and air filtration.

&gt;‚ÄùWe‚Äôve been working extremely hard to put these in place, and we‚Äôre not going to risk their lives by allowing it to be optional,‚Äù Dr. Osgood said.

&gt;Other states have imposed similar bans on mask mandates. Recently, the Arkansas governor said he regretted approving such a ban and hamstringing schools‚Äô ability to protect students under 12, who cannot yet be vaccinated.",,,,1629122646,{},h95p473,False,t3_p5bm5f,False,False,t3_p5bm5f,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p5bm5f/were_not_going_to_risk_their_lives_a_florida/h95p473/,1629188874.0,42,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Israel hesitated for a few weeks before deciding to vaccinate their 12-17 year olds because the safety profile still favour the vaccine even in light of myocarditis.

""...Based on existing reports, myocarditis after RNA COVID-19 vaccination occurs largely after the second dose. The highest risk subgroup is 12-17 year old males, with 66.7 cases per million second doses and 9.8 per million first doses for a combined total of 76.5 cases per million vaccine recipients.1,2 , **Our results suggest that, even for this high-risk subgroup, the risk of myocarditis from COVID-19 infection is about 5.9 times as great, at a rate of 450 cases per million.** Based on the background rate of myocarditis in this population, the expected rate in the absence of COVID-19 for 90 days would be less than 0.1.15 For 12-17 year old females, myocarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination was 1.1 and 9.1 per million following the first and second doses, for a total of 10.2 per million getting vaccinated.4 Risk of myocarditis from COVID-19 infection was nearly 21 times that rate, with an adjusted rate of 213 cases per million. For both males and females, risk of myocarditis from COVID-19 infection was higher in the 16-19 year-old than the corresponding 12-17 cohort...""

Once the permafrost started to thaw, back in the late 90's it really sealed the deal, because as the permafrost thaws it releases massive amounts of CO2, Methane, and nitrous oxide, which causes more warming, triggering more thawing, it's called a positive feedback loop, and positive feedback loops don't stop until they exhaust all the energy driving the loop, and in this case the energy is all the greenhouse gases trapped in the frozen permafrost, which is twice what is currently in the atmosphere.  

At the rate the permafrost if thawing in about 20 years it will be outputting more greenhouse gases then humans output now, which means if we could magically snap our fingers and eliminate all human greenhouse gases, in 20 years the thawing permafrost will exceed what we output now.   Being granted a wish is the only way we'll be able to reduce our greenhouse gas output, so in 20 years between humans and the thawing permafrost the output of greenhouse gases will **DOUBLE.**    

I actually don't think humans well get that far.  The oceans are becoming warmer and more acidity, from human runoff, plus the addition of all the freshwater coming into the oceans from melting ice.  

This is all really bad for phytoplankton populations.  Phytoplankton is responsible for 50-85% of all the oxygen in the atmosphere, much more important than the rain forests.    As the oceans warm and become more acidity phytoplankton populations are declining, just like any population decline there will be a tipping point when the population crashes to almost nothing.    When that happens the entire marine ecosystem will collapse, because phytoplankton are the basis for the entire marine food chain.    40% of the worlds population relies on the ocean for their primary source of protein.  

Along with the collapse of the marine food chain, oxygen production from the phytoplankton will also crash.  Currently the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere is between 20.8 and 21, the lowest percentage of oxygen that humans need to function normally is 19.5, if the phytoplankton population crashes the oxygen concentration in the atmosphere will drop significantly.

it's also factually wrong to say that kids have no protection of their own. that blanket statement assumes that 100% of kids have 0% chance of their bodies fighting off delta. there have always been and will always be people who are immune to any particular virus, strain, or variant.

Usually you will only see this kind of action being taken when supplies are running out and beds are unavailable.  Usually you will see triage tents go up first, then when those are full you will start to see rationing of care and supplies.  If needs are unable to be met after rationing starts, that's when you start to see people being turned away.  This is usually when you start to see bodies in the streets so to speak.  They will turn away anyone they feel that they can't save or that has such a high chance of survival that they may not need specialized care and can try to handle it at home.  This is also when you will start to see a lot of people dying at home or in parking lots where these triage tents are.  It's nasty stuff.

I took classes and in person training on crisis care and triage care along with working in these facilities where we would get the overflow from the hospital across the street.  Basically anyone who wasn't in the ICU or didn't need specific care that required a doctor on hand, but mostly it was either people who needed rehab or people on their death bed; no children though thankfully.  One of the women who instructed me and later worked as my head nurse, was a triage nurse who worked with the military and took care of the soldiers coming back from front lines.  It was a pretty gory and intense part of my life and I would do it again in a heart beat.  I learned a lot during that time, there was a lot of death but we also helped a lot of people recover.  You learn really fast who is able to survive in an environment like that and who can't; most people don't do well with extended crisis situations.

Onboard the *Diamond Princess*, estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for wild-type SARS-CoV-2 were [as high as 14.8](https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/27/3/taaa030/5766334), about five times estimates from urban Wuhan. Given what we subsequently have learned, that the predominant mode of transmission exhaled persistent aerosols, and the shared ventilation systems common on cruise ships, that R0 seems high to me but plausible. The Delta variant is way more transmissible than wild type was. [This paper](https://academic.oup.com/jtm/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jtm/taab124/6346388?login=true) puts the R0 (in ordinary urban contexts) as 82% higher, [this paper](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.24.2100509#abstract_content) at 97% higher. 

So we're looking at an onboard R0 possibly into the 20s. *Everyone* sharing berths on shared ventilation gets exposed if there's a shedder upstream. And given the older demographics of cruise tourists, that's a lot of breakthrough infections, even if everyone is fully vaccinated. Bring unvaccinated children on board, and they get a 1% chance of hospitalization, 1 in 1000 of death.

Hard to see how the cruise industry survives this (certainly not under current ownership). Probably not a terrible thing, insofar as the environment is concerned.

First, the 3/5ths compromise only applied to slaves, not free African Americans. It also only applied to population counts to determine taxes owed &amp; number of seats in the house, not an individual's freedom or access to rights.

&gt; Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed,¬†three fifths of all other Persons.

Basically, the north said the south needed to pay more taxes, since both sides counted their populations differently. The south said increasing their population count should increase their representation federally. The north didn't want to give slave *owners* extra votes, since that wouldn't represent the wills of the *slaves*. The alternatives (a 0/5th rule or 5/5ths rule) wouldn't have an impact on the legalization of slavery or general civil rights. It's a mess, and it sucks for anyone to hear that their ethnic group would be considered *less than others* in any legal context, but it doesn't have the wide application we commonly think it had.

Second, the Dred Scott Decision concluded that African Americans weren't intended to be recognized as *American Citizens* under the constitution, among other terrible ideas (like removing the federal government's ability to limit the states' abilities to allow slavery). This was shortly before the civil war, overturned decades of compromise between north and south, and increased tensions leading into the civil war. It was also a mess, and this one had *way worse* implications than the 3/5ths compromise, but it was a result of existing fractures in the union rather than an intentional federal decision. 

Lastly, both of these were overruled in the 14th amendment, which means neither was in practice during the civil rights movement a century later*.

I agree that American history is a mess of racism and abuse that is still present to this day, but I think it's more useful to relate the civil rights movement with laws &amp; circumstances of its time, like legalized segregation &amp; limited federal protections for voting rights.

*Note: This is assuming you're referring to the ""civil rights movement"" as the explicit period in the 1950s and 60s, and not the general push for civil rights &amp; protections from the Reconstruction era on.

I think it is possible that the R is similar to the original strain and it just appears higher because the models cannot accurately model the influence of human behavior on the spread. I think there is some room to explain the apparent higher R0 with inadequate control for the fact most people just stopped isolating due to pandemic fatigue. First, Alpha kicked in at a time where people were fatigued and some percentage went back to normal, then after the shots eased restrictions entirely and made a ton of people more comfortable, everyone including unvaccinated went back to full scale normal. It‚Äôs a controversial opinion but I‚Äôll repeat‚Äî all the estimates of increased transmission are based on mathematical models that attempt to control for those factors, not lab studies. I need to see those lab data to believe the variant is inherently more infectious.

But then, even those who wanted a vaccine but couldn't get one for whatever reason will also suffer.

I don't know if I support that route for private insurance. On the one hand, it poses an extreme public health risk and we need to explore options that don't involve putting that emotional burden on doctors and nurses. On the other, I am VERY wary that private health insurance companies will then use the precedent set to punish any and all behavior that is seen as negative to one's health. It'd have to be done very carefully and precisely.

I'd personally like to more vaccine mandates in private establishments and for public sector jobs, and have those fired for failing to comply with said mandates not be able to apply for unemployment. We can't literally force people to take the shot but we can at least turn on the pressure.

A mutation in a vaccinated person that can somehow get around the enhanced immunity that the vaccine caused would be a mutation that would be selected for. IOW, that mutated virus would survive to replicate more, whereas the other viruses would be killed off or disabled in that person by the enhanced immune qualities that they got from the vaccine. So that mutated one is now not stopped by the vaccine. So it will replicate (reproduce) in the person, and if that person infects another vaccinated person, it would be with viruses that are not stopped by the vaccine, rather than the original virus. And so on.

So, unfortunately, the vaccines are creating strong selective pressure on the viruses which will favor any mutations that may reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine. This selective pressure does not occur in infected unvaccinated people.

The bottom line is that the vaccines really do well at preventing a person from getting seriously ill, and in so doing, can keep the hospitals from becoming overloaded. But the vaccines that we have now do not stop the spread.

I haven't seen any superimposed bacterial pneumonia from COVID. It's actually pretty rare. In terms of viral pneumonias, they're definitely more common in adult sized kids (like ones that have undergone puberty). 


There was this weird rash in April where a ton of kids were hospitalized from non COVID coronavirus. That was weird. Mostly kids with trisomy 21 or other comorbidities. Now it's all RSV. 


I've seen more little kids sick from rhino/enterovirus this year than I have from COVID. Last month there was a lot of Coxsackie and adenovirus too. I don't know if the risks are worse than COVID in terms of mortality and long term morbidity. They don't seem worse, but I don't have any data to back that up.

If your kids are at an age where they understand this sort of thing, you may find yourself in the uncomfortable situation of having to gently explain to your kids that no, your family won't be going to your extended family's parties this year, because several of them are refusing to get vaccinated. And your kids may be pissed. Like, REALLY pissed. Like ""Seriously? We gave up a year and change of school and seeing our friends, and Uncle What's His Name is a vaccine skeptic and Cousin What's Her Name refuses to mask or social distance? You mean Aunt Whoever has been endangering Grandma and Grandpa *this whole year*?"" It's possible that my kids will forgive these relatives in the future, but right now they're extremely angry, and it's hard to argue that they're not justified in their feelings.

3. Your child's mental health may take a serious hit, and at the beginning of the pandemic, some areas had long waiting lists for pediatric psychiatrists and therapists. 

4. Speaking of anxiety, if you have people in your household with shit immune systems or other complicating factors, prepare for your kids to potentially start having nightmares about getting covid and accidentally killing their relatives.

The general public is mostly removed from how bad this pandemic truly is. I brougt in a patient to an ICU for kidney failure. He was talking shit about how COVID wasn‚Äôt a big deal and the numbers were made up. I told him 3 of the 7 floors were full of COVID patients and the ICU we were going to would likely be at least 50% covid. 

When we got there a code blue was called on the room next door. I had to wait with him until they were done to transfer care. He asked if there was anywhere else he could go. I told him he should consider himself lucky to have an ICU bed that he waited 12 hours to get, because every other hospital will be full but you can leave against medical advice whenever you want because I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other patients who need this bed to. He told me he was afraid they were going to kill him with covid, there‚Äôs no way all these people had covid before they got here.

I got angry. I was on hour 60 of a marathon shift that turned into a constant sprint. I‚Äôm admittedly burned out but unwilling to give up. I left after telling him ‚ÄúI thought you said COVID isn‚Äôt a big deal‚Äù

I met the nurse at her desk. She was visibly exhausted despite being 4 hours into a shift. ‚ÄúI brought you a nut in SICU XX, he thinks we‚Äôre all in on some conspiracy. Good luck with that.‚Äù 

I ramble but let me close up. I‚Äôll care for 40 something patients over my 96 hour workweek between two jobs. 60% of them will be covid and only a couple of them will be vaccinated.

I don‚Äôt see how vaccine + subsequent infection doesn‚Äôt produce it‚Äôs own extra layer of immunity to delta or other similar mutations. And delta is vastly out competing any other variants so I don‚Äôt see how any other less infectious variants will be able to take hold. 

I don‚Äôt get it, and that headline seems overly sensational honestly. Delta sucks, and yeah, it‚Äôs gonna be everywhere and we‚Äôre still going to catch it but if you‚Äôre vaccinated you have very little to worry about, and after you catch it and recover I don‚Äôt see what the situation could possibly be other than that you‚Äôll have an even stronger immunity from subsequent reinfection. 

I‚Äôm just not going to resort to being caught up in a weird fear that this is somehow forever. We‚Äôre going to be out of this one day and Covid will be endemic yes, but for the vaccinated that‚Äôs nothing to really fear. Is it going to suck a lot for a lot of unvaccinated people? Sure. Will a lot of people die in the mean time? Unfortunately. But one day the whole world will have immune responses to SARS-COV-2 and the mass deaths will be over and for most of us, Covid will be something anywhere between a mild cold to a mild flu. 

My 77 year old vaccinated dad caught delta too. Guess what. He was fine besides feeling like crap for a weekend. Then he got better. Now our household can live free of fear of Covid.

As more adults are vaccinated, children will make up an increasing proportion of the unvaccinated population. It‚Äôs not exactly unexpected that they would also make up an increasing proportion of infections and hospitalizations.

There‚Äôs something else at play here though, which the FDA ignores by design: the FDA thinks only of risks to the children themselves, with absolutely no regard to the threat that unvaccinated children will spread the virus in their community, or to immunocompromised members of their family.

Part of living in society is being willing to take risks to protect others.  It‚Äôs not fair that kids are soldiers in this war, but a war it is.  My 12 year old was, as you said, at almost zero risk of severe consequences from COVID, but she was willing and eager to get the vaccine to beat this enemy.  Many more are also willing to take that risk, including parents.  

Maybe you can say a 5 year old is not capable of making that choice, and parents should not force it on them.  As counterpoint, the risks from the vaccine, at worst, are maybe slightly higher than the risks from the disease.

(First shot) üíâüí™ü©π,dark,text,t2_d6fgv5,False,False,[],"The Health Ministry on Monday rolled out a series of new rules to do with vaccinations, from lowering the eligibility age to 15, introducing fourth doses and speeding up the vaccination period for people who tested positiveChildren aged 15 and above, and children aged 12 and older with chronic illnesses, are now eligible for COVID-19 vaccines in Turkey, authorities announced on Monday.Turkey had last lowered the vaccine eligibility age to 18 in a bid to boost its vaccination program in which more than 83.6 million doses were administered. 

The country also changed the period for the first dose of the vaccine for people who tested positive for the coronavirus. They will now be able to get their first dose a month after they test positive, instead of three months later.

Under new rules, a fourth dose will be available for people vaccinated with their third dose, 21 days after their last vaccination. Health Minister Fahrettin Koca later clarified that only those traveling abroad will be required to have received a fourth dose. As some countries require two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for entry, people who have received two doses of the Chinese Sinovac and one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, will be able to get a second dose of the latter vaccine as a fourth dose, according to the Health Ministry. ‚ÄúNo additional doses are required for people who had their two doses of messenger RNA (mrNA) vaccine or three doses of inactive vaccine,‚Äù Koca tweeted, referring to the two vaccines available in the country.Vaccination is vital for the country, especially amid concerns about the delta and delta plus variants. 

Though vaccination is not mandatory, the Health Ministry repeatedly appeals to the public to have their jabs. The country lifted almost all restrictions, including curfews, on July 1, after a decline in cases thanks to the accelerated vaccination campaign with the arrival of more vaccines from China‚Äôs Sinovac and Germany‚Äôs Pfizer-BioNTech. Yet, vaccine hesitancy took hold in some provinces and certain age groups. Without vaccination, there are fears of a fourth wave of the pandemic occurring. Any slowdown in the vaccination drive also worries the public, who experts still urge to stay away from crowds.The rise in daily COVID-19 cases, which fell below 19,000 on Sunday after fluctuating around and above 20,000 for a long time, is blamed on the unvaccinated. Professor Ata Nevzat Yal√ßƒ±n, an infectious diseases expert at Akdeniz University of Antalya, said that in their hospital 90% of COVID-19 patients in intensive care were people who did not receive their vaccines. The unvaccinated also make up 40% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at the university's hospital, he told Demir√∂ren News Agency (DHA) Monday.

Yal√ßƒ±n said that the unvaccinated were unable to gain sufficient immunity against the coronavirus and suffered from a severe bout of the illness. ""The vaccines prevent people from ending up at intensive care and/or hospitalization,"" Yal√ßƒ±n said. ""The rate of people with both doses of vaccine is still around 37%. This number should exceed 60%. We need a faster vaccination, especially before the autumn, when respiratory infection cases increases,"" Yal√ßƒ±n said. Yal√ßƒ±n also said that the three doses of vaccination were good for protecting people for nine months but more doses could be required after that period.

Increasing the number of vaccinations depends on ""persuasion"" as Turkey mobilized everything, from securing sufficient supplies of jabs for the population to lowering the vaccine eligibility age. The Health Ministry already runs awareness campaigns to convince more to get their jabs. Mobile health care crews go door-to-door in 81 provinces to talk the unvaccinated into getting their doses.

Associate professor Ersin Uygun, a psychiatry expert, said the persuasion efforts should focus on the ""undecided"" instead of ""anti-vaxxers."" Undecided or reluctant citizens are among the majority abstaining from vaccines according to authorities. Anti-vaxxers, on the other hand, thrive on social media where conspiracy theories flourish.

Uygun told Anadolu Agency (AA) that the people who are reluctant ""are worried what the vaccines would do to them. It is wrong to approach these people as though they are 'threatening the life of others.' We have to understand their concerns and should not act in a forceful way,"" he said.Uygun said the concerns of people who are reluctant to receive their jabs were triggered by the ""swift process"" in the pandemic. ""There has been a race to find the first vaccine. Phase trials were accelerated and vaccines received emergency approval. This worried people and made them unsure whether the vaccines would be harmful to their health in the long run. In Turkey example, different data on the efficiency of the first available vaccine (China's CoronaVac) in different countries also fuelled concerns among people. For other vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech jab), data on its likely cardiac side effect drove up concerns though it was an infrequent side effect. These may be nothing compared to the fatal impact of the coronavirus but for some people, it evolved into something of concern,"" he said.",,,,1629115808,{},h95bh1i,True,t3_p5es0n,False,False,t3_p5es0n,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p5es0n/turkey_lowers_covid19_vaccination_age_to_15/h95bh1i/,1629182203.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, the risk level won't change much for a given area during the pandemic regardless of how fast the virus is spreading.

Daily new cases per 100k marks how bad things are right now, and infection rate indicates how quickly things are going to get worse (or better)

Vermont looks much better than the south on daily new cases per 100k -- however the infection rate is currently 1.36 in Vermont and 1.15 in Florida -- so covid is actually spreading faster in Vermont than Flordia at the moment.

'daily new cases per 100k' is a bit like velocity and 'infection rate' is a bit like acceleration.

While it is great that the Daily New Cases in Vermont is much lower than the south, it is concerning that the peak infection rates in highly vaccinated states matched the rates in states with low vaccination rates.

This seems to suggest that with the new, more contagious delta variant, the original projecting of 70% vaccination is too low now (as would be expected). That is unfortunately, since 30% of the population seems hellbent on not getting vaccinated.

Alas, all I can do is wait to get a 3rd shot -- hopefully with added delta power, and make plans to stay in my workshop until this passes over.

Needless to say I'm nervous and scared to death. If I could take all of the virus into me I'd do it in a heartbeat but I don't want anything to happen to my mom. We had done everything so well during the pandemic but we were let down by somebody we thought we could trust.

We all have our vaccines, but we're in West Virginia. Our state was tossing them at whoever wanted them super early, so we all got our vaccines in March, with the second dose in April. I feel like that bit us in the ass because it's been five months since her second shot and I worry that will make my mom more susceptible to it.

At the moment we're trying to get everybody to quarantine but it's difficult because the youngest has autism and has a hard time comprehending the severity of the virus and why we all have to keep our guard up around the house.

We are in rural small town of ~2,000 people. Our town is now at very high risk of transmission.

That announcement also reinforced that masks are still optional and that it is ""recommended"" that if your child is symptomatic they stay home or wear a mask to school. 

I didn't major in math but logic and basic data would indicate this is already widely spreading through our small town. I ignorantly assumed if our community started having increased cases or if the district had confirmed cases then proper protocols like mask mandates would be put into place.

After explaining our daughter wouldn't be attending for the time being due to health and safety concerns, the email response I received from the pre-k teacher was reassurance that they clean and sanitize as much as possible to prevent the spread of germs. That's all fine a good but what good does cleaning and sanitizing do if nothing is implemented to prevent the spread of a respiratory virus?! 

Like the lack of actual logic and give a shit is so concerning.

[],,Maxcactus,,,[],,,,text,t2_1vwn,False,True,[],"Most days during the coronavirus pandemic, Cardinal Raymond L. Burke could be found strolling down the streets of Rome maskless and carrying rosary beads. The 73-year-old conservative cardinal was an early critic of social distancing and, later, an unabashed skeptic of the vaccine.
On Tuesday, Burke announced he had tested positive for the coronavirus. Now, the cardinal is in a hospital bed in his native Wisconsin, breathing with the help of a ventilator.
‚ÄúDoctors are encouraged by his progress,‚Äù Burke‚Äôs press team tweeted Saturday night. ""[His Eminence] faithfully prayed the Rosary for those suffering from the virus. ‚Ä¶ Let us now pray the Rosary for him.‚Äù
The Vatican did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Sunday.
A former archbishop of St. Louis, Burke made a name for himself as an outspoken conservative figure in the mid-2000s. In 2004, he refused to give Communion to then-Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kerry because the Democrat was an abortion rights advocate. In 2007, Burke resigned from the board of a Catholic hospital in protest of its invitation for Sheryl Crow, who is also an advocate, to play at a benefit concert.
Two years later, he excoriated the University of Notre Dame for giving former president Barack Obama an honorary degree. In an interview, Burke said that Catholics who voted for Obama ‚Äúcollaborated with evil.‚Äù
During the global pandemic, Burke spoke out against vaccine mandates, claiming the practice ‚Äúviolates the integrity of its citizens.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhile the State can provide reasonable regulations for the safeguarding of health, it is not the ultimate provider of health. God is,‚Äù he said during a May 2020 address.
U.S. bishops splinter on the morality of taking coronavirus vaccines
Burke also repeated false information about vaccines, claiming that some believe there should be a ‚Äúmicrochip ‚Ä¶ placed under the skin of every person, so that at any moment he or she can be controlled by the state regarding health and about other matters which we can only imagine.‚Äù
The cardinal further condemned the use of abortion-derived cells in vaccine development as ‚Äúrightly abhorrent,‚Äù saying it is ‚Äúnever morally justified to develop a vaccine through the use of the cell lines of aborted fetuses.‚Äù
Burke‚Äôs comments were misleading ‚Äî both Pfizer and Moderna used cell lines derived from fetal tissue taken from elective abortions in the 1970s and 1980s to test whether the vaccines worked. In a statement last December, the Vatican called the vaccines ‚Äúmorally acceptable.‚Äù Pope Francis received the Pfizer vaccine, and in February, the Vatican City governor said employees who do not take a vaccine could be fired.
Burke did not reveal whether he got the vaccine.
The cardinal‚Äôs conservative opinions propelled his career in the past, catching the attention of then-Pope Benedict XVI, who appointed Burke to run the Vatican‚Äôs highest court in 2008, making him the church‚Äôs most senior-ranking American. Benedict promoted Burke to cardinal in 2010.
Burke‚Äôs influence in the Vatican was ephemeral, though. He soon clashed with Francis, who is known for his liberal beliefs. In an interview with BuzzFeed News in October 2014, Burke criticized Francis, claiming he had ‚Äúdone a lot of harm.‚Äù He noted Francis‚Äôs comments on homosexuality: ‚ÄúThe pope is not free to change the church‚Äôs teachings with regard to the immorality of homosexual acts.‚Äù
ADVERTISING


In an interview that same month with Vida Nueva, a Spanish Catholic publication, Burke questioned Francis‚Äôs leadership.
‚ÄúMany have expressed their concerns to me. At this very critical moment, there is a strong sense that the church is like a ship without a rudder,‚Äù Burke said.
By November 2014, Francis demoted Burke from overseeing the high court and gave him a ceremonial title as the patron of the charity the Sovereign Order of Malta.
Cardinal Burke discusses secularization of U.S. government

In a May 2014 interview with the Archdiocese of St. Louis before the canonization of Pope John Paul II, Cardinal Raymond Burke says ""freedom of conscience"" is being diminished by government, including through laws on abortion and marriage rights. (Archdiocese of St. Louis via YouTube)
Former highest-ranking U.S. cardinal blames ‚Äòfeminization‚Äô for the Catholic Church‚Äôs problems
Burke continued to speak out on controversial topics. In 2015, he criticized the modernization of the Church and said he feared that it was becoming too feminine. He said men had been alienated by decisions to let women take part in ceremonial activities, such as the move to allow female altar assistants starting in 1983.
‚ÄúThe activities in the parish and even the liturgy have been influenced by women and become so feminine in many places that men do not want to get involved,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMen are often reluctant to become active in the church. The feminized environment and the lack of the church‚Äôs effort to engage men has led many men to simply opt out.‚Äù

In 2015, Burke said in an interview with LifeSiteNews, an antiabortion website, that gay people and divorc√©es are as bad as ‚Äúthe person who murders someone.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf you are living publicly in a state of mortal sin there isn‚Äôt any good act that you can perform that justifies that situation: the person remains in grave sin,‚Äù he continued.",,,,1629127094,{},h95zsu5,True,t3_p5i4gh,False,True,t3_p5i4gh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p5i4gh/a_conservative_cardinal_who_criticized_the/h95zsu5/,1629194090.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the key points, ""If you came into close contact with someone with COVID-19 get tested 3-5 days after the date of your exposure and wear a mask in public indoor settings for 14 days after exposure or until a negative test result.""

From the later section, ""Fully vaccinated people with no COVID-like symptoms following an exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19"": ""Fully vaccinated people should monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 for 14 days following an exposure.""

How do these items reconcile?  I understand that monitoring is not isolating or quarantining, but is there indication that those who were fully vaccinated and exposed to a known positive case should be doing either or both of those things?

To put this into context.  On Saturday, 8/7, a friend and I had spent the day together, in close proximity and without masks.  Both of us are fully vaccinated.  On Monday, 8/9, friend was not feeling well, and at the urging of a coworker, suggested he gets tested.  He was then tested on Wednesday, 8/11, and received a positive result on Thursday, 8/12.  I then was tested on Friday, 8/13, and received a rapid test and PCR test, both yielding negative results.

There are still cases of people still able to catch covid, thankfully those vaccinated get a much weaker affect than those who chose/unable to vaccinate. This is why we still need to wear masks, because you can still be a carrier.

Unfortunately, due to several factors (USA buying up much of the world's supply of vaccines, Anti vaxxers, supply chains, those who are unable to be vaccinated) the virus is able to mutate and become stronger.

From the cdc:

""Vaccines contain the same germs that cause disease. (For example, measles vaccine contains measles virus, and Hib vaccine contains Hib bacteria.) But they have been either killed or weakened to the point that they don‚Äôt make you sick. Some vaccines contain only a part of the disease germ.

A vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce antibodies, exactly like it would if you were exposed to the disease. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first.

This is what makes vaccines such powerful medicine. Unlike most medicines, which treat or cure diseases, vaccines prevent them. ""

[],,Wurm42,,,[],,,,text,t2_3e3ec,False,False,,"&gt;I just wonder if anyone ever floated the possibility of have at least one major hospital that refused to accept any covid positive patients, so that the vaccinated who have need of medical care can get it. If that's even a plausible thing. Test before admittance to an emergency room. 

The hospitals in the Washington DC area tried to do this starting in fall 2020. Designate some hospitals for Covid patients and some for non-Covid. In the end, they were able to concentrate Covid patients at certain hospitals, but not to keep any hospitals Covid-free.

Testing was one problem. Maybe today we could give all ambulances a stack of the at-home 20 minute rapid tests, but that wasn't an option in fall and winter last year. Plus, if an ambulance picks up a patient in acute respiratory distress, the way to help them is to get the patient into care at an ER as fast as possible. You can't park somewhere and wait for the test to come back, then decide which hospital to drive to. 

Another problem was that people develop Covid AFTER they're admitted. You probably already know that COVID-19 has a long incubation time, about 10 days. It can be longer in someone with a weak immune system. In fact, Covid loves to emerge as a secondary infection when patients have been weakened by surgery or some other medical issue. 

So what do you do when somebody tests negative for Covid before admission to the hospital for planned heart surgery, but then tests positive a couple days after the surgery, when they're still in the critical care unit? Moving them at that point is incredibly risky. 

So you could send all the planned Covid admissions to particular hospitals, but even the hospitals that weren't supposed to focus on Covid patients still got them from the ER and from people who tested positive after admission, even if they were admitted for a non-Covid medical problem.",,,,1629069342,{},h939gt1,False,t3_p4quo4,False,True,t1_h92qcoz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4quo4/we_cannot_stretch_anymore_hospital_leaders_on/h939gt1/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,74a7c240c54c14b22b3c3dd5809084f07f465b5b,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1629069353.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

The shipment was disguised as paper greeting cards and upon reading the description in the shipment manifest, customs and border patrol officers ""already knew what it was,"" the agency said in a statement. 

&gt;The shipment was on route to the central business district of New Orleans but was intercepted at at the port of Memphis. The agency said it was the 15th such shipment that night and inside were ""51 low quality, counterfeit COVID-19 vaccination cards."" 

&gt;The cards look like real vaccine verification cards with blanks for name, birthdate, vaccine brand and other information, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and prevention logo. However, the cards had typos, unfinished words and some Spanish words that were misspelled, the agency said. 

&gt;The officers also knew the shipment was counterfeit because it was imported by a non-CDC or medical entity. ""This was not the first time they had seen this shipper,"" the agency said. Such shipments are described as ""Paper Greeting Cards/Use For-Greeting Card,"" or ""PAPER PAPER CARD"" and they are always from China.

&gt;The fake vaccine cards come in packs of 20, 51 and 100 and there are never any attempts to conceal them, the agency said. Memphis isn't the only place these counterfeits have been intercepted, however, officers in the city have seized 121 of these shipments, totaling 3,017 of these vaccination cards.

&gt;The contraband are all over the United States, the agency said. Selling, buying or using counterfeit COVID-19 cards is a crime, the FBI says.

&gt;It can be categorized as the unauthorized use of an official government agency seal and violators could face a fine and up to five years in prison.

&gt;""These vaccinations are free and available everywhere,"" Michael Neipert, area port director of Memphis, said in a statement. ""If you do not wish to receive a vaccine, that is your decision. But don't order a counterfeit, waste my officer's time, break the law, and misrepresent yourself."" 

&gt;Neipert said ordering a fake vaccine card uses officers' time ""as they also seize fentanyl and methamphetamines.""

&gt;On Sunday, New York Senator Chuck Schumer called for a federal crackdown on fake vaccine cards, demanding U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the FBI join forces with Department of Health and Human Services to start a campaign to thwart the counterfeit cards and make clear that they could land people in federal prison, the Associated Press reports.",,,,1629144442,{},h977vfz,True,t3_p5nwk2,False,True,t3_p5nwk2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p5nwk2/more_than_3000_fake_vaccine_cards_from_china/h977vfz/,1629217909.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; One massive analysis of Delta transmission comes from the UK REACT-1 programme, led by a team at Imperial College London, which tests more than 100,000 UK volunteers every few weeks. The team ran Ct analyses for samples received in May, June and July, when Delta was rapidly replacing other variants to become the dominant driver of COVID-19 in the country. **The results suggested that among people testing positive, those who had been vaccinated had a lower viral load on average than did unvaccinated people. Paul Elliott, an epidemiologist at Imperial, says that these results differ from other Ct studies because this study sampled the population at random and included people who tested positive without showing symptoms.**

Bottom line, adults are more than half vaccinated and are hospitalized 10x more.  It suggests it is 95% less risky for minors.   The means not high risk.

And seriously, if you know of any way to support charities or anything else up there vaccinating people, please do so. You don't want to be where we are and if your part of the country avoids it that will be such a win.

I think where the tough part is (and where there is a lot of frustration in the south right now from vaxxed folk) what happens when there is no political will to impose state/local mandates? Do we just keep bouncing along and watch our healthcare systems disintegrate (for everybody, including people who have more routine things happen to them like car accidents or appendicitis or cancer, etc.) or should we try to do something about vaccines and if so, what?

Florida is a great example.  There are a lot of really annoying things coming out of the governor there, but at the end of the day he barely won election (we're talking like several tens of thousands of votes while the state was playing sketchy with some voting rights restoration laws for ex-felons). So a lot of people there are suffering for something that they literally said they specifically didn't want. It is the tyranny of at best a minority of antivaxers  and there are a lot of people there who don't deserve what is happening to them.

It's more a question of what can be done today realistically that will make a near-term difference in keeping people alive.  Theoretically, there is always the possibility of getting better healthcare to not dead people. To make change now, that is likely tied to either requiring people to spend their own money (through premiums or some form of hospital bill) or having employment restrictions (which makes me nervous when talking about tying it to low wage jobs, but seems like a good option for professional jobs and healthcare (all levels, just way too much exposure to vulnerable populations). Unfortunately, there is going to have to be some penalty here to work.

The only realistic alternative is I think letting people see the consequences of crushing the healthcare system and hope that convinces them.

Hey parents, did you plan to raise your children in the context of a society that provides schooling and daycare options?! Well, SURPRISE, the parts of society that were most helpful to you have collapsed!  Now you are solely responsible for providing all care and schooling for your children, but WAIT THERE‚ÄôS MORE, because you *still* have to do your regular full time jobs as well!  Prepare yourself for the long term sensation of simultaneously failing at multiple tasks!  Also, did you think you would at least have family help and support? Well, SURPRISE AGAIN, because your children could literally kill their grandparents, so waive goodbye for more than a year.  Now you are the *only* social interaction for your confused and lonely children.  Try to fit in video chats when you can, in between schooling full time and working full time.

Also, on top of everything, there's still all the fear and axiety associated with knowing your children could be exposed to an unknown and new virus.

Since the aircraft are contracted from aviation companies which fly for other air ambulance services, I'm going to assume that these are probably typical models of airplane for the purpose.

As /u/Goofygrrl notes, planes have to land at an airport which is a logistical disadvantage. However, planes can fly faster and have a longer range than helicopters so there's a tradeoff. For example, one of ALNW's [infographics](https://www.uwmedicine.org/sites/stevie/files/2019-07/Western.Washington_alnw_Final_forWeb_072519.pdf) says that the Pilatus flies at 292 MPH and has a range of 800 miles, and the Learjet flies at 500 MPH and has a range of 1380 miles. Their helicopters fly at 150 MPH and have a range of 150 miles. (They also note that the Pilatus is preferred when flying to smaller airports, so I bet ""is your airport's runway long enough to land our jet"" is yet another factor which must be considered.)

HCM City was the first locality in Vi·ªát Nam to allow asymptomatic patients with a low viral load, no underlying disease or obesity, and stable underlying medical conditions to quarantine at home.    
  
This helps reduce the overload at medical facilities, according to the city Department of Health.     
  
Local health officials monitor them every day.  
  
When they start to have symptoms such as temperature of above 38 degrees Celsius, sore throat, diarrhoea, loss of taste, or shortness of breath, they can call 1022, extensions 3 and 4, to get advice from doctors at the HCM City Medical Association, the city Centre for Diseases Control and Prevention, hospitals, or the Th·∫ßy thu·ªëc ƒë·ªìng h√†nh network of physicians.  
  
‚ÄúI am experiencing shortness of breath. Has my condition worsened?‚Äù was a question a patient asked at 1022, Assoc. Prof. Dr Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Bay of the HCM City University of Medicine and Pharmacy, one of the doctors on 1022, said.    
  
‚ÄúAfter hearing a patient say that, I told her to lie down and place a hand on her abdomen to count the number of times it rises and falls in one minute.  
  
‚ÄúMore than 20 breaths per minute would be worrisome.  
  
‚ÄúThe patient was reassured with the clear explanations about her health status and instructions on what she should do next.‚Äù  
  
Through calls from asymptomatic patients at home and their relatives, she has realised that many of them are anxious and fearful, and timely consultation by a doctor is imperative.  
  
The doctors providing consultancy on the hotline have also been asked many questions about vaccination such as side effects and ambulances to transport them to designated hospitals after their condition worsened.  
  
In the case of the latter, doctors also guide patients‚Äô relatives about emergency aid for patients while waiting for the ambulance besides sending patients‚Äô information to the Department of Health and other relevant agencies for assistance with transporting to and admission at designated hospitals.    
  
The hotline 1022 is available 24 hours a day.

The Department of Health has collaborated with the Th·∫ßy thu·ªëc ƒë·ªìng h√†nh network of physicians to set up one more hotline at 093.95.96.999 for COVID patients and those who suspect they have contracted it and are isolated at home.  
  
The consultancy is provided by health centres in all 22 districts and Th·ªß ƒê·ª©c City in co-operation with the Th·∫ßy thu·ªëc ƒë·ªìng h√†nh network of physicians.  
  
It also helps classify high-risk groups who need to be hospitalised for treatment by sending their information to community-based COVID teams, task forces in districts, wards and communes and the 115 Emergency Aid Centre.  
  
If a person takes more than 30 breaths per minute and their peripheral oxygen saturation is less than 95 per cent, they should call 115 or commune, ward or districts task force for emergency aid and transportation to hospitals.  
  
Dr Tr∆∞∆°ng H·ªØu Khanh, former head of the infectious and nervous diseases department at the city‚Äôs Paediatrics Hospital No 1, has a Facebook fanpage and Zalo group for patients and their relatives, and his consultancy has guided helped many patients‚Äô families.       
  
In T√¢n B√¨nh District‚Äôs Ward 5, the local health centre and H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh Communist Youth Union have also set up a similar Zalo group.  
  
Tr∆∞∆°ng Nguy·ªÖn Phong, secretary of the ward youth union, said free oxygen cylinders and concentrators would be provided to COVID patients at home whose condition becomes worse and need life support while waiting for transportation to hospital.  
  
The union has 10 cylinders and three concentrators, all small and easily taken to homes of patients living in alleys, he said.  
  
The youth union‚Äôs 17 members are available 24 hours a day to take them to patients‚Äô houses, he said.     
  
Nguy·ªÖn L√™ Trung Hi·∫øu, chairman of the B√¨nh T√¢n District unit of the Vi·ªát Nam Youth Federation, said members of the federation and district youth union are providing free oxygen cylinders to patients at home under a programme called Oxygen ATM carried out in co-operation with the Vietnam Young Entrepreneurs Association and PHG Smart home.  
  
To get oxygen cylinders for patients quarantined at home, people need to contact 08.1934.1900 or phone numbers or the Facebook fanpage of the federation at districts and wards.  
  
L·∫°i ƒê√¨nh Ho√†ng, chairman of the Vi·ªát Nam Youth Federation in the district‚Äôs B√¨nh Tr·ªã ƒê√¥ng A ward, said he got information about a senior couple with COVID needing oxygen because one of them got an asthma attack.  
  
They did not have a flow regulator available, and so he rode to many medical stores around the ward to buy one, he said.

If Florida got a new death record we won't know until the weekend... but by then the realtime shock value is over... The Floridian Governor may have successfully killed the climax. Or will it get so high that data manipulation can't hide it?

Some have realized it but its not going to be some mass floridian acceptance of it finally. The vaccination rate went up a little bit but I guess then it went back down. Maybe if a statewide official got it and died, it would get serious to a significant more, but that would just cement the thought the vaccine doesn't work.

Being the dominant strain is a good point to consider it the primary driver of covid numbers.

I then tried to find what percent of covid cases in the us are delta currently.  Couldn't quickly find a solid number for today (not surprisingly), but I found it was 83% of cases and 97% percent of hospitalizations as of July 22nd. https://www.umassmed.edu/news/news-archives/2021/07/delta-variant-spurring-uptick-in-covid-19-cases-largely-in-unvaccinated/

PICUs (Pediatric ICUs in case anyone is unfamiliar with the acronym) filling up is an even newer phenomenon.  There really has not been time to get good numbers or science on it, yet.  It's basically just employees in the hardest hit states saying ""This is very out of the ordinary and we need to look at what's going on.""  It's happened to enough of them that they're absolutely looking into it, but they don't have results yet.

This is only partially true, we think that Delta may be associated with faster reproduction, but  It also has to do with the fact that intramuscular vaccines (all current Covid-19 vaccines) don't elicit high mucosal immunity. The virus may start to reproduce in the upper airways, but as soon as your immune system figures out what's going on you fight off the infection.  With a faster reproduction rate you may be more likely to notice this, where with OG Covid your body was probably fighting it off before it had a chance to do anything at all.

I don't know how many we're missing now, but it's a decent amount as anyone with mild symptoms who is vaxxed is typically not going for a test. And back at the peak, we didn't have enough tests. So both now and back then have us looking at unreliable figures with too many variables to allow us to correlate/compare the numbers with any level of meaningful certainty. That's why it's always been more important in my opinion to focus on numbers that are actually definitively provable - hospitalizations. Even death counts were underestimated throughout the pandemic with the consensus seeming to be that we missed around half of all deaths. 

Bottom line - if you want to know how serious it is in your area, pay more attention to hospitalizations. This also is the only number that really matters if you're vaxxed.

So this is mostly due to math; the more people you have vaccinated in a population (assuming not 100% efficacy, which no vaccine is) , you will of course see more people in the hospital.

Flu isn't a good comparison either, because you have different strains every year whereas Covid-19 variants are not biochemically/functionally different enough to be considered a new strain.

Ideally we'd require both vaccination AND negative test.  Then just scale our testing infrastructure to the moon.

That would tank the numbers pretty quickly and keep them low. 

The stupid thing is: we have the money/resources to actually implement this. It's purely politics.  We could easily scale this out with quick testing infrastructure everywhere.  It would actually be cheaper than fighting covid in hospitals.

As long as people are spreading it, it's going to spread and that's a bad thing. Mutations are real, this is just the theory of evolution in practice just on a crazy fast timeline.  There's a reason people like Fauci are so concerned about mutations right now.

Could be because of moderna‚Äôs higher dose, could be because of the slightly longer moderna interval‚Ä¶or could not even be true and just something whacky in the data.

Some answers to your questions :) 

1. I got vaccinated AFTER getting covid, so my case was not a breakthrough case.

2. My physical test showed extremely low levels of Vitamin D (2 weeks post covid) which I attribute to the severity of my case + 104 degree fever for 4 days.

3. My gf had covid but didn‚Äôt suffer as much as I did‚Äîaside from a positive covid test, her symptoms were similar to a slight cold/allergy 

4. I worked in data analysis (was let go) and my long covid symptoms have totally fckd my skills up‚ÄîI‚Äôm finding exercise, dietary changes, and low dose antidepressant (buproprion) have helped with energy levels and slight clearing of brain fog.

Things that are meant to be means to an end typically become ends in themselves due to the polarization of our culture. The non ideological position is to define a goal, and test how well various strategies meet that goal, and then implement the effective strategies. However, we have already seen a decent into Heuristics used over reasoned objective analysis.  

Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions have differing levels of effectiveness on an individual than on a population level. Ignoring cumulative effects of groups causes people to make bad decisions based on NPI efficacy rates between any two given individuals. There is good evidence that masks are effective at blocking transmission between two individuals during a passing interaction indoors. Most peer reviewed studies seem to fall into a range a 10-75% efficacy against particles in the range of the aerosols that COVID-19 can transmitted by, depending on mask fit and material. As you would expect, lose fitting cloth masks trend towards the bottom and high quality masks are at the top of that range.

However, because even smart people are bad at probabilities, they improperly extend this number as the general level of protection to large group scenarios. A great formula to help explain this was created the the National Academy of Science, where Re can be estimated to be reduced by the following factor (1 ‚àí epm)¬≤ , where e is the efficacy of trapping viral particles inside the mask, and pm is the percentage of the population that wears masks. If we look at a scenario like healthcare, where we have high compliance (95%) and good masks (75%), we reduce the Re by over 10x. However, in say, the grocery store, if we have 50% compliance, and 20% cloth mask efficacy, and everyone is equally likely to transmit, we only reduce the Re by 19%. But in fact it's even worse than that, because of the venn diagram of vaccination and mask compliance. If we were able to say, get 80% of the vaccinated to wear cloth mask, it would be a 30% reduction in the transmission from that group, but if that group is only contributing 10-15% of transmission, then unfortunately the effect may be minimal. 

This is why the vast majority of studies which look at mask efficacy recommend other measures in addition to masks to reduce the spread of the virus. The more you let people mix, the more you revert to the mean of adherence, which below a certain threshold reduces the benefit exponentially.  

The entire point of this is to say, that from my point of view we have already passed the point from pandemic control measures being about which measures are most appropriate and in what circumstances to achieve a specified goal, to an ideological crusade. High quality masks can be a great way to protect you as an individual from getting sick as a secondary precaution, or if vaccination is not effective in your specific circumstance. They can not, however, work miracles, especially when compliance is low, other measures are not being observed, the masks are of low quality, and the current strain is producing higher viral loads. But because we live in an all or nothing culture, masks are either tyranny, or their efficacy is infallible. This is why I worry about emergency protocols becoming permanent, because we have already passed the point where we are willing to treat NPI's with respect to their efficacy, and have instead made them about group conformity. Shutting down in person dining and putting capacity limits in place aren't as sexy, and it's harder to make them into an ideological statement, so they aren't being considered. 

So while I agree with your point in principle, I think that politics, Red or Blue, will be the only thing determining when and what kind of measures are put in place.",,,,1629137815,{},h96r9ca,False,t3_p5dpml,False,False,t1_h9660m1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p5dpml/can_the_vaccinated_develop_long_covid_after_a/h96r9ca/,1629208462.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

My first memory is a migraine. I was out of school sick constantly as a kid. Like, for real sick, not faking it, lol. I'm not sure if it was because I grew up in a home with a chain smoker until I was 20 or what, but I get bronchitis, pneumonia, flu, etc every single year. My kids, on the other hand, are a picture of health. They usually get perfect attendance. They can sneeze one time and I'm sick, though. It's crazy. When they wore masks, that was the healthiest year of my life. From about March of 2020 until February of last year, no one got sick. Then my daughter got the flu! Flu B to be precise. We have no idea where she got it. No one we knew had it, we weren't doing social visits, so it had to have been from school. Maybe she got it at lunch when they took their masks off? I'm not sure. Anyway, you would not believe how many people went nuts over her having the flu. ""They're not testing for the flu. The flu isn't a thing anymore. They're making everything Covid."" My poor kids and husband had to have SO many covid tests last year. They tested them for the flu every single time. When masks mandates were dropped, suddenly everyone got the flu. Stomach bug started going back around again. No one can figure out why. ""But I thought all these things went away because Covid is popular."" They never went away... People just washed their hands more and wore masks so it was protecting people from other things than Covid!! It makes sense, but for some reason, people just do not want to see sense down here. I will never understand it. I'm so glad you're getting out of here. I'm sorry you didn't get to move when you wanted to, I'm jealous it's so soon. My younger two said they'd be fine if we moved now, but my mom moved me around when I was in high school. It's not exactly fun being the new kid. I'm sure they'd be fine, but I really don't want to put them through that, and they have friends and activities and are happy here, for the most part. They do have a few like minded friends with like minded parents, so we're not completely alone. My older son is in college, so he'll be able to move with us if he wants to, when we're ready. 4 years really isn't \*that\* far away. The way this past year has gone, it seriously makes me wonder what life will even look like in 4 years. I'm not sure things will ever be ""normal"" until people take this seriously. It is possible to take it seriously and live your life. I just don't understand why people won't do that. Sorry for the rant.

Before vaccines, you basically had to remove viable hosts from the path of the disease. It was both harder and easier to do before vaccines. 

On one hand, there were fewer people in the world and they were generally more spaced out. The general populace wasn't traveling for leisure and were only exposed to a relatively small portion of an area's overall population. Once the disease infected all viable hosts within that bubble, it couldn't spread anymore. Pockets of infection would appear, then burn out without necessarily spreading to other locations.

On the other hand, prior to vaccines, people didn't really know what caused the illnesses, so they were less prepared (knowledge wise) for how to deal with the spread of infection.

If you have a 504/IEP you can call a meeting, but the clock for that starts ticking on the first day of school, and they have a set number of days to convene an IEP meeting, at which point you may be able to get a change in placement to homebound education (maybe). But then all the paperwork has to get done and signed and pushed through. So at this point your kid may have missed several weeks of school and - oh wait, truancy laws!  Some districts are just awful enough to pursue truancy on you even when you're working with them on a medical issue.

If you don't have an existing 504 or IEP, you can't start the process until the first day of school, and that also can take a lot of time.

And then, let's say they don't go along with any of it, and you have to pursue it as a violation of the child's FAPE rights.  Even more time lost. 

So while yes, absolutely, every parent of a high risk kid should be pushing their districts, the fact is, if a district doesn't have a plan by now, those high risk kids are going to be losing out even more. Which backs parents even further into a corner.

In a twisted way, this is a testament to modern medicine.

Hear me out.

Pre-Covid, most diseases just didn't enter most peoples' lives. Post-childhood, the worst that any of these people have had to deal with is a cold or a flu. A sniffle here, ""down for a few days"" there.

The average person in a scientifically bountiful country has managed to avoid coming down with any number of diseases, either through science (eg, water treatment protocols) or vaccines, etc.

So to them, getting sick is ""just the sniffles"", because that's litally been their entire world their entire life. I'll take this a step further and speculate that their families haven't been touched by cancer, either. Anything else is ""that's just what happens when you get old"".

Their ignorance is the result of their society's successes. Things are running smoothly, so why learn how science works? Throw in a prayer when you're feeling blah, and woo, you get better! Nevermind that your body was busy getting shit done behind the scenes.

To these people, common sense tells them that humans just don't get horribly sick, and certainly not on a rapidly growing global scale. Oh, the 1918 flu? Yeah that was a ""then"" problem, humans are much more resilient now.

Renewables and electric cars are both posed to become cheaper than fossil fuels. Companies are starting to listen in being more environmentally conscious, but they're the ones being the biggest holdup to the process. But the good news is that countries are starting to get into a pissing contest for who's the best at getting renewables online, so that'll definitely influence things. I'm seeing some signs of rich companies and people starting to get into it as well. Also, people with the $$$$$ like living in places near the coast and would like their houses to not fall into the ocean. Basically, due to selfishness, being cheap, and pissing contests, we might have a shot when combined with people that actually want to save the world.

The big difference with COVID is that the rich can easily just seclude themselves and get the vaccines while saving money. There's no arms race to prove superiority, either. What you can invest in and hope to make a profit with regarding COVID is limited; the retooling of large parts of the economy has endless potential for investments rich people can brag about to other rich people about if they do well.

*Isn't she still also the Queen of England?*

This is only as correct as calling her the Queen of London or Queen of Hull; she is the Queen of the place that these places are in, but the title doesn't exist.

No, just pedantic.

‚Ä¢N. sativa L. is a herbal medicine with antiviral and immunomodulatory activities suggested for COVID-19.  
  
‚Ä¢This exploratory open-label randomized controlled trial showed a potential efficacy of N. sativa L. oil for mild COVID-19.  
  
‚Ä¢N. sativa L. oil was associated with an increased rate of recovery of symptoms in adult patients with mild COVID-19 in this open label trial.  
  
  
Abstract  
Background  
Effective treatment for Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is under intensive research. Nigella sativa oil (NSO) is a herbal medicine with antiviral and immunomodulatory activities, and has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of NSO treatment in patients with COVID-19.  
  
Methods  
All adult patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms presented to King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, were recruited for an open label randomized clinical trial (RCT). They were randomly divided into control or treatment groups, with the latter receiving 500‚Äâmg NSO (MARNYS¬Æ Cuminmar) twice daily for 10 days. Symptoms were daily monitored via telecommunication. The primary outcome focused on the percentage of patients who recovered (symptom-free for 3 days) within 14-days. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04401202).  
  
Results  
A total of 173 patients were enrolled for RCT. The average age was 36(¬±11) years, and 53% of patients were males. The control and NSO groups included 87 and 86 patients respectively. The percentage of recovered patients in NSO group (54\[62%\]) was significantly higher than that in the control group (31\[36%\]; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001). The mean duration to recovery was also shorter for patients receiving NSO (10.7‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ3.2 days) compared with the control group (12.3‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ2.8 days); p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001.  
  
Conclusions  
NSO supplementation was associated with faster recovery of symptoms than usual care alone for patients with mild COVID-19 infection. These potential therapeutic benefits require further exploration with placebo-controlled, double-blinded studies.

My conclusion is that vaccinated or not you shouldn't go to a restaurant...or crowded places because you can still potentially get it and spread it whether you experience symptoms or not.

OK here we go, once again, with sources and corrections.

&gt;UK data is available showing that the Pfizer vaccine is effective against the Delta variant, which is the dominant variant in NYC right now. But it is less effective than it was against the alpha variant

[UK covid cases are up 1000% since the end of may](https://www.google.com/search?-b-1-d&amp;q=uk+covid+cases) with [61% fully vaccinated](https://www.google.com/search?q=uk+vaccination+rate)

[India covid cases are down 90% since the middle of may](https://www.google.com/search?-b-1-d&amp;q=india+covid+cases) with 8% fully vaccinated (same source as UK vax rate above)

The variant in india right now is the delta variant 

&gt;Also, the US is very uneven with vaccination rates. So Delta is spreading very rapidly in areas with lower rates of vaccination. It is spreading all over, but the situation in those regions is more dire.

[Califorinia is at more than 70% first dose for adults](https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccination-progress-data/), and has seen a [1000% increase in cases since may](https://www.google.com/search?-b-1-d&amp;q=covid+cases+califorina). Kerala, which some claim has the most accurate data, [is at 50% first dose](https://www.google.com/search?-b-1-d&amp;q=kerela+1st+dose) and [has seen a 50% decrease in cases over the same time period.](https://www.google.com/search?q=kerala+covid+cases)

Especially since vaccination rates vary drastically between neighborhoods.  I know there are arguments around natural immunity, but the idea is to not take a gamble by relying on those levels alone.

There's nuance when it comes to vaccinated people and spread.  The vaccines basically allow people to fight it off faster.  This can mean fighting it off relatively quickly which was easier with previous varients but still still happening to some extent with the Delta varient.  Even if someone gets infected and has a similar viral load to start, they fight the virus off and are no longer contagious sooner.  This reduces the overall spread of the virus.

&gt;The mandate comes on the same day state health officials authorized a third dose of the vaccine for New Yorkers with compromised immune systems. The authorization follows guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued late last week.

&gt;New Yorkers eligible for the third shot must wait 28 days after receiving their second dose (a third dose if only authorized for Moderna and Pfizer) and is effective immediately, the governor said.

&gt;On Monday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced all healthcare workers in New York must get at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by Monday, Sept. 27.

&gt;The new mandate from the state's Department of Health includes staff at hospitals, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, adult care and other congregate care settings, and applies to public and private employees.

&gt;Limited exceptions will be offered for religious or medical reasons.

&gt;The mandate to vaccinate the state's healthcare workforce adds thousands to a growing population of New Yorkers required to get inoculated for work. Previous announcements from the governor mandated shots for state employees and anyone working for the MTA and Port Authority in New York. Both groups have a Labor Day deadline.

&gt;According to the governor, nearly 70% of the state's nursing home workers have completed their vaccine series. That percentage is slightly higher in other settings: 75% in hospitals and 74% in adult care facilities.

&gt;Over the weekend, Zucker said the state's vaccine task force was undergoing a review of the CDC's third dose guidance and would be releasing its recommendation shortly. That authorization came Monday with a recommendation that New Yorkers speak with their healthcare provider about getting a third shot.

&gt;New York says current guidance allows a third dose of the vaccine for people who have:

&gt;Been receiving active cancer treatment for tumors or cancers of the blood;

&gt;Received an organ transplant and are taking medications to suppress the immune system;

&gt;Received a stem cell transplant within the last 2 years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system;
Moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency (such as DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome);

&gt;Advanced or untreated HIV infection;

[Nope](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/different-types-of-covid-19-vaccines/art-20506465): *After delivering instructions, the mRNA is immediately broken down.* ***It never enters the nucleus of your cells***.

&gt; Even still, there‚Äôs no reason the extra step from the viral vector vaccines should make any type of difference where the body‚Äôs response should be much greater when that doesn‚Äôt happen with an mRNA vaccine!

Clearly there must be, given how mRNA vaccines induce antibody production in much greater numbers.  One working theory is that some people could have been exposed to the same or similar adenovirus, causing a lowered or absent immune response to the adenovirus adjuvant.

Don't quote me on this (can't find a source at the moment), but I think another possibility is that that your body will naturally make some errors when generating it's own mRNA, so some of them just peter out to nothing.  But when you receive the mRNA directly from a vaccine, it delivers the precisely correct copy every time.

&gt; The science is still kind of sketchy on why mixing and matching would work better in the first place.

It really isn't.  It's based on decades of clinical experience with immunology.  Heterologous schedules work exactly the same with other vaccines and there isn't really reason to expect it to be different with these vaccines, because it's based on the immune response and not the biological delivery mechanism.

Health authorities very much expected heterologous schedules to be generate at least equal immunity, and the proceeding studies simply affirmed what their experience already told them would very likely be the case.",,,,1629133135,{},h96f9ea,False,t3_p4d6no,False,True,t1_h95xot6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4d6no/biden_administration_plans_for_vaccine_boosters/h96f9ea/,1629201946.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thats despite having 22% of the population and roughly 10% vaccination rate. Minors fare even better on death rate.

At least for me, a major unknown is the long COVID situation for kids as well as the potential for permanent damage that is not being tracked sufficiently.  Just to give one anecdote, I talked to another parent yesterday whose kid is a student athlete and had COVID last school year.  When the kid started to work out in preparation for tryouts (track and field to give you an idea of the physical shape) they couldn't do well and kept getting winded.  After going to the doctor, they found out that they now have 70% lung capacity.  This kid was never hospitalized for COVID and had fairly mild symptoms.

So I'm sure scientists will publish studies on this stuff, but it requires a lot of damage to be done to have data to even begin a study.  My expectations is that there are going to be a lot of people who have to deal with decreased lung capacity, increased cardiovascular disease, etc. as a result of COVID.  Even if vaccines become 100% approved for everyone tomorrow, I suspect that this will still have a big enough impact to become a huge health crisis for the next several decades even after the pandemic is long over.

Also I agree, shutting down schools should be a last resort.

It's the illusion of progress. The only input in the capitalist algorithm is profit. The system builds things to break so you have to buy more. The entire system relies on consuming and scarcity - this is antithetical to sustainability. The system *wants* natural resources to be scarce as long as it doesn't effect profit. A system where poisoned water is a good thing for some companies.  Most people do not need cars to drive to their unnecessary jobs to sell useless shit to keep the system that's killing us going. Switching to EVs to continue to try and prolong the system is misguided. There are also simply not enough raw materials (not even close) to replace all of the currently existing cars on the road. The idea of a circular green economy ""renewables build renewables"" is not possible because they are not as energy dense as oil to keep the system running as it is.  We've already done too much damage to be able to sustain the system we have anyway (air temperature delay, aerosol masking) but instead of talking about *that* and coming to terms with it, we're talking about EVs - as though any of that is going to stop what's coming. I mean, we've already tried using paper straws, recycling, turning off lights when we leave a room, etc... Who is playing into whose hands here?? 

&gt;Just look at Exxon Mobil: They are for a carbon tax right now for the precise reason that it will never happen in this political environment.

No, they are for a carbon tax because the alternative is carbon rationing. At some point in the near future *something* will have to be done to make the masses feel like ""we're moving in the right direction"" so they are pacified and keep the system going. 

&gt;They can go on about how amazing a carbon tax would be and how much they love it making everyone feel warm and fuzzy while continuing to pollute at exactly the same rate they always have been.

And guess what, if we had a carbon tax they would just pay it and keep polluting and say ""we're doing our part."" I believe them when they say they want a carbon tax - they probably want to get something in writing now and be ""grandfathered in"" to continue polluting at X rate for Y price. 

The best idea to in terms of reducing carbon is to ration it. To have carbon credits. The wealthy might have an excess but if they can't use any of it, it's of no use to them. Give the carbon credits out inversely proportional to wealth. Have the rich buy more carbon credits directly from the less well off.",,,,1629128501,{},h963bjp,False,t3_p5cjga,False,True,t1_h95u29n,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p5cjga/after_big_county_fair_virus_hits_hard_in_rural/h963bjp/,1629195833.0,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,
