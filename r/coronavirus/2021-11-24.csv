[],,stillobsessed,,,[],,,,text,t2_j54oj,False,False,[],"Ivermectin is great for parasitic worms.  Possibly also for the mites which cause rosacea.  Not going to do anything for covid directly, though there is one interesting wrinkle for IVM+COVID that's surfaced recently.

One of the things keeping the Ivermectin hoopla alive is that there are small number of apparently competently run studies which appear to show ivermectin helps reduce COVID mortality.  

But it turns out that all of them were all conducted in areas where parasitic worms are endemic, and studies of ivermectin for COVID in areas where worms are uncommon do not show this effect.

Turns out that high doses of steroids (commonly used for severe covid) also shut down the part of the immune system which keeps parasitic worms in check.   And some number of patients turn up with worms + covid and end up dying of some combination of covid + worm hyperinfection.

So the lesson is: if there is any chance that you have parasitic worms a course of ivermectin is called for before you get the steroids.  But the likelihood that someone in the US has parasitic worms is very low so ivermectin won't make any difference in the vast majority of cases here.

Then it doesn't matter that much because anyone who gets infected will have strong immunity against severe disease and won't wind up in the hospital.

If 100% of the people got vaccinated we'd be done with the pandemic phase.

We're stuck burning through all the unvaccinated people, with sufficient amounts of them going through into the hospitals and morgues, until that dry fuel is consumed by the vaccine fire.  But if they start going into the hospital too fast they start getting knocked over because treating COVID is very resource intensive for weeks in the hospital.

Until that's done we can't let the virus just rip through the vaccinated part of the population because they transmit to the unvaccinated people who are then the ones in the hospitals.

Unfortunately due to delta and due to pockets and clusters of unvaccinated, it looks like the herd immunity number is effectively 100% (and kids count).

And also unfortunately, the only people who listen and who are somewhat socially responsible are the vaccinated, so they're the ones that are more likely to adopt and maintain guidelines to slow spread until the virus is done.

You need to still take precautions not because you're worried about your own safety if you get infected, but if you pass the infection on to someone who winds up in the ICUs then when you get T-boned by a drunk driving an Escalade you may not get particularly good quality of medical care in the hospital.",,,,1637810891,{'gid_2': 1},hlznoli,False,t3_r1joqo,False,False,t1_hlzauii,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r1joqo/who_says_fully_vaccinated_should_wear_masks_and/hlznoli/,1638195156.0,95,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;Reports from in vitro studies suggest that ivermectin acts by inhibiting the host importin alpha/beta-1 nuclear transport proteins, which are part of a key intracellular transport process that viruses hijack to enhance infection by suppressing the host‚Äôs antiviral response.^4,5 In addition, ivermectin docking may interfere with the attachment of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein to the human cell membrane.^6 Ivermectin is thought to be a host-directed agent, which may be the basis for its broad-spectrum activity in vitro against the viruses that cause dengue, Zika, HIV, and yellow fever.

(While antivirals aren't supposed to be taken prophylactically, they *would* be more effective early on in an infection -- possibily before the person felt sick and/or knew they had an infection.)

Of course, there's one wee little problem with those anti-viral properties....

&gt; Ivermectin has been shown to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cell cultures.^13 However, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies suggest that achieving the plasma concentrations necessary for the antiviral efficacy detected in vitro would require administration of doses up to 100-fold higher than those approved for use in humans.",,,,1637809818,{},hlzlfsx,False,t3_r0j8lx,False,False,t1_hlu0494,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r0j8lx/seven_doctors_contract_covid_after_attending/hlzlfsx/,1638193904.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you are vaccinated and now have a booster good, excellent in fact, but the current vaccines are not as effective as they original were.  They do not provide effective sterilizing immunity for delta. While your immediate risk is low, you can still transmit to others who are not vaccinated.  While most of these people should have gotten the vaccine and thus you may feel they deserve what they get, there are two important factors here. 

1) They then become a burden for the population in general through continuing transmission and load on the hospitals (which can immediately affect you if you suddenly need medical care). 

2) I would argue that right now we are in a very vulnerable situation with the virus.  We have roughly half our population vaccinated. With half of the potential hosts now resistant, there is now ample selective pressure for any viral mutation that can escape.  Also with half of our population not vaccinated, there are still ample hosts for these mutations to occur in.  We need to be the responsible ones can do everything possible to keep the case count down to lower the odds of such a mutation that selective pressure can act on until enough of the population is immunized to prevent such a likelihood of mutation.",,,,1637826298,{},hm0eid4,False,t3_r18dz7,False,True,t1_hlz9fkf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r18dz7/despite_vaccines_the_us_has_lost_more_lives_to/hm0eid4/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,99ef1d172f4323006ea86ce4c9400deb703cc597,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1637826314.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Medical internships are one of the few ritualized hazings still allowed in our society. You spend somewhere between 2-6 years being shit on by your attending and  being told what a miserable failure you are,  while working 80+ hours a week all with the end goal that you‚Äôll be so terrified of killing someone that the fear will make you work harder to *not* kill someone. 

When you‚Äôre a physician, the buck stops with you.  

If your surgeon had told you ‚Äúyou‚Äôll totally kite surf again no problem‚Äù and you couldn‚Äôt, you wouldn‚Äôt have sued your physical therapist.  You would have sued your surgeon. 

The essential difference between midlevels and physicians is that physicians hold the ultimate liability, and the ultimate fear of fucking up and killing or seriously injuring someone.  

You want to put it in terms of $$s?  Malpractice insurance for midlevels is often about 1/10th the price of a physician.  Which means that if your PT is paying $800/yr, your orthopedic surgeon is paying $8k (actually probably much more).  

This isn‚Äôt some defense or the noble physician or denouncement of midlevels.  We really need more physicians *and* midlevels.

Hopefully so, but I worry that the immunity will still be so patchy that the virus can easily keep going.

The situation might even get worse ‚Äî right now a lot of people has been vaccinated in the ""same wave"", but in the future people will get their boosters in different timeframes and some people might get sloppy about them. The immunity of naturally acquired infections will also start to wane.

&gt;Last holiday, the coronavirus forced officials to order a one-block long, nearly crowd-free version of the parade, which typically runs from 77th Street on the Upper West Side to Herald Square in Midtown Manhattan. The parade, which began in 1924 and is in its 95th iteration, has been canceled rarely, including during World War II.

&gt;Along the 2.5 mile route will stroll over 4,500 volunteers towing among them 15 giant helium balloons, old favorites like Smokey Bear, and newcomers like Ada Twist, Scientist, from the popular storybook, who clocks in at 51-feet tall.

&gt;The return of such sights ‚Äî of large crowds, of public joy, of celebrities on floats and beloved characters transformed into balloons ‚Äî felt deeply symbolic for many who anticipated the spectacle.

&gt; The answer reveals a great deal about the true power, and limitations, of the Putin system. Ekaterina Schulmann, a prominent political scientist in Moscow, has described today‚Äôs Russia as an ‚Äúinformational autocracy‚Äù that ‚Äúrelies most on the impression it is able to create.‚Äù The Kremlin can count on, say, F.S.B. henchmen to loyally carry out its edicts, but it lacks any real power to guarantee the same for millions of citizens, even those it considers a part of its electoral base. For Putin, if the majority of people are disinclined to follow quarantine measures or calls to be vaccinated, failing to force compliance only calls attention to a weakness that the architecture of the system was designed to mask in the first place. ‚ÄúThis dynamic is especially dangerous in a time of constantly sinking popularity, when people have started to fall out of love with you,‚Äù Schulmann said. In the past several years, the Levada Center has found consistently falling levels of trust and job approval for Putin; last month, a survey showed that trust in the President was fifty-three per cent, the lowest such figure since 2012. ‚ÄúTo enact harsh or unpopular measures and then see them ignored or sabotaged only deepens the feeling of crisis,‚Äù Schulmann told me. ‚ÄúThe most dangerous thing of all is to give an order that won‚Äôt be followed.‚Äù",,,,1637845592,{},hm13jet,False,t3_qfwl8n,False,True,t1_hi3e6zr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qfwl8n/with_covid19_deaths_climbing_and_hospitals/hm13jet/,1638225816.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;European governments should accelerate their vaccination rates, administer booster shots and reintroduce restrictions, Andrea Ammon, the E.C.D.C. director said in a statement. ‚ÄúAnd all those three things have to be done now,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis is not pick and choose.‚Äù

&gt;About 66 percent of the European Union‚Äôs total population has been fully inoculated, according to the E.C.D.C. data. This leaves ‚Äúa large vaccination gap that cannot be bridged rapidly and gives ample room for the virus to spread,‚Äù Ms. Ammon said.

&gt;Recommended restrictions could include wearing face masks, working from home, keeping a safe distance and reducing social interactions. Lockdowns are like an ‚Äúemergency brake,‚Äù Ms. Ammon said, used when ‚Äúyou want to bring down a very high case number in a short period of time.‚Äù

&gt;Asked whether seasonal festivities should be canceled, Ms. Ammon replied: ‚ÄúWe still have some time until Christmas. But if the situation doesn‚Äôt get better, it might mean that these measures should be taken over Christmas as well.‚Äù

&gt;On Wednesday, Italy announced new restrictions for the unvaccinated, barring them from dining indoors in restaurants and bars; attending shows, sport events and public ceremonies; and entering nightclubs.

&gt;The E.C.D.C. also recommended that booster doses should be ‚Äúconsidered‚Äù for all adults, with a priority given to those above 40 years old. On Tuesday, Italy allowed vaccinated people to get a booster shot five months after the second shot of their initial vaccination. On Wednesday, Portugal‚Äôs health secretary said the country would give booster shots to a quarter of its population by the end of January, Reuters reported.

&gt;Europe has seen a sharp spike in the number of new infections, hospitalizations and deaths in recent weeks, prompting governments to impose new restrictions, including a lockdown in Austria, one of the first in Western Europe since vaccines became available.

&gt;Over the weekend, tens of thousands of Europeans across the continent protested, sometimes violently, against vaccine mandates and new restrictions, and on Wednesday, more than 1,000 people protested in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, according to The Associated Press.

If you're exposed to covid-19 and are vaccinated and keep testing negative on both the selftests and official ones (idk how much of a difference there is), are you then even infected? I thought infection required antibodies (which would be detected by those tests) even if you're vaccinated.
 
&gt; Not quite. The mRNA vaccines are amazing, probably better than the old kinds, but we are still figuring out how to space out the doses like we do with the other vaccines. 
 
Oh... but measles don't require you to have a booster shot as fast as these, do they? Measles vaccines apparently has a 93% effectiveness too, some covid vaccines less.  
 
&gt; We don't call it a ""breakthrough"" infection when it's the flu vaccine. Or measles. But if you get exposed to measles and you're vaccinated, you may get an asymptomatic infection that could be detected through increased antibodies.

Oh, right, like everyone's going to do that. Just like everyone's going to take the vaccine and wear a mask.

But, you, personally live such a busy life that 7 days a week you can't go to a restaurant at an unpopular time. Then it sounds like you have a full life and I don't know what you're complaining about. You don't have time to go to restaurants anyway.

&gt;Having to avoid doing things that we want to do is putting life on hold.

No, it's not. It's called being a mature adult who can compensate.

As I said in another post,

&gt;Perhaps you should experience a solid natural disaster...like the way we have hurricanes down here...to get some perspective.

Then you'd discover what it's really like to put your life on hold.

As I also said in that other post...

&gt;You have this attitude of ""If I can't do all the things that I used to do in the way that I used to do it then my life is on hold."" Do you know what that sounds like?

For almost everybody I know it was weeks, months, by Christmas, next summer, complaining the whole time about how unjust it was that they had to miss &lt;whatever&gt; and then melted down (emotionally and procedurally) when whatever date they had in their hand came and went.

I was the only one of those I'm close with who said (January 2020) ""until it goes way, which will almost certainly be 18-24 months, probably not before everyone (all-ages) has a chance to vaccinate, possibly longer if it mutates and/or escapes vaccination""--to which I didn't expect such a pushback against vaccination, that they'd wane as quickly as they are, or the near-instantaneous abandonment or non-enforcement of all other mitigations the second a vaccine became possible.

The disaster, human, natural, or some combination, takes as long as it takes--not as long as a person wants or thinks they should have to put up with it.

Increasingly, it seems people are only capable of dealing with disasters that last a few days (tornado, flood, hurricane, terror attack) and then a month or so of fallout--maybe longer for the most effected victims; not catastrophic issues that may continue for years.

To me it is like closing up shops and schools because of an out break of war on their home soil (something almost no living Americans and few Europeans at this point) have had to deal with; and two months later deciding bombs raining from the sky is just ""something we have to live with"" rather than ""the changes will continue until the war or at least the situation, is over.""",,,,1637844174,{},hm11d3d,False,t3_r18dz7,False,True,t1_hlzig1r,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r18dz7/despite_vaccines_the_us_has_lost_more_lives_to/hm11d3d/,1638224530.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't think they are being left out of anything ... they can still be vaccinated, and many governments do outreach to them (in the USA, the federal government cannot mandate vaccinations for everybody, but it can mandate for employees, so that's what they do).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Let‚Äôs say at a movie theatre, if everyone is vaccinated except a couple people in one row, that‚Äôs not that bad, right? 

Probably not ... but I don't see it as an argument \*against\* mandating moviegoers are vaccinated ... it depends. 

First, what percentage of unvaccinated people would you have in the movie with the mandate? Without the mandate? Is the difference significant? You're assuming the difference is not much, is that true? 

The other thing is side-effects; if mandating vaccines for moviegoers would, say, make 10% more of teenagers be vaccinated, it might be worth it :)

I'm assuming there are a few exceptions, but the vast majority of governments want the minimum of mandates; they are a lot of work for everybody. It is obvious vaccines work. Ideally you get 95% of the population vaccinated (and boosting every few years, if needed) \*without\* any mandates, but what do you do if that's not happening?

I'm approaching this from a mostly utilitarian perspective (anti-vaxers may be a-holes, but that doesn't matter; I don't want to hurt them just because). If you don't get enough people vaccinated, mandates make sense as \*one\* way to increase that rate. There are different mandates, with different effectiveness (which will change due to local conditions), and there are many other interventions (PR campaigns, drawings, different ways to get vaccines to people), and governments will probably need to choose some of those. There are many tradeoffs, and I'd rather not be a mayor today :) (or ever, but more right now ... :)",,,,1637862471,{},hm2351k,False,t3_r1rihc,False,True,t1_hm1rla8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r1rihc/daily_discussion_thread_november_25_2021/hm2351k/,1638245905.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Every country or most countries just shut everything except the businesses that are essential for living for 4 months or more, and I mean a real shut down, but not one like they did in 2020 because that was half a**. 

No one is allowed in the park or beaches, no camping, no traveling, no jogging outside ect, they can only go out if they are going to buy food water and or tissue, buy medicine, moving to a new house or apartment, going to work, or going for medical care, and grocery stores limit the amount of people inside bassed on the space of the stores. 
No walking outside without a mask, if you do that's a several thousand dollar fine or jail, and this has to be enforced. 
If you have been in contact with someone who caught covid, do a 21 day quarantine, because it can still come up positive after the 14 days. 

The Government should do something where they give funds to all businesses (even mom &amp; pop ones) that cover the employees wages as well as the kind of profits the usually would make, but on the stipulation that they must not fire employees durring this time, and have to give them their regular salary, whether they can show up to work or not (cause a lot of places will be closed). If businesses do not do this, then they will have the money taken away from them and be required to pay the government back what they already spent, and the employees of said company should be compensated their full salary by the government immediately in full on a regular basis.

For people who work at business that are still open, the employees should be required to be tested regularly for free no matter what, even if they are vaxinated, if they come up positive they must contact trace as well as let the employees off until they recover, and as stated earlier they must get payed their regular salary even while they are off work till they get better. Companies breaking this rule again will be punished. I know some companies like usps and shipping companies were making sick employees work even if they had covid semptoms, can't have none of that.

As for the people who are staying in their homes, they should be able to get free at home covid tests with no stipulations on who can get the test or how many you can get. Also make it illegal to sell the tests, they should be free for all. 

This is the only way I can see any of this getting better anytime within the next 5 years, otherwise it's not going to become an endemic anytime soon, and it will stay a pandemic with a death toll that gets worse each year. 

It is drastic and requires most people to be uncomfortable for quite a while longer, but that's only so we don't rack up years of this still going on like we are now.",,,,1637871333,{},hm2nxje,False,t3_r1joqo,False,True,t3_r1joqo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r1joqo/who_says_fully_vaccinated_should_wear_masks_and/hm2nxje/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,d053dd1de1ac4728c214d067312cdb383f99991d,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1637871348.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Rapid Antigen Negative: You're probably not spreading virus right now.

Rapid Antigen Positive: You're probably spreading virus right now.

PCR Negative: You're probably not infected at all and haven't been for a while.

PCR Positive: You're probably infected or recovering from an infection in the last month or so.

&gt;I thought infection required antibodies (which would be detected by those tests) even if you're vaccinated.

Antibody tests require a blood draw, they look for antibodies in your blood.  ""Antigen"" is a fancy word for viral proteins, which can be found in mucus from a nasal/saliva test, I get the feeling you might be confusing ""Antigen"" and ""Antibody"", but maybe that's just how I'm reading your question. PCR looks for parts of the viral RNA from a nose/saliva test.

&gt;Oh... but measles don't require you to have a booster shot as fast as these, do they? Measles vaccines apparently has a 93% effectiveness too, some covid vaccines less.

The reason we gave a second shot at 3-4 weeks for an mRNA vaccine is because we're in a pandemic and we needed good protection NOW, not in three years.  With[ measles](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html#:~:text=Get%20MMR%20Vaccine%3F-,Children,days%20after%20the%20first%20dose.), you get a shot when you're about a year old and a booster a few years later (unless there's a ton of measles going around in the community and a doctor says to do the second dose sooner).  If you get a third shot, no worries, it does not cause a problem. (iirc MMR is special because the three vaccines combined help each other work better at lower doses compared to if they were separated, it's complicated)

So because we needed the strong immunity really quickly, we gave second doses really quickly, and it turns out that's probably not as good as if we had the time to wait a few years (which we don't).  But if we get another dose in a few years, it may be more long lasting at high efficacy like the measles vaccine.

The number of breakthrough cases is different than decreasing transmission, but these cases do represent individual failures to break a link in the chain of transmission*. I think it‚Äôs important to note how many of those breakthrough cases are serious or fatal illnesses‚Äî The number is quite low.  Also, 40% might sound like a failure, but when you consider that translates to 60% of cases are coming from the roughly 20% of people who are unvaccinated, it sounds a lot better.

Setting The goal posts of the vaccine completely eliminating transmission of a serious illness entirely misses the point. It‚Äôs like saying there‚Äôs no reason to avoid smoking, because you can still get lung cancer without smoking.  While the preventative action doesn‚Äôt entirely eliminate risk, it greatly decreases it, with comparatively few downsides.  In my reasoning, that makes both worthwhile.

I can't tell you how many people who enter my medical facility with ill-fitting cloth masks, gators, and bandanas. This continues to be a problem. 

You'd think that a person who recognizes the function of the mask and wears one to also realize that if it is so loose that their nose is uncovered, that it is not doing *anything*. 

There is also a factor of cleanliness: I see masks that look like they have not been washed since the beginning of the pandemic, some brown, others black with facial oil. Just imagine all the bacteria residing there! By using a mask that is disposable, this nastiness is eliminated. 

Fit testing for a normal person is as simple as testing to see if the seal against the face is sufficient: take a sharp breathe inward. If the mask fits well, it will collapse noticably. During the outward breath, there are no leaks (hold your hand near the area to feel for air leakage) at the chin, side of the face, or either side of the nose. - If the mask is too loose, twist the earloop once or twice and try again, re-bend the nose clip, or reposition any elastics for a tighter fit. 

Effective masks can be found even in the most backward towns in the local gas station convenience  stores. They are available at pharmacies, supermarkets, and office supply stores. If not that, then even Amazon has some (though one must be discerning in their choices)..

Directions for effective mask fit are *all over the Internet*, available upon the most simple search. If people can look up the hours of their favorite grocery store, they can find this, too.

[],,ImaginaryDisplay3,,,[],,,,text,t2_46mvrymn,False,False,[],"Mutation is more likely to make the virus less a problem than more a problem, honestly. 

For one thing, what it has to change to evade the vaccinations may neuter it in other ways.

Beyond that a typical path for a virus is to eventually get less deadly because it's better for its own survival. That may or may not happen here, but it's what has happened with many viruses in the past.

Then you have the ""it killed everyone it could"" factor. At some point, it's torn through everyone who it can kill. It will still reinfect folks, and still kill people who get a big viral load, develop conditions that put them at risk, and so on. But for the part of the population who is just genetically predisposed to have a really bad bout with it, at some point it's infected all of them and killed those most vulnerable. That ultimately means a downward trajectory.

Finally remember that we have starkly different vaccination rates in different places, creating different evolutionary pressures. Where I live, more than 97 percent of people who were eligible got the shots. That number went down a bit with expansion to younger folks but it will quickly climb back up to effective local herd immunity. So the evolutionary pressures where I live will be to escape the vaccination, which actually may make it less deadly because it will be more efficient to give vaccinated folks mild or asymptomatic cases than to give them a ton of symptoms causing them to quarantine (again 97 percent got the shots, so people here are very unlikely to infect others knowingly).

Compare those evolutionary pressures to a place with 50 percent penetration of the vaccination.

4 hour wait..2 in waiting room, 2 in exam room,,with appointment.

I told them I was leaving.

A very frazzled nurse practitoner heard me  and quickly examined ear and agreed to referral

And gave me some prescriptions

One was good idea. Second is no longer recommended by the relevant doctors organization

The third was completely wrong and was an asthma inhaler. I do not have asthma nor chest congestion nor did she use a stethoscope or listen to lungs etc

No referral was made.I had to go back and stand there while they made the referral.

I chalk it up to lack of nurses as they have gone to travel nursing for the covid big dollars. (And i would too). Or have tired of the pandemic and relaxing a while.

Based on this, and the we are hiring ads for local hospitals..

I think I get the point you're trying to make.  

However, I think what should also be considered is the less than obvious effects, things other than death, that children can get from COVID.  

Everything I have ever learned and read about COVID and vaccines leads me to the conclusion that it is much safer to get the vaccine than to get covid.  

IF....and I mean...IF....someone's circumstances made it VERY unlikely for them to get COVID I can see myself being more receptive to someone's argument that they don't NEED the vaccine.   Maybe someone in these circumstances has the ability to isolate and limit their contact with other people to a degree that it is very unlikely that they will be a threat to themselves or others when it comes to COVID.  

However, this is the simple thing that is often overlooked:

If someone isn't getting the vaccine because they are worried about the effects of the vaccine...their worry is misplaced.  The effects of actually getting covid are going to be much worse.    

In other words, there are two safe and logical choices people have right now when they are concerned about their health and safety in this pandemic.  

Option 1:
Get vaccinated and stay boosted. 

Option 2:
Have enough control of your activities and over the circumstances of your life to the extent that you can reliably not get COVID and not spread it to other people.    This would likely also need to apply to anyone that you live with if you live with others.  

Going with something other than option one and option two...you cannot make much of a claim to be making the safest choice, the numbers will be overwhelmingly against you.",,,,1637799846,{},hlyzade,False,t3_r0sk04,False,True,t1_hlx1n0m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r0sk04/the_real_risk_of_heart_inflammation_to_kids_is/hlyzade/,1638182111.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,michaelthecoder,,,[],,,,text,t2_llftk,False,False,,"I don't think they ever claimed that boosters would never be needed, what they did was far worse: they embraced antivaxxer logic to indicate that boosters were useless. They did this by ignoring spread, herd immunity, and any community protection, and only focusing on self protection against hospitalization and death. The worst example of this that I saw was when they compared the booster to an extra life jacket.

The science community has spent decades trying to build up the public's understanding of herd immunity and how vaccines are more than the protection they give you and the WHO comes in and undoes all that by embracing views promoted by antivaxxers just to try to get vaccines to third world countries a month or two early. I cannot understate just how damaging the WHO has been to vaccine public communication as a whole this year in their short sighted goals.

[],,Uysee,,,[],,,,text,t2_warfn,False,False,,"&gt;Covid myocarditis often can cause permanent scarring where as the vaccine myocarditis nearly never causes scarring.

Please show me any peer-reviewed study confirming this. It's definitely plausible. Viral myocarditis has a 5 year survival rate of around 50%. But we don't have any long term data on myocarditis from the vaccine, and we don't have any long term studies confirming myocarditis from the vaccine is more mild, lasts for less time and more importantly whether it has a higher survival rate.

&gt;There is a push to change the terminalogy based on the type and severity of the inflammation now

This is how you reduce public trust in science. It is important to differentiate between for example stage 3 cancer and stage 5 cancer, but is it really a good idea to change the terminology to make one sound harmless?

&gt;Also, there is the question of if someone gets inflammation from a vaccine, are they the body type that would have had extremely severe reaction to a real covid infection.

This is a valid question, but AstraZeneca seems to have lower myocarditis risk than Pfizer and Morderna despite also having the spike protein. It also matters for people with natural immunity who are less likely to get infected with Covid in the first place, so the benefit/risk ratio is a lot smaller (because their antibodies will usually destroy Covid before it gets deep into their body). Same issue with people who are double vaccinated and considering getting a booster shot.

I don't get why people promoting the Covid vaccines have such a hard time admitting that while the benefit is much greater than the risk, Covid vaccines cause 10x as many adverse reaction as flu vaccines as has been stated by the CDC, shown in studies and also implied from VAERS and TGA data, from allergic reactions to cardiac events to autoimmune reactions.",,,,1637816710,{},hlzz0wf,False,t3_r0sk04,False,False,t1_hlzqtox,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r0sk04/the_real_risk_of_heart_inflammation_to_kids_is/hlzz0wf/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,dd06404f80a024d6398a84acab8fe3573137ac85,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1637816727.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

So a few days ago, I get this weird itch on my chest when I was in the shower. It was this tiny little blister that had burst. Next day, I get this weird itch on my side by my waist. Two tiny little blister spots. I was thinking to myself...shit, this kind of feels like chicken pox. And then, just now...I read this. 

Glad I'm vaccinated. I think I will get the booster when I'm eligible. I was debating it...not really sure if I would even need one...but yeah...then I see this and it makes me go...hmmmm...

I've been wearing my respirators at work since I think I got hit by it a bit. Maybe it's a good idea to keep wearing the respirator masks or double mask with cloth and surgical mask underneath.

[],,ShiftLeader,,,[],,,,text,t2_gpzr1,False,False,[],"Most hospitals are non-profits and operate on low single digit net revenues. A very small fraction are making any major ""profit"" and in the grand scheme of things, even the executive compensation packages are drops in the bucket to the overall system.

The health system I work for had a 4% operating margin for 2019 which was like $185 million system wide, which is like 30,000 employees.

The places that healthcare is for profit (or wasteful) are essentially all the suppliers of everything used in healthcare. Prosthetic joints, medications, imaging machines, etc. 

As an example, the US spends $2,500 per person/year on administrative costs in healthcare.

https://time.com/5759972/health-care-administrative-costs/

For prescription drugs, we pay astronomically more money for the exact same drugs that are sold for a fraction of what we pay in other countries.

https://www.davisenterprise.com/forum/letters/letter-why-does-an-inhaler-cost-242-here/

Only reason I bring this up is because the problem here isn't that hospitals and their executives are rolling in cash (because they generally aren't) it's that every other part of the health industry are making record profits year after year while most hospitals struggle to barely break even, which isn't at all addressed by Obamacare or literally any other legislation currently being promoted. Pfizer's shareholder forward guidance estimated $36 billion dollars in revenue from it's vaccine alone this year with an estimated $22 billion in 2022, estimating roughly 44% of it's total revenue coming from the vaccine. It also has multi billion dollar oncology, hospital, and internal medicine divisions making billions in profit each year. The system is disjointed. It's basically a for profit model that's treated as independent business organizations however half the system is treated as for profit public companies (Pfizer, Merck, hill-rom) while the other half (places providing direct care) is treated as a public service without any of the funding supports traditional public services have. This is also why it generally doesn't matter whether we have single payer or whatever since that doesn't do anything to fix the actual problems in healthcare, all it does is not make individuals go broke when seeking care. Everyone involved is still going to make absolutely record breaking profits if we had a single payer system, it would just be coming from our taxes instead of the current model for health coverage and we'd be in the same struggling boat medicare/medicaid are in.

https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-raises-covid-19-vaccine-sales-forecast-36-billion-2021-11-02/

Shoot, even when it comes to ""accreditation"" of a hospital, it's essentially just extortion of more money out of the system. The Joint Commissions is a private non-profit that ""accredits"" health care organizations and charges hospitals and facilities fees to maintain that accreditation. This is something that is done for TONS of different accreditations like stroke or thrombectomy, burn, etc.

Per wikipedia, Joint Commission charges up to $37,000 in fees annually and studies have been done that show being Joint Commission accredited doesn't even lower mortality or readmission rates.

Just like any other corporation, if a hospital doesn't have positive net revenue it will ultimately go under and close because the entirety of it's revenue comes from providing healthcare services. To provide those health services it must purchase the supplies from companies who's only goal is to maximize shareholder profits and spend billions every year lobbying to congress to make sure that happens.",,,,1637820711,{},hm0607l,False,t3_r16po0,False,True,t1_hlxivi6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r16po0/us_braces_for_fifth_wave_of_covid_on_eve_of/hm0607l/,1638205987.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The problem is they report the percentages differently.

Ireland has one of Europe's highest vaccination rates, with 89.1% of people over the age of 12 having been immunized

But when you consider Ireland's total population, they're at only 76%, below the polio threshold.

But that‚Äôs not necessarily cause for concern. ‚ÄúWhen you reach the herd immunity threshold in a population, it doesn‚Äôt happen all of a sudden, like you've flipped a switch. There won‚Äôt be a New York Times headline saying nobody has the disease,‚Äù explains Saad Omer, MBBS, PhD, MPH, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health. ‚ÄúWhat happens is it reduces the indigenous, or endemic, transmission of the virus.‚Äù The spread of disease gradually slows.

Therefore, even when the herd immunity threshold is attained, there will still be smaller outbreaks. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because vaccine coverage is always uneven. You can have these places where embers spark local fires,‚Äù Dr. Omer says.

Garland directed prosecutors on Wednesday to prioritize the prosecution of federal crimes on commercial aircraft, as millions of travelers make their way across the United States for Thanksgiving, the most traveled holiday in the country.

&gt;As travel in the United States nears prepandemic levels, the federal government has ramped up prosecution of crimes on flights, especially by passengers refusing to abide by Covid protocols. In some cases, passengers have assaulted or threatened flight attendants.

&gt;Federal law prohibits assaults, intimidation and threats of violence that interfere with workers on flights, as well as other criminal acts that can occur during a flight.

&gt;Reports filed in the Aviation Safety Reporting System database by flight attendants at times describe a chaotic, unhinged workplace where passengers regularly abuse airline employees.

&gt;Passengers who assault, intimidate or threaten violence against flight crews and flight attendants do more than harm those employees; they prevent the performance of critical duties that help ensure safe air travel,‚Äù Mr. Garland said in a statement on Wednesday.

&gt;In the past year, there have been 5,338 unruly passenger reports, and 3,856 were mask related incidents, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

&gt;Historically, the F.A.A. has handled these cases with civil penalties, warning notices and counseling. However, under the current zero-tolerance policy toward unruly passengers established in January, the F.A.A. has opted to charge an unruly passenger with civil penalties. A passenger can be fined up to $37,000 per violation, and can be cited for multiple violations at a time.

[],,SmirkingImperialist,,,[],,,,text,t2_27pmqe,False,False,[],"It's actually a fairly sensible idea. We have two versions of polio vaccine: one intramuscular injection, the other is oral. The oral vaccine contains live but weakened polio virus and is actually the superior vaccine in many ways. It is easy to be administered. Vaccinators need a vial of the vaccine and sugar cubes. Sometimes not even that. I remember whoever gave me that vaccine just squeeze my face until I open my mouth and she put in a few drops and told me to swallow. Injected vaccine requires needles, clean needles, and needle disposal methods. Oral polio vaccine develops strong immune response in the gastrointestinal tracts which is actually how most people contract polio: through ingestion. Oral polio vaccine is simply more effective than injected polio vaccine

The downside? The weaken virus in kral polio vaccine has a very small chance of reverting to the full-strength polio virus and cause disease. Which version to use depends on whether you are living in a polio endemic region or not. In a polio endemic region, the benefits from a more efficient vaccine outweight the risks. When your baseline risk of catching polio is low, thanks to, I don't know, herd immunity may be? it is more sensible to use a less efficient but with a lower risk vaccine.

A nasal inhalation vaccine for a respiratory virus is actually sensible. For one, it makes the administration simpler and unlikely to cause some of the issues purported to be the cause of adverse reactions of the Astra-Zeneca vaccine: injection into the systemic circulation.

In Australia, and other parts of the world, unvaccinated are getting pushed to get vaccinated or be ostracised by society - no access to places of social gathering and work places.

IMO the gov in Aus have not been very forthcoming with addressing the risks associated with getting the mRNA vaccines (the heart inflammation and blood clots).

That is regardless of it‚Äôs ability to reduce hospital transmissions, people are saying the exact same things as you - what‚Äôs the point and why would I risk it.

The map shows where the coronavirus is spreading particularly. Dozens of journalists, programmers, researchers and volunteers are behind the map. Because we ask the latest figures directly from the city and districts, we can often report new cases faster than the RKI.

The comparison of different countries provides clues as to which measures are effective. The case numbers of different states are never comparable 1:1. It is tested differently, reported and the unreported number can be different.

Corona case numbers

By international comparison

The case numbers by area in comparison. You can show and hide individual states in a world region. A click on a curve shows the daily values.

Quick overview

The following graph shows the corona numbers in Germany, Berlin and worldwide at a glance. The new cases per day, the total number of cases, active cases and daily deaths are displayed. Instead of the selected countries, other countries, federal states or world regions can select.

Corona vaccinations in Germany and worldwide

The following curve shows how many corona vaccinations have already been administered. For it to be fully effective, most vaccines require two vaccinations per person, but for the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine only one.

Number of people vaccinated in Germany

The following diagram shows how many doses are vaccinated daily. A distinction is not made between manufacturers and primary or second vaccination, but the absolute number of new vaccinations is indicated.

All current vaccination numbers by federal state and state can be found on our live map at the beginning of this article. We show the vaccination numbers in Germany in an international comparison in our curve view. Detailed information on corona vaccinations and the vaccination organisation in Berlin can be found in the vaccination FAQ.

Corona cases by age group

In which parts of the population the virus spreads most and again has changed over the course of the pandemic. The following graph shows newly reported corona cases per 100,000 people within the respective age groups per calendar week:

The current test figures

The number of reported cases also depends on how much and in what way the authorities test. In order to estimate the test strategy and utilisation of test capacities, two figures are important: tests carried out and proportion of positive tests. We explain in detail here what the key figures mean.

Hospitalisation

If people with severe COVID-19 courses receive extensive medical care, many deaths can be averted. Two key figures allow an assessment here: The number of COVID-19 cases in intensive care units in Germany. And the utilisation of intensive care units as a whole.

What exactly these figures mean, we explain here.

Recently, a new indicator has also been introduced - the ""hospitalisation incidence"". The hospitalisation incidence indicates how many COVID-19 cases among the cases reported in the last seven days must be treated in relation to 100,000 people in hospital. This is intended to map where there is a risk of overloading of hospitals and intensive care units. More about this here.

The current 7-day hospitalisation incidence by federal state

Travel: Current high-incidence areas and virus variant areas

The following table shows a simplified overview of the case numbers per country. In addition to the incidence of the last five weeks, you can see whether the RKI currently classifies the respective country or individual regions as a risk area and whether the Federal Foreign Office has issued a corona travel warning:

Why we collect the case numbers ourselves

The number of cases in Germany ends up with delay in the population: First comes the infection, then symptoms in those affected. Some are finally tested. Then wait for the results. And only then does the slow reporting system begin: from districts to federal states to the total number of infected in the country.

To make this faster, the Tagesspiegel Innovation Lab works together with Risklayer and the Centre for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and numerous volunteers. The reports from almost 400 individual websites of the district offices are collected and verified several times. Doubtful information is checked by the editors through inquiries from the authorities. In addition, data from the Robert Koch Institute and the federal states are used.

In this article we collect the most important current case numbers from Germany and worldwide.

It may not be able to maintain the extraordinarily high fitness of Delta, but new immune escape serotypes seem pretty well destined to emerge.

At the same time there's pangolin spikes that we've found which have higher affinity for human ACE2 than Delta has right now and that could indicate there's even more room for improvement with this virus.

There's quarantine, and then there's isolation. Here in Florida when you test, you're given direction based upon your situation. If you've been exposed, you should quarantine. If you're sick, you are supposed to isolate. 

We have the protocols, but there's no one to monitor cases effectively. Case investigators are supposed to find the ""origin"" or ""primary case"", and get them to stay put and away from others. This is called *isolation*. 

Then COVID Contact tracers jump in to find out who the primary case has been with, and try to contact them. Anyone who has been exposed should *quarantine*, and get tested. 

Meanwhile, anyone who tests positive should be put in touch with Community Service Coordinators, who see to the sick person's needs so that they *can* stay home. They arrange for pay if they cannot work, food delivery, laundry service, and any other thing the person might need, like having someone else that care of their pet while they are sick.

Right now Florida has barely enough tracers to follow only a small portion of cases. Community care has been just about lost. There are no more hotels for isolation. I heard of one across from a hospital in Tampa, but it's been closed. If you need food delivery, they set you up with an app. Laundry service? I'm betting that's never been a thing here. 

The Contact Tracers sometimes monitor cases, but again, they are terribly busy, and I'm guessing this falls by the wayside often. The purpose of monitoring is to remind the patient to *stay home*, and to *stay isolated*. 

Florida depends upon the patient to do the right thing. It's entirely voluntary, and terribly unfortunate that people disregard the information and suggestions that they are given. For the most part, I'm afraid the public cannot be depended upon. That's part of why we are in this rut. The other part is the failure of the government to hire enough investigators and tracers.

That's not going to fly with everyone, and it's not going to help the vaccine rollout. The people who are just champions of these masks need to step off their high horse and take a look at the bigger picture, this is an infectious disease and there really isn't much we can do to make everyone survive and be healthy, there are going to be deaths and sickness and its not going away, probably forever.

In the US, Biden admin should have replaced Fauci just for the image of going for someone new - a compromise. Instead they decided on being petty and trying to stick it to the previous admin by rehiring the same people. 

Meanwhile everyone with a brain realizes that Covid is here to stay, potentially forever, with mutations. Yet they aren‚Äôt changing any guidelines and they aren‚Äôt planning for the future or being realistic. 

What IS the end game? That is what everyone is asking now. Silence from the WHO and local country governments, for the most part. Do we mask forever?? Covid isn‚Äôt disappearing so how, exactly, do we get back to normal? When 99% of the population vaccinates? But then someone will say ‚Äúboosters‚Äù or ‚Äúbut mutations‚Äù.

&gt;Dubbed B.1.1.529, Imperial College London virologist Tom Peacock highlighted that the new variant¬†contains a high number of mutations, including more than 30 in the spike protein.

&gt;This raised concerns that it may be more resistant to immune cells that attack the virus, and potentially more infectious.

&gt;The Department of Health, in conjunction with the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), held a media briefing on Thursday regarding the latest data gathered on the new variant.

&gt;Experts on the panel indicated that early signs show that infections of the new variant have increased rapidly in Gauteng. According to Tulio de Oliveira, the KRISP director at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, it is likely already present in other provinces.

&gt;According to Anne von Gottberg of the National Institute For Communicable Diseases (NICD), more than 100 genomes of the variant have been identified in South Africa.",,,,1637848331,{},hm185z9,True,t3_r1wyy9,False,False,t3_r1wyy9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r1wyy9/covid19_super_variant_surging_in_gauteng_may_be/hm185z9/,1638228502.0,298,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

People that don't get vaccinated don't give a shit. My mother in law and father in law never even properly isolated before my FIL ended up in the hospital. Even after he died my MIL is still refusing to get vaccinated because she believes she can't get sick again.

IIRC, there were particular concerns about doing a two shot course with J&amp;J because the body can develop an independent immune response to the viral vector that is used. You might have to wait several months or more for that to die down to prevent the body from essentially neutralizing the second shot immediately before it can code for the desired proteins. So a booster at 4-6 months may just be the timing they would have used for a two shot series anyways.

But I‚Äôm fully recovered or at least as fully as I‚Äôll ever be. 

Best advice I can give is religiously do your physical therapy as much as they say you can. My PT gave me exercises to do 2x a day. I couldn‚Äôt work anyways so all I had was time and I asked if it would hurt if I did them 5x+ a day instead‚Ä¶ she said as long as there‚Äôs no pain have at it as much as possible. So I did exercises every couple hours every single day.

Also cleaned up my diet went plant based whole foods and drank more water than I ever have in my life (hydration is important lol).

Doctor originally said I wouldn‚Äôt be kiteboarding for at least a year and possibly never. But I was back in the water within 3 months, no surgery, but had a really fancy custom brace that stabilized and protected my leg. Few months ago ditched the brace and feeling great. 

I respect doctors and certainly listen to their instructions, but having been fucked up a few times in my life I listen to my PTs more in regards to recovery. Don‚Äôt let doctors demotivate you they‚Äôre overly cautious when it comes to stuff like that. PTs are much more positive about getting you back in action.

5 years ago I fucked up my patellar tendon and could only walk on flat/stable ground. Doctor told me there‚Äôs nothing you can do ‚Äúthat tendon is like a rubber band once it‚Äôs stretched out no surgery or therapy will bring it back‚Äù. Told me i would never hike again as off camber ground is what your patellar is for.

I was CRUSHED, literally went into a depression, though my life as I knew it was over. I love hiking.

Then my PT at the time said ‚Äúnon sense! Work your ass off with me and we‚Äôll have you hiking again!‚Äù. And it worked, my patellar is probably still fucked up like the Doctor said but for some reason he didn‚Äôt take into account I could develop all the muscles around it and recover that way. Which is exactly what I did and still hike all the time!

Doctors under promise when it comes to recovery, I understand why and don‚Äôt blame them. But having a positive attitude is very important in staying motivated to do everything you need to recover. So don‚Äôt take their diagnoses as a certainty and always get multiple opinions, for physical injuries listen to your PTs more than anyone! And always try PT before surgery.

My friend blew out his back and doctor swore he‚Äôd need surgery and essentially fuse his spine which would prevent him from all sorts of stuff. Instead he spent 2 years becoming essentially a master yogi, most flexible guy I know now when before he couldn‚Äôt even touch his toes. He still regularly sends it off 40ft cliffs while skiing.

As a result, they have 50% more deaths per capita vs a ""strict"" state like California. However, there's two things note. Being ""string"" just means capacity limits for large events and masking in certain places. Second, while Florida's governor may have taken a loose approach to CV19, some of its cities did not and that helped keep cases down.

Sweden has 3-7x deaths per capita than its neighbors.

The US has 40% less acute care hospital beds vs a comparable country. The obesity rate is 35%+. Life expectancy is 4 years greater in Sweden than America. America does not have the demographics to follow Sweden's approach. [Beds](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/u-s-health-care-resources-compare-countries/)

Additionally, I have yet to see any economic benefit from a ""loose"" approach vs ""strict"" so it makes even more sense to prioritize life.

But at the end of the day that's up to researchers to discover not lay people who have no medical background. It was originally thought that Hydroxychlorquine + an antibiotic was a golden hour drug that when delivered in time it would stop viral replication, it was based if I remember correctly off a small observation in france. It was tested in a larger setting and the results were so bad that they had to end tests because at that point there was no clinical evidence it helped so you're just letting people die. Then the theory was ivermectin, I heard it postulated early on that the reason that South Africa had been spared from this virus comparatively was because the vast majority of people there have issues with parasites and so the younger generation takes ivermectin on a regular basis. That was enough for people to run with that it was the holy grail. I personally haven't seen the qualitative studies on it but as a lay person with no in-depth medical knowledge (I helped with medical research documentation but didn't do the research so I can read it but I don't know the implications) it wouldn't matter because all I need to know is currently medical professionals have stated it isn't effective and the qty that some people were dosing themselves with was toxic.   


But lastly this new one, fluvoxamine, which is an antidepressant and appears to have had a very positive large study in brazil seems to be passing the mustard on the scientific review front but I don't know why team ivermectin doesn't just take that one instead because if you're going to take a quasi-placebo you might as well take the one with actually positive trendlines.",,,,1637798567,{},hlywffo,False,t3_r0j8lx,False,False,t1_hlum9jw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r0j8lx/seven_doctors_contract_covid_after_attending/hlywffo/,1638180637.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That's kind of the problem with having a world of mostly morons, but it's not a new problem. We have this problem every time a new serious illness comes out. There's always loads of deniers and nowadays they have the full power of automated communication networks to help spread their b*******.

I think one thing people didn't really think of when we opened the doors to dirt cheap communication with the Internet is that the limiting factor of having enough success and money to get Mass distribution in media was also a filter that prevented the worst people from getting easy access to mass. 

In this day and age cost has become the major regulating force in media, so when we removed the cost barrier we removed most forms of media regulation that also regulated.

Cable TV had a similar effect, but it was nowhere near as bad as the wild wild West unregulated nature of the internet. The more than anything it just comes down to the fact you can distribute media to millions or billions of people for a tenth or less of what it used to cost and unfortunately what that does is it allows the most radical voices access to easy mass media distribution that they did not have previously.

So at the end of the day life kind of goes on as normal on the internet and intellectual people are intellectual and normal people ignore most things but the radicals get a massive benefit because they were the ones that had been locked out of the media not the other two groups.

That's the big problem with the current media structure. This actually happens every time a new communication medium comes out. They're always under regulated and a bunch of the worst people see an opportunity that didn't exist before while the normal people just keep on doing normal stuff so they don't actually get much benefit.

One of the key problems here is you're being way too nice to these people. You should be shaming them every chance you can get because we've already determined logic and reason won't work.

When logic and reason doesn't work you should always immediately jump to shame because that really is your only other option.

Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) who developed bowel perforation.  
  
Materials and methods: This case series was conducted in Emergency Department of AORN Sant'Anna and S. Sebastiano located in Caserta. All patients resulted positive to SARS-Cov-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs whith a positive laboratory test for SARS-CoV-2 from real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) as well as bowel perforation which was identified by abdominal CT, from September 2020 to December 2020.  
  
Results: A total of five patients were identified with Bowel perforation occurred despite all patients being on anticoagulation. All patients were Italian, predominantly male(four patients) with an average age of 60 years and the most common comorbidity was hypertension, diabetes and obesity.  
  
Discussion: Bowel perforation in COVID-19 is clinically significant with high morbidity and mortality. In our series 40% of patients who were diagnosed of bowel perforation died. Average time to death after bowel perforation diagnosis was 6 days.  
  
Conclusion: We describe a case series of COVID-19 patients who developed bowel perforation.

At some point in the fairly near future this will start to happen with more regularity.  Evolution practically demands that it has to happen.

Its very likely that the new serotypes will be less lethal, and it is very unlikely that they'll be able to escape from T-cells or to increase hospitalization/fatality rates in vaccinated/recovered individuals.

This is what happens with the human coronavirus 229E which evolves every 5 years to antigenically escape the human immune system and spread itself around the world again with a new serotype.  That is probably what is going to happen with this coronavirus as well.  The problem is that we're going to be able to watch it in real time and every new mutation is going to cause loads of anxiety because of the past history of the Delta mutation.

At the same time it is possible that a worse-than-Delta mutation could happen and displace Delta as well.

First/Business include alcohol as part of part of the terms in the ticket sale. It's a small perk that's part of the expectation of that seat. People flying Business or First are likely to be frequent fliers of the airlines which is why they want to treat them. 

As far as I've noticed, Delta has has alcohol available in all classes for a while now. I fly regularly for work, but don't tend to drink on flights but I've seen people order it back in Main.

And the article gets more boorish with the whole ""People upgraded to first are more rowdy than people who bought the ticket."" How asinine. People getting upgraded to First Business are going to be frequent fliers, not the masses, and frequent fliers fly differently.

I've never sat in First for a long haul international flights, but I've gotten a couple dozen upgrades into Delta's domestic First. It's not a big deal; slightly bigger seat, reserved overhead storage, free alcohol, and they've only just started serving food again; even at that, it's just a boxed sandwich or salad.

To the frequent fliers I know, we already get to board ahead of the masses anyway as a status perk, so overhead storage isn't a big deal, seats in Main are fine when you know the planes well enough to manage your legroom, [and most of us have stacks of free drink coupons we don't use anyway.](https://i.imgur.com/fC1663B.jpg) Having sat in both, a lot, for flights as short as LAX to LAS, and as long as JFK to LAX, flying is flying, and the different domestic classes really aren't that different.",,,,1637859401,{},hm1vtlt,False,t3_r1uoyk,False,False,t1_hm1mzqj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r1uoyk/the_us_plans_to_prosecute_unruly_air_passengers/hm1vtlt/,1638241817.0,18,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So packed into that thought process is that we had wide vaccine hesitancy where we had enough capacity to get vaccine coverage to herd immunity status.

Look at the way the delta wave proceeded in the United States.  It started in southern states with patchy vaccine coverage and then washed over states with higher vaccination coverage once it had a large established reservoir.

To put it simply, since delta exists the calculus has changed.  Now the virus can effectively be stopped by a combination of natural immunity and conferred.

Nonetheless the vaccine has been effective at precluding the worst predations of a global pandemic.  We did not, for instance, have the same crisis situation that was seen in India where delta absolutely clobbered them.

We were primed that cases could reach as high as 100,000 a day but so long as the NHS could cope no restrictions would be reintroduced. In reality cases never went that high, probably because of very high infection rates right at the start of the pandemic when testing wasn't possible.

However, at the same time the existing restrictions (I mean, currently there is a lockdown, but before you had to get tested or whatever) are sometimes reason enough for other people to NOT go shopping or in restaurants themselves, i.e. economy is reduced by people for whom the restrictions are too low AND too high.",,LOW_SCORE,,1637865122,{},hm29gie,False,t3_r1joqo,False,True,t1_hm1ec4p,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r1joqo/who_says_fully_vaccinated_should_wear_masks_and/hm29gie/,1638249332.0,-15,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Correcting your error, we would have 793 cases/ 34,002 people (approximate Gibraltar population). Again, in a place where over 100% of the adult population is vaccinated, that would be 2.33% of the population contracting COVID in the last two weeks. 

Now let‚Äôs compare that rate to the United States, where roughly 1/3 of adults aren‚Äôt vaccinated. In the last two weeks, the United States has seen about 1,306,000 cases in the last two weeks. 1,306,000 cases/ 329,500,000 people = 0.396% of the population contracting COVID in the last two weeks.

2.33%/0.396% = 5.88 times the infection rate of the United States. 

TL:DR

118% of adults fully vaccinated = 2.33% of population has COVID in last two weeks, vs. 59% of the entire US population fully vaccinated = 0.396% of population has COVID in last two weeks.

South Korea, where the number of confirmed cases is exploding, initially denied Japan's statistics due to anti-Japanese sentiment.

However, administrative and medical experts analyzed Japan closely and concluded that Japan's statistics are true.

And they put forward some hypotheses about Japan.

Japan has never, in effect, enforced any compulsory control over its citizens during the corona period. It has only implemented some recommendations and support policies.

In addition, At the time of the initial spread of Corona, they dealt mainly with severe patients and did not conduct PCR tests on mild or asymptomatic patients despite the pressure of public opinion. They did not even follow the movement of the confirmed person.

This increased the possibility of group immunity due to the spread of natural infection of mild corona. In Japan, even when the vaccination rate was below 50%, the number of confirmed cases and deaths was already dropping sharply. This is because the influence of the group with immunity is strong.

In addition, Japanese citizens followed the government's recommendations. Japanese medical scientists said that if the movement of the entire Japanese population decreases by 20%, the spread of Corona will decrease sharply. Currently, the movement of Japanese citizens has decreased by 25%.

Now Vaccination rates in Japan are nearly 80% complete. However, there are doubts about the effectiveness of the vaccine, and the Japanese government has instructed schools not to forcibly recommend vaccination to minors.

Lastly, Japanese people have been wearing masks on a daily basis since 2017, so it was common for all people to wear masks. However, the Japanese government has banned children from wearing masks because of respiratory damage.

Currently, the Japanese government assumes that a spread crisis occurs every two months, and is expanding the subject of free tests and securing hospital beds in preparation for the sixth epidemic.

South Korean experts pointed out that South Korea's quarantine was completely wrong, and while South Korea was right next to Japan, South Korea ignored Japan's changes. At the same time, they insisted that the Korean government should learn from Japan even now.",,,,1637847574,{},hm16tbr,False,t3_r1rihc,False,True,t3_r1rihc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r1rihc/daily_discussion_thread_november_25_2021/hm16tbr/,1638227718.0,-2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Florida on the other hand does not report its death info for weeks if not months.  If you look today cdc data says they had somewhere around 10 deaths. But florida counts deaths differently from most other states. 

They do not call death covid related till after autopsy and that takes ages. I tracked several dates in october and every few days that data point increased.

In the UK amongst those over the age of 12 the vast majority of them have had at least 1 dose. I think it's around 88% of those 12+ with at least 1 dose last time i checked. Most deaths i imagine would be 18+ rather than teens or kids. So with the vast majority of adults in the UK it leaves very few unvaccinated people left. 

Now we know in the UK, and well all over the world a lot of people avoided going to the doctors because of covid etc plus i imagine UK hospitals also have a backlog of patients like other countries due to covid. With so many people not going to the hospital etc naturally you're going to end up with a ton of excess deaths like people having major operations cancelled or detecting cancer etc too late.

&gt;The countries were given a Level 4 warning, which means the CDC is recommending that Americans avoid traveling there, even if vaccinated. They join other European destinations on the Level 4 list, including some that were added recently ‚Äî Hungary, Iceland, the Czech Republic and Guernsey last week ‚Äî and others that have been on the list for months, such as Britain.

&gt;Countries and territories in this group have an infection incidence rate of more than 500 new cases per 100,000 people over the past 28 days (or, in places with fewer than 100,000 residents, more than 500 cases cumulatively over the past 28 days).

&gt;The move came the same day Austria went into a national lockdown over soaring case numbers. The lockdown is expected to last 20 days, but will be reevaluated at 10.

&gt;The State Department also moved Denmark and Germany to its own ‚ÄúLevel 4: Do Not Travel‚Äù list Monday, along with Iraq and Burundi. The State Department warnings include other threats in addition to coronavirus, such as terrorism, civil unrest, crime and natural disasters.

&gt;In the past seven days, daily reported cases of infection have increased by 24 percent in Germany and by 14 percent in Denmark, according to data tracked by The Washington Post. Both countries‚Äô populations are highly vaccinated: 78.1 percent of people have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine in Denmark and 70.6 percent in Germany.

[],,Scrugulus,,,[],,,,text,t2_vfsaw,False,False,[],"&gt; The answer reveals a great deal about the true power, and limitations, of the Putin system. Ekaterina Schulmann, a prominent political scientist in Moscow, has described today‚Äôs Russia as an ‚Äúinformational autocracy‚Äù that ‚Äúrelies most on the impression it is able to create.‚Äù The Kremlin can count on, say, F.S.B. henchmen to loyally carry out its edicts, but it lacks any real power to guarantee the same for millions of citizens, even those it considers a part of its electoral base. For Putin, if the majority of people are disinclined to follow quarantine measures or calls to be vaccinated, failing to force compliance only calls attention to a weakness that the architecture of the system was designed to mask in the first place. ‚ÄúThis dynamic is especially dangerous in a time of constantly sinking popularity, when people have started to fall out of love with you,‚Äù Schulmann said. In the past several years, the Levada Center has found consistently falling levels of trust and job approval for Putin; last month, a survey showed that trust in the President was fifty-three per cent, the lowest such figure since 2012. ‚ÄúTo enact harsh or unpopular measures and then see them ignored or sabotaged only deepens the feeling of crisis,‚Äù Schulmann told me. ‚ÄúThe most dangerous thing of all is to give an order that won‚Äôt be followed.‚Äù

I've suspected this for a while now. At first I thought Putin was prioritising the economy; or that he was happy to let a few thousand expensive pensioners die. Then I suspected that he was caught up in his own denial of the severity of Covid and could either not see the reality or was at least not seeing a way to back down from his former position.  
But then I had zeroed in on the problem stated in the above quote. On top of that: most people in Russia are apolitical: their default attitude is that any type of government is always corrupt.
