&gt; The vaccines now in use and available to just about anyone 12 and older provide near universal protection against illness and even greater protection against severe cases leading to hospitalizations. Even more, **doctors in hospitals treating COVID-19 patients in the state can‚Äôt recall a single death of a vaccinated person.**

&gt; But after a year of relentless work, the constant churn of unvaccinated patients continues to wear down the doctors and nurses keeping them alive, or falling short and seeing them die.

The Cleveland study only monitored employees in their healthcare network who began receiving vaccines at the start of the study in December of 2020. [This plot](https://imgur.com/JArZb9k) shows the rate at which unvaccinated employees tested positive for symptomatic COVID vs ones who had been previously infected or vaccinated. You can see that for the last half of the study a majority of the group was fully vaccinated and still had virtually zero cases while the unvaccinated group continued to grow. You can read the full study [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176v2.full-text).

Nobody is lying to you, I don't know why you keep saying that. The conclusion is obvious, if you don't want to end up in the hospital and potentially die from COVID get fully vaccinated ASAP. Nothing in life is perfect but, at least with the current variants, it works extremely well and is the best protection you could hope for unless you're willing to live on some remote island without any human contact.

COVID isn't the only communicable disease so even if the vaccines were perfect you'd still want to take reasonable precautions to prevent illness as usual (like washing your hands frequently). Believing that the vaccines are perfect or nearly perfect or only 'very good' shouldn't have any impact on anyone's behavior, at least outside of a clinical setting where you may face a very high exposure risk to the disease at a COVID ward.",,,1624422484,{},h2qfzmq,False,t3_o5yzio,False,False,t1_h2q2ql4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o5yzio/cdc_nearly_every_adult_covid19_death_is_now/h2qfzmq/,1624722739,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; And they almost all have something in common.

Later in that article they link to three similar stories at other cities:

&gt; Doctors in Denver, Cleveland and other cities have noted the same trend: The COVID wards are filled with unvaccinated people.

The headline of the Denver article is ""About 500 People In Colorado Are Still Hospitalized With COVID. Nearly All Of Them Are Unvaccinated"".

The Cleveland article states:

&gt; ‚ÄúFrom January first to around mid-April, we‚Äôve had around 4,300 admissions to the hospital with COVID. Of those patients, 99% were not fully vaccinated,‚Äù said Eduardo Mireles, MD, Director of the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

The 'other cities' article states:

Another option would be to make that a reason to increase healthcare plan costs--if you're not vaccinated for COVID then your insurance plan might cost 30% more for example. That'd also require changing the ACA but might at least get a couple of votes (not close to the 60 votes in the Senate it'd need to pass though). The downside to that approach is it'd penalize people who can't get vaccinated due to a real health condition. If you try to carve out an exception for them I'm sure unscrupulous doctors would sign off for whoever doesn't want to get vaccinated so that they're not penalized.

In Romania, you don‚Äôt even have to get out of the car to get vaccinated  
24-hour Pifzer vaccination marathons are also popular.  
However, not everyone is vaccinated in Romania. We know of someone who traveled but the vaccinator didn‚Äôt vaccinate him with Pfizer because he had already received another vaccine in the previous four weeks. Caution is not accidental: there are currently no comprehensive studies on the effects of vaccination and vaccine mixing. In any case, there are already countries where it is used: in Bahrain, for example , where nearly 60 percent of those vaccinated received Sinopharm, Pfizer is given as a third dose to those who have previously been vaccinated with a Chinese vaccine. According to the Bahraini protocol, six months should elapse between the second Sinopharm and Pfizer.  
Dual nationals are also vaccinated at the border  
Hungarian-Romanian dual citizens can receive the Janssen vaccine, for example, at the Nagylaki border post, after presenting their Romanian identity card. This is also beneficial because a single dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is enough, meaning that those who choose this solution do not have to travel twice for vaccination.  
Not up in the EESC  
Our reader said he was not worried that his body would have a vaccine after four doses, as his GP also encouraged him to try another vaccine after a good amount of time after the two Chinese doses. However, he advises everyone to consult their GP before traveling to Romania. It is not at all certain that he will encourage his patient to get the third vaccine, as GPs are divided on the issue: there are those who support the third vaccine, others insist that two doses are enough, even if no antibody is detected in the patient's body.  
Our reader also did the antibody test after the first dose of Pfizer, which showed zero after the Chinese vaccine. After the first dose of Pfizer, the antibody levels rose to hundreds, which you will see after the second dose of Pfizer when the two weeks have passed.  
ROBERT GHEMENT / EPA / MTI  
The first car vaccine in Bucharest designed to administer serum against coronavirus on April 29, 2021. Vaccine recipients will receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine here without prior notice  
It is worth knowing that even if you are vaccinated in Romania, you will receive a paper about the vaccination, but your vaccination will not be posted in the Electronic Health Service Area, so if you only received a Chinese vaccine in Hungary, this will apply when traveling abroad.  
Nevertheless, Ern≈ë Duda encourages everyone to try to arrange Pfizer for himself. The Szeged virologist told Free Europe that there are many who solve this in Hungary, in a neighboring country. It is not only a destination in Romania, but also in Serbia, where those who want to be vaccinated abroad are also welcomed with open arms. By the end of March , more than 22,000 foreigners had been vaccinated there by then.  
Sometimes people from Szeged jump over to Serbia and vaccinate themselves, or have a relative in Transylvania and go there. But there are also cases where the Hungarian doctor re-vaccinates without further ado  
\- said Duda, who said that the Hungarian state should do this, but he encourages everyone to ‚Äúafter the mills of the state grind even slower than the mills of God, do not remain unprotected for long months, inoculate yourself if you know. It's semi-illegal, but health is more important. ""  
This is what another reader over the age of 60 who was vaccinated with the Chinese vaccine thought, who did not dare to admit to his family that he was traveling to Romania for Pfizer: he secretly took the vaccine because his relatives and his family objected to having no antidote. receive a third vaccine after a while.  
Any laboratory test is good for the security certificate  
Although B√©la Merkely said earlier that not all laboratories are suitable for measuring antibodies, a government decree a few days ago states that those who do not receive the certificate of protection automatically after vaccination, but because they have contracted the disease in a Hungary they may prove that they are eligible for the certificate by a laboratory test for coronavirus antibodies carried out by a health care provider in the Member States. This can be obtained by someone who does not have a positive antigen test or a molecular biological test for coronavirus with positive results in the EEST, ie someone who is not an infectious patient. So if you are not vaccinated but have the antibody in your blood, which is detected by an accredited laboratory test, you can get a certificate of protection.",,,1624413739,{},h2q08t9,True,t3_o6323y,False,True,t1_h2q08bk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o6323y/worried_hungarians_vaccinated_with_a_chinese/h2q08t9/,1624713727,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Although there is no official protocol in Hungary as to whether a person's body does not develop protection against the coronavirus after two vaccinations based on antibody and cellular tests, it is not an impossible task to get a third dose. Virologist Mikl√≥s Rusvai also talked about knowing about a family doctor who gave a third vaccination to his patient in the absence of an antibody .

&amp;#x200B;

  
The virologist has stated several times that the GP has the right to decide which position to take. ‚ÄúIt can be solved, there are always vaccines left out,‚Äù he said of the fact that although GPs need to document the vaccines used, if they stay in the ampoule, they can even use it to give a third vaccine instead of throwing it away. The expert stressed that it is worth getting another vaccine whose body did not produce an immune response, but it is not worth focusing on the Chinese vaccine, this may happen with other vaccines, in which case he does not think it should be revaccinated with someone.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
At home, however, the problem seems to affect people over the age of 60 who have been vaccinated with the Chinese vaccine: there are strikingly many of them who, even after several laboratory tests, have not had a sufficient number of antibodies, which means that their protection is highly questionable. A Facebook group has already been set up, where hundreds have uploaded their negative lab results, and the organizers who launched the petition have been assured by virologists and immunologists of their support in providing the state with free antibody testing and a third vaccination.

&amp;#x200B;

  
With the approval of his GP, he went to Romania for Pfizer  
However, according to B√©la Merkely , anyone who has received the two vaccinations should sit back and not test for an antibody, because ‚Äúno clear correlation can be established between the level of protection and the level of antibody‚Äù. The rector of Semmelweis University stressed that antibody levels continue to fall after vaccination, but there are still so-called memory cells that ‚Äútrigger cellular immunity‚Äù when needed. Nevertheless, he offered that if someone did not have antibodies after the two vaccinations, they would be tested for free at Semmelweis University, to the extent of their capacity, with a special test. However, the rector did not say what to do with the negative result of this examination, as was the case with a retired doctor, we wrote about it in the following article:  


&amp;#x200B;

  
The antibody test recommended by B√©la Merkely also became negative for a doctor vaccinated with a Chinese vaccine

&amp;#x200B;

  
Half a thousand negative negative results have already been uploaded to the Facebook group where antibody tests for those vaccinated with Sinopharm are collected. Their representatives were received by Gergely Kar√°csony, and they also correspond with the authorities, but no progress has been made on their case.

&amp;#x200B;

  
A reader over the age of 60 did not choose to lean back after receiving both doses of Chinese vaccine in March. An antibody test two weeks after the second dose showed no antibodies in his body. He waited until May to see if anything happened, until then he tried to live as carefully as before the vaccination and barely met his children.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
Satisfied with this, he went to his GP, who advised him that, according to tests, it was as if he had not even been vaccinated, to try abroad to see if he would receive another vaccine.

ROSTA TIBOR / MTI  
A woman receives the second dose of the Chinese Sinopharm coronavirus vaccine in B√©k√©scsaba, at the vaccination station of R√©thy P√°l Hospital on June 14, 2021  
Our reader did so after learning that foreign nationals are being vaccinated in Romania without registration. He looked at the vaccination points on a map, and finally he chose Arad. He traveled twice and received the first Pfizer vaccination at a car vaccination station and the second Pfizer vaccination three weeks later. In other words, our reader received a total of four doses of vaccines: two Chinese in Hungary and two Pfizers in Romania.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
The Romanian vaccination protocol is looser than the Hungarian one, this can be used by those Hungarians who, despite taking the vaccination at home, were not protected against the coronavirus according to the tests. In Romania, registered citizens can go to the vaccination site. However, during larger vaccination campaigns, car vaccination points will be opened in the car parks of shopping malls, where EU citizens will be vaccinated without prior registration, upon presentation of an identity document, and there is even a text on the Romanian Ministry of the Interior urging foreigners to vaccinate. According to our local sources, of the 4.5 million people vaccinated in Romania, about 20,000 were foreigners anyway.

Our reader told me that he didn‚Äôt even have to get out of the car, he was vaccinated at the car fire station where doctors and nurses were happy to help him.

Cyclosporine is no longer common in post-tx immunosuppression - I was transplanted almost 20 years ago and they were already phasing it out. To say that the clinical use of immunosuppressants in tx patients is vastly different than the management of Crohn's isn't entirely accurate. 

  
Your characterization of the immunosuppression of transplant patients is misleading. Of course we need to be careful, but frankly, beyond extra care on planes and avoidance of undercooked foods, our lives pre-COVID were not that different from that of an immunocompetent person - we ride public transportation without masks, work in group spaces, send our kids to daycare, visit our families on holidays, go to the movies, eat out, etc. Surely, you can see why COVID-19 is different from acinetobacter on one end of the spectrum (deadly, but rarely encountered in my lived experience) and say, molluscum contagiosum (very common in my environment, but not at all deadly). 

  
COVID is both common and deadly.  Antimetabolites specifically seem to be the problem for immunogenicity of the vaccine in tx patients (only 54% efficacy after two doses. If you care to, you can find the most recent research on this from Johns Hopkins in JAMA from last month). It is decidedly NOT back to normal post-vaccine for us - we have been told to continue masking and social distancing and limiting any contact outside of our immediate households. Unlike those with Crohn's, we don't have the option of ceasing immunosuppression for a few weeks due to the risk of rejection. To say that we (and the partners, friends, family, and children we share our lives with) should be used to sheltered and lonely existences is simply untrue. I am not suggesting that public health policy should be shifted due to our condition because you are right - there aren't that many of us. That being said, please don't make ableist claims that misrepresent our actual lives in your arguments for opening up.

I never masked up, ever, before this. I certainly will during flu season(and keep track if it hits early)now.  While I wasn't clear on most of the reasoning of this stuff before hand, I'm pretty hyper aware now, and I think most empathetic people are.

Sadly vaccine passports won't be a thing in most states, as this has become deeply political. I'm a libertarian(left leaning, most of the LP would hate my guts here in the states) so I understand the hesitancy to give the state power to discriminate, even if it's for public health, but the failure of our government to be trustworthy is not a reason to step on other citizens.

On a whole it makes me sad that you got people on both sides(this is not a bothsides argument though) that distrust the government, or are unhappy with it, but cannot come together to find a rather simple solution to this. OBVIOUSLY it's not too simple, with how it works now, but our government is supposed to be transparent, beholden to the people. If vaccine passports were a thing, it should also be easily voted away when COVID is in the past. 

Like I said, I'm not really a bothsides guy, atleast anymore. While the left has had some screw ups, there's only one side pushing ignorance and feelings over logic. Our leaders really need some peer review, our sources need more scrutiny, and we need to fix our fucking education system.

Sorry, yet another rant, and I'm drunk this time lol.

U.S. testing to identify people infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been slow to start and to this day has not sufficiently ramped up. Testing was delayed in January and February as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed faulty test kits, then failed to approve a working test developed by the World Health Organization or those developed by local public health laboratories. Since March, the number of tests per day has never reached the number needed because of shortages of reagents, materials, and personal protective equipment (see graph).

More than 6.4 million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Nearly four out of ten Belgians are also covered by a complete vaccination.  
The latest covid figures  
There are still 450 people hospitalized due to Covid-19, including 184 in intensive care, according to the Sciensano epidemiological bulletin published on Wednesday. During the week of June 16 to 22, 28.7 patients with the coronavirus were admitted to hospital on average each day, a decrease of 36% from the previous week.  
Between June 13 and June 19, 432.7 new cases were diagnosed on average per day, 44% less than the previous week. Since the start of the epidemic in Belgium, 1,080,035 cases have been detected.  
The most striking development is observed in the province of Luxembourg, which had 25 new cases during the last week, against 81 the previous week, a decrease of 69%. The Brussels region and East Flanders have observed a 41% drop in contamination. The capital has the most new cases in absolute terms (508), followed by the province of Antwerp (494).  
Over the same period, 6 deaths from the virus were recorded each day on average, a weekly decrease of 19%. At least 25,144 have succumbed to Sars-CoV-2 since its emergence in the country.  
Nearly 38,600 tests on average were also performed daily, for a positivity rate of 1.5%. The latter amounts to 3.5% for the age group of 10-19 years, 2.2% for 0-9 years, 1.6% for 20-39 years, 1.3% for 40-64 years and only 0.8% for those over 65.  
The incidence, which indicates the number of new cases per 100,000 inhabitants, reached 73.2 over 14 days. The virus's reproduction rate remains at 0.75.

After the first person tested PCR positive at the airport, the rest of the team was let go, put on a bus and went to Osaka, their pre-games training cap location.

When a person tests positive, the people they may have infected are designated as ‚Äúclose contacts‚Äù who are then required to go into quarantine. It has become apparent, however, that the Olympic/Paralympic office at the Cabinet Secretariat wrongly believed that the responsibility to designate close contacts fell on the quarantine counter at the airport. ([Here](https://twitter.com/katoikumi/status/1407142271137423360?s=21) is a TV clip circulating on Twitter, of a quarantine official saying ‚Äúno it‚Äôs not our responsibility‚Äù after a government official says it is at a hearing by a diet member.)

The responsibility actually fell on the health care center at the Osaka city the team has been staying at. The center did designate the rest of the team as close contacts, but they only notified the team‚Äôs hotel about an hour and a half after it became news in the media. Because of this delay, the team ended up having supper in the dining room together last night.

Then the second PCR positive result came out today from the swabs taken yesterday. The team has reportedly having their meals in their room from today‚Äôs breakfast onward, but it seems possible that more of the team will test positive in the future. 

I‚Äôm worried about the bus driver, the hotel staff and a city official that has been with the team as well - the vaccination rate is very low in Japan, and even if they have been  vaccinated because of their role in the Olympics, it is still concerning because the Uganda team has been supposedly fully vaccinated.

The two adjectives are referring to different things.

The first, ""nearly"" is referring to the number of cases.  Almost all of them.  The second, ""entirely"" is refering to the degree of preventability.

If I get aids from sharing a needle with my drug addict brother, that was entirely preventable.  If I get it by slipping in the alleyway of my parking garage and jabbing myself on an infected needle, it was partly preventable.

Yep.  Hospitalization and death are rare, but increasingly frequent with the variants.   What may be more concerning is pediatric long Covid.    
There are about 10 clinics in the US that now specialize in treating long Covid pediatric patients. ( Annecdotally I have a 11 year old nephew that had 6 months of a variety of long Covid symptoms and still hasn‚Äôt fully recovered. )

‚ÄúIn adults, studies peg the proportion who experience prolonged difficulties at 1 in 3 Covid patients, but there is a vanishingly small set stats about children. Experts told STAT they‚Äôve all looked at one research paper from Rome that studied 129 patients from 2 to 18 years old, as well as data on about 9,000 children and adolescents from the U.K.‚Äôs health system. From that small base, they surmise a plausible range from 7% to 20%.

No vaccine is perfect.



&gt; Personally, I don't expect the vaccines to be perfect, but I've seen long-term health consequences from viruses, and I don't want them for myself or my family. So, I care about the new variants.

Why are you afraid of the new variants when the vaccines protect against it?

How many vaccinated people are getting long term health consequences from coronavirus after being vaccinated?  

How many vaccinated people are getting long term health consequences from new variants of coronavirus after being vaccinated?  

This is what I mean by ""You also don't get to shut everything down again because you want to.""

Just because you are scared doesn't mean you fear is justified statistically.

""Recovery of deleted deep sequencing data sheds more light on the early Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 epidemic""
Jesse D. Bloom

&gt; Abstract

&gt; The origin and early spread of SARS-CoV-2 remains shrouded in mystery. Here I identify a data set containing SARS-CoV-2 sequences from early in the Wuhan epidemic that has been deleted from the NIH's Sequence Read Archive. I recover the deleted files from the Google Cloud, and reconstruct partial sequences of 13 early epidemic viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences in the context of carefully annotated existing data suggests that the Huanan Seafood Market sequences that are the focus of the joint WHO-China report are not fully representative of the viruses in Wuhan early in the epidemic. Instead, the progenitor of known SARS-CoV-2 sequences likely contained three mutations relative to the market viruses that made it more similar to SARS-CoV-2's bat coronavirus relatives.

She said he will get it, she is waiting for more data/proof/cases/ etc. 

I‚Äôm just worried due to the new variant and how her household likes to travel outside of our state. So I would like him to take the vaccine sooner than later.

My ex did as well, like a flu. But her boyfriend had to be in the hospital. 

I get that even with all of that it‚Äôs not enough for her to be okay with it right away. 
This comment of mine is one step for me at least, to find more info on this. 

The people commenting here with other teens and adults with autism and their reactions are more than great and welcome. But clearly not all that will matter to help me convince my ex. 
The comment about contacting Pfizer about their data for autism individuals is great. I would had never thought of that. 

My thought process for me was ‚Äúmy parents got me the polio vaccine and that‚Äôs why I never got it, so I am going to get this COVID one‚Äù

My ex thinks differently specially due to our son and his autism. I get it. And also she took moderna and had serious side affects. Everybody reacts different I know.

2. actual cases the vaccines are preventing
3. how many breakthrough cases of Delta are happening and to whom/what demographics
4. how many deaths from Delta among the doubly vaxxed and why
5. in instance where doubly vaxxed still get a case of COVID, does it still destroy the insulin manufacturing islets in the pancreas, cause kidney, heart and brain damage and how many cases of Long COVID even doubly vaxxed
6. now that data is showing that kids do transmit COVID and that they get Long COVID  - what now?
7. India just named the new Delta Plus variant AY.1 (aka Delta + K417N mutation) now upgraded to ‚ÄúVariant of Concern‚Äù by India Ministry of health for faster transmission, stronger binding to lung cells,  and the special ability to reduce efficacy of certain monoclonal antibody drugs. ""

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

See hospital workers are not all actually medically trained employees, and a lot of articles have conflated these two groups together.

1. Actually, management of IBD and other autoimmune disorders is quite different both in theory and practice. The point in graft rejection is to blanket any potential cellular immune response to avoid near instant destruction of that tissue. Immunology is quite complex but CD4 or CD8 recognition of MHC‚Äôs will invariably lead to clonal expansion of the B cell repertoire, which leads to a whole host of other cascade immune reactions. That same progression isn‚Äôt at all similar to IBD/rheumatic disorders. The high dosage, very significant amount of suppression post transplant is to ensure that that initial cascade doesn‚Äôt happen. You are right; generally the degree of suppression a period of time after transplantation is titrated to lower infection risk. But it‚Äôs still significant. Why is that?

Well, Crohns/UC patients can benefit from biologics that are much more targeted in their suppression (the one the other guy was talking about targets TNF-a, a pro-Apoptotic cytokine, which is why an adverse effect is certain types of cancer). It still results in suppression systematically to a degree, but it‚Äôs not the same blanket suppression as say cyclosporin.  Another thing is that you mentioned that is incorrect is cyclosporine usage. It is very much still used in transplantation, but it will depend on the circumstances. It‚Äôs also sometimes used in Crohns treatment as well and in the treatment of other rheumatic disorders (also in topical form for dry eyes). 

2. There‚Äôs no ‚Äústandard‚Äù dosage for Crohns. As someone who suffers from RA, with most autoimmune disorders/rheumatic disorders there is no such thing as a standard dose. Dosing is based on the patients symptoms and available data, you don‚Äôt start every patient with the same disorder on the same stuff at the same dosage, there‚Äôs too much variability in the conditions presentation. All we have is combos or drugs that *usually* work well. 

3. I could have named a lots of other bacteria, but I‚Äôm familiar with acenitobacter since I did some research on it. It‚Äôs not a very rare infection. Actually, it‚Äôs an increasingly common hospital acquired infection that is a far bigger problem in, you guessed it, severely immunocompromised individuals, often post-op. So when you compare the two, you ought to consider that if you catch covid, you will in all likelihood be okay (most of the data oddly enough shows that age is a much bigger factor than even a lot of co-morbidities), but given your condition, and you had to go to the hospital for a procedure, where you absolutely could contract an acenitobacter infection, the outcome is far worse.",,,1624432813,{},h2qt18z,False,t3_o5yzio,False,True,t1_h2qqp88,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o5yzio/cdc_nearly_every_adult_covid19_death_is_now/h2qt18z/,1624730334,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There‚Äôs a huge lack of respect for women in the medical community and this is undoubtedly a contributing factor when people get pushed down the anti vaxx pipeline. 

Just look at when women were first reporting that the vaccine messed up their period. The first response was ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wrong; you must be lying about your cycle‚Äù until so many women reported this side effect that they had to legitimately look into it. And what do you know? The stress of making such a significant immune response *can,* in fact, cause temporary disruptions in someone‚Äôs cycle and we weren‚Äôt lying or over exaggerating our symptoms. Another excellent example is looking at how common PCOS and endo are yet many women spend years fighting for a diagnosis because doctors think we‚Äôre lying for some reason. If it took you [years](https://www.health.com/condition/pcos/pcos-diagnosis-delay) to be diagnosed with a condition that effects [up to 12%](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/pcos.html) of your peers, wouldn‚Äôt you be skeptical of doctors too? 

Not that there‚Äôs any excuse for anti vaxxers but it doesn‚Äôt surprise me at all that women are for more likely to fall for it because women regularly have to fight to receive adequate health care. I don‚Äôt really trust my doctors because no matter where I go or who I see, the only two responses I get are ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do a pregnancy test‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhen is your next period?‚Äù I‚Äôve just accepted that I won‚Äôt get treatment unless I‚Äôm literally dying because anything less than passing out in the ER is just my period.",,,1624421349,{},h2qe6qi,False,t3_o5nf02,False,False,t1_h2njt90,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o5nf02/women_are_the_key_to_vaccinating_the_world/h2qe6qi/,1624721689,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Please get vaccinated. I am not OP but just saw your comment. If you had it you might have survived a weaker strain. The strain that is now going to become the dominant stain...is the Delta variant. So while someone might have fought off the original, the subsequent varaints can become signifigantly worse. the Delta variant is what swept through India and caused 400,000 cases per day....after they had thought they had ""beaten"" the virus. It is covid ""on steroids""...so....it is not the same virus, therefore your anti-bodies might not be able to over-come the variant.

Also...anti-bodies dissipate over time. We do not know how long they last. After 3-6 months they seem to reduce, and you are at risk of getting re-infected, and possibily even dying if you get hit with the bad variant.

We've never been 100% safe from infectious diseases. That's not a reasonable standard for returning to 'normal'.

No, as far as I know you would not fall into a ‚Äúseverely‚Äù immunocompromised, but it‚Äôs not exactly like there‚Äôs a set definition for that. Generally when we talk of really severe immune suppression, it‚Äôs stuff like high dose cyclosporine post transplant. The goal there is basically to eradicate your immune system for the time being, largely because the immune response to foreign organ tissue would be very strong, like if we could quantify it it would be several orders of magnitude greater than the autoimmune response you‚Äôre experiencing with Crohns. In those people, you really can‚Äôt fight much stuff off, so the chances of an opportunistic infection is quite high. Actually, transplant ID is like a subdivision of ID, to put that in perpective, there‚Äôs no Chrons/autoimmune ID.

No responsible doctor would prescribe immune suppressant drugs  at the strength or dosage that you‚Äôd use them in a transplant scenario for Chrons, the risk would just be too great. So I guess the answer to your question is that no, you‚Äôre not really in that same category as transplant patients.

Given that you have data on the biologic, my advise would probably be to stop the Methotrexate and then get vaccinated, then I suppose restart it. But that‚Äôs really based on the infliximab data and the fact that blanket immunity suppressants are gonna usually cause less targeted suppression than biologics. From what I understand methotrexate + infliximab are a pretty common combo for treatment of Crohns, so I‚Äôm not surprised your doctor prescribed that. And again, I‚Äôm not a doctor and you should really talk to them instead.",,,1624413125,{},h2pz2yj,False,t3_o5yzio,False,False,t1_h2pwias,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o5yzio/cdc_nearly_every_adult_covid19_death_is_now/h2pz2yj/,1624713039,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The spread of a virus is INCREDIBLY relevant. As we‚Äôve seen with the mutations so far, in the corse of a year it‚Äôs gotten more deadly and better at evading our vaccines. This will continue, but we can control the rate at which it happens by ensuring that everybody gets TWO doses. This isn‚Äôt the flu, and comparing it to the flu is kinda awful.

My understanding is that mRNA vaccines inject messenger RNA containing the instructions for the covid spike protein. The mRNA is covered in lipids to protect it on the way. When the RNA enters your cells, they start producing that spike protein. Your body will then detect that protein and start producing antibodies. The protein is harmless in itself, but your body will be prepared to deal with the real deal if necessary.

Vector based vaccines (AstraZeneca, Johnsson&amp;Johnsson, Sputnik V) take a somewhat similar approach in that they also make your own body produce the spike protein (or similar, I think AZ uses more than just the spike protein). The difference is that they use a vector virus (adenovirus) to deliver the genetic code.

Inactivated virus vaccines like Sinopharm, Sinovac, Bharat or Valneva use an inactivated form of the real coronavirus. It has however been ""disabled"" so that it won't reproduce in your body or pose a threat. This is the most traditional form of vaccines.

By my understanding most vaccines take years to develop because many people are generally not very eager to volunteer and transmission rates for those diseases are relatively low so it takes a long time to establish a large body of data on the effectiveness.  With covid tens of thousands were clamoring for a chance to be in the trials and we had a pandemic level infection rate. They even targeted countries where the infection was running rampant with the trials. All of those factors combined to allow for a massive amount of data to be collected very quickly. 

And unlike the popular argument there have never actually been any side effects that appear years later. There are a couple of cases of side effects (I believe narcolepsy was one side effect) only being realised years later but it was discovered they started within a few weeks of the vaccine.

The Bible is silent at best, so I do believe the political opposition is overblown.

Arguing that the Bible doesn't instruct Christians to require nonbelievers to follow Christian moral codes, and in fact instructs Christians to expect and figure out how to navigate the exact opposite of that with humility about their faith, is a much stronger argument that would simultaneously solve a lot of other toxicity from religious mores being inserted in secular government where it doesn't belong.

CDC is reported to say, ""No worries, don't wear a mask if you are vaccinated."" That sounds great!  
  
Other news reports suggest that against Delta the MRNA may be 80-85% effective in preventing symptomatic illness, (some reports) or hospitalization (other reports.) This is what I don't' understand.  
  
Do these efficacy estimates in preventing symptomatic disease refer to the subset of vaccinated population that actually contracted the virus, making it a smallish number, or does it refer to the entire vaccinated population, making it potentially a very large number?  
  
As I recall, in an unvaccinated population the original Covid variant did not cause symptomatic disease in 85% of persons who contracted it and somewhere around 2% were hospitalized. Can they really be saying that fully vaccinated people are at similar risk to Delta as unvaccinated people were to the original virus?

**The cases are higher and increasing faster in the unvaccinated population in the UK.** When the data is divided, it shows that there are currently 1,917 new daily symptomatic cases of COVID in vaccinated people, an increase of 89% from 1,014 cases, compared to 9,991 new daily symptomatic cases in unvaccinated people, an increase of 114% from 4,662 cases last week.   
In terms of prevalence, on average 1 in 543 people in the UK currently have symptomatic COVID \[1\].   
**The UK R value is 1.3 and regional R values are; England, 1.4, Wales, 1.3, Scotland, 1.3 (full table of regional results below).**   
According to the prevalence data by age, **cases have increased the most in the 20-29 age group and the 0-19 age group follows closely behind (see graph below).**

&amp;#x200B;

The researchers showed that COVID-19 infections in England surged from May 20 to Jun 7, with a **doubling time of 11 days and an estimated R (reproductive) number of 1.44.**  Doubling time is the number of days before coronavirus cases, hospitalizations, or deaths doubled, and R indicates how many people, on average, catch the virus from an infected person.  
In total, 135 of 108,911 swabs tested positive for COVID-19, for a weighted prevalence of 0.15%, up from 0.10% of swabs collected from Apr 15 to May 3. Northwest England had the highest prevalence (0.26%), while the country's southwest region had the lowest (0.05%). Residents of socioeconomically disadvantaged areas were at nearly double the risk of testing positive, compared with those in less-deprived areas.

I mean, it already was able to make the jump of Human &gt; Mink &gt; Back to Human. So it can clearly mutate enough to reinfect humans after passing through a mink. Not to mention the other animals it has already infected,  from cats, dogs, lions, tigers, ferrets, etc. 

The spike proteins can surely change, and they could totally break through the vaccines if given enough time. That is what is happening with the variants. I mean, we are seeing it happen. People would have to blind not to see it. It's on the news. 

So, the virus could make the vaccines practically ineffective. This is why both Modern and Pfizer have been working on booster shots for about a 2 months now. They are due to be out later in the year. Which means this pandemic is going to go for longer than people think with people having to take vaccines for at least a few years.

Last time I checked, the vaccines targets specific proteins in the spike. If the spikes changed, that is the proteins changed enough,  they could still get through the ACE2 receptor --and AND TLR4 and possibly the CD147 receptors* which nobody seems to know about -- but still have the vaccines be less affective as we are seeing with the variant being capable of reinfecting people who were fully vaccinated. 

Not anti-vaxxer here but it seems there is a hole in people's logic because they lack the information. One that does not seem to be addressed by experts on TV either. You have to go and get the info yourself from Academic Papers and not everyone does that. 

Why it is not talked about? My guess? Carrying a narrative to the masses because it might discourage some people to know this.

This, combined with a dosage interval closer to the manufacturer‚Äôs recommendation, would have protected against deaths and hospitalizations in the most at risk groups across all ages and would have better arrested the early spread of the Delta variant (for which a single vaccine dose is mostly ineffective).

Canada is larger and we do single payer at 1/3rd the cost per capita.

More people makes it cheaper, but also more land makes it harder.

United States has no excuse and you're just parroting some nonsense talking points. It is physically impossible for single payer to be more expensive country wide vs current system.

Regardless in the end your comments about no doctors would work in Washington, yeah some doctors complain they did it in alberta to, generally people hate making less money or having money redistributed across sectors or larger areas.

It's not really an excuse unless I guess you wanna argue next all doctors will leave the US.

Also no we don't underpay doctors either, they make very good money as they should.

You're attempt at strawmanning arguments is pretty clear as well as grasping at straws.

No we also don't have high wait times, that's also a made up thing Canadians have no idea where it came from.

However at the end of the day we both know you bringing up doctors is a false equivalency especially when you straw man it into ""you want them to work for free"".

Sorry dude, a doctor shouldn't make 600k+ on average and yeah, doctors going from 400-600k to 200-300k like in canada probably upsets a lot of doctors.

Yes specialities exist and before you even try no I'm not trying to dictate what a doctor should make.

You know that's a fools errand to use that argument as it means nothing.

People making more now are upset they may(some doctors also make more, funny how that works) make less in the future makes them angry and want to move.

If moving a state over makes more, for a lot of people that's worth it. Same happens up here.

When it gets standardized country wide, that stops being as much as a problem.

Though I do like how in the end your argument is for paying more for a service then you should be.

Also again no medicaid and Medicare can't negotiate. Stop bringing up Washington, as that is not what we were talking to, and also insurance still negotiates lower. Someone could also point to 10 to 30 states where the current system fails entirely. Bringing up one state where they somewhat changed the rules for a small group of people does not fix anything or prove anything when the benefits require the entire country to be aligned when it comes to Healthcare.

I'm a bit disappointed with their takeaways.

They also pointed out the higher frequency of cases after the second dose (p.17, and p.25-28), and yet don't seem to consider only giving males in this age group one dose of Pfizer, or J&amp;J instead. I haven't watched the 5 (?) hour presentation yet so maybe they brought it up on video.

Putting that aside, I'm surprised by the rates compared to Israel (which seemed to report estimated numbers higher by a magnitude of 10).

[],,jdorje,,,[],,,,text,t2_ii7rl,False,False,[],"Combining the state's prevalence levels with their weekly case counts (by reported week) shows delta rising in case counts at a fairly low exponential rate, while every other VOC is rapidly being killed off.  Automoderator will not allow the google graph to be posted, however.

But looking at Colorado as one entity here is not helpful.  Delta has been highly prevalent in Grand Junction, an ultra-conservative 30%-vaccinated city in the far west.  Total cases do appear to be dropping there, however.  Meanwhile in the highly-vaccinated and far more populous front range cities cases are dropping much faster, and there is nearly no Delta.  It is worth noting that this was seasonally the lowest-spread time of year last summer.

If we apply the same math to the [US](https://covariants.org/per-country) as a [whole](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/), I think we get a different result.

* 14-28 June : 38% delta : 12,133 daily cases : 4.6k daily delta cases

* 31-14 June : 17% delta : 14,831 daily cases : 2.5k daily delta cases

* 17-31 May : 6% delta : 22,243 daily cases : 1.3k daily delta cases

* 3-17 May : 2% delta : 36,313 daily cases : 800 daily delta cases

This shows a pretty consistent exponential growth of about +33% per week, or R(t) ~1.17 for a 4-day serial interval.  We have vaccinated pretty significantly over that time period, however (around least 15% of the unvaccinated have gotten their first dose over the 6-week period).

Not to say that the Delta variant will cause trouble everywhere; many of our largest cities are incredibly well-vaccinated.  But if you have friends, they need to get vaccinated.

&gt; It feels like they left this out of the press release to encourage people to get 2nd doses, which seems an unnecessary caution **(the burying of efficacy about 1st dose, not the concept of getting 2nd doses to be clear).**

&gt;**Absolutely true that everyone should get their 2nd dose when available**

I was saying them not mentioning the impressive efficacy of the 1st dose in order to encourage people to get the 2nd dose is an unnecessary caution. There are better ways to encourage people to get their 2nd doses, something that hasn't actually been a real issue almost anywhere since there is no movement of people who gladly got the first dose but are somehow anti-vaxx for the 2nd.

I was simply commenting that the same data shows the 1st dose brings people a great amount of protection from this variant, which is great news. 

I have also stated several times in this same thread that the 2nd dose is necessary and everyone should get it when available. Again, this isn't a real issue since anti-2nd dose people are not a significant population that exists. 

If you want to misrepresent what I'm saying, I have no interest in continuing this conversation.

**Youth test positivity rate five times higher than seniors'**

[https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/06/youth-delta-variant-behind-uk-covid-surge](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/06/youth-delta-variant-behind-uk-covid-surge)

Young people are behind the surge, with a 5-fold higher rate of COVID-19 test positivity among children 5 to 12 years (0.35% prevalence) and adults 18 to 24 (0.36% prevalence) than in those 65 or older. People younger than 50 were 2.5 times more likely to be infected than older people (prevalence, 0.20% vs 0.08%), although the researchers noted that infections seem to be growing at a comparable rate in both age-groups.  


&gt;does state they can‚Äôt safely recommend the vaccine to people under 18 rn.

According to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), nearly **64% of people across the state have received at least one dose. The CDPH numbers also include the people ages 12-17 that are eligible for the vaccine,** which is why there is a discrepancy among their statistics and Newsom's.",,,1624471200,{},h2skqe6,False,t3_o6f2v6,False,False,t1_h2s3a5i,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o6f2v6/video_fauci_warns_kids_more_likely_to_be_infected/h2skqe6/,1624765678,-5,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

""Total deaths in any setting (regardless of hospitalisation status) within 28 days of positive specimen date.""

Ie, that's simply the number of people who died within a given period of time following testing positive for COVID. They could have died from any manner of disease.

It's similar for the case count which is defined as:

""Cases are assessed for any Emergency Care attendance within 28 days of their positive specimen date. Cases still undergoing within 28-dayperiodmay have an emergency care attendance reported at a later date.""

I don't see anything in the document stating anything other than what those definitions describe.

That document states its source as ""deaths from PHE daily death data series"". [That document](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/916035/RA_Technical_Summary_-_PHE_Data_Series_COVID_19_Deaths_20200812.pdf) states:

&gt; The PHE data series is not designed to provide definitive information on the causal role of COVID-19 in relation to individual deaths. The weekly publication of deaths statistical bulletin from the Office of National Statistics includes all deaths where COVID-19 is recorded on the death certificate, regardless of whether a laboratory result is available or not.

If you want to find causal information you need a different source, like the surveys I previously linked to and the original phase 3 trials of the vaccines. Vaccines don't stop people from testing positive for COVID, you can be completely asymptomatic and test positive, they most importantly mitigate its symptoms and prevent hospitalizations and deaths.

That also matches the description I found [on this page](https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2020/08/12/behind-the-headlines-counting-covid-19-deaths/) describing the widely used death statistics in the UK:

&gt; For several months, the COVID-19 Data Dashboard has been reporting, for England, all deaths in people who have a positive test. This a robust measure as it uses the fact of a positive test and the fact of death to derive the number reported. However, it is only an approximation of the number of people who die from COVID-19 because other causes of death are included and some people who die from COVID-19 never had a positive test. It was decided to adopt this measure in April in order to be sure not to underestimate the number of COVID-19 related deaths. It was always intended to review the approach as the pandemic progressed.

It's a useful measure for its purpose but not for what you're trying to use it for as you really need to know the cause of death if you're trying to determine how effective the vaccines are at preventing it.",,,1624471175,{},h2skogb,False,t3_o5yzio,False,False,t1_h2s9nu3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o5yzio/cdc_nearly_every_adult_covid19_death_is_now/h2skogb/,1624765650,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,CarlPeligro,,,[],,,,text,t2_efdus,False,False,[],"At the risk of going in circles: the question we ought to be asking is, why did Reagan's rhetoric find such fertile soil? Why does racism work? The United States has a racist history, sure; but so do most countries. Why did the civil rights movement spark such a powerful counterreaction?

I would suggest that the racist aspects of the conservative movement appealed to Americans precisely because of that individualistic streak we were discussing earlier. Racism finds purchase because it is a way of touting one's own independence as opposed to the neediness of others, often disadvantaged minorities: *I* don't need help from the government; it's those *black* people who are constantly sponging off of hardworking people like *me*.

In the wake of slavery, the *only* way of leveling the scales -- or of getting anywhere even remotely close -- was government intervention and a planned redistribution of resources. This rubbed Americans the wrong way because our state religion (insofar as we have one) is the notion that a) anyone can become anything they want to become *if they work for it,* and its corollary: b) nobody ought to need help from the government to become what they want to become.

Because Americans tend to internalize success and failure -- if you succeed, it's because of your hard work; if you fail, it's on you -- racism provides the ultimate explanatory framework. It gives people an out. I'm successful, not because of the advantages I've been given in life on account of my social position, but because of my hard work; but if I fail, it can't be because I haven't been working hard enough: like most Americans, I bust my ass day-in, day-out. Therefore, it *must* be because someone (namely: a minority) has their fingers in the till.

The civil rights movement pushed a certain subset of Americans toward racist demagoguery, but white supremacy took root in minds that were in desperate need of an explanation for why all their hard work was getting them nowhere: the individualist won't think of blaming society, and would really like to avoid taking the blame himself, so he blames the Other.",,,1624473206,{},h2sp6c2,False,t3_o5yzio,False,False,t1_h2sgffo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o5yzio/cdc_nearly_every_adult_covid19_death_is_now/h2sp6c2/,1624768052,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The team recruited over 240,000 volunteers from across the country, then selected 8,058 individuals from that pool through quota sampling to ensure that their study cohort was representative of the U.S. population. Each participant received a sample kit to return to NIH with a dab of dried blood or had blood drawn at NIH, most of which they supplied in an 11-week span between May 10 and July 31. Participants also completed a questionnaire that enabled further analysis of the study results.  
  
The researchers used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies that recognize protein regions from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, referred to as antigens. Antibodies in a blood sample can bind to these antigens. The team found that 304 of the approximately 8,000 blood samples were seropositive, meaning that they contained antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The researchers estimated that 4.6% of U.S. adults had undiagnosed COVID-19 during their study period. They determined that each diagnosed case of COVID-19 corresponds to an estimated 4.8 undiagnosed cases of the disease during this time frame.  
  
The team observed that:  
  
the youngest participants‚Äîthose between the ages of 18 and 44‚Äîhad the highest estimated seropositivity, at 5.9%,

  
estimated seropositivity was higher in females than in males (5.5% versus 3.5%, respectively),

  
participants in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions had the highest rates (8.6% and 7.5%, respectively), and participants in the Midwest had the lowest rates (1.6%),

  
urban participants had a higher estimated seropositivity (5.3%) compared with rural participants (1.1%), and

  
Black/African American respondents had the highest estimated seropositivity rate (14.2%), followed by Native American/Alaska Native (6.8%), Hispanic (6.1%), white/Caucasian (2.5%), and Asian (2%) respondents.",,,1624460924,{},h2rx0x8,True,t3_o6enc4,False,False,t3_o6enc4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o6enc4/nih_study_suggests_covid19_prevalence_far/h2rx0x8/,1624753025,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Some should be able to use vaccines just like everyone else and have it work just as well, but on the other hand someone with CVID for example it's unclear at this stage if the vaccine would even do anything at all. Stuff like CVID is especially fucked up because their body just doesn't produce antibodies anyway so traditional vaccines that use inactivated viruses and such are actively dangerous and even the new mRNA type, while they can take it without it being harmful, may not actually produce a significant immune response because their body isn't able to actually produce the antibodies.

Of course in that case, even before the pandemic these people would still be at high risk from things that would be extremely benign for healthy people. There's a streamer named Ironmouse who has this condition and she has talked about how she got a chronic permanent lung disease from a bacteria that is probably in your lungs already and just hangs out in food and water but is completely harmless to people with functional immune systems. She basically has to live in a bubble and take water through an IV to prevent drinking any bacteria and have everything that enters her room disinfected. In her case herd immunity would be extremely important but on the other hand people in that situation typically can't really go out much anyway. 

It's kind of a spectrum where the people who are most affected are the ones in that area in between who aren't in a condition where vaccines would be effective but are healthy enough that they won't get hospitalized by a seasonal cold virus or some random bacteria in the soil, which is a pretty small cross section.

&gt;VOC: ^(A variant for which there is evidence of an increase in transmissibility, more severe disease (e.g.,  increased hospitalizations or deaths, significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, reduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures.)  
&gt;  
&gt;VOI: ^(A variant with specific genetic markers that have been associated with changes to receptor binding, reduced neutralization by antibodies generated against previous infection or vaccination, reduced efficacy of treatments, potential diagnostic impact, or predicted increase in transmissibility or disease severity.)

So, a VOC is one where there's evidence of increased transmissibility, virulence,  immune escape, or diagnostic/treatment difficulty; a VOI is one where such increases might be predicted from its sequence, but there's no evidence to date, meriting higher surveillance.

The whole point of the WHO naming scheme is to offer mainstream media and the general public alternatives to ""Brazil"" variant or ""India"" variant. I've seen very little mainstream media coverage of variants that didn't rise to VOC status, just a few articles months ago on the now Eta and Iota VOIs first discovered in California. And for the VOIs, scientists got by just fine with designations based on phylogeny or mutations. I don't think the VOIs needed Greek letter names until they rose to VOC status.

Most of the studies on the vaccine response in immune suppressed individuals was in those with severe suppression, like chemotherapy related or transplant related, etc. It‚Äôs because it was highly relevant since those people were at greater risk of infection to begin with and as such qualified as some of the most vulnerable people, so finding out if vaccines worked was paramount.

Such a mutation itself in a variant is not likely to occur in the near term, if ever. It would take months or years, even, for the virus to mutate enough to evade mrna vaccines.

I switched to vaping back in 2013. A few years ago I started the process of moving down the nicotine levels. 24-&gt;18-&gt;12-&gt;6-&gt;3-&gt;0mg. I'd drop a level a month. Eventually I was vaping 0mg nicotine e-liquid and did that for 3-4 months. Eventually I ran our of zero and decided it was time to give up vaping altogether now that I had painlessly and easily dealt with my 'Nicotine Addiction'. Packed my vaping gear away in the drawer......I was crawling the walls within the hour. That day was like going cold turkey from real cigarettes. I couldn't handle it and took the vaping gear back out and am still vaping to this day. Turns out I and perhaps many/most smokers and vapers may not so much be addicted to the nicotine but instead psychologically addicted to the repetitive acts of smoking/vaping. eg vaping/smoking activity associated with other activities, something in our hands, moving our hands to mouth, act of inhalation, throat-hit etc. ie The neural programming of performing an act 100's of times a day is a much tougher nut to crack than the actual nicotine addiction.

It was a risk obviously, we had them out of school due to COVID, but had someone coming to our house.

[],,Talisker12,,,[],,,,text,t2_bfk2e,False,False,[],"About a year ago, genetic sequences from more than 200 virus samples from early cases of Covid-19 in Wuhan disappeared from an online scientific database.

The new analysis, released on Tuesday, bolsters earlier suggestions that a variety of coronaviruses may have been circulating in Wuhan before the initial outbreaks linked to animal and seafood markets in December 2019.

As the Biden administration investigates the contested origins of the virus, known as SARS-CoV-2, the study neither strengthens nor discounts the hypothesis that the pathogen leaked out of a famous Wuhan lab. But it does raise questions about why original sequences were deleted, and suggests that there may be more revelations to recover from the far corners of the internet.

‚ÄúThis is a great piece of sleuth work for sure, and it significantly advances efforts to understand the origin of SARS-CoV-2,‚Äù said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona who was not involved in the study.

Jesse Bloom, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who wrote the new report, called the deletion of these sequences suspicious. It ‚Äúseems likely that the sequences were deleted to obscure their existence,‚Äù he wrote in the paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal.

Dr. Bloom and Dr. Worobey belong to an outspoken group of scientists who have called for more research into how the pandemic began. In a letter published in May, they complained that there wasn‚Äôt enough information to determine whether it was more likely that a lab leak spread the coronavirus, or that it leapt to humans from contact with an infected animal outside of a lab.

The genetic sequences of viral samples hold crucial clues about how SARS-CoV-2 shifted to our species from another animal, most likely a bat. Most precious of all are sequences from early in the pandemic, because they take scientists closer to the original spillover event.

As Dr. Bloom was reviewing what genetic data had been published by various research groups, he came across a March 2020 study with a spreadsheet that included information on 241 genetic sequences collected by scientists at Wuhan University. The spreadsheet indicated that the scientists had uploaded the sequences to an online database called the Sequence Read Archive, managed by the U.S. government‚Äôs National Library of Medicine.

But when Dr. Bloom looked for the Wuhan sequences in the database earlier this month, his only result was ‚Äúno item found.‚Äù

Puzzled, he went back to the spreadsheet for any further clues. It indicated that the 241 sequences had been collected by a scientist named Aisi Fu at Renmin Hospital in Wuhan. Searching medical literature, Dr. Bloom eventually found another study posted online in March 2020 by Dr. Fu and colleagues, describing a new experimental test for SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese scientists published it in a scientific journal three months later.

In that study, the scientists wrote that they had looked at 45 samples from nasal swabs taken ‚Äúfrom outpatients with suspected Covid-19 early in the epidemic.‚Äù They then searched for a portion of SARS-CoV-2‚Äôs genetic material in the swabs. The researchers did not publish the actual sequences of the genes they fished out of the samples. Instead, they only published some mutations in the viruses.

But a number of clues indicated to Dr. Bloom that the samples were the source of the 241 missing sequences. The papers included no explanation as to why the sequences had been uploaded to the Sequence Read Archive, only to disappear later.

Perusing the archive, Dr. Bloom figured out that many of the sequences were stored as files on Google Cloud. Each sequence was contained in a file in the cloud, and the names of the files all shared the same basic format, he reported.

Dr. Bloom swapped in the code for a missing sequence from Wuhan. Suddenly, he had the sequence. All told, he managed to recover 13 sequences from the cloud this way.

With this new data, Dr. Bloom looked back once more at the early stages of the pandemic. He combined the 13 sequences with other published sequences of early coronaviruses, hoping to make progress on building the family tree of SARS-CoV-2.

Working out all the steps by which SARS-CoV-2 evolved from a bat virus has been a challenge because scientists still have a limited number of samples to study. Some of the earliest samples come from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, where an outbreak occurred in December 2019.

But those market viruses actually have three extra mutations that are missing from SARS-CoV-2 samples collected weeks later. In other words, those later viruses look more like coronaviruses found in bats, supporting the idea that there was some early lineage of the virus that did not pass through the seafood market.

You will notice a pattern that Sweden peaked at 47% excess deaths in April while their fellow Nordic countries (who did employ a lockdown) did not rise over about 14% in this time.

You may now say ""hey, look at Denmark in late December their peak is quite close to Sweden's second peak of excess deaths"". This is true but do you want to know the kicker? Denmark only entered their second lockdown on December 16th (if we use the closing of shopping centres as the metric of when it started, link below) and excess deaths fell from December 20th until late March. And hey would you look at that, excess deaths are rising again now for Denmark when they have no lockdown. Basically, lockdown lowered excess deaths, while they rose while countries were not in lockdown. 

Basically, lockdowns work. They are awful and there now is a much, much better alternative with vaccination and I hope we never have to have another lockdown again. But it is indisputable that lockdowns decrease deaths (and that's measuring all deaths, not just covid deaths)

That‚Äôs rich as you immediately went into single payer when I remarked that Americans being detached from the costs of their decisions leads to bad decisions.

The US has plenty of reasons not to do single payer. Such a monopsony don‚Äôt exist in the US.

Washington State happened. Doctors would not take Medicare rates, they are too low, so the state had to come up to an acceptable rate.

Another big of nonsense. The doctors won‚Äôt leave the US, but they won‚Äôt permit M4A as written to pass, especially as the NLRB bans private practice doctors from forming a union. 

If for some reason it did pass, the bulk of worth while primary care Docs would go cash only, and then your supply of full scope practitioners would shrink, making for duplicative visits and more specialist appointments which are much more expensive and much less effective at preventive care.

You don‚Äôt underpay doctors, but the plans here in the US are to underpay doctors. It‚Äôs a 10% net pay cut for primary care doctors, and that‚Äôs a field that is already poorly compensated as compared to their peers.

If you expect them to take Medicare rates, you want them to work for free, there‚Äôs no falsehood there, and clearly you are just fine with slashing their salaries (yet no reform for any other profession in the US, recall that doctors are compensated in part as an opportunity cost).

Primary care doctors aren‚Äôt hitting 600k+, that‚Äôs not even an average for all doctors in the US, I guess you pulled that from the same bottle of nonsense as the rest of your statements. 

Medicare sets the rates far below market, they aren‚Äôt negotiating because they are paying less than anyone. And it‚Äôs take it or leave it and many doctors have a tiny portion of their panel on Medicare because they do t make money on Medicare patients.

We will talk Washington State because that is the latest state to offer single payer, and they initially thought they could do Medicare rates, o my time find that there was no money in it for the doctors to take Medicare rates.

Since we don‚Äôt have vaccinated herd immunity, it matters very much whether someone is vaccinated against covid or not. So this little quirk of American life, the selfish and stupid using a good faith religious exemption to skirt their responsibility to the community, has now become an issue.

It's not quite that simple. In the UK at least, the NHS is regularly brought close to breaking point by even a fairly bad flu season. 

Covid cases won't replace flu ones - they'll be additional. So if, long term, covid was just as bad as flu, I'm pretty certain we won't be able to cope with twice the number of respiratory illnesses on an annual basis.

Now, the answer might be to improve the uptake of flu vaccines (or increase funding to the NHS - not that our government seems to want to do that) rather than continue with covid restrictions. 

But we can't just say that because we can cope with X thousand flu cases every year, we could also cope with X thousand covid ones.
