Protection is not complete.  Controlled studies have shown 80-95% protection from infection against reinfection, which means reinfection would be extremely common with sufficient exposures.  There doesn't seem to be any trend of it being more common with different strains though, which is a little strange.  The new strains we have seen are simply more contagious and therefore outcompete their predecessors.

&gt; My point being that SARS-CoV-2 is changing and under active selection pressure to evade our immune systems.

Seychelles has reported nearly 7,000 Covid-19 cases since the start of the pandemic but it’s a big deal for a country with a population of less than 100,000. Earlier this week, the archipelago announced new measures, including shutting down schools and cancelling sporting activities, for two weeks to curb the infection. Peggy Vidot, Seychelles’ health minister, told a press conference that the Covid-19 situation in the country is critical right now despite all the “exceptional efforts”.

Experts have been watching the situation in Seychelles closely for what it says about the effectiveness of vaccines. According to a Washington Post report, the surge in new cases may confirm that the Covid-19 vaccines being used in the country “have comparatively low effectiveness.” Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told the Post that the situation in Seychelles is making a critical case to “consider the effectiveness of some vaccines and what range we have to reach to meet herd immunity.”",,,1620526406,{},gxgcs7b,True,t3_n844ut,False,True,t3_n844ut,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n844ut/worlds_most_vaccinated_country_is_witnessing/gxgcs7b/,1620570633,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_2q411ct6,False,False,,

One second, please.

""The youth"" were told to stay at home, save grandma, protect the hospitals from being overrun, flatten the curve and so on. They lost their jobs, had to endure remote classes, stay home to care for their children, put their plans and lives on hold because of a virus that disproportionately kills the elderly, and mostly spares them.

And they did. Due to the virus and enduring lockdowns, they lost opportunities, businesses, jobs and in many cases, their plans and financial security. You could even say that 2020/2021 might impact the youth in the same way as 2008/2009 did, if not worse.

Throughout this time, they were told that the point is to reduce the number of cases, to limit deaths to a minimum and save as many lives as possible. Every time there was an uptick in the number of cases, they blamed (mostly) young people for flaunting the rules. Let's not kid ourselves - curfews and other measures aren't targeted against the elderly, they are targeted against youth so that they don't meet their friends, don't go to the gym, don't gather and so on. 

Then, we got vaccines and they were once again told to wait in line because we have to protect the elderly and the vulnerable first. This is pretty universal across all of Europe.

And now, as the elderly and vulnerable are getting vaccinated, they get to enjoy more freedom (even though the virus is objectively dangerous for them) while the youth is still going to endure lockdowns and their impact for who knows how long - even though, again, the virus is not that big of a risk for them.

In other words - when the youth were asked to show solidarity, they did.

NPR did a great piece on some mass centers swapping to walk-ins and seeing black representation among vaccinations increase substantially.

Next, there needs to be a rural push. Many communities are underserved because the mass center is in some urban center that many do not go to. There will also need to be doctor-held vaccines. There are *many, many* rural families who will not do something unless instructed to by their personal doctor they trust. Doctor-patient relationships form a backbone of our healthcare system.

He seems to suggest that people may choose as individuals to wear masks, rather than that we will see the universal use we see now, which honestly I'm in favor of. People should feel free to wear a mask in situations where they feel it is appropriate if, for example, they have fragile health, they're feeling unwell, or they're in a situation like crowded transit.

I'm curious if anybody has studied how much the disappearance of flu had to do with the record number of flu shots this past winter ([https://www.jwatch.org/fw117313/2020/12/10/cdc-record-number-flu-shots-distributed-season](https://www.jwatch.org/fw117313/2020/12/10/cdc-record-number-flu-shots-distributed-season)), relative to the fact that many children were in remote or hybrid schools where flu spreads between them less readily, relative to the use of masks.

I'm not saying that an open window would have prevented the pandemic, of course not, but so many places are perpetually stuffy and it's so obvious that it doesn't help the situation.

I was thinking of this months ago when I saw a restaurant's ""outdoor tent"" that had all four walls closed! You had to open the damn thing to get inside. Technically, I guess it fit CA's outdoor policy at the time, but you could also argue that a building is ""outdoors"" too and you should be able to eat inside it with that logic.

Anyways. Regardless of a mandate, they should have stressed the importance of airflow by encouraging businesses to leave open the front door, open as many windows as possible, and just try to get fresh air in.

Literally, multiple cases

&gt; proof of anything and put it in context

The article doesn't say its proof, just that it casts doubts and further questions regarding the efficacy of vaccine in groups, which is what you mentioned earlier. 

&gt; if actual studies will show that these outbreaks are more frequent than expected, then we'll talk.

And where do you think these studies start and come from? The first step on the ladder of study strength is 'case study'. Another step up is a 'series study'. This constitutes a series study since it has multiple patients - even if they are from the same care home. However, this article literally uses this care home as ONE of many examples of the current spread and outbreak of this particular variant.

&gt; The efficacy figures from vaccines are applicable to large populations

This is just categorical wrong. Modern medicine groups efficacy into individual structures - thats why we can say this vaccine shouldnt be given to pregnant women - because we haven't just made a blanket statement to a general population. This article highlights how efficacy in the most vulnerable (i.e. NOT large population) may be greatly reduced and if these patients required hospitalisation, their recovery can not be attributed to the vaccine but instead to the intervention administered at the hospital. 

These vaccines were given to the elderly first as they were deemed the most to benefit.

That's an oxymoron

&gt; Pfizer and BioNTech started working on mRNA vaccine development back in 2018. Which is exactly why they partnered to develop this vaccine. Your own link refers to it as a ""collaboration.""

Pfizer paid **for access** to a research collaboration just like Chinese Fosun Pharma did.

&gt; And as I've linked elsewhere, Pfizer alone contributed and loaned more money for development than all of Europe combined.

Sure it did, just like it single-handedly partnered with BioNTech, without Pfizer BioNTech would never ever have come up with the idea, right?

What Pfizer did there was buy their way into stakes one of the most prospective mRNA startups, one started with the help of German funds.

&gt; If you're going to try and inflate your national ego, at least don't link contradictory info in the same post.

That's rich considering that's exactly what a whole lot of Americans have been doing. Creating this narrative how all the ""good"" vaccines come from the US and how a BioNTech vaccine is suddenly an American invention that American Pfizer single-handily invented and paid for themselves.

The novavax vax is just a lot of spike protein.  While the spike protein may be absorbed into cells, just as an inactivated virus might be, it's not a special protein that gets taken up into targeted cells.  Am I missing something in the link you give that says otherwise?

&gt; only 80% efficacy against death

This is the same issue measuring every vaccine against death - they are looking at day of death.  Some of these vaccines take a month to give protection, and an infection within the first month could easily cause death within months 2 or 3.  mRNA vaccines are nice in that they give protection in about a week, but as far as I can tell the level seems to be so close to 100% for *every* vaccine that we just can't measure the difference.

The Seychelles is interesting data point.  They have cases rising despite 65% being really fully vaccinated, which looks weird at first glance.  But 80% of those positive tests are unvaccinated people, which (assuming homogeneity which is obviously false) shows an 84% ish efficacy of their vaccines.  They are a well vaccinated tourist country with entirely open borders, which means they're going to just keep having a few cases until their client countries stop having massive cases.  At first glance this looks like a failure of vaccines, but when you look at that 80% number it shows that even our worst vaccines really work.

Scroll down to the the last section:

&gt;For the purposes of this document, a minor is defined as an individual under the age of 18. Minors need parental or guardian consent to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, except in the rare instance where the minor is part of a group to whom the law gives the right to consent to their own care (e.g., married minors, minors who are parents or pregnant, and minors in the military).  
&gt;  
&gt;In general, it is strongly encouraged that a parent or legal guardian accompany a minor age 16 or 17 to provide in-person consent for vaccination at each dose. Vaccine Support/Medical Documentation Staff must document in the CDMS Notes section the name of the person providing consent for the minor. Verbal consent is allowed.  
&gt;  
&gt;**If a minor is unaccompanied, the provider should attempt to contact the parent or guardian by phone at the time of the minor’s vaccination to provide consent to the provider. Providers may elect whether to accept a written statement of consent from the parent or guardian, where the parent or guardian is not available by phone to provide consent to vaccinate an unaccompanied minor.** The NYS COVID-19 Immunization Screening and Consent Form may be considered for this purpose.

The new case involves a Filipina who came to Taiwan to visit a relative of hers who is seriously ill. She tested positive on her first day of quarantine, after taking a self-paid COVID-19 test at a hospital, the CECC said.

Under current regulations, people who travel to Taiwan have to go into quarantine for 14 days upon entry, but they can apply to visit sick family members or attend funerals during their quarantine period as long as they test negative for COVID-19.

To date, Taiwan has recorded 1,184 cases of COVID-19, 1,037 of which have been classified as imported. Of the total, 1,089 have recovered, 12 have died, and 83 are in the hospital, according to CECC statistics as of Sunday.

Globally, COVID-19 has infected over 157.1 million people in 193 countries and regions, with more than 3.2 million fatalities, CECC figures show.

""The infectious viral titres of G614 virus were significantly higher (2.1- to 8.6-fold) than those of D614 virus (Fig. 3b)."" 

Other papers give a range of 3 to 9 fold higher infectiousness and I saw average 6X thrown around somewhere that I can't find now. But let's call it 6X for now.

This is now the baseline mutation of the original Wuhan strain that the new variants are quantified against, because the D614G variant took over the world in short order and is in every single variant.

 P.1: est 1.7-2.4X more infectious (than D614G), so looking at around 12X.
 https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/04/13/science.abh2644 

B.1.617: no number known yet but this expert in link says it looks like it looks like B.1.1.7 squared. B.1.1.7 is 60-80% more transmissible than D614G, or about 10X Wuhan, so B.1.617 could easily be in the 20X range.

https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/05/07/994710459/is-the-variant-from-india-the-most-contagious-coronavirus-mutant-on-the-planet

Anyway no need to nitpick exact numbers since these are tricky to determine but it's pretty certain that B.1.1.7 is about 10X as bad as Wuhan and Indian variants seem to be overtaking it and could easily be worse. People forget that there was this intermediate D614G step which was responsible for the early waves in Spain, Italy, NYC, and was the first variant to truly take over the world, which was much much more infectious than the Wuhan strain, and is now the benchmark when people talk about e.g. 2X increase in new variants.",,,1620581777,{},gxin7nw,False,t3_n7u3so,False,True,t1_gxh119g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n7u3so/preparations_are_underway_for_potential_covid19/gxin7nw/,1620616721,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_m0e5b,False,False,,

That I'm already seeing this sentiment, not just by you but others on the internet and in social circles as well, is very frustrating to me.

No, that's not true. I'm someone who is still not fully vaccinated, and I have no medical reason to not have it, nor have had any hesitancy to get it.

I've wanted to get the vaccine as soon as I possibly could be allowed to have it - without trying to circumvent the process.

Connecticut opened up vaccinations to everyone 18+ on April 1st, the first time I was made eligible for it. That didn't mean that it was somehow immediately available to everyone. I signed up for a vaccine appointment as soon as I could that day, the earliest appointment in the VAMS system - the system CT promoted as their source for scheduling vaccinations - was May 1st.

I frequently rechecked VAMS, as well as the Yale, CVS, Walgreens, and other portals that were available in my area to try to find earlier appointments, and I was unable to find anything. I called many places that the governor said were going to start rolling out vaccines, and never found any opportunity earlier than May 1st. By the way, great fucking job by the government not creating and enforcing a unified platform for vaccination scheduling. It's not like there was a whole year where we could have predicted vaccinations were going to be necessary.

I was fortunate to get it on the 1st, at a clinic that was full of people attempting to get their first vaccinations. That means if everything goes according to plan, my vaccination as well as all of those peoples' vaccinations will be fully effective around June 12th.

I feel like I did things the way they were explained to us by the state government, and got in as quickly as any other common person in my situation would have been able to - without qualifying early, working for some company that somehow get to jump the line, getting extremely lucky, or just happening to know somebody who knows somebody.

&gt; Texas, like many U.S. states, doesn’t require residency for Covid-19 vaccines. Unlike in Mexico, where there are too few vaccines to go around, some U.S. states are offering incentives. New Jersey this week announced a “shot and a beer,” offering a free drink at a participating brewery to adults who have received their first shots.
&gt; 
&gt; On Thursday, New York City began promoting itself as a travel spot for vaccine seekers. Florida officials announced in April that they would rescind a residency requirement put in place after an initial surge of vaccine tourism. In Alaska, Gov. Mike Dunleavy said travelers could get free vaccines at the state’s major airports starting June 1, in an effort to boost tourism.
&gt; 
&gt; While Texas state officials have said foreigners account for a tiny fraction of shots administered, travelers often list a local address on forms.
&gt; 
&gt; Mexico’s travel agencies, battered by the pandemic, have been quick to spot an opportunity. They sold U.S. tourist packages in March and April to 170,000 people, most of them seeking the vaccine, said Eduardo Paniagua, the head of an industry association.

I live in Trinidad, we just went into 2 weeks lock down again due to a concerning rise in cases threatening our health system. The only Vaccine available is the AZ one at this point in time, and with a population of 1.3 million we have issued just over 100,000 first doses, with more on the way soon.

My neighbours are this beautiful and friendly young couple who are both on the front lines as doctors fighting the virus. When my 4 year old son fell and cut his head badly on a flower pot, we ran him next door and needless to say the both of them patched him up and was ever so caring and gentle with him while me and my wife were a nervous wreck.

They crossed my mind very recently and we reached out to them just asking if they are ok given the new circumstances on our island. Unfortunately the husband just tested positive and was quarantining home. They both also just received the first dose of the vaccine, and though his symptoms were mild, she, to her surprise, tested negative 3 times since his positive. She has been tirelessly working her social media trying to get as much people on the vaccine train as possible.

The differences to note after their first shot is the husband had no side effects, where as she had a more severe reaction to it and was down for a few days.

Given that doses are separated by 4 weeks and that over 20% of all deaths occur more than 4 weeks after infection, it's not a stretch to think that all of these (measured by time of death; no time of infection is known) were infections prior to vaccine protection.

About Robert Redfield:

&gt;In the 1980s Redfield worked closely with W. Shepherd Smith, Jr. and his Christian organization, Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy, or ASAP. The group maintained that AIDS was “God’s judgment” against homosexuals, spread in an America weakened by single-parent households and loss of family values.

&gt;Redfield wrote the introduction to a 1990 book, “Christians in the Age of AIDS,” co-written by Smith, in which he denounced distribution of sterile needles to drug users and condoms to sexually active adults, and described anti-discrimination programs as the efforts of “false prophets.”

The group maintained that AIDS was “God’s judgment” against homosexuals, spread in an America weakened by single-parent households and loss of family values.

&gt;Redfield wrote the introduction to a 1990 book, “Christians in the Age of AIDS,” co-written by Smith, in which he denounced distribution of sterile needles to drug users and condoms to sexually active adults, and described anti-discrimination programs as the efforts of “false prophets.”

No, there would be supply. I don't believe for one second that there is enough demand to achieve enough immunity to achieve heard immunity. Nor do I expect that the unvaccinated population will independently take the appropriate measures to prevent transmission within their communities. 

&gt;What other data or metrics will indicate control of the virus?

Traceability, non-exportation, and low test positivity rates.

When we can trace and identify the likely source of most infections then we can act to reduce future cases tied to that source.

Often being identified as a source of exported cases indicates that there's significant uncontrolled community transmission.

Low test positivity indicates a high degree of public engagement, proves that local authorities are testing ahead of cases becoming infectious, and gives much better insight into infection levels in the entire population.",,,1620511036,{},gxfk43y,False,t3_n7cq6v,False,True,t1_gxfgyrs,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n7cq6v/younger_patients_causing_florida_to_have_among/gxfk43y/,1620554977,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_2xdbi8hf,False,False,,

The data doesn’t back up your paranoia. Your risk has been reduced MASSIVELY. Most people fail to comprehend how big a twenty fold reduction in risk is. It’s a virus, not a moral agent who strikes down any who dare to “not do the right things.” This is one of the best vaccines ever created, full stop. You basically can’t get much more protected from a virus than this. You’re much more protected from Covid than you are from the flu after your average flu shot, for instance. And your risk of severe issues is basically zero. How much time and energy do you put into worrying about getting a cold on a weekly basis pre-Covid?

Since the beginning we’ve wanted to have an easy set of rituals that gives us a feeling of control over the virus. The thing that ACTUALLY gives us control is the vaccine. Don’t get caught up in the tribalism of “whether we’re doing the right thing collectively or not” because there will always be people who fail to live up to that. There’s been a lot of research that demonstrates how “blue people” tend to massively overestimate their risk after being vaccinated, and “red people” tend to underestimate their risk in general.

https://bookofbadarguments.com/images/slippery_slope.png

""A slippery slope7 attempts to discredit a proposition by arguing that its acceptance will undoubtedly lead to a sequence of events, one or more of which are undesirable. Though it may be the case that the sequence of events may happen, each transition occurring with some probability, this type of argument assumes that all transitions are inevitable, all the while providing no evidence in support of that. The fallacy plays on the fears of an audience and is related to a number of other fallacies, such as the appeal to fear, the false dilemma and the argument from consequences.

For example, We shouldn't allow people uncontrolled access to the Internet. The next thing you know, they will be frequenting pornographic websites and, soon enough our entire moral fabric will disintegrate and we will be reduced to animals. As is glaringly clear, no evidence is given, other than unfounded conjecture, that Internet access implies the disintegration of a society's moral fabric, while also presupposing certain things about the conduct.""

Leading Sunday’s tally was Bac Giang with 26, followed by Da Nang (17), Bac Ninh (15), Hanoi (11), and Hung Yen, Hoa Binh and Thua Thien-Hue (two each). Quang Nam and Quang Tri recorded one case each.

The new cases in Bac Giang are all linked to Patient 3243, a 43-year-old woman in the northern province of Lang Son.

Most of the new cases in Hanoi were those who’d come into contact with previously confirmed patients, or people in two major hospitals that have become locked down Covid-19 hotspots.

In Da Nang, 14 of the 17 new cases were linked to the Amida beauty salon, which has become a cluster.

Of the 333 community transmissions recorded since April 27 in 24 localities, Hanoi leads with 111 cases, followed by the northern province of Bac Ninh (58) and Da Nang City (35).

With services like UberEats, GrubHub, etc you can get high end restaurant food like Olive Garden in the comfort of your home.   There really is no need to rush this.  Slow and methodical is how we stamp out the cases along with continued vaccinations of course.

[],,AdministrativePilot3,,,,,,[],"The Brazilian regulatory agency Anvisa has banned the Russian covid vaccine. The controversy surrounding Sputnik V seems to be endless.

Sputnik V will be remembered as the first covid vaccine to be approved for use. It happened in August 2020 in Russia and was proudly announced by President Putin. Only then was the preparation tested in the third, most important phase of clinical trials. Its preliminary results, showing an effectiveness of over 90%, were published in The Lancet.

The order of events should be completely opposite, otherwise it is difficult to avoid comparisons to conducting research under the assumption. Read also: Sputnik in Europe. Russia winds up vaccine dispute Brazil says 'no'. Russians furious The publications of clinical trial results raised doubts among various specialists, which was expressed, for example, in the form of open letters. This did not prevent the Sputnik V from obtaining authorization in more than 60 countries. Brazil also waited for the vaccine, which has so far administered a single dose of only 14 percent. population.

Some state governors have expressed a willingness to work together to purchase 30 million doses. However, Anvisa, the Brazilian equivalent of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the largest medical regulatory institution in South America, stood in the way of Sputnik. In other words: not just anyone. **Anvis experts unanimously opposed the import of the Russian vaccine. Russia was furious with this decision. The Russian Direct Investment Fund, which deals with the foreign promotion of Sputnik, suggested that the Brazilians may have been driven by political considerations. In turn, representatives of the Gamaley Institute, which developed the vaccine, said that the decision was not supported by scientific evidence and could not be taken seriously. Moreover, the Russians are threatening defamation proceedings.** What was really going on?

Read also: Sputnik V doomed to success? Russians do not want to vaccinate with it.

Brazilians visit factories in Russia. ""Frustration"" The Brazilian regulator found flaws in the methodology of a clinical trial conducted in Russia. Its participants would not be properly instructed when to test for the presence of the coronavirus, which could lead to negative results despite being infected. **However, the most serious issue raised by officials indicates flaws in Sputnik's production and insufficient information regarding the quality, safety and efficacy control of the product.**

Anvisa representatives even flew to Russia to inspect. They were only allowed to visit three of the seven production sites. In one of them, it was suspected that Good Manufacturing Practices were violated. Brazilians have been refused admission to the Gamaley Institute's quality control laboratories. The director of Anvis summed up the entire visit with one word: ""frustration"", stating that that the decision to reject Sputnik could only be based on it. But another disturbing thread emerged. Non-replicating vaccine vectors Sputnik V is a vector vaccine that uses engineered adenoviruses to instruct human cells to produce the coronavirus spike protein.

The preparation is two-dose and heterologous, because in the first dose the vector is human adenovirus type 26, and in the second - human adenovirus type 5. As in other vector vaccines against covid, adenoviruses in Sputnik are processed so that they are not able to multiply in human cells . For this, the E1 region is removed from their genome. On the other hand, at the production stage, the genetic material of such adenoviruses is introduced into modified cells, in which the genome has been inserted genes needed for adenoviruses for replication.

**In such cellular factories, adenoviruses produce copies of themselves, which end up in the culture medium, from where they are obtained and purified. In this clever way, billions of adenoviral particles are produced - given to humans, they cannot reproduce on their own. When producing such adenovirus vectors, there is a risk that, on occasion, some of them will manage to incorporate deleted genes into the environment of the cells in which they are multiplied. The problem has been known for years, and special monitoring methods have been developed to prevent adenoviruses in the vaccine from being replicated.**",,,1620588641,{},gxj1cx9,True,t3_n8ljm7,False,False,t3_n8ljm7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n8ljm7/brazil_questions_the_quality_of_sputnik_v_the/gxj1cx9/,1620624314,19,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5m45hj1o,False,False,,

The spike isn’t just floating around the body. They are displayed on the cell surface after the mRNA instructions are given to the cytoplasm. Also important to note that it isn’t replicated like the virus. The last important bit of info is that the spike is locked in its perfusion state. It can’t bind with cells in this state.

President Biden has called for 70 percent to have at least one dose by July 4.

I suppose this would be a common misunderstanding of what is actually being said, and mistakes happen. This is also in vitro, and even you've mentioned in a previous comment, in vitro doesn't always show in real world examples for a variety of reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

You can read through this study to learn more about why an increase in infectiousness (titres) doesn't necessarily equate to an increase in transmissibility.  Remember, in terms of what we're discussing, infectivity and transmissibility are 2 separate things.  Study:  [https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(20)30820-5.pdf](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(20)30820-5.pdf)

There is zero evidence that there has been a 20X increase in transmissibility from the current leading variant and the original strain.

The columns that combine covid and pneumonia don't equal the separate columns for covid and pneumonia, nor does the column at the end of the table which includes flu, pneumonia, and covid? 

I guess why are the tabulations off, and why are there so many deaths attributed to pneumonia more so than the past 36 years combined almost? Thank you and sorry if this has been asked or reposted, I tried searching for similar discussions before, yet came up empty.
