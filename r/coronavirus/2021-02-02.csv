this may all be total bullshit i’m not trumpeting this as being the truth but this is the basic gist of what i have read when it comes to the conflict over patent rights.

my guess as to why the US government hasn’t enacted the production act for national vaccine supply is that it simply would take too much time to take any factory in the US producing something else into a factory to produce pfizer or moderna (6 months would be my guess), due to the highly specialized production system that would be needed for this, and they figure by that time the companies themselves will have produced adequate supply for the country and therefore not worth it.

How is EU 100% nationalistic if it's exporting vaccines all around the world since December, including to the UK?

On the way, please do tell how many countries are receiving vaccines from UK?

&gt;To the point that they were going put the good Friday agreement in danger over their reckless acts by blocking vaccines to Northern Ireland, and only stopped when they managed quite an accomplishment by getting the British and Irish governments, the all parties in Northern Ireland to come out heavily against them.

Ah an attempt to try to stop a potential fraud and breach of contract from a pharmaceutical company that could have been diverging stock to a different country = 100% nationalistic ?

&gt;The EU were never relying on the UK for vaccines at any point, there was no UK production of vaccines at the start of pandemic. 

No, the EU was relying on a pharmaceutical company that stated in the contract that part of the European vaccines would be produced in 2 plants from the UK, the and in 2 EU plants.

&gt;It would have been OK to say at that point, ok the EU will only make vaccines for the EU, but making threats to cut supply after allowing its companies to sell vaccine slots to the UK, Canada, Australia and others isn't really on.

Oh would it now, so 100% nationalistic is fine now? Make up your mind lol

&gt;Also the UK plants did have production problems, they were supposed to get 10s of millions of doses last year, but as they signed deals months earlier they were able to sort these out. The EU could of done the same if they hadn't messed about so much.

Every pharmaceutical company has production problems, but only some countries are hoarding local production for themselves - USA and UK. Else they split production of their plants to fulfill orders, but the UK doesn't allow vaccines made in UK to go anywhere else.

But please do explain how come Astrazaneca having problems in the EU plants means ""EU messed about so much"", but the same problem in the UK isn't ""UK messed about so much""?

It's like you're diverging production problems of a pharmaceutical company to a trade block of countries. EU bought vaccines, it's the job of the pharmaceutical company to deliver the vaccines.

Medicago is a Canadian vaccine company that does the R&amp;D in Canada, but their Canadian manufacturing facilities are not yet operational. They produce virus-like particle (I think) vaccines using tobacco plants, which is way better than the old method of chicken eggs. I think algae will end up surpassing their tobacco plant method eventually.

Precision NanoSystems in Vancouver just received 25 million dollars to upgrade their facilities to gain production capabilities for mRNA vaccines, though they are not developing their own COVID jab. Their production line won't be done until 2023 anyways.

Providence Therapeutics is the leading mRNA vaccine in Canada, but I wouldn't expect approval until late in the year. I have no clue what their current production capabilities are, but it'd be nice if they could license production of Pfizer while they await clinical trial results.

People like to compare us to the USA and wonder why we don't have the same level of biotech as them, and the answer isn't because their federal government is necessarily better at supporting the industry; It's that Boston has perfected the art of being a hub for biotech startups. All you need to do is be a post-doc/pro fessor at Harvard/MIT and say that you have an idea loud enough, and you will have a hundred venture capitalists swarming you with millions of dollars. Then, you can start your company in the area and have easy access to critical facilities at Harvard/MIT as your company grows (because you can't afford every piece of equipment you need). Canada could have this same hub in Toronto, but the way the city is developed/developing, they are cutting off the potential for growth. The University of Toronto could easily become Canada's Harvard and have billion-dollar companies starting up there monthly, but there is no room for industrial development anywhere near the campus. There's J Labs, which is great for startup to build out of, but once you start to get more than 5 employees, you're quickly going to outgrow it, and there is no where for you to go. Best you're going to do is Mississauga, and that's going to be a nightmare of a regular commute to UofT everyday if you need to use their facilities.

Maybe a game a little but i'm so fucked up, even that doesnt bring me enjoyment anymore.

 Atleast the drugs make me forget everything. 

When my mom finds out, i'll probably have to start looking for a room somewhere. 

I have absolutely no idea when this will end. They probably come up with the 'turkish variant' or 'the 6th wave is coming' its honestly like a bad script.

 and there's a certain thereshold for when restrictions can start getting lifted.

A vaccine can do anything from give you full-blown sterilizing immunity to just train the immune system to beat the virus more easily. The flu vaccine is a good example of a vaccine with a lower efficiency where you might not become immune but you probably do have an increased immune response.. 


Every reaction between a virus and the hosts immune system is potentially completely different because it's very much based on this ever-changing virus package of chemicals.. You all are assuming that all viruses are way more similar than they really are and that's why you think the reaction between the immune system and the virus is going to be so predictable.

Viruses are not all similar and do not produce similar results inside the human body and that's what keeps leading you astray to think immunity is one generic term that kind of means the same thing across the board. NOPE! Vaccines and immune responses are specific to the virus and of course the host. 

The one big illusion here is simply that we've picked the easiest viruses to vaccinate against throughout the history of modern medicine and that makes it look like vaccines produce long-lasting sterilizing immunity more often than they do.

[],,AdministrativePilot3,,,[],,,,text,t2_5m45hj1o,False,False,[],"\- There are thousands of ingredients in hemp. There are over 80 cannabin compounds alone, including the two main THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol). THC is psychoactive, it stimulates - says prof. Iwona Wawer, professor emeritus of the Faculty of Pharmacy of the Medical University of Warsaw. THC is most commonly used as an analgesic - it relieves migraines, pains after injuries and in degenerative and cancer diseases. - Dry vaporization containing this compound is available on prescription, which can be issued by any doctor. Due to its relatively high price, cannabis is most often prescribed when other pain relief methods have failed. Preparations with THC are also used in patients with multiple sclerosis, because they reduce muscle spasticity, in oncology as a measure against vomiting and nausea, and in people who do not have an appetite, which happens with cancer or AIDS.

The second main ingredient in hemp is CBD, or cannabidiol. It works in some respects opposite to THC - it calms down, calms down, has no euphoric abilities. - CBD is part of dietary supplements and is recommended for patients who do not want to have side effects after vaporization with THC herbs. It reduces the intoxicating effects of THC - says Krzysztof Góra.

CBD's career began with its use in epilepsy. - Today there are more and more studies that confirm that after the administration of CBD in children and adults with drug-resistant epilepsy, the number of attacks decreases by 78-80%, and sometimes they disappear completely - says Krzysztof Góra

\- An interesting study was published in 2017 in the medical journal New England Journal of Medicine. It showed that cannabidiol reduces the frequency of seizures in children and adults with epilepsy, says Prof. Wawer. Subsequent studies have shown that CBD not only reduces the frequency of epilepsy but also improves the general condition of patients. It is likely that this substance reduces the overstimulation of nerve cells in the brain, making seizures less likely to occur. - Perhaps CBD works in a similar way in people suffering from Parkinson's disease. In them, preparations with CBD relieve hand tremors, but this is a hypothesis for now - says Prof. Wawer. Last year, a team of scientists from the University of Sao Paolo summed up the scientific knowledge on the use of CBD in Parkinson's disease. Proven

In late 2017, the WHO presented a report on the use of cannabinoids. It shows that CBD is safe and well-tolerated, non-addictive and has no negative social effects. This was also confirmed by an analysis conducted by Dr. Mateus Machado Bergamaschi from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The researcher looked at over 130 studies on the use of CBD and found that people who had been taking CBD preparations for many weeks had no side effects. This substance does not affect the appetite and does not cause stomach problems, does not change psychomotor or psychological functions, does not affect heart rate, blood pressure or body temperature.

[The UK food agency recommends that healthy people use up to 70 mg of CBD a day, but this compound is safe even in doses much higher than recommended. ](https://www.newsweek.pl/wiedza/medyczna-marihuana-czym-jest-cbd/ymfkj9t)\- Studies have shown that even people who took 1500 mg of CBD daily for four weeks did well - says Krzysztof Góra, but the expert points out that in sensitive people, even a small amount of CBD can cause drowsiness, vomiting, nausea or rash.

The WHO report also states that CBD can complement the treatment of many diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, depression and psychosis, and be useful in the treatment of cancer. - It is true that it does not cure cancer, but it calms and relieves anxiety, and also has an analgesic and antiemetic effect - says prof. Wawer. CBD reduces inflammation and provides relief after prolonged training. The anti-inflammatory properties of this compound are used to treat patients with ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel, and Crohn's disease.

Research is ongoing on the use of CBD in the treatment of acute respiratory distress (ARDS), which may occur in patients with COVID-19. In early January this year, a group of scientists from the Plant Research Institute in Rishon Le-Zion, Israel, showed in laboratory studies that CBD can reduce the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines responsible for the formation of the so-called a cytokine storm that occurs in severely ill COVID-19 patients. - A similar study was conducted last summer in experiments on mice by scientists from Augusta University in the US state of Georgia. The animals were infected with synthetic viral RNA causing acute respiratory inflammation. After administration of CBD, the disease symptoms were completely or partially eliminated - says Krzysztof Góra.

[CBD is of the greatest importance in relieving anxiety, anxiety and stress. ](https://www.newsweek.pl/wiedza/nauka/kannabidiol-czy-jest-cbd-i-jakie-ma-dzialanie-jak-dziala-kannabidiol/c28xq27)\- It has a sedative and hypnotic effect. A few drops of CBD oil in the evening are enough to get a good night's sleep. I use it, for example, after returning from a long car journey, especially after driving fast on the highway - says prof. Wawer. Preparations with CBD can help in the so-called withdrawal syndrome in people who are in the process of quitting smoking or alcohol. - They can be very useful during the coronavirus pandemic, when we live in confinement and isolate ourselves from other people. CBD relieves depressive states, says Prof. Wawer. - It works on dopamine and serotonin receptors. It evokes a pleasure similar to the one we have after eating chocolate. It also improves concentration and makes remembering easier. In small doses (10-20 mg a day) it stimulates the prefrontal cortex - says Krzysztof Góra.

The most popular are preparations with CBD in the form of sublingual oils, but hard capsules that dissolve in the intestines provide three and a half times better absorption. - CBD in oils is unstable due to its sensitivity to light and high temperature. This compound is also easily oxidized - explains Krzysztof Góra.

Cannabis is in fashion. Hemp oil is popular, as it contains up to 80 percent. essential unsaturated fatty acids, beneficial to our body. It is rich in omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, fiber, vitamins B and E, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and iron. - Hemp oil is extracted from the seeds and does not contain CBD because it is found in flowers. Like most cosmetics - soaps, shampoos or creams that contain seed oil. Sometimes only CBD is added to them - says Krzysztof Góra.

The cannabis stalks, which can reach over 3 meters in height, can be used to make fabrics, ropes, ropes and cords. - Maybe in the future hemp will replace cotton, the cultivation of which requires a lot of water. Hemp can not only grow in areas with little rainfall, it does not yet have special soil requirements - says Prof. Wawer.

Hemp grows well in Poland, especially in the Lublin region. We know what hemp, fiber or industrial hemp is known as. They usually contain less than 0.2 percent. THC in the dry weight of inflorescences. - Cannabis, which is used for the production of medicinal marijuana, due to the high THC content (even over 20% of dry weight) will not be grown in the field. They need a warm climate and a long day, because the plant produces THC under the influence of the sun, says Prof. Wawer.",,,1612379686,{},glwa2d5,True,t3_lbvja1,False,True,t3_lbvja1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbvja1/hemp_extract_tested_to_treat_covid19/glwa2d5/,1612379756,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Though he'd not yet reached the age of 40, Ryan Parker filmed a video of himself from a hospital room saying goodbye to his family.

""I told them how much I love them and cared about them and how much they meant to me,"" he said. ""I told them I wasn't going to give up and I was going to keep fighting and I was hoping to see them again soon.""

Parker went into the emergency room on July 9 after experiencing shortness of breath and other complications from COVID-19.

It would be 134 days until he would finally be well enough to leave the hospital on Nov. 20, after months of exhausting efforts to save his life.

That education campaign needs to happen not after ""everyone who wants one, gets one"", but now. Those communities have a lot of death and if death prevention is the goal we need to fix this. That might take celebrities out there showing they aint dead from the vaccine.

And no they shouldnt, nor do they have to. They have two vaccines that are shown at 95 % efficacy and had similar endpoints to each other.  Novavax is good. And even johnson and Johnson is good ( im also waiting for results of ensemble 2)

Not only do they show good efficacy but after the second dose are starting to show long term immunity. 

Az has had bad data, misleading statistics and has fought with the fda on giving definitive answers. 

If their efficacy is 62% with a huge wide confidence interval then you're looking at about 80% of population needing to be vaccinated.  If its truly below 50% then  its not worth keeping. 

Now for this study. Plenty of people here have pointed put the problems with it including the wide CI.

The vaccines produce far better antibodies than you need to prevent disease for the vast majority of people, but the SA strain is also a lot closer to evading given future mutation than the change in efficacy might suggest at first glance. If the developed world gets to near-universial vaccination as fast as the supply allows, we'll be back to some sense of normalcy quite soon. 

Two things worry me. We might need rely on constantly updated mRNA vaccines (and the surveillance that requires) to maintain lasting immunity in the global south, which would be such a logistical nightmare the developed world would probably just not do it. The other is that enough people refuse the vaccine that you still see limited spread, especially if certian areas have especially low vaccination rates. Both of these scenarios would put serious selective pressure on the virus to evade the vaccine and increase the chances of creating new animal reservoirs. There would also be selective pressure to reduce the virulence, but given the incubation period, this pressure may be less than the pressure on other diseases.

We should all do our best to help mitigate spread, but that is basically lowering the viral load. unless you have a fitted mask, you and those around you are stil exposed, just with a lower initial viral load exposure. We know that you can actually contract the virus from mucus membranes in your eye. you can sit on your patio and your neighbor can cough and you are exposed.   


Lets try to avoid blaming people for contracting the virus if they are using normal mitigation efforts- medical professionals are also infected. It’s air borne. Reduce exposure, reduce spread, and get vaccinated. Viral load at initial exposure seems to play a huge part in how severe the illness will be. Mitigate that initial exposure- wear a mask, wash your hands, maintain distance. Give your body a chance to recognize an enemy and mount an appropriate defense. Do not depend on tests for an ‘all clear’- we know they aren’t that accurate.   


I keep a 3 month mantra in my mind- in 90 days most of us will have access to a vaccine. Understand that with most of the vaccines, you will still feel ‘sick’, but you are way less likely to die or be hospitalized, and that’s the goal. It’s not about preventing people from having headaches and body aches, it’s about pneumonia and ventilators. Perspective is important, and I honestly wish they would show more body bags and people dying on the news to stress the difference. 

As Fauci said, the more it transfers, the more it mutates- that means the less we are able to mount a food vaccine response. 

90 days. 

I wear a mask all day at work. I have allergies, so I’m constantly paranoid. Is it an allergy or is it Covid again?!?! I eat my lunch outside... but,  3 months I can do. I can wear a mask, and insist my customers do. 

If this is any help to anyone, humans do need human touch. I call it the ‘butt rub’, and we stand back to back- a lot of people are really alone right now, and it’s a nice way of having human connection with limited exposure.

   * USA has about 265 million Americans 16 years or older ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States) as of 2018)
* This doesn't include the Oxford vaccine which could seek out approval in the next month or so
* Nor the Novavax vaccine which pending US phase 3 clinical trials could be done by the end of April and approval in May.

That assumes that everyone who is eligible will get it (I am hearing 80% are willing), vaccination distribution reaches more than 3M per day and no supply issues.

For context, my job is quite high paying, and could easily support two people if needed.

He laughed in my face and interrupted me to talk about how if his restaurant closed he could just go back to his old restaurant. And anyway, he just graduated from his program and was getting plenty of interviews for white collar positions.

He thought I was overreacting by purchasing two weeks worth of non-perishables.

A week later all restaurants closed, leaving him jobless, with no savings and a few thousand in student loans.

Two weeks later his landlord illegally evicted all of their tenants. The government housing authority was closed.

In total, three weeks after he scoffed at the idea, he moved in with me. Though I have not had to support him financially (thanks Canadian government). 

And it would be a solid 6 months before he heard another peep from any recruiters for those white collar jobs. Effectively ending his pathway to citizenship (though recently they appear to be extending work permits for people in his situation).

Next month we’ll be declaring a civil partnership and applying for sponsorship.

Normally I would never even consider moving in so soon. Let alone sponsoring someone as a spouse who I thought was just going to be a hookup last December. And in many ways we’re quite different people. But we have helped each other through what I think is the hardest year any of us have experienced in a long time.

You are in a better position than millions and millions of people who worked in hundreds of industries who were dependent on Americans being able to freely go about their lives and spend money as they choose. Restrictions and lockdowns were forced upon everyone who would typically spend money supporting their businesses which has taken away their ability to support themselves. Someone forced a decision on them that has negatively affected everything about their lives.

Utility workers. Factory workers. Law enforcement/emergency services. Plumbers, electricians, tradesmen of all kinds. Infrastructure management. Healthcare workers. This list is endless. No matter if you get to stay at home or not, that's not in the cards for millions in the US. 

You're not being forced to go into the office everyday. You can quit your job. If you don't feel safe going in, don't do it. You can just quit. That would make you feel safe, right? You'll just be in the same situation as millions of others who lost their jobs because of restrictions and lockdowns that have been put into place under the guise of safety. Safety that you wanted. Safety that you feel is only attainable by everyone staying home, and *staying safe*. 

There's no question that Covid is a deadly virus, to a small portion of the population.

The Palestinian government does not have the money to order the vaccines required, they would have to either get a loan or have them donated to them. For that reason, they appealed to Israel for aid since Israel is legally their Occupying Power and thus is obligated to do certain things. One of which is to control the pandemic to a more or less equal degree in Palestine as they have in their own country.

Israel is not in charge of their flu shots, because Israel is violating international law by not assuming control of public health in Palestine. Currently, all public health in Palestine is controlled by Palestine's government de facto, but de jure Israel should actually be heading it due to Palestine saying that they cannot handle the pandemic.

Israel assuming control of public health in Palestine does not mean the Palestinian health care system would be dismantled. Think of it as getting a new CEO with bonus resources as opposed to destroying the system before it and building it anew.

The emergence of the mutation to the variant first discovered in Britain highlights how complicated exiting COVID-19 lockdown will be even once vaccines are rolled out.

Public Health England said there had been 11 reports of the UK variant which feature the E484K mutation, mostly in south-west England.

The E484K mutation, which occurs on the spike protein of the virus, is the same change as has been seen in the South African and Brazilian variants that have caused international concern.

""PHE is monitoring the situation closely and all necessary public health interventions are being undertaken, including enhanced contact tracing and control measures,"" a PHE spokesman said.

Several laboratory studies have found that vaccines and antibody therapy are significantly less effective against the South African variant.

By contrast, early evidence showed that vaccines worked just as well against the UK variant, which originally did not have the E484K mutation.

Health minister Matt Hancock said it was too early to tell the impact of variants on vaccines, but mutations of concern had been reported in Bristol and Liverpool.

""We must continue to act with caution, not least because of the renewed challenges posed by new variants of the coronavirus,"" he told lawmakers.

Calum Semple, who is part of a panel that advises the British government, told BBC radio that E484K was the ""mutation of most concern"", and had ""occurred spontaneously"" in the UK variant.

Concern over the South African variant, with its E484K mutation, has already prompted authorities in England to begin a door-to-door mass testing drive in areas where cases of the variant have been found in people with no link to South Africa, while mandatory quarantine in hotels for arrivals from South Africa is yet to come into force.

Though the number of reported cases of the UK variant with the concerning mutation are small, scientists said that it demonstrated how Britain's high prevalence of cases meant that it was not enough simply to prevent new variants being imported.

""This report would seem to suggest that under conditions of very high levels of virus replication even the most stringent of border controls, although they may delay spread, are unlikely to prevent the appearance of new variants,"" said Jonathan Stoye, virologist at The Francis Crick Institute",,,1612373492,{},glvua9c,True,t3_lbswju,False,False,t3_lbswju,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbswju/uk_virus_variant_has_developed_concerning_new/glvua9c/,1612681535,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You play an odds game with covid when you go out and about meeting new people face to face maskless. Your odds are better when your area has low incidence rates. Arizona does not have low incidence rates. In fact it has very high incidence rates. They were meeting 'new' friends to socialize in the safe outdoors.

It's amusing though that people believe you can't get covid sitting around a table talking to strangers if it's outside. Much of this is down to the USA having a joke of a contact tracing apparatus and then not sharing specifics about where people end up infected. It's all some mystery how people get infected. You can get infected talking to people at a table outdoors for an hour plus.

You also have plenty of people who have covid going out and about despite knowing they have it.

two big reasons.

1. the transmission rate would need to be REALLY low (which does not seem to be the case with this vaccine), AND the number of infected people in the community would need to be somewhat low. Otherwise, vaccinated people would still contribute to spread. thus, there will likely need to be a lag where even vaccinated people need to mask up in order to drive down the total transmission rate (vaccinated and unvaccinated people).

2. as soon as it's ok for vaccinated people to stop wearing a mask, then nobody will wear a mask. people don't like masks anyway, so the unvaccinated X% of the population would just stop wearing them, and use some justification they found on the internet to feel good, even if they're causing spread to increase by ignoring social distancing and masking. 

So, you have to ask yourself: what transmission rate of vaccinated people, and what percentage of the population needs to be vaccinated, before we just go ahead and tell everyone to stop wearing masks (vaccinated and unvaccinated), because that is effectively what is going to happen.",,,1612377566,{},glw4pno,False,t3_lbjzik,False,False,t1_glv75ml,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbjzik/the_astrazeneca_vaccine_is_shown_to_drastically/glw4pno/,1612686788,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Lockdowns are an emergency measure. To avoid lockdown you have to act early. If you wait too long lockdowns either become inevitable or you risk unnecessary deaths from having to triage your healthcare system. 

This something I'm noticing around the world during the pandemic. Politicans receive advise to put in moderate measures early they ignore it fearing voter backlash if they act to early. Then when shit hits the fan they fear voter backlash from overwhelmed hosptials and turn to the only option available: lockdowns. Then they reopen things too early, and cases rise again. 

A good contrast  province (BC) and my home province (Alberta). Both provinces have a roughly similarish population, and in BC case the population is mostly packed into the Lower Mainland (Vancouver + Suburbs).

Alberta hasn't delagated any powers to the Chief Medical Officer of Health she needs to get the Premier and Cabinet to agree to the restrictiions. While BC has given our Cheif Medical Officer authority to act independently. So our CMO is basically did what she felt was right at the time she felt it was right.

In BC we have had no second lockdown. I can go shopping, eat a restaurant, drink before 1000 at a bar or even go to the gym (just no a fitness class).

But it required us to act early. In September before cases started rising we put in measures to contain the virus. We closed all high risk businesses where the virus was spreading rapidly (banquet halls and nightclubs) and contained in regularddb businesses where the virus has significant spread (no fitness classes).

By contrast the day after our measures were announced, the Priemer of Alberta mocked them saying it was ""micromanaging businesses"". Then when shit hit the fan, he tried to do what we did but it was too late, and had to lockdown.

Interestingly, despite him worrying about voter backlash. Alberta priemer is the least popular in Canada, while BC priemer is the most popular. On top of that the economic damage in BC is negligible, we actually grew in the last quarter. 

It's not just this it's every issue I'm noticing globally politicians just drag their feet because voters might get angey.

That's by state. State-wide population densities can be found easily on google. There are a few US states with population densities that are comparable to EU countries and can be compared that way.

The US is just too big for per capita to be an effective measurement when compared to much smaller countries. Assessing US states individually is probably more accurate but even still, it obscures the immense death happening due to the mass amounts of unpopulated land in some states. For example the state I live in has a per capita death that equal to that of Belgium even though the population density in my state is way less than that of Belgium. 7 times less. That's because my state has all it's population concentrated in one main area. States like California and Texas have a huge percentage of their population dispersed on farm land and small towns. So they have smaller death rates than average despite huge population numbers and huge city centers. The low rates of the rural citizens is offsetting the devastating rates in the urban centers.  Eastern states with more similar densities and distributions as EU countries are better comparisons.

This is a common assumption, but it's wishful thinking.  Deaths are dropping exactly like it was expected they would because the cases started dropping two to three weeks ago.  Deaths track infections.

The cases started dropping two to three weeks ago not because the vaccinations are happening (there aren't enough people vaccinated yet) but because the case level was a spike due to the holiday season at the end of 2020.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but we're not out of the woods yet.  The number of infected and dead could still increase again, depending on a lot of things.  

That's why scientists are encouraging the government to speed up vaccinations, to get ahead of the curve so by the time the new variants become wide spread more people are immune, which will make any future spikes less severe by making some portion of the people exposed not get infected.

The new variants are coming, though, and if we get unlucky or the government does the wrong thing, they could make things very bad.

But there's another thing to watch out for that happens years later... I'm not sure how to say it in english: the ""Affinity Fraudsters"".  These ""affinity fraudsters"" are basically con-artists that traffic on the anger and resentment that are members of your own group.  They make money off of financial scandals and other corrupt acts that hide in the mutual trust that they have with you by exploiting your mutual anger and resentment of authorities.  A side effect of these conmen is that they left my older brothers and sisters with a bunch of stupid conspiracy theory stories that they passed onto their kids about medicine.  For some reason nobody blames the conmen.

That's easy.  If people keep behaving like they have at holidays and similar, getting together in groups, not wearing masks, etc, we could end up with another spike in cases.  When people get close together and don't wear masks, the virus can spread.

However, at least one of the new variants is significantly more infectious than the original dominant variant.  So the spike of infections that would happen would be much larger in terms of total infected than the ones we've had.   Twice as many infected per day and (two to three weeks later) a corresponding number of deaths spiking are possible.

The open question is how fast the variants will become dominant and whether people in the US will start doing things that avoid spreading it.  Time will tell.

As far as ""natural immunity"", despite what your gut might tell you there aren't enough people with immunity from either the vaccine or from recovering from the virus to get us to the much discussed ""herd immunity"" especially if the new variants can reinfect some number of people who have already had the old variant.

&gt;It feels a little like scaremongering to continue to act like something worse than what we just went through is on our doorstep. The people that need to hear the message still won't hear it, and those that are listening are already doing what we can to minimize our exposure.

There's a reason they are trying to convey the information.

Vaccines are not magical shields that can keep you from getting any virus virions inside of your body. Technically, at any point you can get some amounts of any virus you’re vaccinated inside you. So technically **no** vaccines actually prevent you from “getting” the virus.

What they do prevent is those viruses replicating inside of you, causing you to be sick, and reduce or eliminate viral shedding (spreading the virus, essentially).

Now again, the news has been bad about reporting this correctly - you’ll see statements like, “the vaccine doesn’t prevent spreading the virus”, but that’s a misunderstanding of the science and how scientists talk.

What really happened is vaccine companies didn’t test for that scientifically, and until they do, they’re not going to make claims it can reduce infectivity. They didn’t say it doesn’t, they said “we don’t know this yet, so act like it does”

But the biology suggests it almost certainly does - the infectivity of COVID is almost certainly related to the amount of viral shedding going on. In fact, entire nations have staked their vaccination plan on this idea, like the UK and Israel, where they prioritized single vaccinations for more people rather than double for fewer - the idea being that the vaccine can prevent spread. It’s also one of the main ideas for why healthcare workers are prioritized (the other is that they’re exposed more and likelier to get sick).

That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t still **act** like you’re infectious after you’re vaccinated, as we don’t know how much the vaccine prevents further infection, but it almost certainly does prevent it to some substantial percentage at minimum.

I compiled Evidence based answers to the Israeli-Palestinian vaccine issue in case you are confused. The issue is around Israelis refusing to vaccinate Palestinians and Palestinians affirming it as an obligation under international law as an occupying power.

Here is the[ Israeli health minister being grilled about it on TV](https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiPalestineBigotry/comments/l6co9x/when_asked_about_israels_obligation_to_vaccinate/).

**Both sides seem to fight in social media, in organized efforts even. For example,** [**Here is Israeli propaganda app directing users to repeat certain arguments on social media posts?**](https://twitter.com/AntiBDSApp/status/1348370440692097025)

**Did Palestinians refuse to take the vaccine from Israel?**

**No**, they didn't. [Here is a piece](https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/palestinians-accuse-israel-of-shirking-duty-to-supply-covid-19-vaccines-654946) covering the Palestinian Authority affirming Israel’s responsibility for vaccines. [Here is a statement](https://www.nad.ps/en/media-room/media-briefs/covid-19-vaccines-and-israels-obligations-occupying-power) by the Palestinian Negotiations affairs department citing the responsibility of Israel as occupying power under Geneva convention to provide the vaccine to occupied populace. [Here is the Palestinian ambassador to the UK doing the same.](https://twitter.com/hzomlot/status/1353418223530610688)

Israel by it's occupation has choked the infrastructure and capabilities of the public health sector of Palestine; It is their duty under international law to provide it, but admittedly Zionists don't care.

\----------------------

**Did Palestinians ask for it officially?**

**Yes**, [Here it is reported](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/what-amnesty-international-gets-wrong-about-israel-s-vaccine-programme):

&gt;"" In truth, Palestinian liaison officials had already quietly contacted Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) department to request the vaccine. The Israelis had agreed to help. Assisting the Palestinians made sense, since it was vital to maintain a degree of goodwill in coordination between the two sides on the West Bank. ""

In response Israel provided dozens of vaccines. Looks more like an attempt at humiliation.

\----------------------

**Did Palestinian lose their right to vaccination by Israel in the Oslo Accords?**

**No,** The human rights in the Geneva conventions are not lost. It was stressed by the UN. They are International law signed by 196 countries, one of which is Israel. Again you can’t waive human rights in International law as the Geneva Convention doesn't allow it.

Here is more about it:

&gt;UN human rights experts today called on Israel, the occupying power, to ensure swift and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for the Palestinian people under occupation. \[...\]The experts said that as the occupying power, Israel is required under the Fourth Geneva Convention, “to the fullest extent of the means available to it”, to maintain health services in the occupied territory.**Article 56 requires Israel to adopt and apply “the prophylactic and preventive measures necessary to combat the spread of contagious diseases and epidemics”** in cooperation with national and local authorities.If the protected population is inadequately supplied, the occupying power is required under the Convention to facilitate relief schemes “by all means at its disposal”. **Even if relief consignments, including ‘medical supplies’, are provided by others, Article 60 states that such consignments “shall in no way relieve the occupying power of any of its responsibilities” for health care to the protected population.**“The right to health is also a fundamental human rights issue,” the experts said. “International human rights law, which applies in full to the occupied Palestinian territory, stipulates that everyone enjoys the right to ‘the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health’.The denial of an equal access to health care, such as on the basis of ethnicity or race, **is discriminatory and unlawful.** ”They said some Israeli commentators have justified the differential treatment on the grounds that the 1995 Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement, an integral part of the Oslo Accords, provides that the Palestinian Authority would assume the responsibility for health care in the Palestinian territory, including for vaccinations. The experts said that the Oslo Accords must be interpreted and applied consistent with international law, and **cannot derogate from its broad protections. The ultimate responsibility for health services remains with the occupying power until the occupation has fully and finally ended.**",,,1612360107,{},gluyyzz,False,t3_lbk6c5,False,True,t1_glur4km,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbk6c5/israel_to_vaccinate_all_adults_beginning_tomorrow/gluyyzz/,1612665064,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Idk if that speculative data about AZ's one dose efficacy was something you were aware of early on when you claimed my 62% figure was incorrect, since you pointed out that it had just come out halfway through our discussion. 

In any case, it being more efficacious would be terrific news, since I LIKE the vaccine. I love the tech and love UK's role in this pandemic. Two things I look forward to: 1) Clinical trial data for AZ in the US, 2) Clinical trial data for combined Ad26 - ChAd immunization. If you have any info on when we can expect those, do tell me. 

&gt;feel free to do one of those remind me things and come back when the US data or real world UK trial data is out on 'true' observed efficacy

Don't know how to do that.

&gt;Thanks my Serbia Broski and I'm glad to see relatively how well vaccinations are going there, decision to use Sputnik is good one

&gt;&gt; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic. Initial estimates of the early dynamics of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, suggested a doubling time of the number of infected persons of 6–7 days and a basic reproductive number (R0) of 2.2–2.7. We collected extensive individual case reports across China and estimated key epidemiologic parameters, including the incubation period (4.2 days). We then designed 2 mathematical modeling approaches to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan by using high-resolution domestic travel and infection data. Results show that the doubling time early in the epidemic in Wuhan was 2.3–3.3 days. Assuming a serial interval of 6–9 days, we calculated a median R0 value of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8–8.9).

## Abstract

Infection-related diabetes can arise as a result of virus-associated β-cell destruction. Clinical data suggest that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), impairs glucose homoeostasis, but experimental evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can infect pancreatic tissue has been lacking. In the present study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells of the human exocrine and endocrine pancreas ex vivo and in vivo. We demonstrate that human β-cells express viral entry proteins, and SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in cultured human islets. Infection is associated with morphological, transcriptional and functional changes, including reduced numbers of insulin-secretory granules in β-cells and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In COVID-19 full-body postmortem examinations, we detected SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in pancreatic exocrine cells, and in cells that stain positive for the β-cell marker NKX6.1 and are in close proximity to the islets of Langerhans in all four patients investigated. Our data identify the human pancreas as a target of SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that β-cell infection could contribute to the metabolic dysregulation observed in patients with COVID-19.",,,1612364662,{},glv8r5s,True,t3_lbpg2u,False,False,t3_lbpg2u,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbpg2u/sarscov2_infects_and_replicates_in_cells_of_the/glv8r5s/,1612670287,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

* Even if you aren't permanently affected, you can still carry the virus to someone who it will kill or permanently damage.

* If the virus replicates in you, that gives it further chances to mutate into something more dangerous... it might or might not harm you in the process, but the new variant might eventually cause thousands of deaths.

Ok, so what is it for COVID-19?  Can you give a cite?

&gt;By iteration 5 you are down to the level where only 1.56% of the concentration is picked up, and it's rapidly downhill from there.

This makes no sense.  You are essentially saying that if you've already gotten most of the virus, then there's less left.  Uh, yeah?  

And if the first iteration is enough to get you infected, then it is enough to get you infected.  And it doesn't even have to be enough because you can touch multiple things, or even multiple spots.  Say it is a school desk covered in COVID.  Not every spot is going to be touched uniformly.  Even if one spot is on the 5th iteration (meaning you already picked up most of it, which is bad), you can then touch another spot that is again on its 1st.

&gt;With the 'disinfection' methods that have become standard practice it is an open question whether any protection gained is from actually inactivating virus. How much is due to simply washing and wiping the virus away.

What do you mean by this? washing/wiping it away is also part of cleaning. If you are wiping it away (even partially), then that's a good thing. 

Also, there's stuff like this:

https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-transmission/art-20482397

&gt;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a list of disinfectants for use against the virus that causes COVID-19. Although these products haven't been tested against this specific virus, they're known to work against other, harder-to-kill viruses.

Palestine gets relatively little in aid as compared to Israel.

The Times of Israel is not an acceptable source on Israeli-Palestinian relations. I apologize if you believe otherwise, but the newspaper has an interest in promoting the Israeli government's position and decrying Palestine's. 

I did not ignore your question. It's a strange question but I did answer it. The Palestinian government has undoubtedly tried to buy the vaccine. They cannot obtain it due to the myriad of reasons I have listed and many I have not.

Let me repeat because you seem to be ignoring this everytime I say it. The Palestinians have placed a phone call to order vaccines. They cannot get the vaccines. The Israeli government, according to international law, must help due to being an Occupying Power.

Obviously I don't know if this would actually work, for all I know the body needs the immune system fully focused on fighting one mRNA based antigen for immunity to work out, but if it does, I could imagine it being relatively seamless, and think it would go a long way to making things logistically easier if we do need this vaccine to be annual.

But of course that isn't totally clear yet either. The variants that have been showing some resistance to vaccines aren't showing them uniformly to different vaccines. It could work out that one vaccine creates induces antibodies that are especially good at preventing infection and transmission in humans. If so it could be possible that when a person gets that one, they won't need a booster to handle future variants since the necessary infection mechanism could be out of scope for the natural evolution of the virus.

Why would there be a need for a yearly one if the current one protects sufficiently? We don't know yet but if the vaccines can help you stay immune (protection from hospitalisation and death) for 1.5 to 2 years (according to Sputnik people), why would there be a need for yearly vaccinations? 

We should not forget that if a lot of people get vaccinated quickly enough, the virus will have less hosts to mutate. I would suspect then that it would be a similar scenario to measles. It would still exist, but way less prevalent, lowering the chances of mutations significantly, thus lessen the need for new vaccinations. 

Am I too optimistic to think that we would be done with SarsCov2 if we get vaccinated now and get 2nd gen vaccination in 1.5 years ?

[],,FuelHead77,,,[],,,,text,t2_98zs94r1,False,False,[],"Last week I took a closer look at the data from India. Last September it seemed that this would become the most affected country in the world by absolute number of victims, then the trend reversed and infections have continuously decreased in the last four months; today India records just over 10,000 infections and a hundred of victims per day, very low numbers both in relation to the enormous size of this country, and in the face of almost 100,000 infections and over a thousand daily victims at the peak of September. Overall, officially recorded victims are 154,000, less than those of the United States, Brazil and Mexico: a considerable number in absolute terms, but very low when compared to the population – 111 covid deaths per million inhabitants, when both in Europe and the Americas most countries are well above 500 victims per million, and thirty are even above a thousand per million. Even countries younger than India (lower median age and lower percentage of population over 65) have had more victims in relation to the population: for example Iraq, with 321 victims per million, and Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), with 499 victims per million. Certainly India has not achieved herd immunity, unless there are half a million or more unrecorded victims; this fall in the number of infections is a bit of a mystery.

Looking at the data relating to the individual states / territories that make up India, it can be seen that the distribution of victims is extremely uneven, with a handful of states that have been heavily affected while most of the others have hardly been touched.

One-third of the overall number victims is concentrated in the state of Maharashtra alone (the second most populous in the country), whose population however represents less than a tenth of the total of India; whereas the combined death toll from the country's first and third most populous states, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which together represent over a quarter of the total Indian population, accounts for just over 6% of total victims.

The most affected state/territory in relation to the population is Delhi, with 655 deaths per million inhabitants; it is followed by Puducherry, with 646 deaths per million, Goa, with 523 deaths per million, Ladakh, with 470 deaths per million, and Maharashtra, with 453 deaths per million. These five states / territories combined represent less than 12% of the total population of India.

Few states / territories are located in an intermediate range, between 200 and 399 deaths per million: Chandigarh (316 per million), Sikkim (218 per million), Punjab (202 per million), Karnataka. Combined, they make up less than 3% of the Indian population.

Much more numerous are those that have between 100 and 199 victims per million inhabitants: Karnataka (199 per million), Tamil Nadu (170 per million), Andaman and Nicobar Islands (163 per million), Uttarakhand (158 per million), Jammu and Kashmir (155 per million), Manipur (144 per million), Andhra Pradesh (143 per million), Chhattisgarh (141 per million), Himachal Pradesh (140 per million), Haryana (118 per million), West Bengal (109 per million), Kerala (108 per million), Tripura (105 per million). These states comprise 43% of the Indian population.

The remaining fifteen states / territories (which comprise about 42% of the total population) have recorded less than one hundred victims per million inhabitants, thus being barely touched by the pandemic: the aforementioned Bihar (14 victims per million) and Uttar Pradesh (43 per million) fall into this group. The others are Gujarat (71 per million), Madhya Pradesh (52 per million), Meghalaya (49 per million), Odisha (47 per million), Telangana (45 per million), Nagaland (44 per million), Arunachal Pradesh (40 per million), Rajasthan (39 per million), Assam (35 per million), Jharkhand (32 per million), Mizoram (eight per million) and “Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu” (three per million). Finally, the little Lhakshadweep, which with just 64,000 inhabitants is by far the smallest territory in India, has not registered any victims.

Even the distribution of new daily cases is highly uneven; presently, the majority of new infections come from only two states, Kerala and Maharashtra. Kerala alone, which accounts for less than 5% of the Indian population, currently records half of the total daily infections of the entire country.",,,1612367433,{},glvfcjx,False,t3_lbiqne,False,True,t3_lbiqne,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbiqne/daily_discussion_thread_february_03_2021/glvfcjx/,1612673756,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Restrictions are in place to prevent overwhelmed hospitals, and as hospitalizations decline, it makes sense for restrictions to be eased as well.

We are though stuck in March forever, and despite having much more knowledge about treatment, the levels of healthcare we need, and even a rolling vaccination program, we are stuck in March.

Communication to the public was awful and studies show people genuinely think 15% of those who catch covid die. We had a strategy based on scaring people. Now, the scare went out of control and there is a panic with ""mutations"" that could lead the public to believe that it will never be ""safe"" again and make those measures permanent.

I don't expect you to read the entire paper but this is more or less what I agree with. It is a study with specialists from law and medicine calling for a pandemic approach that isn't simply copying measures from anti terrorism and law enforcement. Curfews are the best example of them

About measures that weren't needed, many. Strict, punitive lockdowns such as in Spain, France and Italy. Restricting movement is reasonable, but blanket and indefinite border closures are stupid and pointless when the virus is endemic. Above all, there is no clear goal, goalposts are moved all the time. Many european countries are seeing drastic falls in infections and hospitalizations and the consequences is MORE restrictions because there is now a irrational fear about hypothetical mutations. We didn't see a societal collapse in countries with a more relaxed approach such as Sweden, Belarus, Mexico etc, and the risk of a societal collapse is the only thing that would justify what we are going through for almost one year.

Personally my patience is gone. I am tired of seeing all this circus of dumbed down population thinking they are living the end of times, selfish cynical media hunting for clickbaits, and politicians not doing what is expected of them which is to lead.

A quite probable scenario is that vaccination prevents infection of lung tissue, but does not prevent an infection of the upper respiratory tract. Given the observed efficiency of the vaccines, they could easily limit the extent of the infection in the mucosae.  


Such a scenario would mean a significant reduction in transmission, but not elimination. This is in fact what we find with most respiratory infections. We might be lucky that after a first 'real' infection, localized immunity in the mucosae provides something more akin to sterilizing immunity for subsequent infections.  


Finally, given that super-spreaders are the main driver for the pandemic, it is arguably much more important what the effect of vaccination is on super-spreaders. If it stops or greatly reduces the transmission in this particular subset, it is not a problem if the non-super-spreaders don't get sterilizing immunity. The majority of infected never transmit infection even without vaccines.  


One  theory about super-spreading is that it caused by asymptomatic infection of the lungs. In that case the vaccines would massively impactful - even if they have 0 reduction in transmission from the upper respiratory tract.

&gt;&gt; In addition to sex differences in immune responses, hormones, and genes, there are also psychological, social, and behavioral components that influence COVID-19 progression (1,15). Compared with women, men tend to engage in more high-risk behaviors that generate potential for contracting COVID-19 (1,4). Polls taken early in the first wave of COVID-19 cases in the United States show sex differences in the perceived severity of the pandemic (20). Another US study found that men have been more likely to downplay the severity of the virus’s potential to harm them (21), and fewer men than women have reported that they have been avoiding large public gatherings or avoiding close physical contact with others (21–23). In addition, compared with women in many countries, including the United States, men tend to have higher rates of behaviors that are linked with COVID-19 infection and mortality, including higher rates of tobacco use and alcohol consumption (1,4,21,24).

&gt;&gt; Men also tend to have lower rates than women of handwashing, social distancing, wearing masks, and effectively and proactively seeking medical help (1,4,21,25,26). Many men have been socialized to mask their fear, and it is important to consider how hiding fear affects men’s response to COVID-19 (27). It is particularly important to focus on men who respond to threats like COVID-19 with aggression and anger. Research shows that people with this response “tend to downplay risk and are resistant to risk reduction policies,” which is problematic during efforts to promote social distancing and other pandemic restrictions (27). These socially constructed behaviors reduce the perception of susceptibility and severity, which then translates into a decrease in the practice of preventive measures, such as handwashing, and protests against pandemic-related restrictions.",,,1612371248,{},glvoo81,False,t3_lblqwl,False,True,t1_glvgj7b,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lblqwl/young_and_middleaged_adults_responsible_for_most/glvoo81/,1612678645,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

i am not a virologist, but i strongly disagree with your assessment, for two main reasons:

(1) we simply do not have a choice. **not** having covid circulating is not possible at this point. it's been said by doctors prettymuch since March of last year that it was *wayyyyy* past the point of no return for ""containment"". the virus is here to stay, it's not possible to eliminate it. it will be like the flu, ever present.

(2) what we know about viruses actually leads to the opposite conclusion - in general, the longer a virus is circulating, the less deadly it becomes. there's evolutionary pressure that results in viruses killing less people over time, and there's also the simple fact that in general, more susceptible people are killed (sounds cold, but it's true) while people who are less susceptible to the virus survive.

the evolutionary pressure is somewhat self-explanatory, the less likely a virus is to kill it's host and/or to significantly incapacitate it, the more likely it is to be able to spread. when a virus is very severe and puts people down quickly, it can obviously still spread (since many viruses can spread while pre-symptomatic), but *not as well* as a virus that has milder symptoms and so infected people are more liely to go about their business meeting a lot more people.


basically what you're saying about herd immunity is kind of irrelevant in the context of trying to ""eliminate"" covid or prevent it from mutating. herd immunity in theory will prevent huge waves of infections, but herd immunity doesn't prevent *all* infections, and certainly will not prevent mutations.",,,1612371101,{},glvobbe,False,t3_lbjd4f,False,False,t1_glv61u9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbjd4f/70_to_85_of_americans_need_to_be_fully_vaccinated/glvobbe/,1612678456,24,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; The study showed no significant impact on neutralizing titers against the B.1.1.7 variant relative to prior variants. A six-fold reduction in neutralizing titers was observed with the B.1.351 variant relative to prior variants. Despite this reduction, neutralizing titer levels with B.1.351 remain above levels that are expected to be protective.

By August 17–23, 2020, the 7-day rolling average COVID-19 incidence had decreased by 6% to 16 cases per 100,000 among mandated counties and increased by 100% to 12 per 100,000 among nonmandated counties.

I mean, sure. But on the other hand, masked counties only saw a 6% decrease. Additionally, this was during the summer when cases were plummeting anyway. Where's the data for this winter on masked vs. unmasked counties? What can we say about California cases skyrocketing despite being one of the most compliant states with masking? Let's also not forget that correlation does not always mean causation - there are a large number of mitigation measures in place that could have also contributed to these discrepancies. And I mean the ""increased 100%"" is misleading. It went from 6/100k to 12/100k whereas the mandated counties saw a huge increase at first (because they're more populated) and then only a 6% decrease after implementing masks. **6%.** Sure, this shows a difference but I'm sorry this is not convincing, nor solid science. It's making an assumption based on a trend without controlling for anything else.

Look, I don't doubt that masks can provide some level of protection to people if the wearer is sick.

Frankly, I don't agree with your conclusion that we can realistically make much distinction between the Russian government and the Russian scientific community, particularly in the case of something like public health. That government inherited from its predecessor a complete willingness to bend the truth on exactly such matters, and not only to do that with its own resources but by exerting tremendous pressure and influence on the entirety of that country's scientific community. 

Whatever the hyperbole and stupidity of the present moment in the public's response to the present crisis, we should not make our judgements in reference to this, we should skeptically (not cynically) examine the facts and come to rational conclusions. Maybe large American media deserves blame painting a picture that is not wholly accurate, but they cannot also be heavily blamed for increasing distrust of groups who give reason for distrust, or groups of people who are within those distrustful people's power. If people then come to idiotic conclusions about the Russian vaccine as you point out, to the point that they wouldn't trust it even if it were vetted independently then I think the greatest responsibility for that result lies with the Russian government and its avowed disregard for facts and truth.

I have previously worked in a minor role in public health, and there is one thing I can definitely state, is that it is entirely about trust and perception. Public health measures are not just about what is scientifically most efficacious in an ideal environment. Nothing good comes from the most scientifically sound practices if they are designed with a complete ignorance of the way they will be received by the community. That is the difference between being greeted by a shotgun muzzle when you knock on the door and being welcomed because people understand you are trying to help them.

When you’re in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it’s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. And, often, there are unintended consequences — people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face""

This was a badly stated quote of Fauci.  The key element that distinguishes this from how people are suggesting it was intended is the ""but it’s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is"". This is very clear, he said prior it may block droplets but it isn't the **perfect** protection.  This statement is not saying they don't work, they're saying wearing a mask is not (alone) going to do anything. Unsaid here in this quote is the intent and context of this.  This harkens to social distance+ and lockdowns.  This is still quite true.  If you all wear a mask and still pack shoulder to should in the subway, that mask isn't going to keep you too safe if someone is ill.  If the number of people is 4 in the same car, masked, the chances for all of them are much better, better even than just the four without masks.   This quote alone doesn't make this clear, though lockdowns and social distancing were at the same time being pushed.  

This alternate timeline you propose asks the wrong question, as I suspect you so not understand the problem.   In an alternate timeline where everyone was wearing masks in January, I'd hope I owned 3m stock for their manufacturing and sales that existed prior to that. 

The inventory to mask everyone did not exist.  Even enough masks for healthcare workers DID NOT EXIST, much less masks for the public who did not need them at the time when the highest chance of being exposed was in a healthcare environment where the masks already found short supply.  

The purpose was to avert panic buying of ppe which was needed by healthcare workers until it was realized it had reached a point where it was necessary.  We learned, yes, but we also had new manufacturing shifted to mask ppe from other items they used to produce making masks more easily acquired. Even now a lot of proper n95s are in short supply. We reuse them at the ambulance co I work at as do many in the hospital.

You have to figure out which is the correct one yourself.  Here's a list of paradoxes I can think of off the top of my head.  You can easily find sources for all these in mainstream publications or news sites and likely from the same ones.

Wearing a mask is worse than wearing no masks and masks cut transmission by 95% (real number).  The first of course was a lie we were told for our own good.

The lockdown will be just 3 weeks and this will stop the virus in its tracks but it definitely won't be gone by Easter (6 weeks from now) as that is just magical thinking.

Masks protect others not yourself but they also protect yourself unless they have a vent despite the fact vented masks can be used in environments with lethal gasses that can kill you in a matter of minutes.

Taking the flu vaccine is the best thing you can do right now (March 2020) with regards to the coronavirus (actual quote) and the flu vaccine does nothing to help.

Sing happy birthday 3 times while washing your hands and COVID-19 is airborne and doesn't transmit through fomites.

Herd immunity will be reached at 60% but now that close to 50% of the population has been infected the new number is now 90% despite no new Science supporting the higher number.

Kids are not immune to the virus and we'll ban you from Twitter from suggesting that as kids are dying all around us.  Also schools are not sources of transmission so are safe to open.

Animals can get COVID-19 from people but they can't transmit it to humans also bats are the source of COVID-19.

And finally the vaccine doesn't stop transmission, only limits symptoms and taking the vaccine will also prevent mutations that rely on transmission.",,,1612328411,{},glttgff,False,t3_lb16pg,False,False,t1_gls6zcp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lb16pg/fauci_urges_vaccinations_to_stop_new_virus/glttgff/,1612644325,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I'm in no way telling you what to do, but leaving the house doesn't mean you'll get covid. And getting covid doesn't mean that you will die. A lot of it depends on the situations you are in and who else is there.

I wrote this below  as a response to a similar question:

&gt;Effective masks have been widely available since very early in the pandemic. People just don't know or care or have time to look into the efficacy of proper masking. 

&gt;The reason that you're asking this question is that there was a criminal failure of the United States Federal Government to effectively communicate that there might be a difference between a mask and a dish towel. 

&gt;This has been going on since at least March 5, 2020 when VP and Dr. Birx [completely misrepresented](https://www.c-span.org/video/?470086-101/vice-president-pence-meets-3m-executives) documents which 3M provided their team, with international mask equivalencies. It was one of her first speeches.
 &gt;[PDF](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1791500O/comparison-ffp2-kn95-n95-filtering-facepiece-respirator-classes-tb.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwibwJe78szuAhXzFVkFHbFGDJYQFjAAegQIARAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw2z4TC1hPHN24_dcVwQNC1V).

&gt;[THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND REPIRATORY PROTECTION](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1819804O/hcbg-msd-white-paper-rpds-and-covid-19.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi46vr28szuAhX-FVkFHWzdC1UQFjAKegQIEhAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0HaH11I-eH9tAbnNqrDOQO) is a white paper which dates to March 2020, written by a 3M scientist (Gaert Driessen, who usually publishes in his native Dutch) for a uniquely English audience. It sums up masks in blunt terms:

&gt;&gt;Looking at what healthcare workers and also the ‘general public” is currently wearing, to protect themselves or their 
environment from possible airborne transmission of COVID-19, we need to distinguish two types of masks;
&gt;&gt;• A Surgical Mask (also known as a procedure mask, medical mask or simply as a face mask)
&gt;&gt;• A Respiratory Protective Device also called a “Respirator”
Although in very different ways, both masks can play a role in containment and mitigation of the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

&gt;Basically he wrote: *In pandemic circumstances there are certainly methods of masking which might be less than optimal, but we're in a pandemic. Wear an N95 equivalent in healthcare settings (if they’re  available) at all possible times.* 

&gt;I'm nearly *positive* that this exact document was presented to the Coronavirus Task Force. It's what Birx summed up as:

&gt;&gt;So, wearing this as a healthy person will not protect you. But a sick person wearing this mask will help protect others from getting infected.

&gt;....

&gt;&gt;And so really understanding why healthcare providers need these masks and that the average American purchasing these masks will do nothing for them. But if you are sick, you should wear one.

&gt;The Administration even had their own science on effective masks, and still do:

&gt;Immediately after the FDA gave a temporary import authoriation for KN95 masks, the CDC actually implemented a testing protocol to certify which devices met at least a filtration standard. This list was available by April: [Appendix A: Authorized Imported, Non-NIOSH Approved Respirators Manufactured in China (Updated with Administrative Changes or Respirator Model Removals: October 15, 2020.)](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-euas).

&gt;The full results are available under the [International Assessment (Respirator) Results – Not NIOSH-approved](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/respirators/testing/NonNIOSHresults.html)
 list, which has been updated regularly for 10 months.

&gt;There is even a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Masks4All/) for this.

&gt;The product of almost a year of anti-mask sentiment from Federal Government ends with a global population which doesn't know what an effective mask is, much less where to find it.

&gt;Tl;dr: Legitimate KN95 and KF94 masks are $12/10pk shipped. They have been available since ~~May~~* April. On Black Friday they dropped under a dollar apiece. The head of the federal government didn't want the public to know this, and effectively censored it.

&gt;Edit: First available in the first week of April 2020, I just checked my receipt. In April they were closer to $2.50/mask but this dropped rapidly to ~$1.00, less in bulk.",,,1612333367,{},glu1380,True,t3_lbctzo,False,True,t1_glta96g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbctzo/its_time_for_a_federal_mask_standard_washington/glu1380/,1612647858,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

To your comments in that thread about the sub, it's incredibly helpful if you use the report function on \*any\* comments spreading misinformation about masks or vaccines. We do our best to remove everything asap, but we also don't see everything because the sub is huge. The report function is a huge help. You are also always welcome to modmail us if you're concerned about something and we'll look into it (and you're also welcome to personally ask for me).

The beginning of the thread doesn't look particularly bad because it's people refuting what the original question was. But I understand your concerns and have removed the information and outside links. I also went through and removed nearly everything else in the thread as it just devolved into a lot of personal attacks. That being said, none of those comments were reported. If they had been, they likely would've been removed before the rest of the thread unfolded. So please report things like that so we are guaranteed to see them.

I hope this helps alleviate some of your concerns a little bit. We take misinformation very, very seriously and have banned countless brigaders, conspiracy theorists and people spreading misinformation at this point. And will continue to do so!

Day 1 (1/26): First day I realized I had symptoms. I had a bad headache, felt dizzy, began losing my taste and smell, had bad nasal congestion, a low-grade fever, and an upset stomach. 

Days 2 &amp; 3: Nasal congestion, smell and taste were nearly gone, still had an upset stomach. 

Day 4: Tested positive. Smell and taste all gone. Upset stomach. Sore throat. 

Days 5 &amp; 6: All I was dealing with was the lack of taste and smell and a sore throat. 

Day 7: Began worrying about my blood oxygen saturation and BPM, but realized I was overreacting. Taste and smell began to slightly come back. Sore throat still there, but healing up. 

Day 8 (yesterday): Quite possibly the weirdest day thus far. Smell and taste went from being 65%-85% back I'd say, so that was a win. Sore throat was still there, but it still feels as if it's healing. But I felt this strange feeling all day. I wasn't sure if it was because I was psyching myself out or what, but I just felt odd. Around 7:00pm, I started having this odd feeling under my left armpit, like a slight pinch. I figured it was just a muscle or something; something not related to COVID. Then around 8:30-9:00, I could feel my heart beating rapidly. I have really bad anxiety, so I'm sure that also played a factor. But my resting heart rate was pushing 101-105, anywhere in that range. It felt as if my body was pulsating, so I was freaking out. I went to my bed, turned on some soft music, and my 101 resting heart rate dropped down to the low-70s and I've felt fine ever since. 

So, this brings up a couple of questions (if you've made it this far) 

1. I read that when your body is trying to fight off the virus, it's usual for your resting heart rate to go up. My normal is around mid-70s-mid-80s, so when it bounced up to 100-105, I was freaking out, which probably caused my anxiety to raise it up a bit more. Have any of y'all who tested positive dealt with an increase in your heart rate? I checked my blood sugar and oxygen saturation (both were great numbers), so I didn't know if COVID was causing my heart rate to go up, or if it was my anxiety in general.  
2. As far as taste and smell are concerned, do we know why yet people lose them/how long it takes to get them back? I read articles saying people usually don't get their senses back for 3-4 weeks, some longer. I'm getting mine back roughly a week later. Same thing happened with my mom and sister. They lost theirs and within a week, they had them back.

&gt; Days after anti-vaccination and far-right protesters disrupted operations at one of the nation’s largest COVID-19 vaccination sites at Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore on Tuesday said any such protests in the future would be met with quick arrests.

&gt; “Our action is to be immediate and swift in the sense of holding them accountable for that unlawful activity,” Moore said during a virtual meeting of the Police Commission in the morning.

&gt; Protests will be confined to an area near the stadium’s entrance in an effort to balance people’s 1st Amendment rights with the need to keep the vaccination site operating, Moore said. Officers, he added, will have no patience for a repeat of Saturday’s debacle, when maskless protesters roamed through the long queues of cars, intimidating people and stalling their entry into the stadium site.

&gt; It’s my expectation and direction that ... individuals will be arrested, they’ll be cited, and their actions will be caused to be ceased,” Moore said. “This going forward is a means of ensuring that the lines will stay open, that the vaccine sites will be unhindered.”

&gt; Commission President Eileen Decker welcomed the chief’s assurances, calling protesters’ attempts to block people from getting the vaccine “sad” and “tragic.”

&gt; “To interfere with people obtaining lifesaving vaccines is just beyond reprehensible,” Decker said.

What I’m saying is I think you and I would probably (based on the few posts I’ve seen) disagree on how to navigate society through this stage of the pandemic, particularly through the discovery of the new variants. You’ve spent a good chunk of your life in the field Biology, I’ve spend a good chunk of mine applying mathematics and statistics to quantitatively assess risk - and I don’t know if we’re doing that as honestly as we have with various other risks in the past. 

So, as I said I appreciate you bringing honest facts about the changes and added dangers of variants. I think it’s unfortunate that people blindly downvote because it’s more negative news. I wouldn’t downvote you simply for that. 

But I would assume that you don’t think there’s a point where additional risk is outweighed by other quality of life metrics. I do, and think there’s a point in time where the aggregate losses to these metrics is not worth the added risk introduced by the virus.... and I look forward to downvoting your *opinion* about this in future discussions (assuming my assumption about your stance is correct).",,,1612306085,{},glsk4mg,False,t3_lb4giq,False,False,t1_glsgyr6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lb4giq/vaccine_concerns_rise_as_variant_fuelling_uk/glsk4mg/,1612622440,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The first article is talking about different endemic coronaviruses, which, prior to covid, were more associated with the common cold. From a small sample of 86 coronavirus-positive cases, 12 got reinfected (14% reinfections rate) and “most” of those 12 were children with underdeveloped immune systems. In other words, some kids get colds multiple times a year. The applicability to the current coronavirus strain was unknown at the time of the article. 

The second article is a little more concerning with 10% of participants having a second positive covid test. The article makes no mention of the potential for false positives in the antibody test or the PCR test; but PCR is supposed to be pretty accurate so we can’t write them all off as false positives, unfortunatly. 

The good news from that study is that reinfected patients had shorter illnesses and higher instances of being asymptomatic compared to those infected for the first time. They also had lower antibody levels than individuals that didn’t get reinfected. I’m choosing to be positive, but this seems like some of the better news we could hope for when it comes to reinfections.  From this study we know 1) natural immunity seems to offer protection, at least at first, for most people; 2) when natural immunity doesn’t offer full protection, it still led to less serious cases; and 3) reinfections appears to be associated with antibody levels. Reinfected patients had fewer antibodies and patients that weren’t reinfected had higher antibody levels 

This last point is actually the best news of the bunch as we know vaccines trigger a stronger immune response than natural infections. So as more people get vaccinated, it wouldn’t be surprising to see rates of reinfections decline.  The real threat to all this is mutating strains of course. And we just don’t know yet. 

As I’ve said elsewhere, the three big questions with reinfections are 1) are the possible, 2) are they common, and 3) how serious is the issue. 

Number 1 has been satisfied. That’s a yes. Number 2 is seeming like a “not really,” but it’s too soon to tell.

Not really.  If the vaccine is ineffective on the variants, then the mRNA based vaccines will likely be altered to be effective.   Since the entire vaccine has been tested and there would be little change from the version already in use, an accelerated testing and validation schedule should be possible.

A working vaccine for the new variants could be usable within a month or two, depending on what's both fast and safe.  Then we'd start distributing it.   A few months later and everyone has it, then the virus stops infecting.  Hopefully reduced transmission due to the original vaccines giving the virus less chances to mutate would prevent any new variants being produced in that time.

Basically, this would cost us a few months more than would otherwise be the case and potentially a LOT of deaths due to spikes caused by the new variants.

They usually open slots for 1 week in advance. So, try to get your appointment online a few mins past midnight. Why? That's when they will be opening up appointments for the next week. So, you'll have a lot of slots available.  
Appointments are 15 mins apart. Once you get your appointment, you'll select the date for both first and second dose. Print everything out. Don't go with your phone and show them that. Print it out.   


When it's time for your shot, you'll be sent into a separate area of the pharmacy(inside) to certify the info you filled out online(to book your appointment). Everything must match. Once they give you the okay(it usually takes 30 seconds or less), they will take you to a separate area and give you the first shot. It'll most likely be Pfizer. After inoculation, they will make you sit for 15 mins to check for reactions. They will not let you leave until those 15 mins have passed. They will have nurses on-site. They'll give you a few papers that you will need to fill out for your next appointment, but that's okay. Tell them you already booked both appointments.

[],,ghostsarememories,,,[],,,,text,t2_3p7y2,False,False,[],"&gt; What they do prevent is those viruses replicating inside of you, causing you to be sick, and reduce or eliminate viral shedding (spreading the virus, essentially).

I would say that is mostly true for the Sars-CoV2 vaccines, though I'd exclude the ""or eliminate"" from your statement as being too definitive, as you later say yourself.

But since you were speaking about vaccines in general, there are a at least a couple of big counter examples to the blanket statement that vaccines ""prevent [...] those viruses replicating inside of you"".

The oral polio vaccine is an attenuated version of the virus, that replicates just fine in the gut, stimulates an immune response and results in plenty of (attenuated) viral shedding through faeces. Unfortunately, due to the overall success of the polio vaccination program, vaccine derived cases from mutated forms of attenuated polio account for a significant number of cases now.

Also, rotavirus vaccine is not sterilising but it has provided a significant reduction in hospital visits. Though it is also a live-attenuated virus vaccine.

&gt; That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t still act like you’re infectious after you’re vaccinated, as we don’t know how much the vaccine prevents further infection, but it almost certainly does prevent it to some substantial percentage at minimum. Estimates I’ve seen have been north of 65% reduction.

I don't think this contradicts my statement. Vaccinated people can get the disease. In most (&gt;90%?) vaccinated people, they will have no symptoms or greatly reduced symptoms but some will still get serious symptoms and vaccinated people can still spread the disease.

Now, a 65% reduction in spread (assuming that is likely to be scientifically confirmed) will probably eliminate a lot of the mass outbreaks with serious outcomes, especially in a vaccinated cohort. So in that sense, I am hugely optimistic about the likely effects of a widespread vaccination campaign, I'm just cautious until we have more definitive data.",,,1612357857,{},gluuyqm,False,t3_lb2pxi,False,False,t1_glug9sf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lb2pxi/student_19_wakes_from_11month_coma_with_no/gluuyqm/,1612662913,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You will be surprised at the amount and extent of protocol deviations and ethics violations in other countries, as well to an extent in the US.

FDA has a lot more protections and regulations compared to other countries. 

And Europe is not one entity when it comes to drugs. You will be surprised to see what is approved and banned in Ukraine, as compared to Germany or UK. You will be surprised what is OTC in Netherlands and what is not in the neighboring countries. Even the healthcare systems are not the same across the EU, infact the medicine training standards are not exactly uniform across Europe either. 

So no, depending upon which country you live in, you may not have the same rigor and ethics of drug trials. Not because you don't care, but because you may not necessarily have the logistics.  

And you are wrong about certain countries in EU accepting results for drugs/devices/vaccinations just cause they were approved or trialed in the US. Several drugs/devices banned in the US are allowed in some countries in the EU, some drugs/devices banned in EU countries are approved to be sold in the US. You are obviously not familiar with this. 

&gt;You know that ethics information, information on how EXACTLY the trials were run etc. are all included in the study yes? 

Yes ofcourse I am aware of that having created so many. However, how do I access reports that shows they were IMPLEMENTED and CONDUCTED exactly the way they should be? Usually this is presented in the publications, but we won't have access to the complete reports. For example, the oxford vaccine and the fumbling in dosage administration. It was a big deal cause there is a spotlight on vaccine trials, hence we knew about this fumbling. Something so basic as ensuring the right dosage was administered was messed up, it brings the other protocol conduction into questioning. And within the scientific community, this was noticed.

Every person arriving in the US should be required to test negative twice for Covid-19 at maximum 36 hours before their travel begins. The first test should be a PCR test, which can show whether a person has an active infection. The second should be an IgM antibody test, which can show whether a person was recently infected and may still be contagious. Some travelers who were recently vaccinated may have a negative PCR test result but a positive antibody test due to the vaccine and not a recent infection. In these cases, an additional antibody test directed at proteins not targeted by the current vaccines would be required. 

&gt;Upon arrival in the US, all travelers should be tested again with a rapid antigen test or PCR test. We know already that these tests miss cases anywhere from 20% to 100% of the time, depending on when during the course of an infection they’re administered. This means that even if a traveler tests negative before travel and upon arrival, they should still be required to isolate themselves for a minimum of two weeks in a controlled facility. We’re not talking about vague promises to head directly home and stay there, we’re talking about supervised isolation where temperatures are monitored, tests are administered, and those who fall ill are treated and cared for without risking the further spread of disease.

&gt; effective antivirals that can intervene during an active infection, especially at the initial stages of the disease, are very much needed, even with the availability of vaccines. Given the emergence of coronavirus mutants, which may undermine vaccines currently in use and under development, and other major respiratory viruses co-circulating in populations, effective antivirals that do not discriminate between virus types are all the more necessary to manage current and future pandemics. The enormous potential practical benefits of TG over current antivirals can be envisaged in general practice, if such an orally administered broad-spectrum antiviral could be dispensed for
early intervention without the need to establish a specific respiratory virus diagnosis; such an antiviral will fulfil an integral role with vaccines in reducing the public health burden of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. 

So this is not a vaccine, but rather it is envisaged as a treatment that would be given at the onset of *any* respiratory virus symptoms, which will shorten or cure the infection.

This time there's at least a legitimate public health reason to do these things; right now those sacrifices can mean life or death for hundreds of thousands of people, so if we've been screwed before (and probably will be again) for much less justifiable reasons, we might as well do the right thing this time and save those lives.",,,1612372537,{},glvrw6v,False,t3_lbiqne,False,True,t1_glv96p0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbiqne/daily_discussion_thread_february_03_2021/glvrw6v/,1612680302,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;Important considerations that I think are largely missed in mainstream media:  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Not all vaccines are the same. In fact, they are quite different. This is NOT evidence that we can delay Moderna or Pfizer doses  
&gt;  
&gt;\-There were key analyses NOT included in the paper, particularly age. In fact, it looks like they weren’t included in this delayed dose at all (see Figure). It’s not clear whether a delayed dose is generalizable to older adults (55+ years). This is incredibly important to know, as older folks have less neutralizing antibodies.  
&gt;  
&gt;\-It’s obvious that the two groups (those that received a delayed booster vs. those that did not have delayed booster) were VERY different in terms of age, sex, and occupation. We also know that those in the LD/SD group were VERY different in terms of age (younger) compared to those in the SD/SD group. We NEED to take this into account (which the study didn’t do) to imply causality. In other words, it’s not clear whether the increase in efficacy or decrease in transmission was actually from the delayed dose, the low dose, or because of demographics.  
&gt;  
&gt;\-This study did not report variants. And did not report whether delaying a second dose adds pressure on the virus to mutate even more  
&gt;  
&gt;Bottom line: (And this is all my humble scientific opinion; take it or leave it) This data is messy. And it’s really hard to parse together the story in an accurate way. It looks like a delayed dose of AZ is “okay”. We aren’t necessarily surprised by this. But, I don’t think this study provides enough data to make sweeping policy changes (like delaying a second dose for the older population).

The reason that you're asking this question (answer is in tl;dr) is that there was a criminal failure of the United States Federal Government to effectively communicate that there might be a difference between a mask and a dish towel. 

This has been going on since at least March 5, 2020 when VP and Dr. Birx [completely misrepresented](https://www.c-span.org/video/?470086-101/vice-president-pence-meets-3m-executives) documents which 3M provided their team, with international mask equivalencies. It was one of her first speeches.
 [PDF](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1791500O/comparison-ffp2-kn95-n95-filtering-facepiece-respirator-classes-tb.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwibwJe78szuAhXzFVkFHbFGDJYQFjAAegQIARAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw2z4TC1hPHN24_dcVwQNC1V).

[THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND REPIRATORY PROTECTION](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1819804O/hcbg-msd-white-paper-rpds-and-covid-19.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi46vr28szuAhX-FVkFHWzdC1UQFjAKegQIEhAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0HaH11I-eH9tAbnNqrDOQO) is a white paper which dates to March 2020, written by a 3M scientist (Gaert Driessen, who usually publishes in his native Dutch) for a uniquely English audience. It sums up masks in blunt terms: In pandemic circumstances there are certainly methods of masking which might be less than optimal, but we're in a pandemic. Wear an N95 equivalent in healthcare settings (if they’re  available) at all possible times. 

I'm nearly *positive* that this exact document was presented to the Coronavirus Task Force. It's what Birx summed up as:

&gt;So, wearing this as a healthy person will not protect you. But a sick person wearing this mask will help protect others from getting infected.

....

&gt;And so really understanding why healthcare providers need these masks and that the average American purchasing these masks will do nothing for them. But if you are sick, you should wear one.

The Administration even had their own science on effective masks, and still do:

Immediately after the FDA gave a temporary import authorization for KN95 masks, the CDC actually implemented a testing protocol to certify which devices met at least a filtration standard. This list was available by April: [Appendix A: Authorized Imported, Non-NIOSH Approved Respirators Manufactured in China (Updated with Administrative Changes or Respirator Model Removals: October 15, 2020.)](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-euas).

The full results are available under the [International Assessment (Respirator) Results – Not NIOSH-approved](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/respirators/testing/NonNIOSHresults.html)
 list, which has been updated regularly for 10 months.

There is even a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Masks4All/) for this.

The product of almost a year of anti-mask sentiment from Federal Government ends with a global population which doesn't know what an effective mask is, much less where to find it.

Tl;dr: My original response: Legitimate KN95 and KF94 masks are $12/10pk shipped. They have been available since ~~May~~* April. On Black Friday they dropped under a dollar apiece. The head of the federal government didn't want the public to know this, and effectively censored it.

Edit: First available in the first week of April 2020, I just checked my receipt. In April they were closer to $2.50/mask but this dropped rapidly to ~$1.00, less in bulk.",,,1612332099,{},gltzans,True,t3_lbctzo,False,True,t1_glteige,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbctzo/its_time_for_a_federal_mask_standard_washington/gltzans/,1612647023,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

We also instituted the ‘butt rub’—- stand back to back with people. Reality is that humans need human contact, and there are a lot of studies on this among the elderly and infants. I have some clients where we just stand back to back touching. They live alone, and not getting any physical contact is actually very hard on them, but you don’t want to get people sick.   


Be kind- it’s really not that hard. Wash your hands, wear a mask, keep social distance... but if some one really needs a hug,  you can stand back to back with them and let them not feel that alone... because that’s  important too. I call it ‘the Covid butt rUN’ because it makes it funny, but it’s actually been really important to some of my friends and clients. I’m lucky- I have family and a dog, but some people don’t, and they feel really alone in a time where it’s hard for anyone to reach out. For some, a handshake or a pat on the back is there only human to human contact, and those are now gone. No more casual encounters at the bar... we all have different standards/ needs- but try to reach out to those you see feeling alone in whatever way you feel comfortable- and that might mean just sending a hand written note.   


When we were shut down, I made a list of elderly clients/ single friends that I would check in with- just so they knew someone cared. It took a few minutes out of my day ( of not working)  so that they didn’t feel alone in the universe.

 It’s also a good opportunity to be grateful for the people you do have in your life. - and sometimes it was heartbreaking here in S Florida. One lady I checked in with, her husband broke his hip walking the dog, and crawled to the elevator and apartment to get home- literally crawled, to get the dog home. She called for an ambulance when he came in, and wasn’t able to see him for six weeks. There was very little I could do for her- but I could call and give her a human to talk to. 50 yrs married, and not being able to sit by your partners side? My heart broke- but he got better, and they are both okay (the dog ended up fucking dying though- ugh!!!).  Just saying, Be Kind when you can- it helps our whole world. Some people don’t know how to order groceries delivered or Uber- take a few minutes, help someone when you can. It helps all of us- don’t we all (mostly) want a kinder world?   


 There are way more decent people than bad people- and that’s just reality. Our brains put a ‘red alert’ on anti-social behavior, that’s why it gets attention. 99% of the people driving along side you in traffic are being responsible and considerate, but your brain highlights the one that is a danger- the guy that cuts you off, speeds past, etc.. because our brains are wired to identify a danger/!out of the ordinary. We ignore all the people who are polite and pay attention to the one lady that was rude because that one person is an anomaly, and that makes her dangerous. 

Do your own experiment, pick drivers or customers or any group you are in on a daily basi, and count the number of people that actively offend you vs the number that are just being normal and polite. They drive the speed limit, don’t cut in line, say please and thank you- actively observe, and make st of us are basically nice. We have our opinions, but we aren’t asses.   


Our brains just pay attention to the asses because they are perceived as a danger- an anomaly. I think all of our media is fucking with our perception of realit. I don’t think it is some grand conspiracy- I think it’s just wiring. Flashy lights get our brain attention. Loud voices get our brain attention. Vegas works for a reason/ slot machines/ TVs/ flashy lights. So... we have to acknowledge this and mitigate to overcome all our wonderful technologies (which also offer us great advantages).   


We have to figure out how to overcome our ‘danger’ response and figure out how to be better people. I haven’t quite done it, I’m just pointing out the problem. I respond to the same stuff- but I try to remind myself that I am. There is no perfect, there is only ‘better’. My instinct is to be ‘perfect’ and I do a mantra of ‘better’. one of my friends who works with OSHA has a mantra of ‘constant improvement’ that I find helpful. It’s a different way of thinking fir me. I don’t have to be perfect, I just have to be improving.  Have I learned something, found a better way, than six months ago? Okay then, I’m meeting my goal- constant improvement.  what might have seemed a great idae yesterday, doesn’t meet our needs today- so we adapt. And if it changes tomorro, we adapt. We keep some things constant - the greater good and being Kind.

Some of those countries used internal lockdowns, some didn't, but they all used government power to enforce mitigation protocols and it worked.

**Canine coronavirus disease**, known as **CCoV**, is a highly infectious intestinal infection in dogs, especially puppies. Canine coronavirus is usually short-lived but may cause considerable abdominal discomfort for a few days in infected dogs. The virus is from the *Coronaviridae* family. The virus gets its name from the fact that when viewed from above under an electron microscope, the virus has a ring of projections that appear like a coronet, or a small crown made of ornaments fixed on a metal ring. There are many types of coronavirus, each affecting different animal species, including humans.

**Feline Coronavirus (FCoV)** is a common viral infection in cats. It generally causes asymptomatic infection, but can cause mild diarrhea. As yet poorly understood changes in the virus can give rise to mutants that lead to the development of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).  Most cats infected with a FCoV eliminate virus following infection, but some cats may develop a persistent infection. These cats are generally asymptomatic, can shed large amounts of virus in feces, and serve as a continual source of infection for other cats in the environment. Continual circulation of FCoV within a cat population may increase the chance that a virulent FIP strain might emerge.  While the pathogenesis of FIP is poorly understood, it is now believed that detection and removal of persistently infected and shedding cats in a multi-cat household can reduce the risk of FIP emergence within that population.",,,1612372245,{},glvr5vy,False,t3_lbr8wj,False,True,t3_lbr8wj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbr8wj/new_study_finds_pets_may_need_to_get_coronavirus/glvr5vy/,1612679925,2,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
