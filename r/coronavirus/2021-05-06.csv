In the US, the daily shower tends to start around puberty and becomes lifelong. But have you ever stopped to ask yourself why?

Perhaps your answer is: ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs healthier than showering less often.‚Äù ***Think again. For many ‚Äî perhaps most ‚Äî the daily shower is more about habit and societal norms than health. Perhaps that‚Äôs why the frequency of bathing or showering varies so much from country to country.***

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/showering-daily-is-it-necessary-2019062617193](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/showering-daily-is-it-necessary-2019062617193)

What are the health ***impacts*** of showering (or bathing) every day?

Normal, healthy skin maintains a layer of oil and a balance of ‚Äúgood‚Äù bacteria and other microorganisms. Washing and scrubbing removes these, especially if the water is hot. As a result:

* Skin may become [dry](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-moisturize-your-skin), irritated, or itchy.
* Dry, cracked skin may allow bacteria and allergens to breach the barrier skin is supposed to provide, allowing skin infections and allergic reactions to occur.
* Antibacterial soaps can actually kill off normal bacteria. This upsets the balance of microorganisms on the skin and encourages the emergence of hardier, less friendly organisms that are more resistant to antibiotics.
* Our immune systems need a certain amount of stimulation by normal microorganisms, dirt, and other environmental exposures in order to create protective antibodies and ‚Äúimmune memory.‚Äù This is one reason why some pediatricians and dermatologists recommend against daily baths for kids. Frequent baths or showers throughout a lifetime may reduce the ability of the immune system to do its job.

Sebaceous glands are part of the body's [integumentary system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integumentary_system) and serve to protect the body against microorganisms. Sebaceous glands secrete acids that form the [acid mantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_mantle).

But in that regard I agree, in the US it just does not seem to work out great in terms of deaths for some reason. I am from the Netherlands, we had very high amount of cases around 160,000 cases per day if it were the US) with a high positivity rate (&gt;10%) and very high amount of currently infectious people (&gt;1 in 100 people currently infected). But it has on average around 350 deaths per day if it were the US over the lest 7 days, with even reporting 60 deaths (if it were the US) some days ago. And there is basically no excess mortality the last months.

This means our level of infections are the highest they have ever been, daily cases are similar to our early January/Winter peak and late October/Autumn peak, but deaths have never been lower since early October/September. This means current CFR is around 0.2% (overall CFR is 1.2%).

For some reason infections in the US are very low, but their deaths are staying relatively high. Especially compared to the Netherlands, which has relatively very high cases but low deaths compared to the US (this was not the case before, they were quite similar). What makes this difference even more extreme, is that the Netherlands is 1 to 2 months behind the US in terms of vaccinations (they will only reach 85% of the adult population at least partially vaccinated and ‚Öî fully vaccinated by the start of July). With only 34% at least partially vaccinated and 9% fully vaccinated currently (of the adult population). This means the US should see a greater vaccination effect for longer by now compared to the Netherlands both in terms of cases and deaths, but until now, this could only be seen in terms of infections, but not the deaths (again, compared to the Netherlands).",,,1620345278,{},gx7qr05,False,t3_n6hkz2,False,True,t1_gx7o3do,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6hkz2/germany_lets_the_vaccinated_have_a_bit_more_fun/gx7qr05/,1620400027,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Von der Leyen, a physician, had developed a productive relationship with Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla, who seemed more capable than AstraZeneca‚Äôs leaders of expanding production capacity and meeting new and faster delivery targets, officials said.

And Thierry Breton, the top European Commission official in charge of Europe‚Äôs internal market and a former French finance minister and industrialist, started a whistle-stop tour of the continent‚Äôs 53 vaccine factories, speaking to workers on the production floor and to leaders of the factories about what they needed to sort out snags and speed doses.

When he was tasked in early February with overseeing the vaccine production effort, his team had little insight into what was happening with the complex process needed to make vaccines from start to finish.

‚ÄúThere was not really a good overview of the numbers, of where are the factories, of what is the capacity of the factories,‚Äù said one European official familiar with the situation, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door process. Breton mapped out the process, and realized that there was a good chance that Europe already had the capacity to meet the 70 percent target in July, the official said.

Companies have gone to him with issues as basic as a shortage of plastic bags used in bioreactors, devices that are crucial for making the substances needed for the vaccines. He found another supplier and fixed the bottleneck, the official said.

Countries have also fine-tuned their strategies, making doses easier to come by. Germany, for instance, has allowed family doctors to administer vaccines, meaning people are no longer obliged to go to government-run vaccine centers. Italy, meantime, under new Prime Minister Mario Draghi, appointed a military logistics specialist, General Francesco Figliuolo, to overhaul the rollout.

Figliuolo has helped create some 1,000 new vaccination centers, nearly doubling Italy‚Äôs total. He has worked with the country‚Äôs most populous region, Lombardy, on a new vaccine reservations portal, after the region‚Äôs initial system kept crashing, leading in a few instances to empty vaccination centers. The general, in March, set a goal for Italy to administer 500,000 doses per day ‚Äî something that seemed like a long shot at the time, when the nation was administering some 200,000 daily jabs.

Two days over the past week, Italy exceeded 500,000 doses. It has averaged 442,000¬†daily doses in the latest week.

Figliuolo, in a telephone interview, described his role as, ‚Äúbasically, fine-tuning the vaccination machine.‚Äù

‚ÄúBy June, we are counting on having such an inflow that we‚Äôll further increase the speed of the machine,‚Äù he said.",,,1620380523,{},gx97hy5,True,t3_n6uprg,False,False,t1_gx97hnh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6uprg/europes_vaccine_campaign_is_accelerating_it/gx97hy5/,1620430918,17,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
[],,a2theaj,,,[],,,,text,t2_5g5zr3wf,False,False,[],"ROME ‚Äî After months of supply shortages and embarrassing blunders, Europe's coronavirus vaccine campaign is at last sprinting ahead, renewing hopes that the continent might meet its initial inoculation goals and tame the virus even while relaxing restrictions.

Across the European Union, countries are touting new daily vaccination records. Supply concerns have eased. The E.U. is now administering roughly the same number of daily per capita doses as the United States, trending up while America trends down.

Some European countries have helped their cause by sorting out logistical problems or enlisting family doctors and pharmacists to administer shots. But the bloc, more broadly, owes its turnaround to a deepened reliance on Pfizer-BioNTech, which has ramped up vaccine production ‚Äî beyond what was initially expected ‚Äî as other options have faltered or come too slowly.

Mostly using Pfizer, France‚Äôs pace of daily doses has increased 60 percent over the past month. Italy has accelerated by 90 percent, Germany by 145 percent.

While the United States has doses widely available to any adults who want them ‚Äî and is struggling to find takers ‚Äî many people in the E.U. are not yet eligible. But appointments are starting to open up in Europe, even for younger cohorts.

E.U. officials, noting President Biden‚Äôs target of getting at least one dose to [70 percent of U.S. adults by July 4](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-aims-to-vaccinate-70percent-of-american-adults-by-july-4/2021/05/05/b17c1738-ad60-11eb-82c1-896aca955bb9_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_10), say that by midsummer Europeans and Americans will be in roughly the same situation.

‚ÄúThe U.S. has a similar goal, and this shows how much our vaccination campaigns are aligned by now,‚Äù said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The E.U. has so far administered at least one dose to 26 percent of its total population, compared with 45 percent in the United States, 52 percent in Britain and 60 percent in Israel.

[*E.U. proposal would allow vaccinated American tourists by the end of June*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/eu-vaccine-travel-passports/2021/05/03/4fc0281c-a8f2-11eb-a8a7-5f45ddcdf364_story.html?itid=lk_readmore_manual_14)

The E.U. is about seven weeks behind the United States on doses, adjusted for population size.

But even as the E.U. campaign takes off, the costs of the slow start are being felt. A bruising third wave struck the continent toward the end of winter, leading to scores of preventable deaths among the uninoculated elderly. Lockdowns caused the E.U.‚Äôs economy to [contract](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europes-economy-shrinks-amid-slow-vaccine-rollouts-and-lockdowns/2021/04/30/36e20fa4-a9ba-11eb-a8a7-5f45ddcdf364_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_17) in the first three months of the year. All the while, the bloc‚Äôs leaders were warring with [AstraZeneca](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/astrazeneca-vaccine-challenges-europe-pandemic/2021/03/21/d8568076-88f0-11eb-8a67-f314e5fcf88d_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_17), the drugmaker that was falling short of delivery pledges, whose vaccine had initially been counted on to play a primary role in the campaign.

‚ÄúObviously, it was painful for E.U. leaders in January and February,‚Äù said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. ‚ÄúThere was an acute shortage, while the countries they like to compare themselves with didn‚Äôt have that problem. But now, it has changed. The scale-up of production in the E.U. has been extremely rapid.‚Äù

Pfizer has said it will be delivering 250 million doses in the second quarter of the year, a fourfold increase from the first three months. Italy, for instance, received 6.9 million doses of Pfizer in April, compared with 8.7 million doses during the previous three months combined.

The E.U. expects supplies to be boosted further as additional vaccines start to come online. After a delay to assess concerns about rare blood clots, the rollout of Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs one-shot vaccine is getting underway in Europe.

Another vaccine, made by the German company CureVac, could soon be approved, depending on the imminent results of a late-stage clinical trial. The CureVac vaccine is similar to those produced by Pfizer and Moderna, in that it uses mRNA technology.

The E.U. has scrambled to make up for lost time after an approach characterized by more caution and less urgency than that of the United States.

While the United States‚Äô Operation Warp Speed spared little expense to help companies build factories and expand their production capacity at an early stage last year, the E.U. behaved more like an ordinary customer in early vaccine negotiations, haggling with drug companies over the price of doses and leaving it up to the drugmakers to figure out how to produce the promised supplies.

The E.U. team that negotiated the deals on behalf of the 27-nation bloc had no experience with the issue, since health issues have previously been the responsibility of individual countries. And it was plagued by a mix of demands from rich countries, such as Germany, that wanted to go big with the more expensive, newer-technology Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and poorer ones such as Bulgaria, for which cost was a major issue and which preferred AstraZeneca‚Äôs cheaper and easier-to-store doses.

European policymakers also did not fully realize the extent to which barriers to vaccine exports out of the United States, Britain and India would put pressure on E.U. production to supply the world, leaving fewer doses to supply the Europeans themselves.

The result was that as Britain, the United States and a handful of other countries raced ahead with vaccinations starting in December, the E.U. badly lagged behind. At the last minute, AstraZeneca also said it would not be able to deliver nearly as many doses of its vaccine as it had promised, further slowing the E.U. effort.

Politicians in every country faced down furious citizens.

In its report, German daily Die Welt said the reason for Paris‚Äô hesitation was unclear, but diplomats had speculated that it might want French companies to play a bigger part in vaccine production.

At recent meetings of European Union ministers about vaccine orders, French representatives held up decision-making by posing technical questions and requests for clarifications, Die Welt reported.

Asked about the report, a spokesman for France‚Äôs Industry Ministry told Reuters: ‚ÄúContrary to what has been reported, France has officially backed the (vaccine) contract within the formal European Commission framework.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are asking common sense questions with regard to the public health challenges we are facing.‚Äù

Due to massive global demand for booster doses as well as vaccines for young people, EU governments fear that they may be too late and lose out on the order.

‚ÄúThat would be a disaster for which France would be responsible,‚Äù Die Welt quoted one diplomat as saying.

Three of the five new cases involved migrant workers from the Philippines. Two of them are men in their 30s, with one of them set to work as a crew member on a boat and the other as a fishing worker. The third is a Filipina in her 20s.

A total of 197 contacts of the three people have been identified and instructed to follow self-health management protocols, according to the CECC's press release.

The fourth and the fifth cases are Taiwanese nationals. One is a man in his 40s who went to India to work in February and returned on April 23. The other is a woman in her 20s who flew back to Taiwan on April 23 from the U.K.

No contacts of the two people have been identified, the CECC said.

To date, Taiwan has recorded 1,178 cases of COVID-19, 1,033 of which have been classified as imported. Of the total, 1,077 have recovered, 12 have died, and 89 are in the hospital, according to the latest CECC statistics.
Globally, COVID-19 has infected over 155 million people in 193 countries and regions, with more than 3.26 million fatalities, CECC figures show.

Non-IP Constraints on Vaccine Supply:

&gt;I‚Äôve gone over these other problems before, but here‚Äôs a brief summary of those ‚Äì not in any order, because it‚Äôs difficult to rank them and those ranks change. An obvious first problem is hardware: you need specific sorts of cell culture tanks for the adenovirus vaccines, and the right kind of filtration apparatus for both the mRNA and adenovirus ones. You also need specialized mixing equipment for the formation of the mRNA lipid nanoparticles. A good proportion of the world‚Äôs supply of such hardware is already producing the vaccines, to the best of my knowledge. Second, you need some key consumable equipment to go along with the hardware. Cell culture bags have been a limiting step for the Novavax subunit vaccine, as have the actual filtration membranes needed for it and others. These are not in short supply because of patents, and waiving vaccine patents will not make them appear. Third, you need some key reagents. Among others, there‚Äôs an ‚Äúend-capping‚Äù enzyme that has been a supply constraint, and there are the lipids needed for the mRNA nanoparticles, for those two vaccines. Those lipids are indeed proprietary, but their synthesis is also subject to physical constraints that have nothing to do with patent rights, such as the availability of the ultimate starting materials. Supplies have been increasing via the tried and true method of offering people money to make more, but switching over equipment and getting the synthesis to work within acceptable QC is not as fast a process as you might imagine. Fourth, for all these processes, there is a shortage of actual people to make the tech transfer work. For most reasonably complicated processes, it helps a great deal to have experienced people come out and troubleshoot, because the number of tiny things that can go wrong is not easy to quantify. Moderna, for one, has said that a limiting factor in their tech-transfer efforts is that they simply do not have enough trained people to go around. And keep in mind that these all have to do with producing a stream of liquid vaccine solution ‚Äì but you need what the industry calls ‚Äúfill-and-finish‚Äù capacity to deal with it after that. Filling and capping sterile vials for injection is a specialized business and the great majority of large-scale capacity is already being used for the existing vaccines. Time and money will fix that, and has been, but waiving vaccine patents won‚Äôt.",,,1620405656,{},gxai20t,False,t3_n6aimv,False,True,t3_n6aimv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6aimv/waiving_ip/gxai20t/,1620455814,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Some institutions are already requiring vaccination, so I don't think there's any legal basis for what you're saying here.

Again.  Math..

How can you vaccinate 82% of adult population by June, when &gt;30% of the adult population is under 35, and by your quote earlier, they won't  even be open to be vaccinated yet.

Even if you have 100% compliance, you'll be at &lt;70%.

Or is your math 82% of *ELIGIBLE* people?  In which case, you aren't comparing apples to apples.

That's what I said won't happen. Eligibility will just keep expanding by age group until it reaches the youngest. It opened up to people aged 56 here and each day another year group will be until it reaches 50, when they'll focus on getting the vast majority of them vaccinated and then they'll move on to the next cohort. 

It depends on the country. Many in Eastern Europe have opened up availability to most of the population because hesitancy is high, but most of the west is still following an age based program which is limited by supply.

You also need specialized mixing equipment for the formation of the mRNA lipid nanoparticles. A good proportion of the world‚Äôs supply of such hardware is already producing the vaccines, to the best of my knowledge. Second, you need some key consumable equipment to go along with the hardware. Cell culture bags have been a limiting step for the Novavax subunit vaccine, as have the actual filtration membranes needed for it and others. These are not in short supply because of patents, and waiving vaccine patents will not make them appear. Third, you need some key reagents. Among others, there‚Äôs an ‚Äúend-capping‚Äù enzyme that has been a supply constraint, and there are the lipids needed for the mRNA nanoparticles, for those two vaccines. Those lipids are indeed proprietary, but their synthesis is also subject to physical constraints that have nothing to do with patent rights, such as the availability of the ultimate starting materials.

First - I think some of what he said was taken out of context. He discusses the summer as looking ""very good"", and that's possible, surely, if we are able to get enough people vaccinated. What he doesn't say is *when*, exactly.

Secondly, he's on the board of Pfizer and a new testing company. One might infer that he has a lot to gain by taking such an aggressive approach.

Thirdly, he is in no position to dictate to the CDC. He is no longer in charge of the FDA, and even if he was, the FDA does not make those decisions. 

So what do we have? I think it is a statement that he believes will advocate for more vaccinations. That's good; but a mistake in tactics when you're on the board of the company thst makes the vaccine. It may also raise the price of the stock...?

Under-40s offered alternative coronavirus vaccines to AstraZeneca

Chris Smyth, Whitehall Editor
Thursday May 06 2021, 10.00pm, The Times

All under-40s will be offered an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine as falling Covid-19 infection rates makes the risk of blood clots loom larger.

There are no new safety concerns over the Oxford vaccine but the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) will issue ‚Äúprecautionary‚Äù advice today that those in their thirties should be offered other jabs as success against the pandemic reduces their risk from Covid-19.

Supplies of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna can make up the bulk of remaining first doses, with AstraZeneca largely being used to complete second doses for older people, sources say.

More younger people may be persuaded to get vaccinated if the fear of side effects is removed. Scientists believe that maximising take-up is worth the risk of delaying the end of vaccination by a few weeks, but the government insists that it is on track to offer all adults a jab by the end of July.

Last month the JCVI said that the under-30s should be offered alternatives to AstraZeneca because of evidence that it may cause a rare type of blood clot, with a risk of dying of about one in a million. The committee will extend the offer of a different vaccine to all 4.5 million people aged 30-39. It is hoped to start this month, and the AstraZeneca jab will still be on offer if the alternative is a long wait.

For people over 30 the risk from Covid-19 is still higher than the risk of clots, but the gap is narrowing as infection rates fall. Yesterday 2,613 cases were reported, down 10 per cent in a week.

The Department of Health said the medicines regulator, the MHRA and the JCVI considered the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine ‚Äúoutweigh the risks for the vast majority of adults‚Äù.",,,1620339898,{},gx7fotb,True,t3_n6jgid,False,True,t3_n6jgid,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6jgid/under40s_offered_alternative_coronavirus_vaccines/gx7fotb/,1620393419,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I had every symptom. Started with scratchy throat and dull headache. Progressed to severe body aches , fever, chills, night sweats,and then eventually the poor breathing. My o2 meter would briefly tank to the upper 70s/low 80s after climbing a flight of stairs. And my lungs situation attracted bacterial pneumonia for good measure, causing blood in my sputum. My heart rate at night normally at 55/60 would go down to the very low 40s.

I had asked my doctor when it was over if I would have it rough each time and expect a ‚Äúcytokine storm‚Äù whenever I catch it.

I think the strict lockdown was one of the major reason that helped control the peak to around 100k. Without it we may had almost 250-300k cases and our hospitals would've collapsed.

But on other side lockdown was implemented hastily which led to a lot of daily wage workers being stuck without income causing many deaths among them. It also devastated the economy.

This is I believe why central govt is hesitant to implement full lockdown this time since they were highly criticized for the implementation last time and they still don't have any proper infrastructure in place to take care of daily wage workers during lockdown.

Paper 1 is not peer reviewed yet. But looking at this, it seems like paper 1 is discussing a strategy in which the elderly are still regularly vaccinated first while giving the young smaller doses earlier. Thus this is not the young first elderly later strategy at all, not even close.

&gt;The model predicts that, in the absence of vaccination, 72‚Äâ000 deaths (95% credible interval 40‚Äâ000‚Äì122‚Äâ000) would occur in Ontario from Jan 1, 2021, to March 14, 2025, and at a vaccination rate of 1¬∑5% of the population per week, the oldest-first strategy would reduce COVID-19 mortality by 90¬∑8% on average (followed by 89¬∑5% in the uniform, 88¬∑9% in the contact-based, and 88¬∑2% in the youngest-first strategies). 60‚Äâ000 deaths (31‚Äâ000‚Äì108‚Äâ000) would occur from Sept 1, 2021, to March 14, 2025, in the absence of vaccination, and the contact-based strategy would reduce COVID-19 mortality by 92¬∑6% on average (followed by 92¬∑1% in the uniform, 91¬∑0% in the oldest-first, and 88¬∑3% in the youngest-first strategies) at a vaccination rate of 1¬∑5% of the population per week.

Paper 2 literally shows that vaccinating the elderly first is the superior method and youth first the worst for now. Still, the modelled deaths here seem to be modeled over 4 years, what would be the use of that. And the last comparison starts September 1st and looks over 3-4 years. By then everyone should be fully vaccinated for a while anyways, so what does it matter (in Ontario anyways)?

&gt;About 100,000 people received the vaccine against covid-19 on Thursday and this Friday the same number of doses should be administered, bringing forward by one week this target set by the vaccination plan task force.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""On yesterday (Thursday) were administered about 100 thousand vaccines, a number that should also register today, thus anticipating the initial expectation in about a week,"" said the structure that coordinates the logistics of vaccination in Portugal in information sent to PUBLICO.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;According to the task force led by Vice-Admiral Gouveia e Melo, this result of vaccinating 100,000 people per day ""was only possible with the implementation of the self-scheduling process, which allowed to significantly increase the rate of vaccination, despite some setbacks in the process"".  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;On 23 April, the portal for self-scheduling for vaccination went live and by the beginning of this week, it had registered around 206,000 entries for the vaccination against covid-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;With the entry of the second phase of the vaccination plan and a greater availability of vaccines by the pharmaceutical companies suppliers, the vaccination rate is increasing significantly, with the task force forecasting that a daily average of 100,000 inoculations would be reached, corresponding to 1% of the population, in the coming weeks, a goal that has already been achieved.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The task force also advanced that Portugal reached on Thursday the mark of one million people with the complete vaccination with the second dose or with the inoculation with the Janssen vaccine, which corresponds to more than 10% of the Portuguese population.  
&gt;  
&gt;

She believes covid is real and takes safety precautions like masks and social distancing, almost obsessively so in some instances (she has OCD). 
She does not believe vaccines cause autism, and is annoyed to be lumped in with people who believe the fringier conspiracy theories.

BUT:
She does not trust ‚Äúthe media‚Äù to report what she consider to be the full story of vaccines.
She believes pharmaceutical companies are greedy and do not have our best interests at heart (I tend to agree, I just don‚Äôt think that means vaccines are dangerous)
She trusts things that are ‚Äúnatural‚Äù - and I think this would include viruses- over ‚Äúchemicals‚Äù. So to her, a vaccine could indeed be scarier than a virus.
Because there have been no long term studies on the covid vaccines for obvious reasons, it leaves them as a huge, enormous question mark of unknown-ness which to her is unquantifiable.

I think we‚Äôre about 1-2 months away from if not already achieving a good level of immunity in the majority of localities with the exception of some states in the south and west. Not herd immunity but probably enough to keep cases at bay and start opening up significantly. But the fact are vaccines have slowed down drastically and we‚Äôre probably anywhere from 3-4 months away from 60 percent vaccine uptake nationally. We‚Äôll see that threshold and have already seen that threshold crossed in a lot of high uptake states. But you have states in the sub to low 40‚Äôs that basically have stopped vaccinating new people. Seems unlikely that these states will ever hit 60 even with kids being vaccinated and will drag down the national average for several months. Fortunately I don‚Äôt live in those states and they seem to be more rural states that were not hit as bad by covid. So I think you take me saying we won‚Äôt hit 60 percent nationally for several months as me saying I don‚Äôt think we are ready to open up or that we should be worried about covid which I‚Äôm not. I think we should be getting rid of most restrictions in the next month or two especially once a state hits 50-60 percent of the population fully vaccinated. But the data doesn‚Äôt lie. At the current pace it will take two months to reach 60 percent nationally and that rate is only likely to slow down over time which means even if we ramp up a little when 12-16 qualify in a month or 2-11 qualify next September it will still take probably more than 3-4 months to hit that national average of 60 percent.

Is it impossible to make contracts with these pharmaceutical companies to set up additional production facilities and put in the contract they have to work together with local capable producers? What is the need to give the IP if the pharmaceutical can facilitate additional production as well. I just have the feeling it is just for the sake to score points to get rid of the IP because it is a ""win"" against ""big pharma"".

Nothing wrong with releasing the IP, but what is exactly the problem with making a contract with and buying from the pharmaceutical company that developed the vaccine directly and making sure they contract as many local producers as possible to get the vaccine as early as possible? Janssen and AstraZeneca are not even selling their vaccines for profit.

There is just way too much focus on releasing the IP, while the real focus should be on producing as many vaccines as possible now and in the future and getting them all over the world.

* Totals for each demographic group can be downloaded from the [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) as a CSV.  While the CDC indicates totals are by ""Date Administered"", it appears to be by ""Date Reported"". Race/ethnicity and sex data is also available.
* Texas (about 9% of US) is excluded from CDC data, so tables do not match national totals.
* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group. The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, assuming that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17.",,,1620412560,{},gxaxtax,False,t3_n6sj6g,False,False,t1_gxathms,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6sj6g/daily_discussion_thread_may_07_2021/gxaxtax/,1620463913,15,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

"" VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning it relies on individuals to send in reports of their experiences to CDC and FDA. V***AERS is not designed to determine if a vaccine caused a health problem***, but is especially useful for detecting unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse event reporting that might indicate a possible safety problem with a vaccine. This way, VAERS can provide CDC and FDA with valuable information that additional work and evaluation is necessary to further assess a possible safety concern.

&amp;#x200B;

*VAERS is not designed to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event. A report to VAERS does not mean the vaccine caused the event.*

&amp;#x200B;

Bald faced liar.

&amp;#x200B;

 

* VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning that reports about adverse events are not automatically collected. Instead someone who had or is aware of an adverse event following vaccination must file a report.
* VAERS reports are submitted by anyone and sometimes lack details or contain errors.
* **VAERS data alone cannot determine if the vaccine caused the reported adverse event**.This specific limitation has caused confusion about the publicly available data, specifically regarding the number of reported deaths. In the past there have been instances where people misinterpreted reports of death following vaccination as death caused by the vaccines; that is a mistake.  
VAERS accepts all reports of adverse events following vaccination without judging whether the vaccine caused the adverse health event. Some reports to VAERS might represent true vaccine reactions, and others might be coincidental adverse health events not related to vaccination at all.  
Generally, a causal relationship cannot be established using information from VAERS reports alone.
* The number of reports submitted to VAERS may increase in response to media attention and increased public awareness.

&amp;#x200B;

To deal with the first claim, that the spike protein in the vaccine is effectively COVID itself and so you could get the same damage from the vaccine as you do COVID:

1. There are not nearly enough spike proteins in the mRNA that is injected into you via vaccine to do organ damage.

2. Unlike a virus, the mRNA in the vaccine does not replicate once in the body so it can't grow into enough spike proteins to harm you. 

3. Lastly, no, random mRNA spikes don't just float around the body looking to damage something. 

For the second point, this seems to be based on the idea that the vaccine would cause a cytokene storm similar to severe COVID cases, and that's too much for the body to take. The difference is, your immune response triggered by the vaccine is *not* a cytokene storm - the mRNA cannot replicate in the body so the immune response will not reach nearly the same levels as it would if you had actual COVID.",,,1620418489,{},gxbaijg,False,t3_n6sj6g,False,False,t1_gxb5f1x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6sj6g/daily_discussion_thread_may_07_2021/gxbaijg/,1620470485,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Or think of it another way, the vaccine is some, but not all, of the virus, so it can't replicate or get you sick, but it's enough for your immune system to respond to.

Your immune system has to learn how to fight off each type of virus separately. Through vaccinations and through being exposed to things in the public you accumulate immunity to hundreds of viruses including the flu or rhinovirus or whatever.

There's just two points: Based on the data we do have, the most accurate thing we can say given the data we have is that it's at least 6 in 5.9 million based on those who have been vaccinated. When you start making further assumptions on such a small number of cases, your margin of error will be **huge**. The problem is you said that the incidence is likely to be x in x, which is not wise at all since, as I mentioned previously, we don't know the exact time frame this occured. Furthermore, I think we'd both agree that, as I've mentioned in my first post, younger people seem to be more affected. This likely incidence rate of yours is likely to dramatically change depending on the population receiving their second dose. We know that healthcare workers had their first vaccine earlier and some of these events may have been from this population getting their second dose.

**MASSACHUSETTS UPDATE**

The drop in first doses is not too bad today in the 7 day average, so not much change or drop today.

**CDC** update on first dose shots:

38,986 first dose shots. Last week 43,953. 

7 day rolling avg is now 32,212. 32,922 yesterday. 

4,039,602 MA residents have first doses - 58.61% (4,000,616 - 58.04% yesterday)

72.91% of adults now

At this rate, the first dose shots:

On

May 15th - 4,329,513

May 31st - 4,844,909

June 15th - 5,328,093

**Eligible population numbers (based on 5,540,726 population)**

On

May 15th - 78.14%

May 31st - 87.44%

70% on 5/31 (- 18 days)

75% on 6/11 (- 24 days)

80% on 6/21 (- 28 days)

**Fully vaccinated estimates**

Using the date for 95% of adults with dose 1, if all of them get a second dose 31 days later (1 month for Moderna), plus an additional 14 days for immunity to kick in, that will put us at a date of: Thursday, July 29th (- 26 days), for 95% of adults fully vaccinated.

They could have decided to set up policies that restricts the export of doses that are domestically produced by private companies before all of their ordered doses have been delivered. They did not.

Even though though they do not own all the doses, they enforce what gets im/exported (as the EU). Exactly the same way the US controlled this with executive orders, contracts and the DPA. And the EU ordered hundreds of millions of doses and invested billions and billions of euros into development and production. If private companies would not be allowed to export through policy, they would have no choice but to only fulfill the EU order (which consists of billions of doses anyways) and deliver everything to the EU.

Japan bought Pfizer doses from wherever Pfizer could deliver them. Purely because the EU is allowing Pfizer to export everything they want to wherever they want. US does not allow this.

Vaccinating the vulnerable ASAP is the quickest way out. First get deaths low, then hospital and ICU admissions and then severe disease. With each step you reach, the consequences of COVID-19 gets lower and lower, thus more and more restrictions can be loosened. If you want to give as many people as possible for freedom, you can decide to give fully vaccinated group more freedom again. But this creates an unfair split in society and creates an uneven environment where the people that need protection gradually get more rights, while the people that do not have to be protected have less freedom. But this is unfortunately the quickest road to less measures while giving as many people as possible more freedom. You could also decide to not give fully vaccinated people more freedom, which is more fair, but this means you just follow the quickest road to less measures but not giving as many people as possible more freedom.

Vaccinating the other way around is significantly less effective. As it keeps the vulnerable population vulnerable to the virus and thus keeping the overall consequences of infection high. Which means measures have to stay a bit longer. Opening things up would mean severe consequences to these groups. If you would open things up if you already vaccinated the vulnerable group, there might still be a higher level of infections compared with vaccinating the other way around, but it means the consequences of infections will be much lower, and thus restrictions can be loosened earlier.

The importance of prevention is more like:

1. Deaths
2. ICU admission
3. Hospital admission
4. Severe disease
5. Long COVID (extra)
6. Symptomatic COVID infection
7. Asymptomatic COVID infection

Recently a law has been changed to allow a public curfew for incidences over 100. in comparison, the area that is doing best in Germany is currently ‚ÄûRendsburg-Eckernf√∂rde‚Äú with an incidence value of 30,6 and the worst doing area is currently Saale-Orla with an incidence value of 500,5.

The thing about the lockdown is, that a lockdown has been in place since November but with varying severities. But the last time anything was open was October. 2nd wave directly became 3rd wave, without us ever leaving lockdown.  Also our vaccination campaign is going shittyly and is only starting to catch some wind in its sails (today about 30% of Germans have received their first shot. About 8.9% have received both).

Nor do they have an extensive network of doctors to provide advisory decisions.

So, in practice, these regulatory bodies review documentation and labelling to ensure it conforms with their expectations, and leverage FDA and EMA approvals of the actual drug product and facility to say that the product and manufacturing site are safe.

Regarding the product you linked, that's also a medication that falls under generic rules, and not biosimilars. Functionally to the public a a generic and a biosimilar is the same thing: not the name brand drug, often produced for cheaper.

In practice, they're very different.  Generic medications will utilize a molecule that is metabolized in the body in order to create a new molecule that supports your body's processes. In biosimilars, you're providing proteins or something like that that actually does stuff to your body.  It's incumbent on the applicant to *prove* that their product does the same thing as the original. Insulins are an example of this, as are antibody therapies.

The 40 domestic infections were recorded in Hanoi with 24 cases, Da Nang (five), Hung Yen (four), Hai Duong, Dien Bien, Ha Nam, Nghe An, Nam Dinh, Phu Tho and Vinh Phuc with one each.

In Hanoi, the 24 patients are either linked to the infected Chinese experts in Yen Bai Province, or the Covid-19 cases confirmed at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases or the K cancer hospital in Tan Trieu Commune, both coronavirus hotspots in Hanoi.

The 24 patients are being treated at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Dong Anh District.

The five patients in Da Nang are linked to the outbreak at the New Phuong Dong Bar in the central city. They are being treated at the Da Nang Lung Hospital.

In Hung Yen, the four patients are related to the cases in the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases.

The case in Hai Duong is one who was in contact with a previous case here.

The case in Dien Bien is a person who traveled from Da Nang to Hanoi on flight VN160 of Vietnam Airlines on April 29. On May 2, after acknowledging that she was in the same flight with a Covid-19 case, the woman went for a health declaration and was quarantined in Dien Bien.

The case in Ha Nam is linked to the outbreak in this northern province.

The patient in Nghe An is one who had direct contact with an infected person in the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases 2. The same goes for the new cases in Phu Tho and Nam Dinh.

The case in Vinh Phuc is a person who works at a karaoke parlor in Phuc Yen Town of the province.

The six imported cases were detected in HCMC, Da Nang, Quang Tri and Binh Thuan.

Nationwide, Vietnam has recorded 161 Covid-19 community transmission cases in 19 localities since January 27.

Minister of Health Nguyen Thanh Long on Friday described the current outbreak as ""very alarming"".

He said the outbreak is complicated with many hotspots, diverse sources of infection and different virus variants having higher infection speed, as compared with the previous outbreaks.

""The control of the outbreak might even be more difficult in the coming time, with possible new hotspots and unknown sources of infection,"" he added.

In a meeting on Covid-19 fighting on Friday, Deputy PM Vu Duc Dam said a major reason behind this outbreak is the inadequate management on people entering Vietnam at centralized quarantine facilities, including hotels.

Some people who finished their 14-day centralized quarantine and still needed to be monitored for another 14 days at home but they failed to follow regulations and were not monitored properly, he noted.¬†""Some even went to parties and karaoke parlors, that‚Äôs unacceptable.""",,,1620402522,{},gxaalyz,True,t3_n71kup,False,True,t3_n71kup,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n71kup/vietnam_records_another_40_domestic_covid19_cases/gxaalyz/,1620451946,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The professional council of the southern province‚Äôs health department said the cause of death was anaphylaxis due to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug allergy.  

&gt;Vietnam began administering the Covid-19 vaccine produced by the AstraZeneca company on March 8. As of Friday, 747,827 people in 57 provinces and cities had been inoculated.  
Inoculation priority has been given to medical workers treating Covid-19 patients; those collecting samples for testing; members of Covid-19 prevention groups; members of the Steering Committee for Covid-19 prevention; police and army personnel.  
Minister Long had said Thursday that a review of over 600,000 people who had been vaccinated showed that 16 percent had normal reactions after vaccination. These reactions disappeared after 24 hours of being injected. This rate was lower than in other countries. A few cases with more severe reactions have been handled well by doctors, he added.

Even with COVAX, they don't get a lot. COVAX has already had stipulations in place that fixes the prices for all eligable countries so they bargain together.

I had to dig through the WHO documents to find the details but you can read the exact term stipulations here:

[https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/covid/covax/COVAX-Facility\_Terms\_and\_Conditions-Self-Financing-Participants.pdf](https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/covid/covax/COVAX-Facility_Terms_and_Conditions-Self-Financing-Participants.pdf)

The relevant paragraph is no. 9, ""Commitments of Participants subscribed to the Committed Purchase Arrangement"". It's around $10 on average per dose.

\[Since COVAX and the ACT in general is a bit of a public-private partnership style thing, you'll see a lot of GAVI, the Vaccine alliance and the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation mentioned.\]

China has agreed to participate in COVAX and if Sinopharm (and Sinovac and all the others) will export through COVAX, they will be also bound by that.

Hungary for example is not getting their doses through COVAX so they have negotiated with Sinopharm on their own, therefore the price is different.

[https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/act-accelerator/covax/3rd-round-allocation-pfizer-apr-jun-2021---online-pdf---final-for-webwtime-stamp.pdf?sfvrsn=d587228c\_1&amp;download=true](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/act-accelerator/covax/3rd-round-allocation-pfizer-apr-jun-2021---online-pdf---final-for-webwtime-stamp.pdf?sfvrsn=d587228c_1&amp;download=true)

According to this, a country like Uganda with a population of 47 million has gotten no Pfizer/Biontech doses in Q1, will get 3,024,000 doses from the Serum Institute of India or the AZ facility in South Korea between Feb and May and will get no doses from Pfizer and Biontech between April and June again.

Therefore, we hypothesized that suspended aerosol particles were the probable mode of transmission in this instance, and that the enclosed and unventilated space in the hotel corridor probably facilitated this event.

So that clearly shows it's possible.  How likely it is is hard to say.  There are also lots of reasons for people to lie about what they've been doing lately.

Unfortunately, asymptomatic spread is very real and may account for the majority of infection.  A very basic summary is that we can tell because it spreads faster than it makes people sick.

&gt;Under baseline assumptions, approximately 59% of all transmission came from asymptomatic transmission: 35% from presymptomatic individuals and 24% from individuals who are never symptomatic.

1. Vaccines target only the spike protein of the virus. Everything you hear in the news about variants are only discussing mutations in the spike protein. This is because the spike protein is what the virus uses for entry into cells, and therefore very important for transmissibility, and also because it appears to be the dominant antibody response. However, in individuals that are infected with Covid the antibody response is not just made to the spike protein. You can find antibodies against other viral proteins that can be equally as neutralizing and would not be influenced by changes in the spike protein. These theoretically  could be harder for the virus to mutate away from on the population scale due to there being less selective pressure since those mutations wouldn't also influence transmissibility like spike variants do; but either way previously infected individuals would have antibodies to other parts of the Covid virus beyond the spike protein that could protect them against a variant strain
2. Since Covid is a respiratory virus infected individuals develop high levels of mucosal antibodies which would protect the airways (these are called IgA). Our current vaccines develop a systemic IgG response, which yes is enough to neutralize the virus effectively as we have seen, but having mucosal IgA may improve quick clearance of the virus before any infection can take hold. 

There are still large questions about the durability of both responses, and yes the vaccine may produce a higher just spike antibody response than the natural infection, but the points these scientists are making are valid and do need to be considered.

No, it doesn't. It just implies that temperature checks make people feel better far more often than they actual detect anything. Which is true.

Anecdotes are not data. This is science 101. Your perspective is not representative of the whole. The representative data is that these tests don't do much, in large part because about half of COVID cases don't get fevers and pre-symptomatic cases are among the most infectious.

&gt;It's true that the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines have emergency use authorization from the FDA and not full approval yet.
But that's only because not enough time has passed to show how long the vaccines stay effective, Offit said.

&gt;""Frankly, the only real difference was in length of follow-up,"" he said. ""Typically, you like to see efficacy for a year or two years.""

&gt;He stressed that the vaccines' EUA status doesn't mean they're less safe. As a member of the FDA vaccine advisory committee, Offit said the vaccines are reviewed with the same level of scrutiny as they would to get full approval.


&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, is director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia and a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.

Tiny quibble: The N95 standard means that they are tested to be *at least* 95% effective under test conditions against the most penetrating particle size (which interestingly enough is not actually the smallest). They are more than 95% effective against other particle sizes, and likely more than 95% effective even against the most penetrating particles, since that's the minimum standards for the classification. And not all particle sizes are produced in even proportions, and not all are of the same level of concern. On the other hand, none of that really matters if the masks are poorly fitted or have other gaps around the seals.

If he (hypothetically) gets the first Astra zeneca vaccine dose today, how long should he wait to meet people at a place like a Biergarten (we live in Munich)? I really don't want to catch corona myself, and we're basically living together. 

 My concerns are:

- Currently there's a high rate of infection in the city, predominantly the UK variant. We just had a big surge after Easter.
- Beer glasses aren't usually washed well in these environments
- Trees shield the area usually, so I'm not sure how much mixing the air gets. You don't usually feel a breeze, for example.
- There's no guarantee people won't get close to each other. 
The tables/benches are usually designed for stuffing as many people as possible on one.
People here seem to go back to their hand shakes and close talking/walking rather quickly when they get together (they want to forget about corona, I get it.)
- Just one vaccine dose doesn't give so much protection. Does anyone have a chart to quantify this? 

Any insight is appreciated. He &amp; his friends are apparently thinking of meeting up like next weekend, if Biergartens open.

\&gt;CureVac was founded in 2000 and had raised about $84 million at time DARPA selected it to lead the consortium. DARPA also played an important role in helping Moderna establish its mRNA platform, awarding the biotech a contract for up to $25 million in October 2013. In addition to a vote of confidence for an edgy technology, the DARPA award added non-dilutive funding to the 2012 $40 million venture funding from Flagship Pioneering. Moderna raised over $600 million in a 2018 IPO and has a market cap of $11.6 billion.

A coworker told me that the mRNA vaccines create a spike protein that your body learns how to fight, and should you contract COVID, your body is better prepared to defend against it.  That sounds good to me.  Then she said two things I'm concerned about and would appreciate some insight on:

1. The COVID spike protein is responsible for damaging organ tissue, and when you receive an mRNA vaccine, the same type of spike protein is created.  Therefore, by creating a spike protein through administration of the vaccine, your organs are at risk in the same way COVID puts them at risk.
2. The mRNA vaccines essentially force your immune system to ""overpower"" your body's natural defense mechanism.  The antibodies normally used to fight against things like influenza or a rhinovirus prior to receiving a vaccine will be ineffective because the vaccine essentially modifies the RNA to create stronger antibodies that wipe out normal antibodies, which she called ""broad spectrum antibody neutralization.""    

Is there any truth to this?

I'll try my best to explain:

1. These events can occur within days to weeks post vaccination (studies suggest up to 3 weeks)
2. Only 6 events have been recorded
3. We have have absolutely no information which post-vaccine day these 6 events occured
4. Due to the extraordinarily small number of events compared to the observed population (number of indviduals who received their second AZ dose), a misinterpretation of when the events occured can change the incidence dramatically. Let me give an example. These reports tend to come out weekly. If all 6 of these events occured within the same timeframe of updated 2nd vaccine doses and events (ie. if the these events occured between days 1-7 post vaccine from the time the reports were last updated), than this would give you 1 in 5.9 milliion. If two weeks, then it would be a higher incidence, if 3 weeks, it would be higher still. Whatsmore, even a difference of 1 event came make a seemingly large difference to the incidence since it's so small (e.g the difference between 1 in a million (=1/1000000) and 2 in a million (=1/500000) which effectively doubles the incidence). This last point is why really you shouldn't interpret the data as you have without knowing when these events occured and why you can only really work with the data you have rather than push assumptions through since it can inflate the incidence. The only way to know if either for the data to be published whereby we can know for sure if those 6 were amongst the first 2.3 million or in later groups **or** if for some reason we paused AZ second doses for 3 weeks and let the cases catch-up (which is highly unlikely) **or** wait until everyone who has had their 2nd dose of AZ has had it and continue to monitor them afterwards (which is what we do).

Hope that clears it up!

And not all workers can take all jobs. In my area, restaurant and construction jobs are plentiful, but not everyone can physically do those jobs. Or has the flexibility to work the various shifts required of many minimum wage jobs, that frequently require evenings and weekend. If you have kids, before and after school child care is still limited in many areas.

Minimum wage is $7.25. If you can find a minimum wage job that gives you 40 hours a week, that‚Äôs $290 per week.

Secondly, it seems that J&amp;J has a lower prevalence of the clots. Now, this is yet to be confirmed as we are using US data for J&amp;J and EU/UK data for AZ so there may be discrepancies between the reporting but based on the data we have available it appears that J&amp;J has a lower risk. 

Consider also that the J&amp;J has been largely given to younger people, rather than AZ which has been given to a mixture of young and old. The AZ data is clear, that younger people are at higher risk of the CVST and thus you would actually expect the J&amp;J rate to be slightly higher than AZ if it had the same rate of clotting. The fact that it appears to be lower also makes it seem as though the prevalence is lower in J&amp;J than AZ (but again we can't really know that for sure because most countries have only used one or the other, this is changing now though with the EU rolling out both so it will be interesting to see the data that comes from it).",,,1620400087,{},gxa4x1p,False,t3_n6vnzq,False,False,t1_gx9pvnq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6vnzq/under_40s_to_be_offered_alternative_to_az_vaccine/gxa4x1p/,1620448958,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I somewhat agree. I also think that just in general, Canada is less comfortable with high death rates than in the United States, as you see from our responses to upticks in case numbers that were where some states started opening up again.

Additionally, for better or worse, we tend to be more 'compliant' with the government, maybe as a product of it fundamentally being less polarized here than in the states.

I have seen studies that suggest that the vaccine is not really effective against variants.  Have read reports from the vaccine manufacturers that stated as much.  And they say a booster is coming.

This is just one thing in many that leads me to wonder and have a question about where you think we will be going forward after I point out a few just general observations.  The above is something I have read as I have said.  Then I see some say what you have said in response to another: "" Current data suggest that the existing COVID-19 vaccines offers protection against most known variants.""  

&amp;#x200B;

So you get what I have been hearing often.  I know people that work in the local hospital that have been vaccinated.  They say they will not take a booster or another shot.  Some site the fact that they have gotten covid after their vaccines.  A few, including the boss of one of the women I know, was put in ICU at the regional hospital.  She had been vaccinated a few months ago with her second shot.  And they have quite a few others I know about get sick.  And teachers were vaccinated with some ending up with the virus and a couple fairly ill later and having to quarantine entire classes of students because of contact and none of them are vaccinated yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Have heard several doctors here and other healthcare people claim they would never take another because the vaccine is good against variants.

&amp;#x200B;

So a question about the vaccine in a more about getting the word out and dispelling this stuff and a booster.  Because if healthcare professionals are, at any level, pushing this it may be hard going forward.

2) It does matter. The bit of the EU-AZ contract that we talk about in regards to best reasonable effort has nothing to do with the UK bit (the first bit). The bit that applies to the UK is where the contract talks about using other non EU plants to fulfil the EU order with their best reasonable efforts scenario. As the UK plants were already dedicated to an order as per whatever contract the UK had, it's not exactly reasonable to go against another contract to help fulfil orders. This does matter.

3) If that is what the contract said then yes. This isn't a gotcha.

4) If you are trying to make the argument that AZ favoured the UK specifically over the EU you would have to show that the UK received more vaccines (excluding the more vaccines gained due to the above reasons) then you should expect to see a higher net amount going to the UK. As we are not, it's a bit hard to say the UK is getting too much. Clearly the UK contract with AZ contained some form of supply us first in regards to the UK plants which isn't unfair or the issue. So you have to show that the EU plants were sending more to the UK. Which they were not.

Perhaps you're not really knowledgeable about pharma, but that last decade has been an accelerated trend of cutting RND. In fact, there was a very famous wall street darling which basically cut it out entirely from its business model. 

&amp;#x200B;

Innovation changes in pharma have been pretty telling. But RND is going down.... [http://www.nihcm.org/pdf/innovations.pdf](http://www.nihcm.org/pdf/innovations.pdf)

Merging companies and their competitors both drop rnd spending after merger occurs. And are you aware at all about the Irish merger fervor from 6 years ago? Probably not. [https://hbr.org/2016/08/research-innovation-suffers-when-drug-companies-merge](https://hbr.org/2016/08/research-innovation-suffers-when-drug-companies-merge)

And again, we see something you're for some reason saying doesn't exist. 

\&gt;In major mergers today, not only are R&amp;D cuts made, but entire research sites are eliminated. Nowhere is this more evident than with Pfizer. Before 1999, Pfizer had never made a major acquisition. Over the next decade, it acquired three large companies ‚Äî Warner-Lambert (in 2000), Pharmacia (in 2003) and Wyeth (in 2009) ‚Äî and multiple smaller companies, such as Vicuron, Rinat and Esperion (Supplementary information S1 (figure)). Over this time frame, to meet its business objectives (a euphemism for raising its stock price) Pfizer closed numerous research sites in the United States, including those at Kalamazoo, Michigan (formerly a site for Upjohn), Ann Arbor, Michigan (formerly a site for Warner-Lambert) and Skokie, Illinois (formerly a site for Searle). It has also recently announced the closure of the Sandwich site in the UK. These sites housed thousands of scientists, and many major drugs ‚Äî such as atorvastatin (Lipitor), amlodipine (Norvasc) and sildenafil (Viagra) ‚Äî were discovered there. The same pattern has been observed after most of the mergers and acquisitions by other major pharmaceutical companies during the past decade.

\&gt;However, Pfizer now projects that in 2012 this figure will only be 11% (between US$6.5 and $7 billion). The extent of this decrease is further emphasized by comparison with the pre-merger R&amp;D expenses of Pfizer and Wyeth in 2008: $7.95 billion and $3.37 billion, respectively, and $11.3 billion in total. Other large pharmaceutical companies have announced similar cuts in recent years.

If it's harder to do head-to-head comparisons, then a company with a mediocre vaccine can save face by saying that their trial was run differently.

And to be fair, even if trials were all run exactly the same way, they would occur at different times and in different countries with different demographics and variants.

Perhaps a good example of this is the mRNA technology that was developed by BioNtech. Obviously a great vaccine tech, but they were targeting oncology primarily before COVID. 

So how to improve the situation? We can address both incentives and removing disincentives. Companies like BioNtech could be supported with research grants with conditions around vaccine development attached. Ensuring we have robust and internationally agreed mechanism for protecting IP and allowing a good return on investment from organisations that provide expertise and infrastructure (without fear of confiscation) would be a disincentive removed.

Colorado is considerably younger than the US as a whole (0.65% annual mortality versus 0.85%), so nationwide numbers should be higher.  And with 50,000 nationwide cases daily this is still a large number of daily deaths.  

Vaccinating the biggest spreaders instead of the highest mortality risk first is a gamble for most countries, but in Europe it's a no-brainer.  They're having tremendously expensive lockdowns rather than let cases rise, even though their vaccinations are only preventing the consequences of cases - not preventing the cases themselves.

In most of the world, where there isn't both the political will and the wealth to prevent spread, vaccinating the elderly and letting the rest of the population catch COVID could be a better option.

At the end of April, Wa≈Çbrzych councilors adopted a resolution on the compulsory vaccination of all residents and people working in the city . Its initiator was the president of Wa≈Çbrzych, Roman Sze≈Çemej. He indicated that currently the only effective drug that protects against death due to coronavirus and against the severe course of this disease is vaccination. Lawyers commented that the resolution - although motivated by good intentions - has no chance of entering into force, because there are no regulations that allow the local government to create such regulations.

City councilors also accepted an appeal to the minister of health to enter COVID-19 on the list of infectious diseases subject to vaccination.

So Sinopharm is now able to provide exports for the COVAX program, which should be good for African countries who chose to rely on COVAX.

However, national authorities are free to make their own decisions either way. The EMA has not received any request for submission from Sinopharm but surprisingly, they have started doing rolling reviews for Sinovac, which is especially confusing because not a single EU country has been using it but Hungary has been actively using the Sinopharm one. No idea why the two companies have made different decisions with regard to markets. Maybe because one is private and the other one state-owned? Idk.

Btw, there are a ton of additional candidates on the list for assessment for EUL under WHO, the next ones will likely be the Sinovac one and the one from Gamaleya.
