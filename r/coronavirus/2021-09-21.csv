By that, the US is at 27.5%, UK 3.4%, Turkey 2.4%. South Korea 2.6%, Russia 3.7%, Japan 5.9%, EU 21.1%, China 13.3%, Canada 2.2%.  If we assume we need 20 billion doses (enough for everyone to get 2 shots + 4 billion doses for inevitable expiration + 3rd doses), then the US should be aiming for 5.5 billion doses. Between the doses they've pledged/donated to other countries plus doses for themselves, they're at about 1 billion.

I don't think its a perfect way to calculate how much they should donate, but the US is behind where they should be IMO.

[],,bakedveldtland,,,[],,,,text,t2_anw4i0wi,False,False,[],"Personally I weighed the decision heavily. 

I am vaccinated. Overall I feel comfortable in public. 

I wore a KN95 when traveling and when in public indoor spaces. Most of my trip was spent hiking so I wasn’t indoors with strangers that often. 

Mental health wise- I needed it. I usually travel internationally at least once a year. The shutdown was hard, for a lot of reasons, but especially because I thought that my asthma might make me high risk. 

I was careful as fuck and hardly saw any friends. I spent most of my time as an essential worker, and that was it. Work work work. 

Mental health is real and I was losing my mind. Losing it. Having to pull over on the side of the road while driving because I was having panic attacks. Fuck that shit. 

So when I got vaccinated, I knew that I needed to have somewhat of a return to normal. My husband turned 40 this year. We wanted to celebrate and he had wanted to go to Italy… at least that was his goal pre-Covid. 

So we compromised and traveled domestically. And you know what? It pushed me out of my comfort zone and I had panic attacks. But I’m glad I did it. 


We still need to have quality of life. And that varies from person to person. For me, travel is big. It’s a huge motivator for me. It makes my quality of life better. I’m returning it to it as safely as I can. 

If I had unvaccinated kids, I wouldn’t be traveling unless necessary. But I’m vaccinated. I’m privileged and I know it, and I’m getting back into the economy while being respectful of health concerns.",,,,1632277077,{},hdspewf,False,t3_psshje,False,False,t1_hds8ktl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/psshje/is_it_ethical_to_travel_right_now_experts_on/hdspewf/,1632414472.0,16,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Differences in VE between the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine might be due to higher mRNA content in the Moderna vaccine, differences in timing between doses (3 weeks for Pfizer-BioNTech versus 4 weeks for Moderna), or possible differences between groups that received each vaccine that were not accounted for in the analysis (9).""

And looking at the CI levels it's ever so slightly wider for pfizer than Moderna. 

Pfizer: &gt;120 days after full vaccination 77 (67–84)

Moderna &gt;120 days after full vaccination 92 (87–96)

From that i gather while it could be the higher dosage of Moderna vs pfizer it could be other differences as well like timing between 1st/2nd doses etc. Plus the wider CI levels between the two.

But it's probably more on manufacturing capacity. Might be Moderna simply can't deliver 500m in a specific time frame whereas pfizer can easily do it.

While requiring masks and certainly vaccines for teachers and staff shows a clear public health benefit, it’s not so clear that requiring masks for elementary school students does the same. Additional research needs to be done and balanced against the potential developmental impact of mask mandates on young children. Per a recent CDC study [1], “The 21% lower incidence in schools that required mask use among students was *not statistically significant* compared with schools where mask use was optional” (emphasis added).

So there is nothing finite about it.

Like you said, the census has changed over the years and the categorization is not static. A lot of middle eastern people are against being categorized as white. They feel it erases them as a group completely. Many years ago, opinions might have been different when being white meant being safe. But that’s not the outlook anymore.

Socially, middle eastern people aren’t considered white at all. In the situation above, this is purely a social situation. So to call someone that’s middle eastern white is, in my opinion, dismissive and incorrect.

So, it looks like the reason fewer people take a test is because there really are fewer people that have covid. Covid hospitalizations are going down too (33% lower than the peak ~1½ week ago), essentially mirroring the fall in infections.

Regardless, the authorities and most experts have clearly stated that the country can expect a new peak this winter. The big unknown is the size of the peak and which measures -if any- will be necessary to deal with it. As you indicated, this also depends on levels of other infections (flu, RSV, etc) and a potential reduction in the vaccine protection (being monitored; also the reason boosters currently are being provided for nursing home residents).",,,,1632338108,{},hdvpiey,False,t3_pt01y7,False,False,t1_hdtlphr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pt01y7/portugal_hits_80_per_cent_fully_vaccinated/hdvpiey/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,acd78cf462a8af7ff345fd3264d8c415aa493cc8,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1632338119.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Plus there's sublineages already of Delta including Kappa.  And Delta itself includes other mutations than just P681R.  

Not sure if I really understand your point though or if you've misunderstood mine.  All of the current mutations would just produce a Delta version with maybe some enhanced immune escape (stuff like Kappa being an exception with mutations thought to cause enhanced affinity to ACE2, but that doesn't seem to be enough to outcompete Delta).  A future variant that is much worse in terms of _virulence_ than Delta it probably will probably use a/some novel mutation(s) and be built on top of Delta (or delta-related strains like Kappa with P681R), and I suspect the big one will be with a couple nucleotides of 681.

In terms of how the virus kills its mostly all about fitness/virulence and not immune escape right now and why Delta took over the world and why Mu and Lambda and other newspaper headline variants didn't really take off globally.  Delta+Alpha or Delta+Mu is less likely to be that much worse than Delta already is.  Son-of-Delta would be the thing to worry about.

Finding the optimal furin cleavage site for this virus in humans is probably the biggest prize for the virus right now, all the other variants out there are worse or no better than Delta (there's a lot of other subproblems the virus is ""working"" on solving but that'd be the biggest one).",,,,1632345931,{},hdw28lw,False,t3_pt3otl,False,False,t1_hduo2qn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pt3otl/is_the_worst_over_modelers_predict_a_steady/hdw28lw/,1632480095.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Public rant;

The focus on the ""death count"" is a simplistically unrealistic and deceiving way to look at any disease. It intrinsically gives people a false sense of security and immunity, and obscures the other very real and much more common outcomes, which are often lifelong health issues/disability. It's probably too soon to tell the very, very long term issues, but it seems about 20% of people who are hospitalized have some very serious and life changing ^limiting long term issues.  

IE; Traffic accident reports. *""There were only (X) traffic deaths in the state last year!""* This doesn't say anything about the much larger number of people who were injured, maimed, and had permanent life changing damages. *""Bob's doing really well since the accident, the doctors say he should be walking short distances again within the year.""*

Like, say on average a vaxed person had a 0.005% chance of dying from covid over a given month, and a non-vaxxed person had a 0.02% chance.

At a 50% vax rate, we'd expect, in a country of 9 million people, 4.5mil \* 0.00005 = 225 vaxed deaths and 4.5mil \* 0.0002 = 900 unvaxed deaths, so total deaths = 900+225=1125, of which 20% were from vaxed people and 80% were from unvaxed people.

At a 90% vax rate, we'd expect vax deaths = (9mil \* 0.9)\*0.00005 = 405 vaxed deaths, and (9min \* 0.1)\*0.002 = 180 unvaxed deaths = 585 total deaths, of which 70% were vaxed and 30% were unvaxed.

Honestly I don't even have words for it  anymore. Sometimes I am so angry that this is *still* going on, needlessly, and even worse than last year. Other times I am just deeply disappointed. 

I'm recovering from a breakthrough case that I picked up over Labor day weekend in Montana from my husband's friends. I knew the trip was risky but I accepted the risk because my husband hadn't seen his friend in a long time. I wasn't even upset when I  first tested positive. My vaccine did its job and I'm almost back to 100%. 

But when my husband told his friends that I was sick and had tested positive after our trip, they blew off my test result, almost like they didn't believe in it. Even though three of their kids were sick. Then, the husband got sick. Then, the family members that stayed with them Labor Day weekend after we left got sick and tested positive for covid. Their family tried to get our friends to test... They wouldn't do it. Then the wife got sick. ""Just a cold"" she told me, after driving across two states to go shopping, obviously offended at even the suggestion that she should get tested.

In the face of all that anecdotal evidence and at least two positive covid tests... To be so ignorant that you don't even believe that family and friends were sick with covid?

And although we still have some restrictions, they are mainly based in realation to the vaccination certification which, you know, was the whole point.

Other than that the only restrictions that are applied heere are:

* Groups up to 15 people in public spaces

* recomended only, remote work

* weekends at night you need certification to be able to eat on restaurantes/pubs indoord (this one is stupid i admit)

* Certification needed for cultural events and indoor activities

* cultural events that have audiences only 75% capacity are allowed

This doesn't seem that harsh.

After september 30th this will change:

* No capacity limits anywhere

* certification needed for clubs and discos, cultural events and public transportation.

That's basically it.

I used to think that we should allocate ressources blindly, to “save the most lives”, without judgement. We treat smokers who get cancer right? Why not give monoclonals and ICU beds to the unvaxed on spring break?

On the other hand, I share in the growing frustration that we are all paying the costs of certain peoples decisions. If a guy gets Covid and goes to the icu, he can stay there for 10-14 days. In that time, we could use that icu bed to do 7 or so heart bypass post op recoveries. Those surgeries are now getting cancelled, so we can free up that bed for one guy that didn’t want to get fucking vaxed…

I know that it’s a slippery slope to start allocating resources based on merit; it feels icky. But we do it all the time already. We would give a liver transplant to someone who is sober and refuse someone who still drank, for example…

They generally say only to wait until you are out of isolation. Special considerations:

&gt;People with a history of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or adults (MIS-A): These people may choose to be vaccinated but should consider delaying vaccination until they have recovered from their illness and for 90 days after the date of diagnosis. Considerations for vaccination may include: (omitted, see source)

&gt;For people who previously received passive antibody therapy as part of COVID-19 treatment, defer vaccination for at least 90 days after receipt of passive antibody therapy (monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma). This recommendation applies to people who receive passive antibody therapy before receiving any COVID-19 vaccine dose and to those who receive passive antibody therapy after the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine but before the second dose, in which case the second dose should be deferred for at least 90 days following receipt of the antibody therapy.",,,,1632275582,{},hdsmc3k,False,t3_psdjg3,False,False,t1_hdsfym0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/psdjg3/daily_discussion_thread_september_21_2021/hdsmc3k/,1632412599.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reason for this is regular contact with infected people or surfaces, according to the study published by the institute in Nuremberg. The increased risk of infection in cleaning professions is therefore 18.3 percent; for occupations in the security sector at 7.7 percent.

&gt; Overall, less than a quarter of all occupations showed an increased risk of infection. In general, the risk of contracting the coronavirus is highest in health professions at a rate of 35.2 percent, according to a study. At 69 percent, the risk of infection is greatest in the areas of human medicine and dentistry. There is also a risk of infection in social and cultural service professions (5.2 percent) and commercial professions (2.9 percent).

Most of the dying people are really old and for them the vaccine doesn't make as big a difference as one would think. Many of them don't develop proper immune response to the vaccines due to illnesses and treatments.

The most dramatic effect is usually seen in the ICU numbers - even young healthy unvaccinated people end up in ICU pretty easy. That's something the vaccines prevent pretty well.

With a population-level immunity of 81%, we have 62,358,000 people without immunity.

Over the last 7 days, we have averaged 324,609 people initiating vaccination per day.

If we extrapolate this data, that gives us 73 days until we reach 100% immunity, which is December 4th.

Obviously there are plenty of wrong assumptions here. It's very unlikely we will continue at this rate of cases for very long. We can see the cases decreasing already. And, I believe the current vaccination rate is fueled by case count. So, when cases decline we will also see vaccinations decline as people are less afraid. I also think there is a ceiling to vaccinations.

Nicki Minaj lied to get attention.  she lied to pander to ignorance.  so she lied, insulted her fan base and the rest of us by making people already busy with runnin gthier countries and health services waste time in demonstrating she lied.

and no punishment will happen.  

the media decided that we shouldnt trust science becasue it isnt definative and certain immediately.  things the media claim to want. despite Hearst's 'if it bleeds, it leads'.  


the media is trying to sell advertising space by scaring people into reading stories that they got out before they checked the facts on because 24hr news.  an we have decided to let them off on contradicting themselves later on when they actually have facts.  

we even let them off when they produce obvious pandering political biases of both sides on stories.

and then we have social media - a great idea hijacked by the gross stupidty of the people.

\[see Men in Black: K's speech on the differences between the people and a person.\]

one lie from someone famous is repeated by thier fans because its easy to do it and it shows \_i\_ am a real fan of thiers.  Karma whores are causing this you might think.  but thats not all.  bots.  bots looking for words they then repost to all the contacts they have - many of whom are bots, who repost instantly and then you have a post with 10 thousand reposts!  the credulous will then repost iot becasue it must be true/important sicne it has been reposted so often.

and here i am on social media posting this in response to a post on social media.

Cells naturally emit mRNA from the nucleus all the time and that mRNA is used to produce proteins (mRNA is usually copied from the DNA, but never the other way around). mRNA vaccine makes just to deliver a foreign mRNA engineerised to look not foreign from the beginning in the cells.

But it's not really possible to be allergic to *all* the vaccines, people who are allergic to one type can simply switch over to a different type.

Myocarditis (including perimyocarditis) is a weird one because while it has been linked to the mRNA vaccines, it is much more likely to happen with an actual Covid infection than with a vaccine (https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ps110k/myocarditis_and_pericarditis_following/). So people who are at high risk for myocarditis would be in this weird place where they are highly encouraged to get the vaccine but cannot be mandated to do so, due to liability problems.

&gt;Stage 2. It becomes harder and harder for you to breathe. “Like drowning,” many patients describe the feeling. The bronchodilator treatments we give you provide little relief. Your oxygen requirements increase significantly, from 4 liters to 15 liters to 40 liters per minute. Little things, like relieving yourself or sitting up in bed, become too difficult for you to do on your own. Your oxygen saturation rapidly declines when you move about. We transfer you to the intensive care unit.

&gt;Stage 3. You’re exhausted from hyperventilating to satisfy your body’s demand for air. We put you on noninvasive, “positive pressure” ventilation — a big, bulky face mask that must be Velcro’d tightly around your face so the machine can efficiently push pressure into your lungs to pop them open so you get enough of the oxygen it delivers.

&gt;Stage 4. Your breathing becomes even more labored. We can tell you’re severely fatigued. An arterial blood draw confirms that the oxygen content in your blood is critically low. We prepare to intubate you. If you’re able to and if there’s time, we will suggest that you call your loved ones. This might be the last time they’ll hear your voice.

&gt;We connect you to a ventilator. You are sedated and paralyzed, fed through a feeding tube, hooked to a Foley catheter and a rectal tube. We turn your limp body regularly, so you don’t develop pressure ulcers — bed sores. We bathe you and keep you clean. We flip you onto your stomach to allow for better oxygenation. We will try experimental therapeutics.

Keep in mind that odds are that we're all going to see some risk of infection/reinfection forever based on what we're seeing. ""Sterilizing immunity"" going forward is unlikely at least for the next few years/decades. 

Those studies do have one big limitation, which is that they don't test for b-cell/t-cell response. They're seroprevalence tests, which do have some limitations. 

Study 6 also finds that share to be small: ""The \~5% who were seronegative non-responders, using multiple assays in a population-wide manner, represents the proportion of patients that may be at risk for re-infection.""

This is how I understand it, in *very* layman's terms:

If you are unvaccinated and are exposed to a small amount of the virus, your immune system doesn't know what it is &amp; before it figures out what to do about it, the virus can spread inside you and may result in a serious bout of COVID.

However, if you are vaccinated and are exposed to the same small amount of the virus, your immune system immediately recognizes it &amp; starts fighting it before it has a chance to spread, and in all likelihood you get mild symptoms at worst. Your immune system knows what's up and doesn't let things get out of control because it has been trained by the vaccine.

Now, if you are exposed to a high amount of the virus, you could still have a serious bout of COVID even if you are fully vaccinated, because so much of the virus is inside you that your immune system can't keep up. But even so, it is putting up a fight that it wouldn't without vaccination thereby giving you better odds at a better outcome. Without vaccination, the virus can immediately spread like wildfire and send you down the path of a real bad time.

The vaccines don't stop you from getting infected, it's not like they're a forcefield that bounces the virus away from your body as it approaches. The virus still lands in you regardless of vaccination. But the vaccine helps your immune system get to work on a solution immediately as opposed to having to learn on the job, which in some cases can happen too late.

Generally if you are vaccinated you are not qualified for monoclonal antibody treatment unless you are high risk (ie immunocompromised, severe underlying conditions, transplant). This is according to a [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20210826/monoclonal-antibodies-vs-vaccines-vs-covid-19) interview with Dr Fales, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Michigan. The reason being is you are less likely to get a severe infection. If you do develop a severe infection being vaccinated you are already past the point that treatment would help you. The current EUA from the FDA for the monoclonal antibody treatment is only for mild to moderate [infection](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-additional-monoclonal-antibody-treatment-covid-19). 

The sentiment is still that unless you develop severe COVID your immune system is really all you need to fight off the infection in a large majority of cases. If you do develop severe COVID requiring hospitalization it is too late for monoclonal antibody therapy to be effective. 

We are still in the middle of deciding who needs the what regarding treatments in the pandemic. Additionally, being vaccinated is enough for a large majority of people to be alright from COVID. Hence why monoclonal antibody treatments are the first line of defense for those unvaccinated COVID positives, whereas for many of us vaccinated it is like a not completely necessary second line of defense. 

Setting your sentiments against unvaccinated people aside, in the pure scheme of who will actually benefit from monoclonal antibody treatments, only those unvaccinated really will experience a noticable impact to their survival and health.",,,,1632271152,{},hdsd0qt,False,t3_psnxa6,False,False,t3_psnxa6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/psnxa6/tennessee_recommends_vaccinated_residents_lose/hdsd0qt/,1632406834.0,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 30 yr old with an undiagnosed lung problem and a minor heart defect. Day-by-day they feel a little off sometimes but overall fine and these issues, if not agitated, aren't enough do much to to them. They seem ""perfectly healthy"" to themselves and everyone around them. They also are unvaccinated because they listened to someone of your persuasion and are convinced that COVID is all a global shadow government conspiracy.

They get covid - a hoax as you say - and their immune system is not primed and doesn't know how to immediately react. The virus doesnt understand it's just a made up propaganda bogeyman and rapidly multiplies in the lungs making the minor breathing problem now a big problem. They struggle to breath as oxygen absorption is reduced and the heart is stressed in a way that agitates the heart defect so much so that they can't even get out of bed without collapsing. They are taken to the hospital

After struggling in a hospital for weeks, the damage is too much to handle, their immune system cannot sufficiently fight off the virus, their lungs become unable to oxygenate the body and the heart is stressed to the max trying to supply the sub-optimal oxygenated blood to the body. They die.

This is not a hypothetical scenario and has happened.

There might have been models in the spring that predicted massive Delta variant surges in the summer even in places where vaccinations were ramping up and the Alpha variant was still dominant. They didn't get much coverage, though, and the more optimistic (and popular) models got it wrong, at least as described in the popular press. It's hard to blame them, though: their assumptions looked pretty good when they were made, but they didn't leave much room for error.

The trajectory of the pandemic depends heavily on human behavior; we can be pretty sure of that.

It may be gross to you, but I can guarantee you do it too. There is someone that you don't know but greatly admire out there.

It has some unique characteristics and the jury is still out on all of its potential long term effects. Like many risk assessments, you should multiply probability of occurrence times potential impact. Right now probability of occurrence (infection) is still really high, even with vaccination. It's still everywhere, and the ICUs are still all extremely stressed. Potential impact for the unvaccinated is pretty obviously huge at this point. Death or disability are very likely for those folks. For the vaccinated, it's going to be less than that, but otherwise there are still lots of big question marks. What is the mechanism of Long Covid? Do breakthrough cases with vaccines still potentially trigger those Long Covid problems? How badly and how often? What about on the second, third, etc. infection? There have already been documented cases of people getting reinfected three or more times already, even with vaccination. We know that both natural and vaccine immunity wane over time somewhat. But it's just going to be a while until we can observe and learn more, and it's still likely that new variants will come in and change things up once more.

This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions. However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

[],,ensui67,,,[],,,,text,t2_5gy4x,False,False,[],"The answer is pretty simple if you’re going to account for the economics portion of it. Tests are relatively cheap while the impact of a covid outbreak is fairly high. Take for instance, the film industry. Days lost in production can result in many thousands of dollars in costs per day, therefore their policy is to routinely test all workers and those who are positive get removed while the show can go on. Same with sports. Same with healthcare workers. Same for schools. The UK is one instance where routine testing has seemed to work out really well for schools even with the rise of Delta.

Your presumption that just because cases are low and trending lower is that it is the direction things will head indefinitely. It has been proven to not be the case when we observe high transmission in highly vaccinated communities. This is because we see that Delta is particularly good at finding vulnerable populations and making a mess of it no matter how well vaccinated the population. Also, due to the nature of transmission of this virus in which it is most transmissible just before and/or at the onset of symptoms, the only way to put out the fire early is to test. Therefore, testing can be used as a form of insurance. An upfront cost at the prevention of a higher potentially higher cost down the line.

The world is coming to grips with a level of covid that will be acceptable. China has a stance of 0 covid. Australia is warming up to the idea that it is uncontrollable and mitigation will be the best method. America has mostly decide to let it run its course. All can be helped by mass testing for now.

Loss of productivity due to illness is very high so that should also be a main determinant of “at what point is testing not worth it”. The answer will probably be when most of the world is vaccinated/immune. The dollar amount you can save by preventing an outbreak and loss of $$$ makes the economics of testing very compelling in certain situations. Maybe it’s not so important for those working from home, but makes a lot of sense for those high physical contact contexts.

Remember what happened in late 2020 in the US. The wave of outbreaks spread through the US unevenly from one section to the next. Will it happen in 2021 again where the northeast is next? Stay tuned.

&gt;As part of a virtual Covid-19 summit on the margins of the UN General Assembly, Biden announced that the US is purchasing an additional 500 million Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines to donate to low- and lower-middle-income countries around the world, a senior administration official said, previewing the summit. The newly announced 500 million doses are on top of the 500 million the US had already committed to sharing with other nations.

&gt;Those vaccines will begin shipping out in January, and from January through September of next year, the US will ship out 800 million vaccines to the world, the official said. These vaccines bring the United States total to over 1.1 billion vaccines donated to other countries.

&gt;""We also know that to beat the pandemic here, we need to beat it everywhere. And I made -- and I'm keeping -- the promise that America will become the arsenal of vaccines as we were the arsenal of democracy during World War II,"" Biden said at the summit.

&gt;The vaccines will be distributed through Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access, the global vaccination program known as COVAX. The President noted the US has already shipped more than 160 million Covid-19 doses to 100 countries, which is more than every other country has donated combined.

&gt;""To put it another way: For every one shot we've administered today in America, we have now committed to do three shots to the rest of the world,"" Biden said at the summit.

&gt;The President called on other nations to fulfill and increase their vaccine donation pledges to help put an end to the pandemic, and announced a partnership between the US and European Union to expand global Covid-19 vaccinations.

&gt;The push comes as the Biden administration prepares to offer booster shots to many vaccinated Americans this fall. The executive director of the World Health Organization's health emergencies program, Mike Ryan, has criticized the move, arguing vaccines need to be prioritized to those who haven't had any Covid-19 shots yet.

&gt;White House officials have pushed back on the criticism and said they can provide booster shots while also continuing its efforts to help vaccinate the rest of the world. Officials like White House Covid-19 response director Jeff Zients and US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy have stressed the importance of doing both at the same time in order to end the global pandemic.

&gt;Biden said that Secretary of State Antony Blinken would be convening foreign ministers later this year to check on the global vaccination progress. The President also proposed a second high-level virtual summit in the first quarter of 2022 ""to help gauge our progress and keep our efforts fully alive.""

&gt;The summit will consist of heads of state, leaders from international organizations, the private sector, philanthropies, nongovernmental organizations and other partners from around the world, according to an administration official, who said there are more than 100 countries and 100 organizations participating. The summit will contain four distinct sessions and is expected to last more than four hours with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris both chairing a session.

&gt;Biden will call on world leaders in all sectors to focus on specific areas in order to help end the pandemic, including vaccinating the world in an equitable and efficient manner and saving lives now by working to solve the global oxygen crisis and making tests and therapeutics more available.

&gt;The White House sent those participating in the summit a list of ""deliberately ambitious"" goals and targets, which will be released afterward.

&gt;""We need to align around common goals and targets to hold ourselves and the world accountable for collective action to end the pandemic, and obviously to prepare for the next,"" the official said.

&gt;CNN has previously reported on some of the targets expected to be set at Wednesday's summit, including urging world leaders to collectively commit to vaccinating 70% of the world's population against Covid-19 within a year and calling on nations to ensure $3 billion is available this year and $7 billion in 2022, for ""financing for vaccine readiness and administration, combating hesitancy, and procuring ancillary supplies.""",,,,1632331529,{},hdv97eq,True,t3_ptccxl,False,True,t3_ptccxl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ptccxl/us_to_send_additional_500_million_doses_of/hdv97eq/,1632466008.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

But even still, having the overly broad categories that we have no serve almost no function.

If anything, it overinflates just how many white people actually do live in this country. Which I think is interesting when it comes to topics of who even is the “minority” group in some areas? If the white group is the minority, does that actually change anything on the federal level?

I’m a little too broad on this topic, I’ll admit. But I don’t think race matters anymore in the government. Ethnicity, nationality, skin tone, location, generation (immigrants), are all significantly more important to giving an overall picture about the person and the state they’re living in.

The only group it really matters to are scientists and health professionals. But even then, it has gaps. I have light skin, but I’m sure you could tell from these comments I’m middle eastern. Had a minor health concern that no one ever bothered to test me for due to my race being white and my skin being light. It took a doctor finally asking my mom what her ethnicity was to test her for it and informed her it’s common for people from that region of the world. Not as common for white people in general.

And to your second point, yes that’s an odd and I’m sure complex one. Makes me think that “identifying as an ethnicity” will be a much talked about future topic.

Additionally, the order does not require that those who come into contact with a COVID-positive individual be tested for the virus themselves.

Many kids with disabilities can only access their free appropriate public education (FAPE) in in-person classes.  Sending these kids out of in-person classes denies them FAPE

Why is denying special Education kids FAPE important:   
Every child in the US is entitled to FAPE.  Any government action that directly leads to denial of FAPE is considered illegal under federal law.

&gt; Today at 5:51 a.m. EDT

&gt; When a coronavirus vaccine site in Humble, Tex., shut down at 7 p.m. on Dec. 29, Hasan Gokal began a race with the clock to distribute 10 leftover Moderna doses before the vial expired.

&gt; The doctor, with permission from his supervisor, phoned elderly and at-risk patients who were eligible to receive the shot in the earliest phases of the nationwide vaccine rollout. He found 10 people with underlying health conditions who said they would take the vaccine doses. Over the next five hours, Gokal drove around the Houston area to distribute the vaccine to nine people. He couldn’t reach the 10th person before the vaccine vial would expire, so Gokal gave the last dose to his wife, who has a lung disease that affects her breathing.

&gt; The doctor believed he was doing the right thing after Jennifer Shuford, chief epidemiologist with the Texas Department of State Health Services, warned physicians not to waste the shots and said it was even acceptable to give leftover doses to ineligible people if the vaccines would otherwise expire.

&gt; But on Jan. 7, Harris County Public Health fired Gokal for doling out the shots. Officials within the county health department then shared false information with the local district attorney’s office, Gokal said in a lawsuit filed Tuesday, spurring prosecutors to bring criminal charges against Gokal for allegedly stealing vaccine vials and giving shots to friends and family. That month, he was charged with theft by a public servant, a misdemeanor that was ultimately dismissed.

&gt; Gokal is suing Harris County Public Health for wrongfully firing him, orchestrating a “misinformation campaign” aimed at stripping him of his medical license, and discriminating against the doctor based on his race and national origin. Harris County Public Health did not immediately return a request for comment from The Washington Post early Wednesday.

&gt; The termination and subsequent efforts to pursue criminal charges against Gokal left him struggling to find a new job in public health, he said.

&gt; “If you Google my name, you’ll see ‘doctor theft,’ ‘doctor theft,’ so on and so forth,” Gokal told KTRK on Tuesday.

&gt; According to the lawsuit, a human resources director allegedly told the doctor that he “did not ‘equitably’ distribute the vaccine and gave the vaccine to too many individuals with ‘Indian’ sounding names.” Gokal’s attorney told KTRK that the 10 individuals Gokal was able to reach before the vaccine expired “happen to be South Asian.” Gokal, who is from Pakistan, sought out at-risk patients “without race in mind,” according to the suit. Instead, it adds, he tried to ensure that the extra doses went to people who were particularly vulnerable to the novel coronavirus because of underlying health conditions.

&gt; The lawsuit said that Harris County Public Health did not properly investigate the allegations made against Gokal. The department “never interviewed Dr. Gokal, never took his statement, never asked for his side of the story, conducted no internal investigation of the matter, and never sought to get the facts straight,” the lawsuit states.

&gt; Gokal has flatly denied accusations made against him, including the claim that he gave the leftover doses to people close to himself.

&gt; “The only individual that qualifies as a ‘friend’ or ‘family’ that received the vaccine is his wife, who Dr. Gokal did not give the vaccine to until time had nearly run out and with no one else available to receive the last vaccine dose,” the lawsuit said.

&gt; The suit also alleges that individuals within the public health department sought to malign Gokal’s reputation and pursued “a revenge campaign rooted in discriminatory-based disdain.” The suit claims that members of the department sought to further punish Gokal by allegedly sharing false allegations with prosecutors and attempting to persuade the Texas Medical Board to revoke the doctor’s medical license.

&gt; “Upon receiving Dr. Gokal’s side of the story and the evidence he submitted, the Texas Medical Board immediately dismissed the complaint on March 9, 2021,” the lawsuit said. “The Texas Medical Board stated that Dr. Gokal ‘administered doses of the coronavirus vaccine to patients that were properly consented, in the eligible patient category, and they were given doses that would have otherwise been wasted.’ ”

&gt; A judge similarly dismissed a criminal charge leveled against Gokal on Jan. 25, stating that the prosecution’s affidavit was “riddled with sloppiness and errors.” Prosecutors continued to pursue charges for several months, but a Harris County grand jury declined to indict Gokal in June.

&gt; Although Gokal was ultimately cleared of wrongdoing by the courts and the medical board, the lawsuit said he struggled to find work after his termination.

&gt; While the medical board reviewed the complaints and the courts considered the criminal charge lodged against Gokal, the doctor “could not work because employers were reluctant to hire him given the publicity of the allegations made against him,” the lawsuit said. It added: ”Dr. Gokal went through a tortured six-month criminal investigation during which time his reputation was tarnished, his confidence was shattered, and he and his family were subjected to emotional distress.”",,,,1632326798,{},hduxk1z,True,t3_ptaozs,False,True,t3_ptaozs,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ptaozs/a_texas_doctor_was_fired_after_doling_out/hduxk1z/,1632460177.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

I compare the two situations and blame the obsession with testing AND the media’s tendency to take advantage of case numbers and “outbreaks”. Most universities aren’t going to risk being in the news for an outbreak even if all the cases are asymptomatic. 

A solution? Stop testing and quarantining healthy kids. Some would say it’s negligent but I very much believe these schools care way more about PR then they do a handful of students getting really sick.

[],,Synonyms26,,,[],,,,text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,[],"HCM CITY — HCM City is set to implement a ‘COVID-19 green card’ system that will allow partly and fully vaccinated people to undertake certain activities like shopping and working in offices.  
  
It has announced COVID-19 preventive measures for places such as traditional markets, wholesale markets, manufacturing facilities, and service businesses as it prepares to gradually reopen while ensuring safety.  
  
The measures include issuing green cards to people who have developed antibodies against COVID due to being vaccinated or contracting the disease and recovering.  
  
People who have received both shots or have fully recovered from the virus will get the card provided they also test negative for the virus and have not come into contact with a patient for at least two weeks.  
  
A ‘COVID-19 green card for limited activity range’ will be issued to those who have got one shot.   
  
At traditional markets, both vendors and customers have to have green cards, while management staff and workers who do not frequently come into contact with customers have to at least have the limited card.  
  
The markets have to ensure social distancing between people, manage the flow of people and keep out those with symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath.  
  
They need to install equipment necessary for identifying green cards, scanning QR codes and collecting online health declarations.  
  
Supermarkets and other retailers have similar requirements for customers and staff.  
  
At wholesale markets, customers only need the limited cards, but vendors and workers coming into contact with people need the full green card.  
  
The latter have been instructed to encourage non-cash transactions and use technologies to reduce onsite staff numbers.  
  
Production facilities have to ensure safety measures are in place, and all employees need to be vaccinated at least once.   
  
People returning to work after a long gap need to furnish negative COVID-19 test results.  
  
Employers need to have workers tested every three days if considered high risk and every seven days otherwise.  
  
Workplaces have to ensure adequate distancing between staff and set up barriers or have workers wearing face shields if space is limited.  
  
Food and accommodation also have to strictly conform to preventive measures.  
  
Staff at service businesses who work directly with customers need green cards as do people who want to use sports facilities and gyms.   
  
At government offices, workers need green cards while visitors only need to furnish negative test results.   
  
Supermarkets, malls and food and beverage shops who want to open need to fully meet safety criteria.  
  
All their staff must have green cards and furnish negative test results when they resume work, while drivers and delivery men need both.  
  
Supermarkets and malls must ensure a two-metre gap between staff and customers and that entrances and exits are one-way, and set up check-points, temperature screening and hand sanitisation machines and QR code scanners at all entrances.  
  
They need to have emergency response teams standing by.  
  
Staffs and customers must make electronic health declarations, have their temperatures checked, wear masks, and wash their hands.  
  
Food and beverage businesses must set up a separate takeout place, and ensure social distancing between delivery people who come to pick up stuff.  
  
Constructions  
  
Construction works for pandemic control, key national and city projects and national defense projects in progress are among those that can resume in green zones if their workers have green cards, comply with the 5K safety requirements and are regularly tested.  
  
The list also includes construction works to serve industrial production, transportation and agriculture and facilities and technical infrastructure in suburban areas.  
  
Works that were 80 per cent complete before the lockdown and those in industrial parks and clusters, export processing zones and high-tech zones, and repair and renovation of factories are also allowed to go ahead.  
  
However, no work is allowed yet in yellow (risk), orange (high risk) and red (extremely high risk) zones unless they are meant for pandemic control.  
  
On August 17 the city administration approved some urgent works like the metro line No 1, Thủ Thiêm 2 Bridge and flyover at the new Miền Đông (Eastern) Bus Station in Thủ Đức City and the underpass at the Nguyễn Văn Linh - Nguyễn Hữu Thọ intersection in District 7 to continue. — VNS",,,,1632316513,{},hdu9p4f,True,t3_pt7ash,False,True,t3_pt7ash,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pt7ash/vietnam_covid_green_cards_to_be_issued_for_people/hdu9p4f/,1632447761.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

On Tuesday night roads around central areas of ​​Hà Nội, such as Hàng Lược, Hàng Cân, Hàng Mã, and Đinh Tiên Hoàng streets, were very crowded, zing.vn reported.  
  
According to Dr Trần Đắc Phu, former Director of the Department of Preventive Medicine, Ministry of Health, these actions are unacceptable, and risk affecting the overall good results that the city has achieved.   
  
Meanwhile, a number of COVID-19 cases in the community have not yet been found. The latest cluster in Long Biên District discovered 10 cases through screening.  
  
""The pandemic may break out again when one F0 appears in the crowd on Tuesday night. Hà Nội is still implementing social distancing rules under Directive 15. It means that people are asked to stay at home and only go outside for essential trips,"" Phu said.   
  
People still need to maintain personal protection with the 5Ks (wear your masks, wash your hands, keep your distance, declare your health status, do not gather in groups), according to Dr Phu.  
  
The city government needed to implement measures to prevent these activities from happening again, he said.  
  
He suggested the city's health sector should immediately screen people with symptoms of cough and fever who went to the Mid-Autumn Festival on Tuesday night.   
  
The city also needs to have measures to properly regulate vehicles and people on the streets, to prevent large gatherings.

Dr Nguyễn Thu Anh, director of the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, Việt Nam, expressed concern about the possibility of COVID-19 cases appearing after Tuesday night's crowd.   
  
The risk of infection is much greater as many families took their children to the street that night. Children are not vaccinated, so their risk of infection is very high, Anh said, adding that most people are only partly protected with one vaccine shot.  
  
Anh suggested that people should be responsible for both themselves and the community.

We as a family have a lot more freedom to go and do things once the kids are vaccinated.  The people who choose not to vaccinate their kids are probably already out going and doing and taking their risks.  Those who will vaccinate are still largely stuck at home taking precautions, for them it will be extremely freeing.

Additionally, we're at a point now where we are forcing parents to take risks they aren't comfortable with regards to their children.  My kids have to go to in person school.

""Why are vaccinated people still testing positive for Covid but not getting as sick? It’s all about the type of immunoglobulins produced from vaccination. For those of you who are hardcore scientists, ignore this post- it’s geared toward lay people and meant to be easy to understand. I’m going to do an epic under-simplification of a very complicated subject. Look away!

  
IgG is a type of immunoglobulin (antibody) that is plentiful in our blood serum. These are the immune proteins that our Covid vaccine is really good at producing.

  
IgA is a type of immunoglobulin that is plentiful in our mucous membranes, like the respiratory tract (nose and throat). Unfortunately, our injected vaccines are NOT very good at creating a lasting army of this type of antibody.

  
SARS-Cov-2 (virus) that causes the disease Covid-19 is a respiratory virus- meaning, that it enters the body through the respiratory mucosa. It sets up shop in the area of the back of the throat where the nasal passage meets, called the nasopharynx. While it’s there, it enters those cells and reproduces. Once it reproduces in high enough numbers, it moves it’s way down the respiratory tract and attacks lung cells. From there, it enters the whole body and attacks almost every organ system.

  
When you are vaccinated, your mucous membranes in the back of your throat are still relatively unprotected, because they lack the IgA antibody response at the mucous membrane level. This is why a vaccinated person is still showing high viral loads in their nasopharynx area when swabbed. However, once the virus tries to move down into the lungs, the very good vaccine induced IgGs that are circulating in a vaccinated person’s blood serum, quickly identify the virus and begin destroying it. The body then says, hold on…where’d these guys come from? The antibodies see the open door at the nasopharynx and then move the troops to destroy. This is the reason that vaccinated people are not getting as sick, even though they are getting technically infected and why vaccinated people are contagious for less time than unvaccinated people are. Our defense is delayed, at the upper respiratory tract, but we eventually have a neutralizing response.

  
This is why it became important for even vaccinated people to begin wearing masks. We still have several days of the virus successfully replicating in the backs of our throats, which means that when we cough, sing, laugh, talk loudly….we can pass those viruses to other people. This is new with the delta variant because it is better at unlocking those respiratory cells than other variants were. This is what changed. The previous variants were not as good, and it took them longer to unlock cells and replicate so our vaccine induced serum antibodies used to have more time to recognize and respond than they do now.

  
So what you’re seeing with vaccinated infected people is: sudden onset sore throat, dry cough from nasopharynx irritation, eventually a fever as the virus tries to make it down the respiratory pathway and your immune system activates, but then a marked reduction in symptoms that suggest that the virus has been unsuccessful at invading any other organ systems. This is your reduction in hospitalizations and deaths. The lungs never get so sick that the person requires oxygen. Vaccine IgGs are very effective at staving off a massive infection, but not great at stopping the virus from initially replicating in the throat.

  
This might suggest that we should focus efforts/funding into more research and development for nasal spray type vaccines (several are in trials) that produce better IgA response for virus neutralization at the mucous membranes which would be better at halting transmissions of the virus between people.""

TL;DR: the current vaccines help your body produce blood antibodies but not respiratory tract antibodies. COVID infects the back of your mouth &amp; throat because there are minimal antibodies to prevent initial infection, travels down into the lungs but is then neutralised by blood-borne antibodies. Hence, infected fully-vaccinated individuals display onset symptoms (cough, sore throat, fever) and still shed virus particles (which is why masks are still required), but don't get the serious disease caused by SARS-Cov-2 attacking the lining of blood vessels.

So, health journalists, let's all of you make a pledge not to use the word ""efficacy"" without saying what it means. Efficacy, in the context of these vaccines, is a measure of their prevention of infection, which was the metric of their approval studies.

From the Mayo study: ""In July, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization has remained high (mRNA-1273: 81%, 95% CI: 33-96.3%; BNT162b2: 75%, 95% CI: 24-93.9%), but effectiveness against infection was lower for both vaccines (mRNA-1273: 76%, 95% CI: 58-87%; BNT162b2: 42%, 95% CI: 13-62%)""

So we're talking about a Pfizer vaccine that, measured in July, would no longer be considered effective without a booster.

Look, it's not evil to say these things, nor is it antivax. What we need to ascertain is how much of this medicine, the most effective medicine we have, will be needed in order to better prevent being injured or harmed by covid. If the words that need to be said are ""ineffective after six months until a booster is administered,"" then just say that, so the boosters can be administered.
