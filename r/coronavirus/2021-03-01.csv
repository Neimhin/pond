We need to be objective, and engage in objective decision-making that involves calculated risks, like in all things.  In the pre-pandemic era, we took risks like driving 1000 miles in the winter to visit family for Christmas.  The risk of that was actually pretty high if the weather was bad.  But, we trusted ourselves and one another to make decisions; and those decisions *did* affect one anothers' safety, since more cars on that same road during a snowstorm raises everyone's risk level together, probably exponentially.

I hope they find a very middle-of-the-road and rational way to make their restrictions, and despite the absolute cringeworthyness of the misinformation, I hope they can drop their censorship as soon as it's safe to do so.

I compared death levels, not the wearing of masks.  You compared the wearing of masks.  We know masks for COVID saves more right now than preventing drunk driving.  We don't know that for the flu, and in fact all those studies you see about how masks don't work are always dealing with the flu.  There is a reason why masks were not seen as important because studies on the flu and masks have not shown as big of a decrease in spread.  We have seen that with COVID.  So I am comparing a known (deaths prevented) while you are not.  Although I would love to see studies do in depth dives of how much widespread mask wearing would help during flu season.

&gt; Why does it need to save a certain number of lives before you support a mask mandate? 

Why are yours different?  I am fully willing to admit there is a cost aspect of enforcing the rules vs. life benefit.  I know the benefit of wearing a mask right now for COVID is really high and well above something like drunk driving.  I don't believe masks for the flu are near that level.  Yet if I am wrong perhaps we should look into it.  We sure as shit should promote the wearing of masks if you are sick.  It is common many other places.  We also need rules to promote staying home from work and school during flu season.

I know you badly want to make me seem like a hypocrite, but I am not.  I am not advocating preventing all death.  It is impossible and becomes cost prohibitive.  Yet you are the one cool with telling people they can't drink and drive which causes way fewer deaths than would prevented by COVID mask mandates.  Sorry, but you are the hypocrite here.  You also have a level of deaths but for you it is not consistent.  Oh, and the CDC is also on my side for both COVID and the flu.  I am willing to debate those things but at the end of the day we have experts for a reason who should be listened to and followed.

This is possible if all expected deliveries continue, said outgoing Minister Hugo de Jonge (Public Health) Tuesday in the television program Op1.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Of the currently available vaccines (Moderna, AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech), two shots are needed. Of the vaccine of pharmaceutical company Janssen, which is expected to be approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) next week, we need only one shot.  
&gt;  
&gt;The government had previously reckoned that it would take until at least the beginning of autumn before everyone who wanted to would be at least partially vaccinated. However, based on recent experiences with the injection and delivery of the various vaccines, De Jonge is now more optimistic.  
&gt;  
&gt;The government is considering that about 85 percent of the 14 million adult Dutch people will be vaccinated. Two-thirds of these could be fully vaccinated by the beginning of July; the rest would have had one shot. According to the minister, we will have administered 18 million shots.  
&gt;  
&gt;De Jonge emphasises that everything ultimately depends on the deliveries from the various pharmaceutical companies. If they are disappointing, it could still take longer.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last week, 322,380 people in the Netherlands received a corona vaccine. This brings the total number of shots administered to 1,379,655.

Has Illinois not already eased restrictions? 

Did we not, here in Chicago, JUST announce higher capacity limits in bars and restaurants, as well as expanding service hours?

Have there not already been announcements about opening the lakefront, city parks, and other outdoor activities?

What you fail to realize is that a convention’s choice to pull out of McCormick Place is completely up to them. If they think there will still be a risk of low attendance, the organizers choose to cancel  or reschedule the event. Pritzker does not have some red phone on his desk to tell the King of Conventions that Chicago is a safe space this summer.

Of course there are outliers and circumstances where *someone* can form an issue as a result of a vaccination, but the point is that overall vaccinations are safe for nearly everyone, and furthermore, vaccinations help protect those who can't get vaccinated through herd immunity.

Stop perpetuating this shit that is literally harming humanity and setting us backwards in progress.  You are having the exact same influence as people during the era of the dark ages during the christian crusades in the 10th century.

Do you understand that?

Pause for a second a think about my statement.

You are actively sowing discord and questioning science.  Science, mind you, that has been tested a billion times by people who are far smarter than me, far smarter than you.

May I try an analogy?

Your car has a flat tire.

You walk into a mechanic shop with your car and say ""Hey I could really use some help.""

The mechanic walks over and says ""well, we can fix this if we pull this big nail out of the tire and patch it""

You say: ""listen here you stupid mechanic... I subscribe to cylindrical earth theory and I understand that the shape of my wheel has nothing to do with this nail, for you see the shape of the wheel is a torus and not a circle, therefore this nail is not impeding it's ability to hold air pressure.  Kindly stop lying to me and stop making me question my entire reality about this so-called nail stuck in my tire, that's not the reason my tire is flat.  I'm leaving this liberal establishment filled with facists and going elsewhere.""

Shut the fuck up on the internet, go get a hobby, stop sowing distrust in science.  Doctors and scientists who have spent their entire life ... learning about what every scientist before them has ever discovered and learned, and then applying that information to improve humanity..

and some shit stain idiot on the internet like you shows up and undoes all of it just because you suddenly have the capability of making facebook posts.

Here's another analogy:

A man once began work on a beautiful sculpture.  The year was 200CE.  He had such grand plans for this sculpture that it ballooned beyond the scope of his entire life.  He worked on it until his death, but he wrote down what he wanted to do.  His sons and daughters took up the chisels and continued his work where he left off.  The sculpture became more complex and more beautiful, more perfect.  Alas, the work was too much for multiple generations of people.  The man's family and the man's society continued to work on this for years, hundreds of years, and to this day in 2021, we still have an entire sect of people trying to achieve the perfect sculpture with their chisels and tools.  It's so intricate and complex it's something that you or I cannot even comprehend, but this sect of people have been improving on their tools, their notes, and their methods for hundreds of years, thousands of years.  Will it be complete this year?  Probably not, for the work can be improved yet still.

In this analogy, the sculpture is our understanding of medicine. 

We have been improving our tools for as long as written history has existed.  You showing up right now and tossing a wet blanket on all of science is like walking up to this grandiose sculpture that's been worked on for hundreds of thousands of hours, and saying ""this is really dumb and you should do it a different way, it's not going to work.""

Who the fuck are you to make that claim?

What I was saying is that while we can use the covid stats to make our decisions, it's not something where we wait for the virus to say A-OK, lockdowns do end when we choose to end them. We can make sacrafices to protect our fellow humans, yes. But as we have learned, its only a small group (proportionately) who are in danger. The CDC death rates by age:

0-19: 0.003%

20-49: 0.02%

50-69: 0.5%

70+: 6.4%

(From September 2020, I can't remember the updated stats off the top of my head but look at scenario 5: best estimate for IFR in [this link](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#table-1))

These make it clear that you are not in danger unless elderly or have multiple pre existing health conditions. So it's a little ridiculous to say to the majority of people to follow restrictions if the want to stay alive. We're all doing this for the at risk people, but there comes a point when the cost of these sacrafices far outweigh the benefits and people are not being unreasonable when frustrated in hearing others say 'oh variants, you still have to follow restrictions through summer'.

I've heard some rumors that AZ on average has worse side effects than Pfizer, but personally I got my first dose of Pfizer and felt like shit for two days so I'm not sure how much I buy into that, I suspect they are all similar on side effects. 

Studies show the full two dose AZ vaccine is very effective at preventing symptomatic COVID, and almost completely protective against hospitalization and death, so it's a great vaccine. The full two dose Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are *even more* protective than AZ against symptomatic COVID and also probably provide better protection than AZ against the South Africa variant (I'm guessing AZ will produce a booster to target the SA variant), so I guess if there is a choice of getting either and all other things are equal might as well get Pfizer or Moderna, but if I were unvaccinated and had a choice of getting AZ now or having to wait a couple months for a different vaccine to become available, I would get AZ without hesitation.

Saying children under 20, or even 16 aren't dying from covid is false, because children have died. 

Saying children are unaffected is also false.  Children have been getting MIS-C, which the CDC states they are still learning about and have no idea why some kids get it and don't. While most children will hopefully recover, some will die (even without the MIS-C), and we don't even know full long-term effects for children except some may need long term coronary care. 


&gt;It’s like ppl are outright ignore data and science to push unsubstantiated fear mongering.

Blanket statements that children are unaffected and won't die is like some people just outright ignore data and science to sound informed but really just ignore data points that don't fit their beliefs. 

My example of lung damage was just that, an example. Much like covid in adults we don't know true long-term effects as we're not exactly long term in the timeline.

The November data showed efficacy of 70% which is higher than what you get from a flu vaccine and way above the WHO threshold for what is deemed efficacious at 50% . 

However, in the case of a smaller sample of patients: instead of giving two full doses they were accidentally just given half of a full dose for their first injection and they then recieved a full dose second.  Doing it this way,  they found this order gave efficacy of 92+% 

Naturally, they wanted to confirm this was statistically sound and they repeated the trials doing it this way on a much larger sample size. 

In the meantime, the UK went ahead and approved the vaccine on the assurance that it would be at worst 70% effective, and at best 92%. Critically, the trial did not have a sufficiently representative number of over 65s. This would later make the EU apprehensive. 

Meanwhile, the EU wanted to demonstrate their independence from the UK and took far longer for approval to be granted. Thus, AZ prioritised contracts with the UK over the EU. 

Then down the line a supply shortage occurred cos AZ were upgrading a factory in Belgian in order to fulfill more orders long term. So buy that time most of the orders had be taken and this left the EU out in the cold. There was likely a good bit of politics and Brexit related political grandstanding that complicated things. 

But at no point did AZ botch the trial or bend their results. This vaccine came out of Oxford University, one of the best institutions in the world.

&gt;Texas will also do away with limits on the number of diners that businesses can serve indoors, said Abbott, who made the announcement at a restaurant in Lubbock.

A lot of this is book-keeping issues. For example if you pull your kid from a public school and enroll them in a legitimate home-schooling program offered in your state, sometimes that will be tracked correctly but other times there's a delay/problem resulting in students being ""missing"" until the end of the school year (and even then sometimes it requires manual record consolidation, because the homeschooling programs didn't include the state's unique identifier for the student).     

Aside from the data issues, which are very real, parents also common drop the ball in terms of paperwork (e.g. failure to notify the state that they're having their kid do an out-of-state home school program). This typically resolves itself when the parent gets a nasty-gram letter from the state, but things are backed up due to the sheer numbers involved.     

I guess my point is: This is likely a *real* problem (i.e. some kids aren't getting an education), but we have no idea how many/the scale, because even in more normal times keeping track of kids is a mess and tons of parents pulling kids out at the same time has amplified this problem.",,,1614715719,{},gpgbblv,False,t3_lw9zao,False,False,t3_lw9zao,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lw9zao/thousands_of_students_reported_missing_from/gpgbblv/,1614719009,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

But I do think (from an admittedly Western perspective) that this pandemic will,  along with 9/11, be the event where people will distinguish between 'before' and 'after'. I know it's a commonplace to talk about the prospect of a 'new normal' but just moving to a working culture where working from home (for a large part, not all by any means) of the workforce is a standard pattern has colossal implications for society.

Population density, interdependence of communities, and even things like car access/travel all have impacts in NY way more than OK. That's fine.

Most of the time, the snapbacks in cases happened after a big spike but prior to restrictions showing that the populace chose to restrict themselves without the government requiring it.

Either way, Oklohama is in the bottom 20% of all states with one of the worst healthcare systems to begin with.

They're also terrible from an education perspective too.

When you take everything into account OK isn't somewhere most people want to live. Average job opportunities but that's literally their only selling point.

The CDC study is data from June and July, and from a cursory glance their conclusion was that counties that implemented mask mandates saw decreases in that period while counties that did not saw increases.  The study also shows that while the counties that implemented them were fewer in number, they were larger in population.  So the urban counties experienced decreases after implementation and rural counties experienced increases at the same time.

Again I'll point out that correlation =/= causation.  It logically makes sense that the urban areas could have been hit first and were experiencing decreases due to already having been hit while rural areas were just beginning to being hit.  For example, here are the counties that implemented the mask mandate according to the CDC document and in parentheses their ranking in terms of deaths per million of Kansas counties:

Allen (91), Atchison (71), Bourbon (88), Crawford (32), Dickinson (38), Douglas (78), Franklin (50), Geary (74), Gove (1), Harvey (43), Jewell (64), Johnson (63), Mitchell (98), Montgomery (89), Morris (9), Pratt (21), Reno (34), Republic (17), Saline (41), Scott (6), Sedgwick (67), Shawnee (40), Stanton (66) and Wyandotte (47).

Average ranking is 51st in deaths per million in a state with 105 counties.  So again, overall, the counties that implemented mask mandates did not perform better in the long run.

I could be a bit off though, because restrictions were reinstated and it got under control pretty quickly like the previous times with much less impact on daily life than it seems most other countries had to resort to after letting things get out of hand, so frankly most of the people I know aren't glued to the news about it like people in the west. I admit I'm one of those people, though I'm from America so I still see daily news of the horror show over there.

Vietnam borders China, Cambodia, and Laos. It has major ports connecting many countries in the crowded region of the world it sits in the middle of and diaspora+student communities around the globe whose return the gov has handled well. Even if real numbers were ten times higher than my estimate, or ten times higher than the likely number reported after I stopped checking the numbers daily, Vietnam kicked ass at this from start to finish. And nobody got welded inside their apartment or tracked with invasive phone apps. It came down almost entirely to people's willingness to follow best practices. So I don't buy for a moment this notion that it's only islands or countries bordering hermit kingdoms that managed to pull it off. 

Vietnam was proactive and had a plan in place after the first SARS scare illuminated the fact that their national healthcare system couldn't handle the inundation that a pandemic would cause. It turns out that rich countries really couldn't handle that deluge either.

&gt;The Republican governor has faced sharp criticism from his party over the mandate, which was imposed eight months ago, as well as other COVID-19 restrictions on businesses that Texas will also scuttle starting next week. The mask order was only ever lightly enforced, even during the worst outbreaks of the pandemic.

&gt;The repealed rules include doing away with limits on the number of diners or customers allowed indoors, said Abbott, who made the announcement at a restaurant in Lubbock. He said the new rules would take effect March 10, although leaders in Houston and other big Texas cities were already reacting with alarm.

&gt;“Removing statewide mandates does not end personal responsibility,” said Abbott, speaking from the crowded dining room where many of those surrounding him were not wearing masks.

&gt;“It’s just that now state mandates are no longer needed,” he said.

&gt;The decision comes as governors across the U.S. have been easing coronavirus restrictions, despite warnings from health experts that the pandemic is far from over. Like the rest of the country, Texas has seen the number of cases and deaths plunge. Hospitalizations are at the lowest levels since October, and the seven-day rolling average of positive tests has dropped to about 7,600 cases, down from more than 10,000 in mid-February.

If you vaccinate a group of similar people and only 0.1% of them contract the illness, that's great, but you have no way of knowing whether that's a matter of not coming into contact with the virus or because the vaccine was effective.  


If you have a control group, and 10% of them contract the illness, while your vaccine group results in 0.1% contraction, now you've shown quantifiable reduction of transmission.  


That said, there's a lot of ethical considerations happening that don't generally apply to a 'normal' medical trial, from what I understand. For example, if I am presented with the opportunity to receive a vaccine, have a medical emergency, or become pregnant, I can call them and they will immediately unblind me and tell me whether or not I'm vaccinated. Some of the phase 2 trials have, at the end of their periods, informed recipients that they received the vaccine and administered a real vaccine to the placebo group at the end of the study.

My main problem is that governments do not deliver tracing data or at least describe the sources of their claims.
For example, did anyone actually test people who got food delivery from outbreak restaurants? Do they even ask positive people for delivery contacts? 

In the UK, they just started the debate about joggers infecting others. I don't believe that's a problem, unless you follow really closely for a longer period. But there's experts who believe it's a risk to the public, others say it's bullshit (which I guess it is).

But if the government would present data on 50 high-ventilation gyms where positive cases trained, as compared to low-ventilation ones, this would put an end to the debate. For the dirty details, perhaps there would still be a significant risk if you follow a jogger for half an hour or so, but for the public who feels threatened by joggers passing by, this data would be enough.

If it's really this horrible that a deep exhalation near someone will infect regularly, then this is not good, but at least some evidence from CCTV in shops or something like that will put an end to the debates, and be a more sound basis for mask mandates.

Why do you mean science says that?  


&gt;and MIS-C can have long term effects that we don’t yet fully know because it hasn’t actually been all that long.

Could you please provide the data your are referring to?  I’ve asked this already and yet you’ve failed to do so.  

&gt;	I didn’t say they were, so I am glad we can agree?

So, why are you arguing as though the data regarding deaths/cases for ppl under 20 was incorrect?

&gt;	I’m on mobile and formatting is already annoying, 

So, you actually don’t have the data to support what you’re arguing.  I’m on mobile rom and already posted the data.


&gt;so I’m not going to sort through statistics for you. 


So, you don’t have it.  Got it

&gt;I welcome you to do some fairly easy google searches to find the CDC information on this (or plenty of other health publications) if your legitimately interested. 

So, you can’t actually provide the data to support your argument and now demanding I do it for you?  

&gt;	You actually haven’t provided data in this comment chain 

I provided two links detailing the rates children contract, symptoms and deaths of covid and even one comparing that to the same with the flu. 

Please take a moment to look at them.  

&gt;Regardless, I’m not claiming any data is wrong, 

What about the data then I provided are you disputing?  

&gt;I am claiming that you, as the person in this chain that has said nothing other then children don’t die is wrong. 

They’re aren’t dying according to the data I provided.  Please take a moment to review that data so you have a clue what’s the context is.  You obviously haven’t!

&gt;Because factually whether an “anomaly” or not they can and have. 

Again, take a moment to read the data provided so you understand the discussion going on here.  

&gt;	Uhhh what? When did I even attempt to create disinformation? 

I provided data as to covid cases and death rate of children.  I’d yore claiming any of that is wrong please support that accusation.  If you can’t you’re doing nothing but spreading disinformation.

&gt;Nothing I said was factually incorrect. 

Are you still disputing the data I provided?

&gt;And as for ""an attempt to sensationalize this topic"", you started this entire conversation. 

Why am I sensationalizing buy providing data of covid cases and death of children?

&gt;I made a general comment (to a different user) that long term issues are possible, 

Could you provide what science you’re referring to?

&gt;because they are, and that as such like said user despite being likely to survive still didn't want to contract it.

Again, can you substantiate what you’re arguing?  What are you talking about?

&gt;	My end goal here was to agree with a general comment by another user that you tried to turn into some kind of weird pissing match with me. 


Why are you trying to discredit the data I’ve provided regarding children catching covid?


&gt;Literally nothing about policy or moving forward was discussed between me and that user or even you and me prior to our interaction.

So, you’re just fear mongering then since you for whatever reason have a problem with the data I provided showing children under 20 aren’t dying from
Covid?

&gt;	I’m not pushing fear of any kind. 

Denying the science and data that is known?

Why?


&gt;I’m not pushing anything, actually I didn’t even reply to you in this chain to begin with I replied to someone else and you took it upon yourself to tell me “It’s like ppl are outright ignore data and science to push unsubstantiated fear mongering”. 

Why are you ignoring the science?  Is there a goal to come on here and act like children under 20 are dying at rates adults are to covid?


&gt;Perhaps you should look back up through this chain and you will see I was advocating for the same thing the person above me was, not catching covid because despite being in an age group likely to survive I still don’t want it in my system as it can cause long-term issues. 


So why are you trying to deligitimize the science and data that exist regarding children under 20?

&gt;	haven’t said anything that isn’t searchable and relatively easy to find. 

So, why can’t you provide anything to support what you’re arguing here?

&gt;You can verify in a quick search that MIS-C can have long-term effects and that people under 20 die from covid. 

So, you don’t actually have the data and can’t speak intelligently on the topic?

&gt;Everything I have said came from CDC, Yale Medicine, WHO, the Mayo clinic and probably a couple others I have forgotten. 

Can you provide it then so we can discuss it?

&gt;You’re the one here who is trying to say people under 20 don’t die (false) 

What is false about the data I provided?  Please explain!!

&gt;and have no lasting effects (also false in the current “long term” that we are). 

I didn’t say that.  I asked you to provide details as to what you’re claiming I’m regards to
Long term effects on children and you haven’t.  Why?

&gt;	Idon’t disagree that the number of dead or long term illness is smaller in the younger age group, 

Drastically less as the data I provided shows.  

&gt;	I honestly don’t understand how we got to this point with you bringing up stuff that was never mentioned from a general comment I made to someone else. 

You calling into question the data I provided regarding covid for children under 20

&gt;If you’re looking for a debate with someone I don’t have the time or energy for it so you might want to try and find it somewhere else. Hope you have a wonderful day.

- Extraverted &amp; previously-busy buddies who are being pandemic-careful have more time for me now and everyone seems to text all the time.  

- Relationships with introvert buddies have deepened tremendously as we share more and more often.  

- Relationships with people who didn’t slow down during the pandemic are more or less on hold.  They’re about as busy as before but we aren’t getting together and the amount of time they spend typing to friends on the computer hasn’t increased.

[],,ZigZag3123,,,[],,,,text,t2_gmdsd,False,False,[],"Okay, wow, you’re really chasing shadows, and your other comments have come across as extremely anti-vax. The WHO definition is exactly the same, even down to “through vaccination or previous infection”, all they added was a recommendation to do that *through vaccination so that hundreds of thousands more don’t die*. I’m really not sure what point you’re trying to make there. You’re seeing nefarious intents in the WHO saying “we recommend vaccination”. No definition was changed and no science was erased; I have less than zero clue what you’re even talking about.

&gt;Note also how the Covid-19 vaccine does not prevent reinfection, does not provide immunity to the virus, and will still require masks and social distancing.

Every number I’ve seen shows 90-95% effectiveness. That’s just the nature of vaccines, and is more than enough to provide herd immunity. Once everyone received the vaccine, masks and distancing could be halted. Those precautions are only necessary until everyone gets the vaccine. The issue is with anti-vaxxers that will continue to spread it and keep us from achieving herd immunity—i.e. protecting those who are immunocompromised and thus aren’t benefitted by the vaccine.

&gt;Wasn't there a study done in California last year which estimated that the asymptomatic population was likely 40 times higher than what was being identified, meaning most of us probably had it and it didn't even affect us?

Maybe? You’re assuming that 40x in the early days equals 40x today, which doesn’t really make sense. And even if so, you said yourself that cases and deaths keep going up... so obviously we need greater immunity.

&gt;And what happened to the flu?

The flu is not a novel virus starting from zero, first of all. Second of all, COVID is extraordinarily transmissible, far far far more than the flu. I.e. those precautions work better on the flu than on COVID, but that doesn’t mean they’re ineffective. How else do you think COVID spreads? You think there’s some unexplained vector and the masks and distancing are just a ruse?

&gt;Why didn't anyone cancel Black Friday, but they wanted to cancel Thanksgiving?

What the hell are you talking about? Ah, okay, I can see those gears chugging in your head now. This is about “cancel culture”, some nefarious scheme to... cancel Thanksgiving and Christmas? People don’t travel for Black Friday, first of all, which is what the holiday concern was about. CDC also recommended against New Years and Super Bowl parties, is that cancel culture too? And pretty sure everyone saying “stay home” was also saying “don’t cram yourself pole-to-hole inside a Best Buy”.

&gt;If the government cares so much about our health, why are there no recommendations on healthy living? Take vitamins, eat right, get exercise, and get plenty of rest?

There are 100 quadrillion articles online telling you to eat healthy, exercise, and take vitamins, and a ton of those are from the government. Why are they not included in COVID recommendations? Because exercising and hitting your macros isn’t gonna protect you from a highly infectious airborne pathogen. Staying away from people does. You’re just yelling at clouds now.

&gt;I've got lots of questions, and you all should too. Remember what they taught you in school, there are no stupid questions. And it's how science works.

We do have questions, we’re asking and answering them and abiding by our findings. I.e. masking, distancing, and getting the vaccine to achieve herd immunity without incredibly unnecessary deaths. There may be no stupid questions, but there are incredibly stupid people saying incredibly stupid things because they don’t understand what questions to ask, much less the answers they receive. You say “that’s how science works”, yet you’re sitting here questioning the WHO and vaccines of all things, like you somehow know better than the entire scientific community.

ChAdOx1 (Oxford/Astrazeneca) may not be so great against the SA variant, and we have a lot to learn here.

**Vaccines Seem to Reduce Spread**

Milder cases, especially asymptomatic cases [are worse at spreading](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kcy2e0/weekly_question_thread_week_of_december_14/gg8tp7n/).  

[Pfizer's vaccine may prevent spread and disease.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/loljxz/effectiveness_results_of_the_pfizer_covid19/) Looks like the amount of virus in people who've gotten one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and then infected is [greatly reduced compared to those not vaccinated](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfiqma/decreased_sarscov2_viral_load_following/).  This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a great reduction in ability to spread the virus. [Maybe even with just one dose!](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242)

Any answer you get that is either ""yes"" or ""no"" is wrong, for now. We have only ""maybe, probably not"", and it's going to be that way for a long time.

In order to answer the question scientifically, it would require a ""challenge study"" where both vaccinated and unvaccinated people are deliberately exposed to the virus to see if transmission occurs.

The ethical concerns of deliberate exposure prevent us from performing these studies in humans.  It's the same reason that the vaccine trials took so long, we can't deliberately infect people to see if they need hospitalization or die. 

(EDIT: Well, now it looks like I [spoke too soon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/llw5cu/worlds_first_coronavirus_human_challenge_study/))

However, we did these studies with monkeys and the results look [*really good.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03041-6) They show strong immunity, or [sterilizing immunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/la4fud/immunogenic_bnt162b_vaccines_protect_rhesus/) from multiple vaccine types.  However, it's unlikely that sterilizing immunity would be found in most vaccinated humans, if we even get sterilizing immunity at all. This is still good news. 

Also, you'll notice that any reputable person talking about this subject always says ""may be able to spread"", or ""maybe"", or ""we don't know if"". And that's because there is a small chance that vaccinated people will be able to spread the virus. But it's not a big chance. Doctors, scientists, and regulators are being very careful with their language on this subject, some would argue they're being too careful. That said, if they were to say that ""vaccinated people cannot spread the virus"", and then we find out that in some situations that vaccinated people have spread the virus, [that would end up worse for them than if they hedge for a while.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/los8r9/daily_discussion_thread_february_21_2021/goa8cu0/) So at least to me, the way they're framing it seems pretty reasonable, you just have to put yourself in their shoes.

That said, they seem to be [saying what I've been saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s). 

**Additional Thoughts/Cool Stuff**

Testing and the Positivity Rate: It's been said a lot in other subs that the positivity rate should go up over time as more people are vaccinated and don't require testing. Last year, it was *the* metric to watch, but it will likely wane quickly in importance as overall testing drops.  Don't necessarily worry about sudden high positivity rates, as mass testing will likely drop off pretty quickly, particularly as testing sites are converted to vaccination sites. 

We may want to use our newly found testing and sequencing capacity to test and sequence a higher proportion of flu samples.  This might give us a head start on which flu genetics are circulating, and help eliminate a flu or two.  We're in the single digits of flu cases most places, which is awesome!

The problem is that you have to wait longer for the second dose, and therefore, full protection.

Just because [mRNA vaccines aren't 100% effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/)  against the SA variant, *doesn't* [mean that we'll definitely need boosters](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gmu581s/).

I like [thegracefuldork's prediction about vaccine availability](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lcatpp/daily_discussion_thread_february_04_2021/gm0bwc8/) more than my own previous prediction.  Not because it's ""rosier"", but because it's just better.

**Which vaccine should I get?**

When someone asks me what my favorite beer is, the answer is always the same.

It's the one in front of me.

So get the first vaccine you can, the differences are pretty minor.

**Booster questions to think about, I don't have answers**

(note: there's a difference between ""boost"" and ""booster"" here that needs to be understood.)

(also, what's the term for a mixture of sequences, heterogenous? Is my doubt about this term just from overthinking?)

(also also, I'm not convinced we're definitely going to need boosters, this is just fun to think about.)

Could a booster shot replace the second dose of a prime/boost regimen?

Should a booster shot use only one sequence of mRNA (or have all identical spike proteins), or should it have both/multiple?

For future vaccines, should the sequence/spike be the same for prime/boost or different?  If you have four spikes/sequences, would it make more sense to do two in each, or all four in each?

How much should we trust mutation modeling here? Should we anticipate future mutations and include them?  Are we good enough at that yet?

Do we need to give any non-booster doses to people who have recovered from infection?

Could we ""stretch"" doses of an mRNA booster by priming with a vaccine that's easier to manufacture, but maybe less effective (like ChAdOx1), and boost with the mRNA booster?  Could it be better or faster to prime with a current mRNA sequence and boost with an updated ChAdOx1?  Could we maybe do [this in the US?]( https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-first-covid-19-alternating-dose-vaccine-study-launches-in-uk) 

[**Conclusions**](https://gfycat.com/cleantalkativedassie)

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms.  This currently seems to also be true with post vaccination infection with any of the known variants. We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well. 

In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections and symptoms in those who do get infected. Therefore, vaccines should reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing an infection, each subsequent variant they are exposed to will just broaden their immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). So they'll have good and broad immunity to a variety of variants, which seems likely to be an indication that they won't catch or spread the virus as well in the future. Same thing happens when someone who is vaccinated is exposed to a new variant. Their immunity is broadened and strengthened by each subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. But remember, so many people will be less likely to spread the virus, so it's pretty unlikely that this reduced level of spread will be sufficient to sustain the virus in the way we have seen over the past year. So if a variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. If they don't become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing to have my mind changed on this with new information though, so don't take this as gospel.

From what I've seen conspiracy theories will flourish even with the truth, so I'm not sure there's much of a tradeoff there at all. Especially during a pandemic, that's just a naturally ripe event for the loonies to come out.



Maybe it's gotten lost in all the text but I don't necessarily think public health officials should be going around just lying every second. Obviously that will erode trust too much and ruin the chances of people listening. I started with the masks lie which people point to as a reason not to trust fauci and I strongly disagree with that (as I explained above).

Human Challenge Trials for Vaccine Development: regulatory considerations

&amp;#x200B;

**Human Challenge Studies to Accelerate Coronavirus Vaccine Licensure**

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32232474/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32232474/)

&gt;However, we argue that such studies, by accelerating vaccine evaluation, could reduce the global burden of coronavirus-related mortality and morbidity. Volunteers in such studies could autonomously authorize the risks to themselves, and their net risk could be acceptable if participants comprise healthy young adults, who are at relatively low risk of serious disease following natural infection, if they have a high baseline risk of natural infection, and if during the trial they receive frequent monitoring and, following any infection, the best available care.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Backed by a £33.6 million UK government investment, the first-of-its-kind study for this virus will involve ***establishing the smallest amount of virus needed to cause infection, which will give doctors greater understanding of Covid-19 and help support the pandemic response by aiding vaccine and treatment development.***  
&gt;  
&gt;***Over many decades, human challenge studies have been performed safely and have played important roles in accelerating the development of treatments for diseases including malaria, typhoid, cholera, norovirus and flu.*** The trials have also helped researchers establish which possible vaccine is most likely to succeed in phase 3 clinical trials that would follow, usually involving thousands of volunteers.",,,1614715076,{},gpg9ty3,False,t3_lw294q,False,True,t1_gpewidu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lw294q/worlds_first_coronavirus_human_challenge_study/gpg9ty3/,1614718259,1,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This is the result from real life data.  That's it, unless I'm missing something that you would like to point out.

You continue to ignore the real world data.  What is your excuse for Kansas? Or California? Or Norway?

If there were a clear correlation between mask mandates and overall deaths per million, don't you think there'd be several studies on it by this point?

Go through that list and determine where a mask mandate is helping.  I would argue that 85% of those cases are unaffected by mask mandates.  So even if masks were 80% effective (which they likely aren't in practice), you could reduce your case and death count by 12%, maybe?

I didn't categorically say anything of the sort - I said that you could potentially attribute some of the milder lingering COVID symptoms to psychological factors because mild fatigue, headaches etc are fairly commonplace. You've taken that and run away with interpreting this as saying all long haul symptoms are caused by anxiety. 

&gt;Where is the research confirming that post viral sequele is anxiety?

There's very little good, controlled/non-counfounded research on long COVID at all, so there's no way to assess how much of self reported symptoms are in fact related to past COVID diagnosis - the only statement made was that some people might attribute some of the milder symptoms months after to long COVID when we're not sure if that's the case. We'll know much more in a few months - as you've said yourself, budgets are only now really being allocated to treatment and study of long COVID. It's also odd that you're willing to completely dismiss the mental health aspects of having had COVID and their potential impact on anxiety. Lon

&gt;It is incredibly unlikely that people with 10+ symptoms, previously young and healthy, now so sick and bedridden, are sick due to anxiety and PSTD.

Again, no one is talking about people with 10+ symptoms but you. These people obviously have long COVID. You're arguing with yourself.

&gt;A coalition of health and tech companies, which includes Microsoft, Salesforce, and Oracle, is working on an initiative that aims to make it easier for people to access their COVID-19 vaccination records digitally. As people are beginning to get vaccinated against COVID-19, they may need to prove that they’re vaccinated so that they can return to work, school, or to travel, and having an easily accessible digital vaccination record could help with that. The coalition is calling itself the [Vaccination Credential Initiative (VCI)](https://www.vaccinationcredential.org/).

I don't expect it to be the sole thing, but I think in the future COVID and pandemics will play a much larger role in foreign and domestic policy of **every** state. I would expect that their spending on pandemics would be much larger than today. This used to be some hypothetical on the scale of an asteroid hitting the earth. It wasn't something taken seriously, let alone serious enough to devote significant resources to fighting it. Everyone now knows the cost in lives in the economic impact of a pandemic on the modern world. It's a real threat that countries will be working to stop in the future.

&gt;They fundamentally led to paradigm shifts. Covid hasn't. The very framework of ""normal"" changed. It hasn't with COVID.

&gt;...

&gt;The fall of the soviet union and the invention of the hydrogen bomb and Chinese civil war definitely will have longer effects than covid.

I disagree. For most of the world that wasn't part of the Soviet Union or in its immediate sphere of influence, it didn't have much impact on daily life (same with the Chinese Civil War). Yeah, there was some Cold War tension, but the fall of the Soviet Union didn't change much in the western world. It didn't change how most people worked, how they obtained food, how they educated their children, how they interacted with friends and family. COVID has done that for everyone everywhere.

Yes, if you were in an Eastern bloc state, when the Soviet Union fell, that was huge. If you were some random person in Kansas, it was an interesting thing you saw on the news and then you went about your day like normal. COVID effected everyone and how they do everything. And I do think it's going to change how the world works together, how they control people moving across borders, how they see emerging health crises in other states as a threat to their own safety.

Once the large, developed nations vaccinate their own people, they're going to be working with foreign governments to vaccinate their populations as well. It doesn't do any good to cure all of the US and the UK only for dangerous variants to arise in a less developed country and threaten to put us back into a pandemic. There would have been huge blowback to spending billions on foreign health in the past, but I don't expect it to be very contentious at all going forward.

It's going to change how people work, how people view education, the perception of illness and how it used to be fine to go to your workplace when you were clearly ill or send a sick child to school and now it's seen as a very bad thing. I think we're going to see big and lasting changes as a result of it. No, they may not be as big for an individual directly effected by the things you mentioned, but they're going to be large and lasting changes to how the world works as a whole.

In short, it might not change a single person's life as much as some of those things did to some specific people, but it's going to change everyone's life a little.

They're all doing it independently because it's what works best for them, the way water flows downhill. And there's no big mystical reason for why they're doing it. It's money, pure and simple. They have money, and they are afraid of losing their access to it.

Let's take universal healthcare, for instance. We have a whole industry based on health insurance. We have no idea what will happen to that industry if we implement universal healthcare. Probably nothing good. The whole point of universal healthcare is to get rid of the profit happening in between the doctors and hospitals and their patients. 

But it's not just the insurance industry that will suffer. All employers stand to lose a huge advantage in the employer-employee balance, here. Right now, employers are one of the only viable way for your average Joe to get healthcare. There are many many workers out there who will leave their jobs to retire early or pursue something independent if they didn't have to rely on their employers to provide health insurance.

So of course the people who are profiting from the way healthcare works today don't want universal healthcare. They lobby politicians (and by ""lobby"", I mean spend vast amounts of wealth on) to keep universal healthcare from being an option. Those politicians are now motivated to make their constituents think universal healthcare is bad. They also spend money to influence news stories that make universal healthcare sound bad. They fund studies and only publish the ones that make universal healthcare sound bad.

This is a far cry from vaccines causing autism or mind control. There's a clear motivation, here, and a clear path as to how we got here.

The US getting a large and steady supply of vaccines coming in from Pfizer and Moderna and soon also J&amp;J which all did early phase 3 trials in the US made it possible to maintain its high barriers for approval of AZ and Novavax, but I suspect the FDA would have waived these requirements to approve AZ in January if either a) the data from their phase 3 trials had fewer errors and showed higher efficacy or b) the Pfizer and Moderna trials hadn't finished so early and gone so spectacularly well.",,,1614708554,{},gpfukvm,False,t3_lvwwsx,False,True,t1_gpfcieu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lvwwsx/daily_discussion_thread_march_02_2021/gpfukvm/,1614710345,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Either way, it is *a fact* that Oklahoma allowed their citizens freedom *and* you were about half as likely to die of Covid in Oklahoma than New York.

The only person who's been strawmanning arguments is yourself. You are free not to continue, but again, as long as you make argument that I see are irresponsible and ill-founded, I will respond to them.

&gt;\&gt;  *You* are the one who dismissed legitimate concerns of those who want to end restrictions as merely selfish desires to ""socialize."" I did no such thing.

You've been appropriating the then delegitimizing the people who have suffered by people who have foregone precautions, and then want to continue to forego precautions before reaching herd immunity. It clearly shows that you don't really care about people who have suffered under this pandemic and are willing to appropriate the suffering (physical, mental, etc) of others for your rhetoric. You did that. No one else but you.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt; I just pointed out that you are woefully out-of-touch and have no business pretending to understand the plight of those you are trying to pass judgment on, and that clearly struck a nerve. 

Lol says the person who's been appropriating my family's emotional and financial situation from this pandemic. You don't have any arguments so continue to appeal to the suffering of others that your policy would actually exacerbate the suffering of.

&gt;Whatever - that's your problem. 

That a everyone problem if people like you can mess up the progress that's been made before we reach herd immunity.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No one else is reading at this point, and I could give less of a shit if I change *your* mind.

Get better arguments then.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt; The fact that you *still* can't acknowledge the possibility that someone might have an honest, well-intentioned disagreement with you over what policy is the most sensible - that to you, they're just selfish, full stop - is proof that you're just another armchair intellectual living in a bubble, whom no one needs to listen to.

If only you had ""honest, well-intentioned disagreement"". Your arguments have only been based on ill-formed logic and selfishness, masked by the appropriation of the suffering of others and ad hominem attacks.

Herd immunity is not an on/off switch. There will be a gradual reduction in infections and hospitalizations until the level is manageable. The question is where that threshold lies.

So have you finally figured out the fact that I'm not a ""zero-covid"" person and now you just want to attack herd immunity? Until you reach herd immunity, you don't have adequate social protection from such a virus to warrant reducing social precautions. That's when you're out of the woods in terms of social precautions. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt; *Reasonable* people can have *reasonable* disagreements over where the line ought to be drawn. 

I wish I was talking to one right now....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt;  Despite not even understanding how herd immunity works, you see fit to shout the term in the faces of everyone who thinks we're already on a sufficient downward trend that we should start opening up to alleviate the effects of these restrictions.

Again tall talk from someone who thought herd immunity meant I was for ""zero COVID"", you're sounding like someone who had to wikipedia the term just now, although you still don't have a full grasp on why it's an important threshold for many epidemiologists.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt; Could it *possibly* be that maybe those people are aware of all the concerns you've raised, potentially have more at stake than you do, and have simply reached a different conclusion about the relative risks?   **Nah**. They're just being selfish, and don't care about other people at all - decrees the dude comfortably working from home while other people file for unemployment benefits.

How many nurses are urging people to open back up? Go appropriate their suffering too....

From the article:

EL PAÍS looks at how the country’s Covid-19 inoculation drive will progress under several different scenarios: at the current speed, at the rate of the United States and if first doses are prioritized

Spain has administered two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine to 2.6% of the population. Although the pace of the vaccination drive picked up in the last week of February, the rollout has been more or less steady over the month: every day, 0.17% of the population are injected with one dose, which equates to around 500,000 people per week. At this rate, the European Union’s target of vaccinating 70% of the adult population before the summer – amounting to 58% of Spain’s total population – will not be met.

As the graph below shows, if the current speed is maintained, barely 20% of the total population will have received two doses by September.
-



Spain’s regions – which are in charge of the vaccination campaign as well as handling the response to the pandemic in their territories – have been prioritizing the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, in accordance with the Health Ministry’s protocol. The three vaccines that have so far been approved by the EU – from Moderna, Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca – all require two doses, separated by a specified interval. As a result of this strategy, the first dose is administered for around three weeks, then alternates with the second dose for another three-week period. The solid lines on the graph represent the evolution so far: about 3% of Spaniards have received both doses and another 1% have received the first dose and are waiting for the second. The dashed lines show how the numbers of people vaccinated will evolve if the current rate is maintained.

To reach the 70% target, weekly vaccinations in Spain will have to increase fourfold. The central government is confident this will happen. The Health Ministry announced that 6.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer vaccine would arrive in Spain by the end of March. And there million-euro contracts for the new vaccine by Janssen – which only requires one dose – and the vaccine by CureVac for the coming months. However, for Spain to be able to quadruple the number of weekly doses administered, two conditions must be met: the vaccines must arrive on time – there have been delays in the past – and it must have the capacity to administer them.

In general, Spain has been administering vaccines at the rate at which they have been arriving. As of February 25, Spain had administered 87% of doses received, one of the highest percentages in the European Union, according to data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which has pointed to limited supply as the biggest challenge to the EU rollout. Spain has not yet had a problem administering the received doses, but it could start to become one. While the first phase of Spain’s vaccination campaign targeted staff and residents of care homes, frontline health workers and adults in need of daily care who were not in residences – who can be easily located – the next stage includes members of the general population, such as essential workers, which may present difficulties. “Vaccinating professional groups is more complex,” explains Jaime Jesús Pérez, a doctor from the Vaccinology Association. “You have to have at least two weeks just to organize the information on who gets vaccinated and who doesn’t.”


The country with the fastest vaccination campaign is Israel, where 37% of the population have received two doses and 53% have received the first. This has been achieved by vaccinating more than 200,000 people a day – the equivalent of 2% of the population. In Spain, this rate is 0.17%, nearly one-third of the speed in the United States (0.45%) and the United Kingdom (0.5%)

Best-case scenarios
The speed of the vaccination drive in Spain is likely to accelerate. In fact, 30% more doses were administered in the last week of February than the previous week. As well as receiving more vaccines, the country is also learning how to optimize the process. As Jesús Pérez points out: “We are seeing the usefulness of mass vaccination points, such as sports centers, which are going to be key when there are more vaccines. A lot of people can arrive at the same time and wait while maintaining a safe distance, something that is impossible at a health center.”

The question is whether the rate will increase enough to reach the goal of immunizing 70% of adults by summer. Here’s how vaccination would progress in three possible scenarios.


Four times the number of doses. Last week, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez told the lower house of parliament, the Congress of Deputies, that the number of vaccines arriving would increase fourfold in the second quarter of the year. The repercussions of this are evident in the graph below, which shows how the number of people vaccinated would progress if, as of April 19, the number of doses administered is multiplied by four. With this acceleration, by the beginning of September, around 58% of people would be vaccinated, surpassing the threshold of 70% of adults.


At the US rate. Another optimistic reference based on the actual experience of other countries is to assume that the rate of vaccination in Spain can match the current rate in the US, where 0.45% of the population receives one dose a day. It would not, however, be enough to reach the EU’s goal: 50% of the entire population would be vaccinated by the end of the summer, accounting for 60% of adults.


And if just the first dose is administered?
The above scenarios are all simulations based on the same strategy, which is the one followed in Spain: second doses are always prioritized, so that there are three weeks in which a group of people receive their first dose and then another three weeks in which the same people receive a second. In this way, there are periods of three weeks where only one dose is given and another three-week period where the second dose is given.

Spain’s regions have so far followed this strategy, with the idea that it guarantees maximum protection for the groups being vaccinated. As can be seen in the graph below, there are three weeks when only the line representing first doses goes up; then it stops and the line for the second dose starts to rise.


The model is not perfect, because there are exceptions and because regions can vaccinate at different speeds. And it will most likely become less clear as time goes by. For the moment, it is confirmation that Spain, like most of Europe, is following a vaccination protocol that seeks to maximize the number of people who have received both doses.


But this is not the only viable strategy. In the UK, the authorities opted from the outset to administer as many first doses as possible and to postpone the second doses – from Pfizer and AstraZeneca – by up to 12 weeks. The aim is to reduce the spread of the virus as soon as possible by immunizing as many people as possible: in the first three months the pace is very fast and the number of people who have at least partial protection doubles.


The following graph shows what the situation in Spain would be like if the country had followed a strategy similar to the one in the UK. At the current speed of the Spanish vaccination drive, 5% of the population would have received at least one dose and almost 20% would have received one by the end of May, when second doses would begin to be administered. By the end of the summer, 25% of the population would have received one dose and about 20% would have been given two doses.


Most countries rejected the UK strategy because the outcome was less assured – the results of the Pfizer or Moderna trials had focused on testing efficacy of two doses separated by three to four weeks. But studies using data from Israel and the UK are finding that the first dose already offers considerable protection against Covid-19 and the risk of hospitalization. It may also prevent up to 50% of transmission one month after being administered. Epidemiologist Miguel Hernan of Harvard University published a study on the effects of the vaccine in Israel over the past few weeks that confirmed that one dose can provide a high level of protection, but also pointed to the superior efficacy of the second dose. “Our results indicate that a single dose is effective, although not as effective as two doses,” he says. “This is not surprising. It was already seen in the clinical trial. It will be interesting to see in future studies whether spacing the doses further apart increases effectiveness after the second dose.”

As we have seen time and again during this pandemic, choosing strategies is a matter of risk management as decisions have to be made based on incomplete information. “As of today, there is no solid data to confirm the superiority of using existing vaccines to prioritize first doses [as the UK does] rather than to complete the vaccination regimen in three-to-four-4 [as virtually all other countries do],” says Hernan. “With the information currently available, both strategies can be justified. Fortunately, in two to three months, when vaccine availability is much greater, this debate will cease to be relevant.”

""There isn’t much for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, as trials did not compare different dose spacing or compare one with two doses. The trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine did include different spacing between doses, finding that a longer gap (two to three months) led to a greater immune response, but the overall participant numbers were small."" https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n18

My understanding is that immunology is really complicated and no one would be able to say for sure without the data, but based on other vaccines it's is quite possible that a prolonged interval between the first and second dose would lead to a stronger and more lasting immune memory than a shorter interval for the mRNA vaccines as well. I mean, obviously giving the two doses 1 day apart would not be good, but we don't know if the best combo is 3 weeks or 3 months or 9 months apart because it was not tested.",,,1614699236,{},gpf9fce,False,t3_lvwwsx,False,True,t1_gpf5q87,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lvwwsx/daily_discussion_thread_march_02_2021/gpf9fce/,1614699301,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Fauci has specifically said that the vaccines don't allow for return to normal life, and that they may still allow the virus to spread. It's here: https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/02/22/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-6/

&gt;So there are things, even if you’re vaccinated, that you’re not going to be able to do in society: for example, indoor dining, theaters, places where people congregate.  That’s because of the safety of society.  You, yourself, what you can do when you are together with another person, we are looking at that, and we’re going to try and find out very quickly what recommendations could be made about what people can do. 

&gt;One of the things that’s universal here that we know: that at this point in time, it is unclear whether when you get vaccinated and you might be protected from clinical disease, which is the primary endpoint of the vaccine studies, that you could conceivably be infected, have virus in your nasopharynx, and at that same time have no symptoms, which is the reason why we recommend and say you still need to wear a mask.  Because if you do have virus in your nasopharynx, even though we hope that when the data comes in, it’s going to show that the virus level is quite low and you’re not transmitting it, we don’t know that now.  And for that reason, we want to make sure that people continue to wear masks despite the fact that they’re vaccinated.

The reason minimal Covid restriction states have more cases per capita but fewer deaths per capita is because there was no testing at the beginning of the pandemic.

The case count in April peaked at 33,000 while deaths were around 2,200.  In January cases peaked at 255,000 and deaths were 3,400.  The urban states (New York, New Jersey) had their biggest outbreaks in April when testing was low but before treatments were better and the governments sent positive Covid patients back to nursing homes.  That led to low case/person and high death/person metrics.

There's also another factor in that if there's minimal restrictions people less at risk are more likely to go out and do things and get the virus instead of older, more at risk folks.

So what changed? The system changed. The food industry changed. They started pumping sugar and HFCS in everything. Scientists in labs started developing food like substances that induced cravings by tricking the brain into thinking they weren't unhealthy trash. 

No amount of moral lecturing will fix what is a problem of capitalism. The fixes must be systemic as well e.g. not just repeating the same slogans to individuals about how junk food is bad that they've been ignoring for 30 years.

But regardless of your risk of getting it, the point is about the harm that comes from getting it. Covid is bad because it can kill you, but the risk of Covid killing a young person is minuscule, dwarfed by the other causes of death. This doesn’t mean it is 0 risk, but something like car accidents are 10x more dangerous for someone your age and we don’t shame people for driving. For young people, the risk of driving to places is much much higher than the risk of hanging out at those places. 

Now you can make the point that young people can spread it to higher risk older people. Once the vaccine has been offered to those higher risk groups, no need to worry about them as the vaccines are nearly 100% effective at preventing serious illness and death. So even if your young friends aren’t vaccinated, they are not and never have been at any significant risk from Covid.

Like I said, lockdowns aren't necessary if the governments did contact tracing right and properly enforced mask wearing and social distancing.

Also you are confusing cause and effect. The worst hit places had no choice but to do a lockdown because the other measures were not properly done.

There are many variables determining whether hospitals can cope with the number of patients needing ICU. It's not just lockdown, but also whether people stay inside all the time (depends on the weather), average age, mask wearing compliance, number of available ICU beds...

I wasn't aware of the scandals in the UK. But I can't say it surprises me. UK politics seem to be in the gutter since the Brexit referendum.

Maybe there is something fishy going on in the UK, but still, I find it hard to believe politicians wouldn't like to announce victory and end all measures and get the votes as soon as possible? 

In Belgium the experience has been that politicians promised to not repeat lockdowns during summer but then they also forgot to properly contact trace and test and enforce mask wearing and quarantines for infected people. So the numbers kept rising until they had to announce a second lockdown because hospitals were nearly full.

Those same politicians are now trying to relax some rules here and there but hospitals are already filling up again due to all the variants we let in. All epidemiologists are advising not to relax any rules.

Vitamin D isn't ignored here in Belgium but it only helps if taken systematically over a long period. I think ivermectin is already used in hospitals for some time, treatments in general have improved quite a lot since the beginning but people are still dying.

I asked why do you think China did a lockdown? Like you said the number of total deaths must have been much higher than they reported.

The Chinese government isn't exactly known for shutting down the economy to save a couple of lives.

This is just dumb and an absurd attempt to dismiss verified patterns of infection rates by pointing out outlier anomalies.  You’re ignoring the science.

Ppl under 20 aren’t susceptible to the virus anything close to the rest of the population 

&gt;	Saying children are unaffected is also false. 

Use your head and try interpreting the actual data that is known regarding infection rates by age.  

&gt;	Children have been getting MIS-C, which the CDC states they are still learning about and have no idea why some kids get it and don’t. 

What is the per capita rate children are getting this?

&gt;While most children will hopefully recover, some will die (even without the MIS-C), and we don’t even know full long-term effects for children except some may need long term coronary care.

Again, at what rate are children getting this?  Is it 1 in 10,000 or 1 in 1,000?  Please provide the data as to the frequency children are being affected.  

&gt;	Blanket statements that children are unaffected and won’t die is like some people just outright ignore data and science to sound informed but really just ignore data points that don’t fit their  beliefs.

What science and a data are you suggesting is being ignored?  I’ve offered actual data that shows just how minimal the impact on children are.  If you’re claiming that data was wrong please provide something to support that claim.  Till you do that you’re doing nothing but trying to create disinformation in an attempt to sensationalize this topic.

&gt;	My example of lung damage was just that, an example. 

Again, Could you please provide data that shows how frequent children are developing such health issues due to covid?

&gt;Much like covid in adults we don’t know true long-term effects as we’re not exactly long term in the timeline.

Why does this even mean?  Are you suggesting policy based on “we just don’t know” and ignoring the science that is known?

Why, what is your end goal here suggesting to suggest we ignore the science/data that is now available when formulating how we move forward with this virus?  

&gt;	So if i understand what your asking is about right now? We do know there can be long term issues for children. 

We know exactly infection rates, deaths and the effects covid has on the population by age grout.  What data are you utilizing here to push this fear over covid and what is it you’re advocating for?

Please explain yourself!

&gt;Are they all lung related? Probably not, are they potentially serious resulting in long term issues and death? Yes.

Additionally, they recommended that people not stay in shared public spaces for more than a half hour to avoid breathing in enough suspended aerosols to exceed what scientists believed to be the threshold of viral load to cause infection.  So, you do not hold some secret to viral spread that they overlooked.  

I really dont have to go up into the attic with a flashlight because I already knew what you did about the continual lofting of dust due to thermal circulation. There is more than one way to keep dust aloft and kicking it up from your floor is only one way. My mention of that one way does not imply that there are no other ways.

But it seems I must repeat myself. Virus particles are sticky and unlike a dust particle, once they land, they do not become airborne again by a mere thermal circulation of air.

I'm not ignoring the science. Science says children can die from Covid, and MIS-C can have long term effects that we don't yet fully know because it hasn't actually been all that long.

&gt;Ppl under 20 aren’t susceptible to the virus anything close to the rest of the population

I didn't say they were, so I am glad we can agree?

&gt;What is the per capita rate children are getting this?

I'm on mobile and formatting is already annoying, so I'm not going to sort through statistics for you. I welcome you to do some fairly easy google searches to find the CDC information on this (or plenty of other health publications) if your legitimately interested.

&gt;What science and a data are you suggesting is being ignored? I’ve offered actual data that shows just how minimal the impact on children are. If you’re claiming that data was wrong please provide something to support that claim.

You actually haven't provided data in this comment chain other then you said ""Nonetheless, children under the age of 20 aren’t dying from covid."". Regardless, I'm not claiming any data is wrong, I am claiming that you, as the person in this chain that has said nothing other then children don't die is wrong. Because factually whether an ""anomaly"" or not they can and have. Whether that data point is small or not is still data.

&gt;Till you do that you’re doing nothing but trying to create disinformation in an attempt to sensationalize this topic.

Uhhh what? When did I even attempt to create disinformation? Nothing I said was factually incorrect. And as for ""an attempt to sensationalize this topic"", you started this entire conversation. I made a general comment (to a different user) that long term issues are possible, because they are, and that as such like said user despite being likely to survive still didn't want to contract it.

&gt;Why does this even mean? Are you suggesting policy based on “we just don’t know” and ignoring the science that is known?  
&gt;  
&gt;Why, what is your end goal here suggesting to suggest we ignore the science/data that is now available when formulating how we move forward with this virus?

My end goal here was to agree with a general comment by another user that you tried to turn into some kind of weird pissing match with me. Literally nothing about policy or moving forward was discussed between me and that user or even you and me prior to our interaction.

&gt;We know exactly infection rates, deaths and the effects covid has on the population by age grout. What data are you utilizing here to push this fear over covid and what is it you’re advocating for?

I'm not pushing fear of any kind. I'm not pushing anything, actually I didn't even reply to you in this chain to begin with I replied to someone else and you took it upon yourself to tell me  ""It’s like ppl are outright ignore data and science to push unsubstantiated fear mongering"". Perhaps you should look back up through this chain and you will see I was advocating for the same thing the person above me was, not catching covid because despite being in an age group likely to survive I still don't want it in my system as it can cause long-term issues. Literally had nothing to do with anything else and wasn't even directed at you.

&gt;Again, what data are you using? Is there any or are you simply looking to stoke fear?  
&gt;  
&gt;Please explain yourself and your lack of verifiable evidence to support whatever it is you’re advocating for..

Again, not looking to ""stoke"" fear. I haven't said anything that isn't searchable and relatively easy to find. You can verify in a quick search that MIS-C can have long-term effects and that people under 20 die from covid. Everything I have said came from CDC, Yale Medicine, WHO, the Mayo clinic and probably a couple others I have forgotten. You're the one here who is trying to say people under 20 don't die (false) and have no lasting effects (also false in the current ""long term"" that we are). I don't disagree that the number of dead or long term illness is smaller in the younger age group, I also literally never said this, but you seem to be trying to use it as a gotcha moment, but to say it doesn't happen is false.

I honestly don't understand how we got to this point with you bringing up stuff that was never mentioned from a general comment I made to someone else. If you're looking for a debate with someone I don't have the time or energy for it so you might want to try and find it somewhere else.

&gt;For both vaccines approved for use in the UK,the virus neutralization titres and efficacy are higher after two doses than one. There is therefore a higher risk of virus replication under  partial  immunity after  one  dose  than  after  two  doses,  so  in  the  short-term, delaying the second dose would be expected to somewhat increase the probability of emergence of vaccine resistance -but probably from a low base.

&gt;Whilst  the neutralization titres seen  after  one  dose  of  vaccine  are  lower  than  the median titre of convalescent plasma, they are within the lower range of responses seen following natural infection.

However,

&gt;It is a realistic possibility that over time immune escape variants will emerge, most likely driven by increasing population immunity following natural infection.

Unlike with antibiotic resistance, there are many ways we might end up with antibody (vaccine) resistance. Yes, it might come from people getting infected between their first and second doses of Pfizer/Moderna. Or from people given one dose of J&amp;J or any of the other weaker vaccines. Or following a natural infection--this may be how the UK and SA variants arose.

From a variant evolution standpoint, is it more important to have fewer people with imperfect immunity or to suppress the spread rapidly so that people with imperfect immunity come into contact with the virus less often?
