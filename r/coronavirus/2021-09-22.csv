But really, they are only trying to convince themselves. **If they really didn't think it was true, they wouldn't mind other people finding out about it.**

Think about it like this. Let's say the gas station down the street is giving away free gas. You go down there and say ""Is the gas really free?"" And people are just like ""Yeah! Go inside and get your voucher!"" So you go in and then you realize that the gas is free for members only. So you become a member, but all you want is the gas. So you get your voucher, fill up your car, leave, and never come back. Well, sooner or later your gas tank is empty and you see a post online from that gas station telling people to go down and get free gas, **but you made a decision to never go back and you need to feel justified in it.** In your own head, there's a question, you think, ""Did I really give up free gas for life? What would make me turn down the offer of free gas for life? That sounds like a great deal! Other people are going to go to the gas station, fill up their car for free, and it's going to go very well for them, **and they are going to wonder why I'm not doing the same. I don't want to seem foolish!** But wait! Maybe if I tell them that the gas is actually dangerous, and that it broke my car. Then people won't think I'm a fool!""

So, in order to prevent other people from thinking badly of them, they decide to start a rumor that the gas actually broke their car. They start posting online that the gas from that gas station is actually full of lead, and not safe, and that it's killing people! Even though that's not true.

They know the free gas is completely fine. They know it. And so the only option they have is to live in a world where the free gas *isn't* fine. Or else what are they giving up?

A judge in Groningen has ruled that. The boy went to court because he wants to visit his seriously ill grandmother who is suffering from lung cancer. He is afraid that he might infect his grandmother and that she could eventually die from it.

&gt; The ruling was already made the day before yesterday, but has now been brought out. The boy's divorced parents are on bad terms with each other and cannot agree on their child's vaccination. The mother allows her son to be vaccinated, but the father is against vaccination and testing of his son. The boy let it be known that he did not feel heard by his father and therefore went to court.

&gt; The father says he is worried about side effects of the vaccine and the long-term consequences. He argued in the court case that the risks of side effects are outweighed by the vaccination. In the ruling, the judge explained up front that children can indeed get corona.

&gt; Less sick
&gt; Children, according to the judge, on average get sick less badly and less often than adults, but can still get sick for a long time or experience long-term effects of the disease, such as lung covid. ""Further, the risk of infecting others is significantly lower among vaccinated than unvaccinated people,"" the judge said in the ruling. The boy may now be vaccinated immediately.

&gt; Children aged 12 to 17 have been allowed to decide since July whether to be vaccinated against corona or not. However, 12- to 17-year-olds may only decide this in consultation with their parents.

While I agree there is a gray area in what would have been acceptable, the ultimate basis of approval was studies that addressed ""symptomatic illness."" 

Yess, they would rightly have approved a vaccine that only ""decreased severity"" in 51% of recipients, or for that matter, even fewer, if the safety record was acceptable. Even a minor benefit for a vaccine is acceptable as long as there is safety. 

And I think the same standard should be applied to the boosters: if they can safely show prevention or decreased severity in half of recipients, they should be approved. Right now, the odds ratios for third shots in Israel widely exceed that benefit.

That is why I support the ongoing effort to improve the vaccine's effectiveness, and I simply do not understand the rationale for accepting a situation that can be demonstrably improved.

Not entirely correct and I've explained in other instances. 

COVID death rate is heavily age stratified. Take this [graphic](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/covid-pandemic-mortality-risk-estimator) from The Economist. Add vaccination to the risk assessment and you will end with about 1/10 of risk of death for elderly (and other conditions) in comparison to no-vaccine. This still means a lot of deaths.

Of course, those who refuse vaccination are at higher risk. You can see however the risk for a vaccinated 80yo may be comparable to an *unvaccinated* 60yo.

subs yes but don't forget how the games have lines that play separately. 

""Teams must register a minimum of 15 players and 2 goalkeepers at the first Directorate meeting, held the evening before the tournament starts.  
Game Rosters are set with a maximum of 20 players and 2 goalkeepers per team.""

with six at a time (5 skaters plus a goalie) so if somehow a whole line got knocked out you'd be down to playing 2 lines versus the other team's three which may not hurt so bad that first game, but any subsequent games or any overtime games would suck balls.

yes, i got skeleton and luge confused, though in fairness they look pretty dang similar haha.

gibb could only play because his partner test positive at prior to the event. if they were in the quarterfinales or something when he tested positive that team would just be out. that would happen to any team event. they would just play without those players for the remainder of the event but there wouldn't be added players who weren't on the team on the first day.

The COVID vaxx only introduces the protein spike of the virus shell to your body, it's 100% inert, zero chance of actually getting COVID from it. Would be like worrying about getting food poisoning from a plate with no food on it.

When you get the mRNA vaccine, a tiny little piece of mRNA code gets passed on to your cells near the injection site, and causes those cells to build a bunch of the little spike/sucker looking bits we all know from various illustrated pics of the COVID virus. There's no virus, it's just those little protein strands. They leave your cells, your body identifies them as foreign and attacks them...and now your immune system recognizes this protein spike.

If you happen to actually get exposed to COVID after that, your immune system immediately attacks and kills the virus instead of allowing it to fester and explode inside you for several days while coming up with the correct response.

Inoculation on the other hand is the practice of introducing your body to a version of the actual disease so that you can build immunity to it, and there is a legitimate risk of you getting ill from that.",,,,,,,,,1632415565,,,{},hdzedbs,False,t3_pts290,False,False,t1_hdz3k6d,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pts290/federal_court_antivaxxers_do_not_have_a/hdzedbs/,,26,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,1,[],[],1632545071.0,

IMO instead of this battle for the highest protection percentage, more focus should be put on cost-benefit-analysis for the low-vaccinated groups.

Going to the [CDC COVID Data Tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total) though, right now 64% of the eligible population has been fully vaccinated (55% of the total population); in the last month they've only given 2.3 million more doses, even though there's plenty of vaccine available - which implies that the other 35% of the eligible population is not planning on getting vaccinated any time soon.

Case it point, the Florida numbers have doubled from yesterday on Covidestim and the Minnesota numbers have dropped largely. This shows that the model is very reactionary to changes in the raw data. 

It's not really a conspiracy. You are just using a statistical model for an incorrect purpose. The model is useful to predict future trends, not to actually determine the current number of cases per capita.

But this is not necessarily the case outside the EU. Moreover, techniques such as machine learning that use AI are limited by the quality of the available data. Researchers have revealed many instances in which algorithms that were intended to improve decision-making in areas such as medicine and criminal justice reflect and perpetuate biases that are common in society. The field needs to develop standards to indicate when data ‚Äî and the algorithms that learn from them ‚Äî are of sufficient quality to be used to make important decisions in an emergency. There must also be a focus on transparency about how algorithms are designed and what data are used to train them.

The hunger with which Drakopoulos‚Äôs offer of help was accepted shows how eager policymakers are to improve their ability to respond in an emergency. As such algorithms become increasingly prominent and more widely accepted, it could be easy for them to slide, unnoticed, into day-to-day life, or be put to nefarious use. One example is that of facial-recognition technologies, which can be used to reduce criminal behaviour, but can also be abused to invade people‚Äôs privacy (see Nature 587, 354‚Äì358; 2020). Although Eva‚Äôs creators succeeded in doing what they set out to do, it‚Äôs important to remember the limitations of big data and machine learning, and to develop ways to govern such techniques so that they can be quickly ‚Äî and safely ‚Äî deployed.

Despite a wealth of methods for collecting data, many policymakers have been unable to access and harness data during the pandemic. Researchers and funders should start laying the groundwork now for emergencies of the future, developing data-sharing agreements and privacy-protection protocols in advance to improve reaction times. And discussions should also begin about setting sensible limits on how much decision-making power an algorithm should be given in a crisis.",,,,,,,,,1632423963,,,{},hdzysrd,True,t3_pu2a4c,False,True,t1_hdzyrzp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pu2a4c/greece_used_ai_to_curb_covid_what_other_nations/hdzysrd/,,2,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],[],1632555240.0,

In many countries, travellers are chosen for COVID-19 testing at random or according to risk categories. For example, a person coming from a region with a high rate of infections might be prioritized for testing over someone travelling from a region with a lower rate.

By contrast, Eva collected not only travel history, but also demographic data such as age and sex from the passenger information forms required for entry to Greece. It then matched those characteristics with data from previously tested passengers and used the results to estimate an individual‚Äôs risk of infection. COVID-19 tests were targeted to travellers calculated to be at highest risk. The algorithm also issued tests to allow it to fill data gaps, ensuring that it remained up to date as the situation unfolded.

During the pandemic, there has been no shortage of ideas on how to deploy big data and AI to improve public health or assess the pandemic‚Äôs economic impact. However, relatively few of these ideas have made it into practice. This is partly because companies and governments that hold relevant data ‚Äî such as mobile-phone records or details of financial transactions ‚Äî need agreed systems to be in place before they can share the data with researchers. It‚Äôs also not clear how consent can be obtained to use such personal data, or how to ensure that these data are stored safely and securely.

Eva was developed in consultation with lawyers, who ensured that the program abided by the privacy protections afforded by the EU‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Under the GDPR, organizations, such as airlines, that collect personal data need to follow security standards and obtain consent to store and use the data ‚Äî and to share them with a public authority. The information collected tends to be restricted to the minimum amount required for the stated purpose.",,,,,,,,,1632423954,,,{},hdzyrzp,True,t3_pu2a4c,False,True,t1_hdzyqup,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pu2a4c/greece_used_ai_to_curb_covid_what_other_nations/hdzyrzp/,,2,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],[],1632555229.0,

**Governments are hungry to deploy big data in health emergencies. Scientists must help to lay the legal, ethical and logistical groundwork.**

A few months into the COVID-19 pandemic, operations researcher Kimon Drakopoulos e-mailed both the Greek prime minister and the head of the country‚Äôs COVID-19 scientific task force to ask if they needed any extra advice.

Drakopoulos works in data science at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, and is originally from Greece. To his surprise, he received a reply from Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis within hours. The European Union was asking member states, many of which had implemented widespread lockdowns in March, to allow non-essential travel to recommence from July 2020, and the Greek government needed help in deciding when and how to reopen borders.

Greece, like many other countries, lacked the capacity to test all travellers, particularly those not displaying symptoms. One option was to test a sample of visitors, but Greece opted to trial an approach rooted in artificial intelligence (AI).

Between August and November 2020 ‚Äî with input from Drakopoulos and his colleagues ‚Äî the authorities launched a system that uses a machine-learning algorithm to determine which travellers entering the country should be tested for COVID-19. The authors found machine learning to be more effective at identifying asymptomatic people than was random testing or testing based on a traveller‚Äôs country of origin. According to the researchers‚Äô analysis, during the peak tourist season, the system detected two to four times more infected travellers than did random testing.

The machine-learning system, which is among the first of its kind, is called Eva and is described in Nature this week (H. Bastani et al. Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04014-z; 2021). It‚Äôs an example of how data analysis can contribute to effective COVID-19 policies. But it also presents challenges, from ensuring that individuals‚Äô privacy is protected to the need to independently verify its accuracy. Moreover, Eva is a reminder of why proposals for a pandemic treaty (see Nature 594, 8; 2021) must consider rules and protocols on the proper use of AI and big data. These need to be drawn up in advance so that such analyses can be used quickly and safely in an emergency.",,,,,,,,,1632423941,,,{},hdzyqup,True,t3_pu2a4c,False,True,t3_pu2a4c,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pu2a4c/greece_used_ai_to_curb_covid_what_other_nations/hdzyqup/,,2,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],[],1632555213.0,

It is true that Christians generally have wild truth claims: resurrection, miracles, angels, visions, etc.  But I do know that one can know of the truth of these things through spiritual experience.  In a manner that can't be fully described in words, one can simultaneously *feel and understand* spiritual things.

To a non-believer, this sounds crazy.  The almost paradoxical element is that those who can have these type of experiences are only those who are already willing to believe and willing to act on that belief.  A skeptic cannot have such evidence.  Thus, the skeptic becomes more skeptical, and the believer believes more.

My daughter (unvaxed due to age) is under quarantine from an exposure at school.  She had come home from school vomiting Friday and it was later on we got the call about the confirmed exposures. Pediatrician didn‚Äôt have any availability that day and we‚Äôre heading into the weekend. You had to schedule a day or two out at cvs or urgent care and I‚Äôm not really aware of anyplace else still doing the drive thru‚Äîand this is outside Columbus in one of the saner corners of the state. So we waited a couple days and got the last drive-up appt for her pediatrician on Monday. By which time she was acting fine but we wanted to know for sure anyway‚Äîshe‚Äôs still excluded for class 10 days regardless. Her test was negative, thankfully, but it still felt like more work than it should have been to get that test. 

I‚Äôm honestly less worried about that than I am about the fact that nobody really gives a crap anymore. Kids go to school with half-full classrooms that the schools definitely aren‚Äôt reporting as being this empty. Sports leagues, activities, churches, whatever all go about their business massless and everybody pretends all the absences at school their kids talk about aren‚Äôt happening.

&gt;The immune responses of approximately 200 participants 18 through 55 years of age who received a single booster dose approximately six months after their second dose were assessed. The antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 virus one month after a booster dose of the vaccine compared to the response one month after the two-dose primary series in the same individuals demonstrated a booster response. 

They also listed the most common side effects of a booster:

&gt;Safety was evaluated in 306 participants 18 through 55 years of age and 12 participants 65 years of age and older who were followed for an average of over two months. The most commonly reported side effects by the clinical trial participants who received the booster dose of the vaccine were pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, as well as fatigue, headache, muscle or joint pain and chills. Of note, swollen lymph nodes in the underarm were observed more frequently following the booster dose than after the primary two-dose series.

You can, right this minute, schedule an appointment with them over the phone for $90-500. They will take your money, and they might call you. They will then prescribe you Ivermectin - a de-worming drug which does not help covid. They might not call you, and if you complain they will say they were stopped by the WHO. This is not how the WHO works, nor what it does. They'll happily keep your money, though.

According to Trevor Tombe's Canada Vaccine Tracker Site ([Source](https://trevortombe.github.io/covidgraphs/provs), scroll down to the fourth graph/chart): 

The closest province is Newfoundland and Labrador at 73.6% fully vaccinated.  For those that don't know, that province has a population of 520,000 which is about 1.4% of Canada's total population (38M).  Yukon Territory is 75.6% fully vaccinated but only has a population of 43,000. 

There are two provinces that are at 80%+ for first doses. Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island (population 160,000).  Not sure what their current vaccination rates are but the provinces that are doing, relatively, well are doing about 0.1% second doses per day.  So a province could get to 80% fully vaccinated in 2 months.  I wouldn't consider that ""days away"".

Canada is in ""bad shape"" because the unvaccinated are driving cases, hospitalizations and death.  The delta variant is dominant (99%+ in most provinces) and that has caught some provinces off guard as their reopening plans were made for the Alpha and Gamma variant.  So summer had little restrictions for most provinces but cases started to increase exponentially and now they have to put back the mask mandate, limit some gatherings in hotspots and do a vaccine passport.  

Most provinces are doing okay (Ontario/Quebec/Manitoba/Atlantic Provinces which make up 2/3 of Canada's population).  BC has had to cancel surgeries and had to transport people in ICU from remote communities (where cases are exponentially  increasing and have low vaccination rates) to bigger cities.  Alberta and Saskatchewan (the two lowest vaccinated provinces) are seeing their health care system almost at maximum capacity, even with surge beds and Alberta are transporting ICU patients to other provinces. 

In all provinces fully vaccinated people make up about 80% of eligible population (12+) but are responsible for 30% of the cases, 20% of hospitalizations and 15% of ICU.

[],False,,Archivalia,,,[],,,,text,t2_dlur1p7u,False,False,"We know asymptomatic cases can be spread. We know people with asymptomatic positive infections are infectious. 

My classroom is a revolving door of covid right now. I‚Äôve had dozens of cases in my classroom so far this school year. I got another email about a student with covid just a couple hours ago. I see more than 200 kids per day in my classroom, and only a couple of them are masking. I can draw infection zones on my seating charts.

Quarantines for close covid exposure help keep students and school staff safer. It reduces the spread. 

The flippant way you‚Äôre talking about 480 dead children is crazy. They certainly didn‚Äôt deserve to die, and even if we could only save ONE of them by not doing something ignorant like letting sick kids attend school, it would be worth it. These are children. Human beings. 

I‚Äôd also like to point out that children aren‚Äôt the only one in the building. Five teachers here have already caught covid. I feel like it‚Äôs only a matter of time before I catch it again. We have janitors, principals, teachers, aides, secretaries. We have adults, young and old, that can absolutely get sick and die from this crazy pandemic. This stuff is killing us. 

Covid is taking a visible toll on us. Teachers are quitting flat out, substitute teachers are nonexistent, and the few teachers left behind are being stretched thinner and thinner. For the few of us not being forced into 6/5 contracts (no prep and extra classes), our preps are being eaten so we can go stand in another teacher‚Äôs room and teach their kids while they‚Äôre at home with covid.

We lost another teacher today. She walked out halfway through the day and didn‚Äôt come back. She‚Äôs done. She‚Äôs the third teacher in her department who has quit this year. Showing teachers that you don‚Äôt value their lives and their health is a great way to lose teachers, and I can tell you flat-out that this kind of turnover is hurting student achievement far more than a student staying home if they‚Äôre exposed to covid.

I want to make something clear here - the ‚Äúexposure‚Äù we‚Äôre talking about is typically substantial and ongoing. My state made mandatory exposure quarantines illegal, so I have had several students come in who had parents or siblings at home with active and positive covid infections. One of them was in my classroom for three days before he finally started showing symptoms. Now I‚Äôve got six students in that class who are out sick - all from his same corner of the room. He gave them all covid.

They probably won‚Äôt die. If they‚Äôre lucky, the parents might not be saddled with tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills‚Ä¶ but that is wishful thinking at best. 

I‚Äôll tell you what. Instead of sitting here being so flippant about dead kids, maybe you should join our honorable profession. We desperately need teachers and subs. Come sit in my infection hub and show us all how it‚Äôs done.",977c61bd4114dd97be786311cb33b94ba4c9c59a,True,False,,,,,0.0,1632375536,,0.0,{},hdxkwbf,False,t3_ptb7y0,False,True,t1_hdx8bck,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ptb7y0/students_exposed_to_covid_can_still_go_to_school/hdxkwbf/,1632375551.0,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,,

However if you're immunocompromised because you're taking medication to suppress your immune system to manage your autoimmune disease, you should coordinate with your doctor about the best timing of the 3rd shot.   From CDC guidance: 

&gt; Whenever possible, complete mRNA COVID-19 vaccination doses (including the primary 2-dose series and the additional dose) at least 2 weeks before initiating or resuming immunosuppressive therapies.

&gt; Timing of COVID-19 vaccination should take into consideration current or planned immunosuppressive therapies and optimization of both the patient‚Äôs medical condition and response to vaccine.

&gt; When it is not possible to administer a complete COVID-19 vaccine series (i.e., 2 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or a single dose of Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine) in advance, you may still vaccinate patients who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy.

&gt; Decisions to delay immunosuppressive therapy to complete COVID-19 vaccination should consider the patient‚Äôs risks related to their underlying condition. Also, certain patient populations (e.g., bone marrow transplant patients post ablative therapy) may warrant additional unique considerations. The patient‚Äôs clinical team is best situated to determine the degree of immune compromise and appropriate timing of vaccination.

This quote for example is just blatantly wrong. It is 100% misinformation.

... and this quote lacks all perspective. It ignores that their decision to not get vaccinated does put others at risk for not just the virus, but for any emergency that cannot be properly taken care of because of the unvaxxed in hospitals.

Our school also started doing weekly pooled testing (only about 50% of families opted in though), school has been in session for 4 weeks and there haven't been any cases of covid-19 reported yet.  Note, we live in a high vaccination rate county, all the faculty and staff are vaccinated as well.

However, there have been plenty of kids that have stayed home for a few days because they had a cold (ours included, got tested, negative for COVID-19).  Which makes us think that the precautions for COVID-19 are not as effective as they should be, since the same precautions should also prevent kids from catching colds as well, and that we're mostly being spared because of the relatively high vaccination rate on our area.  They do have air purifiers going and windows/doors open and fans running in the rooms, and try to do as much outdoors as possible, so that probably helps.

When we were starting school again, our district only planned for in-person learning.  But we wouldn't have been able to do any sort of hybrid or independent study anyway between our jobs.  No one planned for anything that wasn't going back to things as usual.

The frustrating thing in all of this is that there were months to plan; why wasn't money made available to school districts to bring in more faculty, bring in portable rooms, have smaller groups with more space, make resources available--classrooms had to ask for donations to buy air purifiers, filters, and fans.

A few months ago DeSantis and his gremlins decided to report deaths differently than the way anywhere else reports them (which - surprise! - just happens to make things look better to the casual observer).

In most places, hospitals and local health departments report Covid deaths to the state, and then the state reports that number each day. That‚Äôs it.

It gives a pretty good idea of the overall trajectory, even if some of those deaths may have taken a week or two to be reported because of whatever bureaucracy/lag.

DeSantis figured out how to capitalize on that reporting lag -

Every day, Florida only reports the deaths that were confirmed to have actually happened that exact day. This is usually single or very low double digits.

Then they take all of the other 200-400 deaths that were reported by localities or hospitals and add them to the graph on the day they actually occurred - usually 1-3 weeks earlier.

This has the effect of ALWAYS making the most recent 2 week period look like deaths are plummeting and all is well.

DeSantis knows most people will only occasionally glance at a chart like that and will see it as good news - and those same casual observers will not check back often enough to realize that the days they thought looked so promising have now been ‚Äúback filled‚Äù and the peak has just shifted ahead, with the illusionary drop off also shifted ahead only to be filled in at a later date‚Ä¶

Honestly, looking at our numbers, the results are promising, specially after vaccinating the younger generations (12+) we've had several massive gatherings with thousands of people in the last months and numbers didn't raise. We had a whole summer of more relaxed rules and numbers didn't go up. At the beginning we were steadily rising in numbers, the government was thinking of lock down again but decided to start vaccinating younger generations and afterwards the numbers plateaued and started slowly going down since.

So, looking at our 10M people country, after 70% specially after bellow 30 years started being vaccinated? Things got progressively better, even though we have 100% delta cases.

Is it a clear cut win? No. But it makes the disease manageable which was the whole point i think. Our cases and deaths are currently lower than other flu strains.

Leaving someone at home matters as well but they would have to weigh that against the possible risk of losing multiple players. In the case of ice hockey though in particular with the rules that Canada has put forth I would suspect that nearly every NHL player is going to be vaccinated regardless of Home Country. I haven't heard what the Russian Federation or any of the other major leagues might be doing.

The rule book I was looking at was just a Google search for Olympic ice hockey roster rules.

But I think the point you made was a good one in that it should be a person's goal to avoid ever being somebody else's close contact right now if there are unvaccinated, that would be true for professional athletes but also for regular workers at any jobs that would put them on the shelf for 2 weeks if they are close contact

I used the no-smoking and no-pets as examples, so if you're smoking you can't enter a certain area, if you have an animal with you you can't enter a certain area (with the exception of service dogs to help disabled people)

So the way that would work with vaccine mandates for the general public would be: if you're unvaccinated(maybe vaccine passports could actually be introduced?), then you can't enter a certain area.

Running a manufacturing operation requires shift teams of multiple skilled workers over weeks per run, up to months per campaign. Also each in-process intermediate needs to be QCed.

Do they really cost a little less than their price? (~2000$ per dose)? I suppose not.

I ""understand"" that the company evaluation for the price was: if you give the treatment to a patient at risk of going in ICU, it's nonetheless economically worth it.

The problem is that this drug if safe, or similar monoclonals, can be probably benefit everybody. Making it so poorly accessible will mean that very few people will access it. 

The whole EU purchased recently 220,000 treatments with Eli Lilly. What are 220,000? That's literally nothing. Imagine a country that has 40,000 cases per day, or the EU that could have more cases per day than purchased treatments. Basically only people really at risk will access that, and no one else.

How are we supposed to drop treatments for a population this way. 

Ofc there are vaccines and I'm not denying they're useful (they are necessary); still, treatments have their space. And monoclonals are the only treatment that actually works on asymptomatic/mild cases of Covid. All the others are basically for the already messed up patients.

[],,,Synonyms26,,,[],,,,text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,"H√Ä N·ªòI ‚Äî Children who have a fever for two straight days and other early symptoms of dengue fever should visit doctors as soon as possible to prevent complicated development of the disease, especially when the rainy season is coming, which can worsen dengue fever outbreaks.  
  
Doctors also raised concerns that due to fears of COVID-19 infections, many people have been delaying visits to doctors.   
  
According to the Centre for Children‚Äôs Tropical Diseases under the H√† N·ªôi-based National Children‚Äôs Hospital, in the last two months, the centre received more than 60 children with dengue fever. Among them, the youngest was only six days old.  
  
A mother named Trang whose son was treated at the hospital for ten days said that he had a high temperature of up to 41 degrees Celsius and vomited a few times a day.  
  
Trang said that she gave her son pain relief tablets for a few days but they did not work and he continued to have a fever.  
  
‚ÄúI took my son to a local hospital ‚Äì Ch∆∞∆°ng M·ªπ District‚Äôs Hospital ‚Äì and then he was transferred to the National Children‚Äôs Hospital after a diagnosis of dengue fever,‚Äù she said, adding that her daughter and father also had the fever.  
  
From the beginning of this year, H√† N·ªôi reported more than 540 dengue fever cases in 27 out of its 30 districts and towns.  
  
In HCM City, the city‚Äôs Children Hospital received a two-year-old boy with complications of dengue fever.   
  
The two-year-old boy from the southern province of T√¢y Ninh had breathing difficulties and a bloated stomach.  
  
Doctors determined the leakage of water in the blood vessels caused his abdomen to swell, putting pressure on the lungs. The lungs, which were already filled with effusion, lacked more space for gas exchange.  
  
After four days of intensive treatment, the child partly recovered but still needed intensive care and blood transfusion.  
  
T√¢m Anh General Hospital in HCM City also received an increasing number of child patients with dengue, aged mostly from three to seven years old.  
  
According to the hospital‚Äôs Department of Pediatrics, many of the children were taken to the hospital after having a high temperature for several days.  
  
Some even suffered serious complications due to their late visits to doctors.  
  
Head of the hospital‚Äôs Department of Pediatrics L√™ Phan Kim Hoa said that the number of dengue fever cases could increase as the southern region entered the rainy season which lasts until early next year.  
  
The peak time for dengue fever outbreaks might fall in the last few months of this year, she said.  
  
‚ÄúDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, many are hesitating to go to the hospital for medical examination and treatment,‚Äù she said.  
  
‚ÄúDelaying medical visits could worsen the patients' conditions, even raising the risk of death,‚Äù Thoa said.  
  
If children suffer a continuous fever for at least two days, parents should take them to a doctor, Thoa said.  
  
It was necessary to take the children to the hospital at once when they had symptoms like irritability, lethargy, poor appetite, vomiting, abdominal pain, nosebleeds, blood in the teeth or vomiting blood and black stools, Thoa said.  
  
In the early stages of illness, children often have symptoms that are easily confused with other viral infections like typhus or hand‚Äìfoot‚Äìmouth disease. However, dengue fever is different from other viral diseases as after four or six days, children‚Äôs fever can get better or disappear, but their illness is still severe.  
  
Thoa said that children need to be diagnosed early to have a suitable monitoring and treatment regimen.   
  
‚ÄúThe fever ending does not mean the children have recovered from the disease. When dengue is severe, bleeding or plasma leakage can cause shock. Without adequate rehydration or uncontrolled bleeding and anaemia, the disease can seriously affect internal organs,‚Äù the doctor said.  
  
Associate Professor ƒê·ªó Duy C∆∞·ªùng, Director of the Center for Tropical Diseases under B·∫°ch Mai Hospital, said that dengue fever and COVID-19 both had some similar initial symptoms including high fever, headache and tiredness. However, COVID-19 is spread through inhalation, contact with droplets/surfaces containing virus droplets, and dengue is transmitted through blood by mosquitoes.  
  
""As they are worried about the spread of COVID-19, many people with dengue symptoms did not dare to go to the hospital for examination and treatment. This is one of the common mistakes,‚Äù he said.  
  
‚ÄúMost dengue fever patients recover within seven days. However, about 5 per cent of dengue fever patients will have severe manifestations such as bleeding or plasma leakage. Without timely treatment, the patient will face fatal risks,"" C∆∞·ªùng said.  
  
According to the Ministry of Health, nearly 44,000 dengue fever cases and 13 deaths relating to the disease were reported in Vi·ªát Nam in the first eight months of this year.  
  
The number of dengue fever cases decreased 9.35 per cent compared to that of the same period last year, however, the number of deaths rose by ten. ‚Äî VNS",,,,,,,,,1632409087,,,{},hdyyvfo,True,t3_ptx1pi,False,True,t3_ptx1pi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ptx1pi/vietnam_people_urged_to_not_put_off_medical/hdyyvfo/,,3,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],[],1632537072.0,

The outlying district of C·ªß Chi, which has basically kept the COVID-19 outbreak under control, has been chosen to pilot a new scheme of operation for the city after September 15.  
  
Nguy·ªÖn Quy·∫øt Th·∫Øng, secretary of the C·ªß Chi District Party Committee, said the district has divided its localities into four levels.  
  
Areas with a high risk of COVID-19 infection will apply levels 1 and 2, and the ""new normal"" areas with low risks of infection will apply levels 3 and 4.  
  
Areas at level 1 will continue to strictly follow the ‚Äústay where you are‚Äù order, control the movement of residents from 6am to 6pm, and suspend operations of traditional markets and construction works.  
  
Level 2 areas will allow businesses and production facilities to resume their operations if they meet safety requirements of pandemic prevention and control, and will allow people with a COVID-19 green card to take part in production and social activities, and go to the market once a week.  
  
Cultural and religious activities will remain suspended.  
  
Areas at level 3 will restart economic development, ensuring social security and people‚Äôs lives. People will be allowed to travel within the district, except for high-risk areas, and must continue to comply with the health ministry's 5K message: kh·∫©u trang (facemask), kh·ª≠ khu·∫©n (disinfection), kho·∫£ng c√°ch (distance), kh√¥ng t·ª• t·∫≠p (no gathering), and khai b√°o y t·∫ø (health declaration).  
  
Non-essential services and businesses (such as beauty salons, karaoke, pubs, bars and massage), and cultural and religious activities will remain closed.  
  
At level 4, pandemic prevention and control measures will be carried out in the ""new normal"" situation. People will be allowed to gather in outdoor and indoor activities. Cultural and religious activities and weddings will be allowed, and production and business activities will resume.  
  
C·ªß Chi District is only applying levels 1 and 2, Th·∫Øng said.  
  
After September 30, the district‚Äôs Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control will evaluate the pandemic control situation in levels 1 and 2 areas to consider upgrading them to levels 3 and 4, he said.  
  
The city has recently piloted tours to C·ªß Chi and C·∫ßn Gi·ªù districts after a long period of social distancing.

I live in Ohio and I'm not a huge fan of DeWine overall, but I do think it should be pointed out that the absolutely insane Conservative State Reps really put DeWine in a bad place. 

He was getting the same personal threats that Amy Acton was getting. He was also facing the State Senate permanently removing key powers from the executive branch if he pushed any harder. Removing a Governors ability to make emergency decisions being the worst change. 

Also, things that DeWine was killed for as half measures, like the bar curfew as an example, actually had a positive effect. Come to find out people are creatures of habit and they are not just going to go out to the bar 2 hours early and party with large crowds. Bars remained relatively empty up until they closed. 

DeWine could have done more, but when you are facing the threats to him and his families lives, watching a kidnapping plot of a nearby Governor get exposed, and dealing with true Trumpist maniacs in the State Senate, I honestly think that if he did something worse could have happened.

[],,,JLBesq1981,,,[],,,,text,t2_2tm4uvwf,False,True,"&gt;Just as the pandemic has fuelled a burnout crisis among frontline medical staff, it has been calamitous for the mental health of workers in public health ‚Äì the data analysts and policy advisers whose recommendations are supposed to shape the nation‚Äôs pandemic response. Many feel stonewalled by elected officials and scapegoated for the death toll of Covid-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;The results of a nationwide CDC survey of public health workers, released this July, were revealing. Of the more than 26,000 surveyed individuals working in public health departments across the United States, more than half reported recent symptoms of at least one major mental health condition. Their reported prevalence of PTSD was 10 to 20% higher than in frontline medical workers and the general public.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some public health workers, including Alexandra, cite a lack of cooperation from elected officials as a driving source of widespread overwork and discontent. Others even say they have faced pressure from elected officials to alter their findings to fit a political agenda.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile, public health workers are at the receiving end of mounting resentment. Since last March, threats against public health officials have increased. In a high-profile incident this past July, an angry crowd targeted Dr Faisal Khan ‚Äì the acting director of the St Louis department of health ‚Äì at a meeting on mask mandates. The disgruntled attendees lobbed racial epithets and surrounded Khan after the meeting like a mob.

Health care workers have been seeing mass casualties for over a year and a half.  Many elected officials are pressuring them to reinforce a  narrative and are not giving them full support and they are being harassed and threatened by anti-vaxxers who now make up the majority of their covid patients.  It's no wonder they want to quit.",,,,,,,,,1632408739,,,{},hdyy1uq,True,t3_ptwt0j,False,False,t3_ptwt0j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ptwt0j/us_public_health_workers_leaving_in_droves_amid/hdyy1uq/,,14,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],[],1632536625.0,

[],,,Fuckn_hipsters,,,[],,,,text,t2_7s9op,False,False,"&gt;I strongly believe anti vaxxers see the vaccine as a form of obedience towards the government and all that and in my opinion i can understand because i don't trust them either.

Do you trust the Government that the food you eat is not going to kill you? Do you trust the Government that the regulations they put in place around electricity means you won't get electrocuted when you turn the lights on? 

Why would you think that the Government is trying to kill you with the vaccine. Mistrust in the Government is understandable, but there has to be a line. We go through life everyday trusting that our Government has put policy and regulation in place to prevent needless death. Why is the Covid vaccine different? 

&gt;How are unvaccinated people endangering everyone else?

When your vaccinated father just had a heart attack but can't get treatment and dies, because every nearby hospital's ICU is full of unvaccinated covid patients, that is endangering everyone else. 

&gt;What's the difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated spreading the virus?

There isn't and it is why places have asked vaccinated people to start wearing masks again after the Delta variant came to the US. What is different is that even with Delta, vaccinated people are far less likely to spread the virus, especially in outdoor settings.

&gt;Aren't we the ones endangering people? because we are going to parties again and all these activities fully vaxxed living like everything is back to normal.

To a certain extent, sure, but you are also seemingly implying that the unvaxxed do not go out to parties and spread the disease. That is not true and they do not have the, now limited, protection against spreading Delta. 

Additionally, do you really want to wait and continue to shut shit down while we wait for an additional 20% of the country to get vaxxed. Mind you this is a group full of people that say silly shit like they need at least 10 years of research to be sure the vaccine is safe. Do you want to sit at home and watch the world, and economy, burn around you for the next 10 years? 

&gt;Why do people start hating on the people when they don't know what to trust like i said in 1.

Because while a general mistrust of authority is ok, thinking the government is trying to implant microchips, wants to sterilize the entire country, or any other hairbrained reason people have come up with to not get vaccinated is fucking stupid. When you do stupid shit, and do it publicly, you are going to get hate. 

Again, mistrusting this government here is fucking stupid. They aren't trying to kill you, what gain would Biden get from that? They aren't trying to track you, Facebook does that well enough as it is. Mistrust the government, fine, but don't act like you are schizophrenic and the government is out to get you. 

&gt;Shouldn't we the people take the middle ground in this?

What middle ground? You are either actively contributing to the deaths of others or you are getting vaccinated. There is not middle ground here. 

&gt;covid isn't a hoax most know that, but why wouldn't the government take advantage of that situation to divide and spread fear to have more control over us.

I have tried to be patient, but this is silly. If you want to worry about someone controlling you stop looking at the government. Social media and it's providers have been controlling so many for over a decade and barely anyone complains. Why on earth would the Government go through some convoluted scheme to control people when Facebook and Twitter have already set up the groudwork and means tested the shit out of it the last two years.

My recommendation, stop being paranoid. The government isn't out to get you. They aren't out to make you infertile or to control you. That doesn't make any fucking sense. All that would do is diminish the population and thus diminish their power. If they are nearly as power hungry as you think wouldn't they want the opposite?",,,,,,,,,1632410560,,,{},hdz2deb,False,t3_pts290,False,False,t1_hdyveax,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pts290/federal_court_antivaxxers_do_not_have_a/hdz2deb/,,4,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],[],1632538857.0,

The covid unit is permanently full to the point there are new protocols in place where covid patients must recover in the actual OR if the covid recovery unit is full. This means we lose one of the few operating runs while that patients recovers. To give you an idea, my tower has a total of 12 ORs.

&gt;""Without a mask, just breathing normally, talking softly, they were able to measure a substantial amount of COVID on droplets,"" said Simon.

&gt;He added that, as the virus gets better at getting into the air, the public needs to be better about keeping it out of the air.  
&gt;  
&gt;Though the study revealed that masks cut down the spread of the virus by half, with variants becoming more airborne, masks should be worn more tightly around the face, Milton said.

It should be noted that this study was the alpha variant which is considerably less contagious than the current delta variant, which is spreading in aerosols, further reinforcing their position.

&gt; They had previously lost 90% of troops to disease during fighting (mentioned in the library of congress article on it)... it's kind of hard to make a direct comparison to today's stakes.


My response:

IIRC in nearly every war all the way up through WWI and maybe WWII most war casualties are always due to disease. 

Lots of people in tight unhygienic temporary quarters, breathing the same air, struggling to keep the water they poop in separate from the water they drink, every cut or scratch has ample opportunity to become a fatal infection. It's a recipe for death.

The stakes today aren't identical, but they're still severe. Right now pro-pandemic states are shipping their sick to spare beds in anti-pandemic states. But even then beds are still running out.

With hospitalization the death rate is ~2%. Without hospitalization that is going to jump drastically. Anyone who needs a ventilator or any kind of specialized hospital care is automatically dead.

Quick googling shows me that for COVID-19 [88.5% of people hospitalized / 59.5% of people entered into critical care survive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7920817/) (not a full recovery, just survive).

Enough of the anti-vax population being infected is how. ""Natural immunity"" exists, but you have to roll the dice to obtain it.

""Vaccination percentage isn't the only thing that counts, if you get covid you also gain immunity. So the non- vaccinated will get a little bit sick and we're all immune. It will sort itself out.""


""Still talking about vaccines? They aren't vaccines, it's experimental gen therapy. Side effects more dangerous than the virus""


"" Remember people, if you don't get vaccinated you are a danger to the ones that are.

Or something""



""They already know that there will be a pandemic because we're in biological warfare""


"" It is a too big of risk to have vaccinated and non-vaccinated people near each other. Why would I a tested unvaccinated risk getting covid by a untested vaccinated person.""


""Getting your child vaccinated to protect the elder and weak?
The elder and weak are already vaccinated so the vaccine doesn't work well does it""



These are some comments you will see on any local video about covid, which will also make you see the mentality of the youth in this country... As for me I'm not that intelligent and i know that, but some will have a very good vocabulary which makes me question some thing. But just so you know I've always kept distance and am fully vaxxed.",,,,,,,,,1632413885,,,{},hdza9tq,False,t3_pts290,False,True,t1_hdz2deb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pts290/federal_court_antivaxxers_do_not_have_a/hdza9tq/,,1,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],[],1632542944.0,

Yes the variants that are more resistant to the vaccine are able to spread more, that's how evolution works and when there is a giant pool of unvaccinated people the virus can mutate in, eventually a strain will emerge that isn't affected by the vaccine and that strain will spread, because it had the opportunity to mutate in unvaccinated people.

Under normal circumstances, you have the right to refuse a vaccine.  Be aware that even under normal circumstances, this may prevent you from being able to do certain things: for example, some schools may refuse to allow your unvaccinated child to attend, some countries may refuse to grant you a visa to visit or immigrate there, or a privately run business may refuse you entry/participation without a vaccine.

However, the government has the authority to supercede your right to refuse a vaccine if said government decides that they need to do so in the interests of the public health.  For example, in the event of a highly contagious pandemic.

 Evolution does not necessarily reward intelligence. With no natural predators to thin the herd, it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most, and left the intelligent to become an endangered species.

You can't say ""anti-vaxxers aren't allowed to endanger 'everyone else'"" and then also admit that being vaccinated doesn't actually stop you from endangering ""everyone else"" but rather doesn't-endanger them as badly.

People act surprised when others think that the vaccine eliminates transmission; pro-vaccine folks make it seem that way, by insinuating that people who haven't been vaccinated pose some great danger to everyone and people who are vaccinated pose little to no danger. It also completely overlooks the fact that natural immunity is literally more protective than being vaccinated alone.

Here's a case study where during an outbreak in a prison, [70% of the fully-vaccinated prisoners still got COVID](https://news.yahoo.com/70-fully-vaccinated-prisoners-caught-120458867.html). This level of breakthrough infection is what we're describing as ""not endangering"" other people? At this rate we're saying you're only allowed to contract COVID if you're vaccinated from it.

Pro-vaxxers are living in a comfortable bubble where being vaccinated magically makes all social contact safe. It's like, ""we did the thing we were supposed to do, we're the good guys, we can go out and do whatever we want and nothing bad will happen to anyone because we got the vaccine.""

It‚Äôs not even that. It‚Äôs just plain wrong. It‚Äôs a misunderstanding based on a rule of thumb kind of thinking in biology, and those things are always subject to a huge number of caveats anyway. 

Evolutionary fitness is all about reproduction. Period. Faster cheetahs, smarter apes, cuter dogs are all more fit because they have more kids, on average. Evolution, all things being equal, will favor those genetic variants that tend to lead to more offspring, period. We can talk about other levels of selection (my favorite field) but for bio 101 that‚Äôs pretty much what you have to worry about. 

With viruses, you‚Äôre looking at how easily it spreads. A virus that is quickly incapacitating is less likely to spread, all things being equal, because the infected person will usually become less likely to have interactions with people. However, the factors that lead to infectiousness (how easy it is for a given exposure to cause an infection) are independent of how quickly it kills you. If you turn up both the lethality and the infectiousness, you can end up with either them cancelling each other out (same level of spread) or even with a disease that is both more deadly and more contagious. 

It can definitely lead you astray if you take a general rule of thumb like ‚Äúless deadly viruses spread more equally‚Äù and over interpret them into some kind of universal law.",,,,,,,,,1632425553,,,{},he02j2e,False,t3_ptv2r2,False,False,t1_hdyssrc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ptv2r2/covid_variants_are_getting_more_airborne_making/he02j2e/,,27,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,1,[],[],1632557037.0,

\&gt;Arguably longer incubation periods and higher contagiousness would be selected for over lethality.

Like here, there's no selection process. If a mutation randomly occurs that is more lethal to humans and more contagious than the current dominant variant without negatively affecting replication, we'll have a more lethal variant. If a mutation randomly occurs that has a longer incubation period while being more contagious than the dominant variant, we'll have a variant with a longer incubation period. Neither is ""preferable"" at the moment because neither negatively effects how the virus proliferates.

I think you're trying to say that a longer incubation period would allow for more people to get infected, and \***that**\* would make it more likely to be ""selected.""

But that would only be the case if there was any evolutionary pressure that made it difficult for variants with the current incubation period to infect people. That is incredibly not the case--multiple days' worth of incubation of an airborne virus in a society where people see many other people per day doesn't create any pressure for evolution to ""prefer"" a virus with an incubation period of 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 etc. days.

These people are so fanatically married to the feeling of freedom they have when they go camping that they can't imagine that words like ""freedom"" and ""liberty"" have multiple meanings and that the sense of ""freedom"" that we use to make society work is not the same sense you feel when there's nobody around telling you what to do.

Sure.

1. Vaccination reduces transmission rates because it reduces infection rates. Same goes for masks.

2. Because unvaccinated are between 12 - 30X more likely to require hospitalization, they take up hospital resources more than the vaccinated.

They would smoke in the car with the windows up. Sometimes it was just a 10 minute drive to town and other times it was for several hours. They would drive from Ohio to Indiana to do basic shopping or go to a restaurant because you could still smoke indoors in Indiana. They literally would drive several hours because to smoke inside.

&gt; **CLAIM**: After a legal challenge from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and a group of scientists, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled COVID-19 vaccines are unsafe and ‚Äúcanceled universal vaccination.‚Äù

&gt; **AP‚ÄôS ASSESSMENT**: **False**. The Supreme Court has not issued any rulings regarding the safety of coronavirus vaccines. Kennedy, a lawyer who has advocated against vaccines, called articles sharing the claim ‚Äúmisinformation.‚Äù He said he has been involved in dozens of lawsuits regarding vaccine safety, but none of them have reached the Supreme Court.

&gt; **THE FACTS:** Incorrect articles and social media posts falsely alleging the U.S. Supreme Court has deemed coronavirus shots unsafe have been circulating online for months and recently reemerged as new vaccine requirements issued by the federal government take effect.

&gt; Dozens of such posts shared over the past week link to blogs that regularly publish hoaxes and misinformation. The undated articles do not list an author and are nearly identical from site to site. They allege the nation‚Äôs highest court has sided with a group of scientists and Kennedy in a lawsuit against pharmaceutical companies, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and the nation‚Äôs top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci.

&gt; The articles go on to erroneously claim that the defendants failed to prove ‚Äúvaccines over the past 32 years have been safe for the health of citizens,‚Äù and falsely assert that the court ‚Äúcanceled universal vaccination.‚Äù The articles and posts also include a supposed quote from Kennedy.

&gt; But Kennedy told The Associated Press that the articles are false, as is the quote.

&gt; ‚ÄúThe article about the Supreme Court is misinformation,‚Äù Kennedy said. ‚ÄúThe quote is fabricated. Clearly somebody made it up and is promoting it because the same quote keeps coming back no matter how many times I deny it. The same article keeps reappearing.‚Äù

&gt; Furthermore, there is no legal case that matches the one described in the articles.

&gt; ‚ÄúThe U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled in a case involving a challenge to a Covid-19 vaccination requirement,‚Äù Joanne Rosen, a senior lecturer at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, wrote in an email to AP. Rosen has studied the legislative precedent for vaccine mandates.

&gt; While ‚Äã‚ÄãKennedy said he has been a part of more than 30 lawsuits on the subject of vaccine safety, those are at different stages of the judicial process and none have appeared before the Supreme Court.

&gt; The articles also incorrectly identify Kennedy, who is the son of former presidential candidate Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, as a U.S. senator and share several untrue claims about mRNA vaccines, including the myth that mRNA vaccines alter DNA.

&gt; They also include the bizarre assertion that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are not actually vaccines. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has labeled the shots as ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù in all available information on its site.

&gt; The websites that published two of the most widely circulated articles did not list contact information or publisher information.",a945007178570fdd244e8b4fd6e8f8e93ab55e5d,True,False,,,,,0.0,1632416991,,0.0,{},hdzhw1h,False,t3_pts290,False,True,t1_hdzfy39,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pts290/federal_court_antivaxxers_do_not_have_a/hdzhw1h/,1632417009.0,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,,

&gt;COVID-19 adolescent hospitalization rates from COVID-NET peaked at 2.1 per 100,000 in early January 2021, declined to 0.6 in mid-March, and rose to 1.3 in April. Among hospitalized adolescents, nearly one third required intensive care unit admission, and 5% required invasive mechanical ventilation; no associated deaths occurred.
  
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e1.htm
&gt;During December 14, 2020‚ÄìJuly 16, 2021, v-safe enrolled 66,350 adolescents aged 16‚Äì17 years who received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (Table 3). After Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was authorized for adolescents aged 12‚Äì15 years (beginning May 10, 2021), v-safe enrolled 62,709 adolescents in this age group. During the week after receipt of dose 1, local (63.9%) and systemic (48.9%) reactions were commonly reported by adolescents aged 12‚Äì15 years; systemic reactions were more common after dose 2 (63.4%) than dose 1 (48.9%). Reporting trends were similar for adolescents aged 16‚Äì17 years: systemic reactions were reported among 55.7% after dose 1 and 69.9% after dose 2. For each dose and age group, reactions were reported most frequently the day after vaccination. The most frequently reported reactions for both age groups after either dose were injection site pain, fatigue, headache, and myalgia.
&gt;During the week after receipt of dose 2, approximately one third of adolescents in both age groups reported fever. Nearly one quarter of adolescents in both age groups reported they were unable to perform normal daily activities the day after dose 2. Fewer than 1% of adolescents aged 12‚Äì17 years required medical care in the week after receipt of either dose; 56 adolescents (0.04%) were hospitalized.

Covid hospitalization rates peaked for this age group at .0021%, while the hospitalization rates for those who took the vaccine were .04%?  Am I reading this correctly?

The process of introducing a live virus into the body is typically variolation (named after the smallpox virus - vaccination is named after the cowpox virus which was used to create the smalpox vaccine). This was what was done for smallpox.

Also vaccination can be done in a very similar way to variolation with the introduction of a live virus (cowpox for smallpox). Vaccination though requires the pathogens to be weakened as compared to the actual disease (or in the case of the mRNA vaccines needs to induce a immune response)  whereas variolation does not (e.g. cowpox is much less deadly to humans than smallpox so vaccination with cowpox was much safer and essentially a weakened smallpox).

Variolation was used so prevalently for smallpox because of the *major* and *minor* varients - both of which granted immunity towards the other. If the minor varient was introduced to a healthy individual it was much less likely that the individual would die.

Both of these are forms of innoculation (vaccination and variolation).

I‚Äôd like to do a thought experiment so we can think about this. First, when we‚Äôre talking about a virus like this one, the main factors in disease spread are what I call the three D‚Äôs - distance, duration, and (the most important) droplets. So this virus seems to behave like any other viruses with which we are familiar in that your potential for developing Covid and possibly the severity of the disease are bounded by a dose dependency, all else being equal. The higher your initial exposure load is, the more likely it is that you‚Äôll get sick. This relates directly to how much of the virus enters your nose and mouth. 

The size and number of droplets are going to be constrained by distance. Bigger droplets fall very close to the infected person, smaller droplets carry further. Let‚Äôs say we use four size categories - big, medium, small, and tiny. Big will fall within a couple of inches with just normal breathing/talking, or within a couple of feet of coughing, sneezing, singing, yelling, etc. If you‚Äôve ever noticed you were accidentally spat upon by someone talking to or yelling at you, those are probably these. The other sizes fall progressively further away. You additionally have the factor that the overall particle count per unit of measurement is going to be decreased by the approximately cube of the distance, because that‚Äôs how volume works. The tiny ones are the ones that can float for an arbitrary amount of time, get recirculated by the AC, etc. 

Duration is also a factor. We can see how someone standing six feet away from an infected person is going to be exposed to orders of magnitude fewer particles than someone standing face to face, but if the face to face contact is fleeting while the distances exposure lasts for hours, things might start to even out. Given the dose dependency, this means that the likelihood of your developing Covid is also going to be based on the duration of your contact. 

An actual experiment would be both difficult and Nazi-level unethical to perform, but in our thought experiment we can think about whether our model indicates that standing a foot away from someone for five minutes is the equivalent of standing three feet away for an hour, or whatever. We can see why our thought experiment suggests it, and we can think through what that implies. 

So, sitting next to someone in a plane for a four hour flight is likely much worse than passing someone in an aisle. Having someone sitting behind you (let‚Äôs call it three feet away) coughing or sneezing is also likely worse. Having someone seated ten rows in front of you is likely better. 

And don‚Äôt forget to factor in additional variables like masking and hand washing. Where I live, virtually everyone in stores is masked. Many use a hand sanitizer on their way in, on carts, and on their way out. Sitting on a plane once food and drinks have been served is generally unmasked. Masks, per our thought experiment, will address both droplets (by catching most) and distance (by reducing the velocity of the escapees). 

This is all leaving aside perfectly legitimate and interesting but more difficult questions like ‚Äúis the average person traveling by air during a pandemic flare-up more or less likely to have Covid than the average grocery store shopper?‚Äù We might think that this should be true given that air travel is a riskier and (to the general public) a less required and rarer behavior than grocery shopping and so should correlate in general to risk tolerance or to the person taking the pandemic seriously. We can leave that to one side as an interesting complicating factor though. 

The TL;DR is that the physics of the scenario should make us skeptical that passing a sick person  while masked in the grocery store is more risky than having someone unmasked seated next to you on a four hour flight. 

Air recirculating isn‚Äôt going to help with that, or with the person two rows behind you coughing violently. 

And all of that is still leaving aside the fact that you have at least grocery store levels of exposure in airports before and after your flight. 

At the end of the day, you might end up concluding that one flight has the same risk as five months worth of grocery store visits or something. 

Anyway, the empirical studies funded by the travel industry and published to date still have not resolved the kinds of questions our thought experiment suggests, and the noise we know about (no systematic testing, negligible contact tracing in the US - at a minimum) suggest that their data might be subject to additional scrutiny.",,,,,,,,,1632420860,,,{},hdzrabk,False,t3_ptpv7m,False,True,t1_hdyz4nj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ptpv7m/vaccine_mandates_for_travel_are_legal_in_the_us/hdzrabk/,,2,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],[],1632551539.0,

Back then, the non-smoking section was up front, and the smoking section in the back, because that was the way the airflow was set up within the cabin of the plane.  If you were a non-smoker, naturally you tried to get a non-smoking seat, but sometimes the plane was almost full and you had no choice but to accept a seat in the back.  I made that mistake once, and never again.

It.  Was.  Horrible.  Worse than any bar or restaurant with smoking that I had ever been in.  I don't have allergies or breathing issues, but I was choking and coughing the entire time.  It was *dense* smoke, probably because of the limited airflow.  I still think about how awful it was, because there was no escape from it.  For hours.  You just had to sit and take it.

I'm fine with adults lighting up and smoking if they want -- freedom and all that.  It's their choice, but NOT if it's a shared space where it their activity impinges significantly on other people's freedoms.  I don't know how we ever got accustomed to just letting smokers do that, and it's good riddance as far as I'm concerned.

This was a really stupid thing to say because while it is true that the vaccines don't prevent transmission 100% they greatly reduce transmission.

I think the reason she said this was to justify why vaccinated people still need to wear masks. But it's misleading to the point of being dangerous.

What she means was that vaccinated people **who get a breakthrough infection** can spread the virus, which is still very rare, like 0.5% of the vaccinated population.

You can measure once (when someone comes into the ER or the like), and compare the highest measurements for vaccinated and unvaccinated.

You can measure multiple times and see how the measurement changes over time, but that means you need to test your experimental subjects daily which is harder to arrange.

And there are different things you can measure: 

 - the PCR cycle threshold - which is a rough measure of how much virus RNA is detected in a sample (easy &amp; safe, but not well calibrated)

 - attempt to see if the virus in your swab can actually grow in cell culture. (more difficult &amp; fussy, and potentially hazardous if you succeed).

What studies have found (I can dig up references to these if you'd like):

 - peak PCR cycle threshold in infected vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals is about the same (same peak infectiousness *if* PCR is a good proxy for infectiousness).

 - PCR cycle threshold drops faster in vaccinated individuals (less area under the curve -- you spend less time being able to infect others).

 - it's harder to grow virus from vaccinated individuals, suggesting that some of what the PCR tests are counting are shredded/deactivated virus bits rather than viable virus.

 - contact tracing in Singapore shows very little evidence of spread between vaccinated individuals.

How many people exactly were willing to gamble their shot?  Because I don't know.  And you don't know.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but ""gamble with their shot"" can only mean ""didn't get vaccinated before traveling"" in this context.

So, yes, if the above poster is talking about there being ""so many"" that gambled they have to be making assumptions about vaccination status.  Because from the information actually provided (which includes no info on vaccination status), it is impossible to determine how many gambled with their shot at the olympics.

[],,,rhawkins7777,,,[],,,,text,t2_2dxdxzp7,False,False,"PEORIA ‚Äî At least one local church is offering formal support to members who seek a religious exemption from COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

Northwoods Community Church in Far North Peoria has placed on its website a form for members and attendees who request a statement of affirmation regarding objections to mandated vaccinations.

Religious exemptions have become a topic of discussion after President Joe Biden introduced a plan to require COVID-19 vaccines for as many as 100 million American workers, as a condition of employment. In some cases, weekly testing for the virus would be accepted in lieu of vaccination.

'Vaccination mandates are an infringement' of constitutional rights In a statement on its website and during a recent Sunday service, Northwoods officials said they support churchgoers who believe they should be inoculated. The officials also stated they support those whose faith leads them to believe they shouldn't be.

""We believe that the Constitution of the United States provides the freedom and right for a person to follow their religious beliefs and convictions and that the limitation of that right is a direct assault on the fabric of families, freedom, education, employment, and, ultimately, our country,"" the church statement read, in part.

""We believe that recent vaccination mandates are an infringement of those rights.""

The form asks respondents for basic identification, information about their attendance at the church, the name of their employer and accommodations the employer might offer regarding vaccine objection. It also asks what specific beliefs led the respondent to request an exemption.

Church representatives might contact respondents with additional questions, according to the statement.

Northwoods Senior Executive Pastor Mike Bell referred to that statement in declining to answer Journal Star questions about the church's policy. Other churches were willing to discuss the topic of religious exemptions.

'Part of being a Christian is submission' Richwoods Christian Church, a nondenominational congregation in North Peoria, is not entertaining vaccine exemptions, according to its lead pastor.

""We know COVID's a real thing. The vaccines are a real thing. We know the data,"" Chad Manbeck said recently. ""But we're not compelled by the basis of our faith, which is our scripture, that this is something we're supposed to do as a local church.""

Manbeck said several Richwoods members have asked about a vaccine exemption. He acknowledged those conversations aren't easy.

""You can work somewhere else, or you can get vaccinated,"" Manbeck said about the options. ""And God, we believe, will work through all of them.

""Part of being a Christian is submission. We follow things we may or may not agree with, as long as they don't defy what God tells us to do.""

A religious exemption 'hasn't been part of our thinking' The Rev. Chip Winter of Redeemer Lutheran Church in Northwest Peoria said he hasn't heard from congregants regarding vaccine waivers. When asked what he might say to someone who requested one, he twice started to answer but paused each time.

""I guess I haven't really thought that through,"" Winter said. ""I guess I don't understand a religious exemption. That hasn't been part of our thinking.

""I would want to talk with them. I would like to counsel with them. I would probably seek some guidance from our church body, as far as what our practice would be in this.""

Winter, who also teaches at Concordia Lutheran School in Peoria, had COVID-19 about a year ago but was vaccinated in April.

""I felt the need to do that, since I'm ministering to all sorts of people,"" he said.

Winter said he might understand exemptions for abortion opponents who object to COVID-19 vaccines being tested on fetal cell lines. The lines were developed in laboratories and the vaccines don't contain such material, according to The Associated Press.

Catholic bishops in Colorado and South Dakota are willing to consider such exemptions, The AP reported. But according to the Vatican, the danger of the pandemic and lack of alternative vaccines outweigh its objections as to how the medicine was developed.

The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are among religious organizations that aren't providing exemptions.

Manbeck said he understands the Northwoods point of view, as well as those of other churches that might offer religious-based vaccine waivers. He also said he believes in free will and understands why people might want or not want to be vaccinated.

But rather than enter a secular realm that can be contentious and polarizing, Manbeck prefers to emphasize a higher calling.

""We're focusing on things more important than a paper mask, that are more important than a vaccine, that are more important than getting emotionally involved in politics,"" he said.

""Loving God, loving our neighbor and helping people take the next step in their relationship with God, whatever that may be. Our leadership here is focusing on our bigger purpose, our bigger mission.""

2019, silicon manufacturer fired me because I would not fake audit reports so his company could get preferred supplier discounts from Intel (yeah the processor company).

2019, radiopharmaceutical company fired me because I told them they needed to report a complaint in which a product they manufactured resulted in a broken toe.  [This is required by regulation](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=803).

2019, medical device manufacturer makes a speculum that gets stuck open.  Yeah.  I was the quality lead.  I was terminated for telling them to issue a field notice warning users of the potential for a speculum to get stuck open in patients.  They did nothing.  That product is still out there.  CEO told me it was a cheap Chinese piece of garbage.  Marketing called it a ""premium medical product"".

2020, medical device manufacturer fires me for saying ""a 2 drawer file cabinet is not a sufficient quality management system"".  I was also asking for more security, because we were handling patient data on unprotected Excel files (12k rows of patient data).  

2020, Fired from one of the worlds largest global pharmaceutical manufacturers.  I told the Executive of quality that I could demonstrate they were using risk assessments as a loophole to not investigate deviations from the clinical protocol.  I also demonstrated they were only investigating 17% of those deviations.  So if you're a patient in one of their clinical trials, there's a 17% chance anyone asked the doctor why he deviated from protocol.  This data is presented to global regulatory authorities.  

None of these companies have changed their ways.  In fact, that last company promoted the woman who made the decision not to investigation clinical protocol deviations.

I'm in California. Can't tell you *anything* about the urban Northeast specificallly, straight-faced or no (wasn't trying to - I was thinking more on a national scale). Rural areas, however, are often another matter. I have family in NE.

Hesitancy caused by historic medical injustices is also difficult ... but community outreach, coming from trusted community leaders, does make a difference.

I'm not sure what the Olympic's policies are, but here in the US, close contacts aren't quarantined if vaccinated.

Short story, if you‚Äôre vaccinated it greatly reduces your risk of being infected. If you‚Äôre not infected you don‚Äôt transmit it. 

It‚Äôs rare but a few vaccinated people will become infected (that‚Äôs a breakthrough case). It is possible for people with a breakthrough case to infect someone. 

&gt; The CDC added that breakthrough infections ‚Äúoccur in only a small proportion of vaccinated people and of the breakthrough infections, transmission by the vaccinated appears to only be a small part of overall spread of the virus.‚Äù 

Let‚Äôs put that in perspective. 

100 unvaccinated people in a room. One person with covid delta variant enters and coughs and leaves after 30 min. Approx 40 of the unvaccinated people will get infected and it will spread among the rest of the unvaccinated. 

100 vaccinated people in a room. One person with covid delta variant enters and coughs and leaves after 30 min. Approx 3 or 4 of the vaccinated people will get infected but it will not spread among the vaccinated. 

That‚Äôs the difference. That‚Äôs why everyone should get vaccinated. 

1. Breakthrough cases are RARE, and 
2. the more people who are vaccinated the less it will spread if it happens.",d563bb42a469b5c7837ef5eb5bccccb596e6024a,True,False,,,,,0.0,1632409293,,0.0,{},hdyzclk,False,t3_pts290,False,True,t1_hdyxyvm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pts290/federal_court_antivaxxers_do_not_have_a/hdyzclk/,1632409305.0,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,,

[],False,,twistedbristle,,,[],,,,text,t2_4940rooy,False,False,"&gt; I strongly believe anti vaxxers see the vaccine as a form of obedience towards the government and all that and in my opinion i can understand because i don't trust them either.

The government requires you to carry a card with your name and address on it, they set the speed at which you can drive, they make you pay to register your car, and when you get a job you have to let them know so they can make sure to take social taxes out of your pay check. 

You have to be obedient to the government in dozens of ways every single day this is nothing new 

&gt;How are unvaccinated people endangering everyone else?

unvaccinated people carry significantly higher viral loads and get significantly sicker, clogging up hospitals and harming people who are seeking emergency treatment for things like cancer and appendicitis

&gt; What's the difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated spreading the virus?

Again, viral load. The viral load is significantly higher in the unvaccinated and they have not only a higher chance of spreading it, but spreading a more dangerous amount of it. 

&gt;Aren't we the ones endangering people? because we are going to parties again and all these activities fully vaxxed living like everything is back to normal.

If everyone was fully vax'd we could be back to normal because it would essentially neuter COVID. We'd see hospitalizations trickle down to nothing and then the illness would become weaker and weaker as it cannot find suitable host to procreate in and then it would eventually die within a couple of months. Even if it can spread just as easily to unvaccinated, it gets weaker every time instead of stronger.  

&gt; Why do people start hating on the people when they don't know what to trust like i said in 1. I don't mean the people bragging in Facebook that vaccines are whatever kind of shit they come up with, but the ones you don't hear about. The hate towards these people seems to be generalized while they may not be spreading disinformation they just don't trust it yet people are making fun and hating on these people.

I don't even understand what you're trying to say here. Why does ""just not trusting"" a vaccine with over **six billion** doses taken and only a few thousand adverse reactions somehow shield you from hate? When did baseless mistrust become a virtue? 

&gt;Shouldn't we the people take the middle ground in this? because i think there are truths to both sides of the story, for example: covid isn't a hoax most know that, but why wouldn't the government take advantage of that situation to divide and spread fear to have more control over us.

Because the middle ground is an easy solution that makes you feel better than everyone but is often wrong. Would you like to try applying this logic to wildfire evacuations? 

Heres another way to phrase the middleman argument for you, disobeying every order is just as dumb as obeying every order.",04c262ee0ec13b56fb76042c9c23d53f6ce02fb4,True,False,,,,,0.0,1632409256,,0.0,{},hdyz9k7,False,t3_pts290,False,True,t1_hdyveax,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pts290/federal_court_antivaxxers_do_not_have_a/hdyz9k7/,1632409270.0,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,,
