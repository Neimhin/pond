I'm off the opinion that we should consider three points.  1) the most vulnerable members of our population a are highly vaccinated at this point. 2) we have developed better treatment options to get those who need to be hospitalized out of the hospital faster. 3) pretty soon everyone that wants the vaccine will have gotten it.  

I don't see any way at all we will hold the health measures to keep businesses closed for much longer.  The economic cost of that is not balanced by the public health benefits.  I do agree that masks are very low burden, but even those won't last another 6-12 months among adults.  It's selfish, but that's the world.

The point isn‚Äôt that this is a convincing argument over the all natural cause theory. It‚Äôs that it shouldn‚Äôt be dismissed outright because there is genuine concern in the scientific community. 

For a person to have been infected in Yunnan and not infect anyone until Wuhan, that‚Äôd be crazy. 

Your theory is that a cave spelunker that explored remote caves came into contact with a Cave bat, contracted the virus and then immediately isolated himself in a car and drove 1100 miles without stopping in any city or infecting a single person until he got to Wuhan. No sleep, no hotel rest, or pit stop. Just straight from cave to Wuhan. 1000 mile trip, no stopping.  

The lab leak theory is that a Wuhan virology lab that had a history of lab failures and bad precaution was knowingly researching Coronaviruses in the exact bat from Yunnan we are talking about. Therefore, some investigations need to be made about whether this lab was following the precautions that were set in place.

&gt;We believe the IOC‚Äôs determination to proceed with the Olympic Games is not informed by the best scientific evidence. The playbooks maintain that athletes participate at their own risk, while failing both to distinguish the various levels of risk faced by athletes and to recognize the limitations of measures such as temperature screenings and face coverings. Similarly, the IOC has not heeded lessons from other large sporting events. Many U.S.-based professional leagues, including the National Football League (NFL), the National Basketball Association, and the Women‚Äôs National Basketball Association, conducted successful seasons, but their protocols were rigorous and informed by an understanding of airborne transmission, asymptomatic spread, and the definition of close contacts.2 Preventive measures, adapted amid continuous expert review, included single hotel rooms for athletes, at least daily testing, and wearable technology for monitoring contacts, supported by rigorous contact tracing. Despite increasingly rigorous protocols, outbreaks of Covid-19 have caused multiple game cancellations. The World Men‚Äôs Handball Championship, held in Egypt in January 2021, showed the limits of housing even two people together when roommates were both forced out of games after one tested positive. In February, the Australian Open was challenged by hotel-driven exposures and two local outbreaks. In early May, the Indian Premier League cricket tournament was suspended in its third week.

&gt;The IOC‚Äôs playbooks1 are not built on scientifically rigorous risk assessment, and they fail to consider the ways in which exposure occurs, the factors that contribute to exposure, and which participants may be at highest risk. To be sure, most athletes are at low risk for serious health outcomes associated with Covid-19, but some Paralympic athletes could be in a higher-risk category. In addition, we believe the playbooks do not adequately protect the thousands of people ‚Äî including trainers, volunteers, officials, and transport and hotel employees ‚Äî whose work ensures the success of such a large event.

Sometimes you just have nothing left in the tank.

My kid's doing great, but, only because I sacrifice my free time to do stuff with her when the work day is done. She does school while I do work, we take a break for lunch and watch an episode of a show together, I have her help prepare lunch. In the evenings we read together, or play card games, or make a craft or play a video game. I have her help with dinner so I can teach her how to make simple meals. She practices her drawing in the evenings. On the weekend, we go on a nature hike with the dogs. 

But, her dad, my husband, just sits there on his phone contributing absolutely nothing. It hurts my heart thinking some kids have two parents like that.

Well, we put a pretty much permanent kibosh on that tug-of-war in 2020, embedding social interaction via screen time as the only avenue for many kids, and teaching them to be afraid even of things that have virtually zero transmission risk (of a virus that's already markedly low-risk for them) such as being outdoors without a mask.

I think we adults fail to appreciate how life-altering these habits can become when they're enforced during the formative years. This is now a generation where throngs of impressionable young people are primed to never feel safe, at least not without significant psychological intervention.

I've noticed that Reddit loves to flog the usual talking points about how life is so harsh with climate change and student debt that who *wouldn't* be depressed? And this is an egregious blend of lazy thinking and cope. As daunting as some of those things may loom (and they certainly don't ruin *everyone's* mental health, challenges though they may be), there were healthy ways to escape from and process them, many of which relied on face-to-face personal interaction. Well, we've now demolished that. The result is a markedly worse mental health climate.

You also see - on pretty much any Reddit discussion that challenges the idea of lingering restrictions for kids until they, too, can be vaccinated, despite the sub-flu mortality risk they face from COVID - the talking point about ""long term damage"". I've yet to see anything control-matched that indicates a long-term prognosis that differs in frequency from any comparable illness, but setting that aside: if long-term damage from COVID is on the table, why aren't we just as afraid of long-term mental health damage?

&gt;Seven (78%) of nine fruit bats had a transient infection, with virus detectable by RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridisation in the nasal cavity, associated with rhinitis.

Bats have strong immunity system that most pathogens are suppressed (but still active). It's quite impressive that 78% of the test subjects are infected.

Palm civet was found because patient zero was a chef. And it wasn't the original host. The original host, rhinolophus sinicus, was found 10+ years later in a rural area, supported by antibodies testing results of nearby villagers.

There has been evidence of limited, but not sustained spread of MERS-CoV from person to person. It's much easier to track than SARS-CoV-2.

It seems you have little knowledge in this field. And your beloved politicians. They've got an investigation, and they are not satisfied with the outcome since it does not match their tones.

People also love to bring up the example of children being traumatized by losing parents. That risk is also insanely low, especially for young children. Over 80% of deaths occur in people over 65, and the other 20% are skewed pretty close to 65. If kids were to lose anyone, it would be grandparents or great-grandparents. As sad as that is, it‚Äôs expected to lose grandparents during childhood. And as of March, less than 20% of Americans knew someone who had died of COVID.

Maybe it's a bit different up there, but I strongly suspect that relatively few people with symptoms seek testing or care. They figure that for most people, it's milk, so they only seek treatment if they get very ill or are well-insured.

Up there, the tests and treatment are mostly free, so it might be a little different?

&gt; Recently they did some rapid testing in schools here, and came up with similar results... using it for random sampling was basically a waste, because it produced such low numbers... and that was with Covid very rampant in our schools recently.

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

\&gt;Mexico is struggling with behind-schedule local AstraZeneca production and shortfalls in deliveries from foreign suppliers and has asked the United States to help with more vaccines. read more The request is in addition to some 2.7 million AstraZeneca doses Washington sent to Mexico in March.

The UK got enough doses to end hospitalisations and vaccinate down to the ages of 44-40. No other country has been able to do so with AZ. The UK has a population of 66 millions and got 50 million doses (out of 100 million doses). That is more than enough to make a dent on hospitalisation numbers. 

Compare that to that to the EU which had ordered 300 million and gotten 53 million so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Australia has berley recieved 2 million out of 8 million doses. All of those came from EU sites. They will begin production of [54 million AZ doses](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-04-09/csl-remains-committed-to-manufacturing-astrazeneca-vaccines/100058070) but it has yet to start.

We learned early on that the virus overwhelmingly damages and kills older people.  The physical health impact is heaviest at the top end of our population by age, and then diminishes as you go younger, gradually at first and then sharply as you cross under like 50 years old.  Pretty much the whole world reacted strongly and quickly to protect these vulnerable people, and took unprecedented and severely expensive measures to do so.  

But it's always felt like the more invisible other side of this coin has been downplayed or, by some people, even directly trivialized and ignored - the mental impact.  This seems to fall almost exactly opposite of the physical impact; it's heaviest in our youngest people (school aged kids), gradually diminishes across early adulthood, and then probably sharply drops around maybe the 40s or 50s.  ~150 million young Americans losing a year of their school or young adult lives is an incredibly steep price to pay.  The early years of your life are so vital to who you'll become (social and mental development for kids, career and relationship development for young people) compared to later years where more people tend to be a lot more settled.  

This should've been better discussed throughout the whole past year, at the very least so that we could be ready at the end to try to address some of the problems we were going to have, like this one.  This is why I personally find it completely absurd that some people still want restrictions to continue just to protect an ever-safer group of morons (anti-vax) and super-low-risk (children) individuals.

Over the years, I've slowly come to the conclusion that most human beings need something that fulfils the role of religion. If they don't have a traditional religion, they'll take another set of values and beliefs and treat it as if it is one. Politics and science can easily fill that role. Of course, when you try to force science into being a religion, it stops being science, because science is all about putting theories to the test and changing your beliefs when presented with new information.

And of course, for a lot of people, it's a way of affirming their place in the world and the correctness of the tribe they identify with. If someone comes from a slightly uptight suburb or backwards small town, they don't like their parents, and they did fairly well in the academic aspects of school but not the social ones, they can often end up with the attitudes you've identified.

You are posting **media** reports. The only thing worth discussion are words from scientists. For example, it was widely reported that Australian scientist, Dominic Dwyer, as a member of WHO mission to Wuhan, criticized that China refused to provide data.

[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-56054468](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-56054468)

However, by his own words:

&gt;""The Chinese were very hospitable hosts, everyone worked together very well, it was a joint mission after all,"" he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;""There were some clear differences of opinion and there were some quite firm and heated exchanges over things but in general everyone was trying to do the right thing and certainly WHO got more data than they've ever had before, and that's some real progress.""

[https://www.9news.com.au/health/australian-scientist-professor-dominic-dwyer-believes-covid-started-in-china-after-return-from-wuhan-with-who-team/9e1f9b5f-fb16-487c-b4a3-bf25a2185b7f](https://www.9news.com.au/health/australian-scientist-professor-dominic-dwyer-believes-covid-started-in-china-after-return-from-wuhan-with-who-team/9e1f9b5f-fb16-487c-b4a3-bf25a2185b7f)

It's not China going more defensive. It is because COVID-19 situation is getting eased in US and now it starts more media campaign to create a rival.

He discusses seamless editing, but fails to mention that there are some serious logistical and technical limitations on when they can be used,  how they are used.

He talks about passing the virus repeatedly through cell cultures to adapt it to infecting human cells.

To get there also requires immune system evasion, which is a function that you don't gain in a culture.

https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00877-4

&gt;The report concludes that the chances of COVID-19 having originated in a lab accident are slim. But there is growing pressure, including some from researchers, for a more comprehensive inquiry into this possible route.
&gt;
&gt;**WHO team members did not have the required background to investigate a biosafety breach,** says Filippa Lentzos, a biosecurity researcher at King‚Äôs College London.
&gt;
&gt;**Tedros agreed that further investigation was needed, and was willing to send additional missions involving relevant experts. He said that the team‚Äôs assessment, based on lab visits and interviews with researchers, was not extensive enough, adding that ‚Äúas far as WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the table‚Äù.**
&gt;
&gt;A key argument against the lab-leak hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2 was an unknown virus before the pandemic, with no trail in public databases and research articles. But some researchers say that it is not possible to know exactly which viruses had been sampled around the world.
&gt;
&gt;Wang says it‚Äôs highly unlikely that a lab would keep such information secret, but he adds that there‚Äôs a small chance that someone doing research on bats inadvertently got infected by an unknown virus while collecting bat samples in a cave, and that this infection seeded the pandemic.
&gt;
&gt;Nikolai Petrovsky, an immunologist at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, says that **given the lack of evidence, the team ‚Äúwould have been best to have been silent on the question because, scientifically, we simply don‚Äôt know‚Äù.**

&gt;Evidence from the first study of long covid in children suggests that more than half of children aged between 6 and 16 years old who contract the virus have at least one symptom lasting more than 120 days, with 42.6 per cent impaired by these symptoms during daily activities. These interim results are based on periodic assessments of 129 children in Italy who were diagnosed with covid-19 between March and November 2020 at the Gemelli University Hospital in Rome (medRxiv, doi.org/fv9t).",,,1622007567,{},gzhdg3d,False,t3_nknhgq,False,False,t1_gzfp8gb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nknhgq/health_official_unvaccinated_adults_may_pose/gzhdg3d/,1622099368,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_4gb68,False,False,,

I‚Äôm concerned that 4-5 of them are diehard conspiracy theorists and hoaxists, and the other 1.5-2.8 run the gamut from genuinely scared to woefully misinformed.

I‚Äôm concerned we will never come close to herd immunity and never know if danger is lurking 3 feet away. 

I‚Äôm concerned about the longevity of the vaccine‚Äôs efficacy. We were told 3 months, then 6 months, then up to a year. Which is it?

I‚Äôm concerned about the CDC‚Äôs veracity. It‚Äôs been one ricochet after the next with them from the get go. Are we making it up as we go along?

I‚Äôm concerned about the egregious way Americans were mislead and lied to February 2020, told we don‚Äôt have much of anything to worry about, while the virus had already gone from firm foothold to rapid-fire spread. 

I‚Äôm concerned about the arrogance of the CDC and the misguided notion of American exceptionalism in general. Take, for instance, (1) CDC‚Äôs rejection of the WHO‚Äôs up-and-running test kit; (2) the epic failure of CDC‚Äôs big rollout of contaminated test kits; (3) CDC‚Äôs refusal to to approve/allow functional tests created out of desperation by scientists in early hard hit states. Then, translate it with typical Mike Pence eloquence when asked why we didn‚Äôt use the WHO‚Äôs testing apparatus ‚Äî ‚Äúwell, [aw, shucks], that‚Äôs just not how we do things here in the US.‚Äù We do things better? Well, of course, so naturally, the CDC will construct its own, far superior, test kit. Oops, as the clock continues to tick away. 

I‚Äôm concerned about the ease with which (a) lies were told when the truth could have been the ‚Äúgame changer,‚Äù and (b) optics took priority over human lives. To-wit: Our nationwide unpreparedness became shockingly evident in a matter of days. Ergo, when Fauci pooh-poohed masks, it didn‚Äôt take much of a stretch for a good skeptic like myself to realize that the fact of the matter was we‚Äôre in deep shit because there are no masks to be had. Likewise, Trump‚Äôs personal vanity and his near daily insistence that we have it totally under control (‚Äú15, soon to be 0, e.g.) might as well have been a blimp emblazoned with all caps ‚ÄúWE CANNOT PROJECT A SICK AMERICA BY BEING SEEN MASKED.‚Äù

I‚Äôm concerned about the repercussions of the denial of science and acceptance of some alternate fantasy.

I‚Äôm concerned that any given Deborah Birx could so readily succumb to ambiguity and double-speak by thinking a little to highly of herself (the one and only trump whisperer) and do no more than scrunch up her face and look at her feet while a Trump suggests bleach cures.

I‚Äôm concerned that the actual Deborah Birx gets a pass for saying ‚Äúwe get a pass for the first 100,000 deaths because nobody knew, blah-blah.‚Äù No, Deborah. You knew.

I'm not sure how old you are but a certain amount of this is just teenagerdom to be honest. However I'm 100% sure it has been exacerbated by social media and then by the pandemic.

Big popular social media (Facebook) really only started when I was in high school, and early on it wasn't the raging beast it is today. It was kind of all-consuming when I was in grade 11 or so but not in the same way it is now (because then it was a novel thing and everybody wanted to talk about it in person, and more importantly smartphones didn't come out until I was out of high school).

But students still close off a bit in high school and become more introspective anyway, I think, regardless of social media. It's when you start to actually think about how you will fit into the world - in terms of friend groups, cliques, fields of work, and what version of the education system you are destined for (trade school, college, university, or perhaps none of the above).

Having said all that I think it is really important to have resources for kids right now. You say social media is an escape for teens -- I don't think it is anymore, especially during COVID. For many, social media *is* their life now, and real human interaction is the escape.

Of all the countries in the world, those with a zero-covid strategy are very few.  It's China, Mongolia, Taiwan, most of SE Asia, Australia and NZ and the Pacific Islands.  

Mongolia and all of SE Asia have now had their systems fail, all within the last month or so.  For most of them their failure is because they're developing nations without enough testing capacity and difficult to control borders.  Once one SE Asian country failed, it couldn't be stopped from spreading to the others.  

Only Taiwan, Australia and NZ have the wealth and the isolation to completely keep Covid out.  These three countries are in a category which no other country could hope to be in.  You need the wealth to provide economic support to people to make lockdowns effective.  You need the total border control to prevent undocumented migration bringing it in.  

&gt;This is quite a funny claim given how good their system has worked so far. I guess I'll be saying the same thing about Nz's system if it ever happens to face a major outbreak (I hope not but it cannot be ruled out).

Their system worked well before, but the more transmissible variants are a game changer.  They require catching leakages even earlier and locking down harder.  Since the very beginning in NZ we've been told on a daily basis how key good testing numbers are to maintain elimination.  So it's been shocking seeing Taiwan so severely limit testing and have the lowest testing rate in the developed world.  They've tested 25,000/million while NZ has done over 400,000/million.  

&gt;Heh, this is factually wrong, there's also countries that managed to manage covid both without experiencing massive waves and also without ever having lockdowns. See Korea.

Elimination is the best approach for the economy and lifestyle.  For every country like South Korea there are about 40 who went for mitigation/suppression and ended up with big waves.  

&gt;I guess then Melbourne's experience only showed the weaknesses of Australia's system and their subpar contract tracing, then?

There is no Australian system.  Every state has a totally different strategy, or they did in 2020.  Now most of them are on the same page, though still with differences.  NSW continues to favour a much looser approach relying more on contact tracing and less on lockdowns.  Western Australia and Queensland lockdown at the drop of a hat.  

But I'm not here to defend Australia as the gold standard. I'm from NZ and there's a lot about Australia's approach that we find confusing and stupid.

I live in Louisiana, where we have one of the worst covid vaccination rates. That means a greater likelihood of a teacher or another child bringing covid to school.

See this from your first article: ""Reducing transmission in schools is a shared responsibility. A combination of effective prevention strategies (including consistent and correct¬†use of masks;¬†physical distancing;¬†handwashing and respiratory etiquette;¬†cleaning¬†and maintaining healthy facilities;¬†and¬†contact tracing¬†in combination with¬†isolation¬†and¬†quarantine) implemented with strict adherence can limit transmission in the school setting.""? Physical distancing won't happen with the vast majority of kids back in person, my kid's school is old and so is the ventilation system, handwashing has already lessened considerably since the beginning of the year,  ""respiratory etiquette"" among 5 year olds... hilarious, cleaning hopefully is still being done well. Oh and now masks won't be required.

From your second article: ""It is noteworthy that among reported pediatric deaths, about 80% of those children were not fully vaccinated."" That's about the flu. So since my kids are always fully vaccinated, that shows there is a much less likely chance of them dying from the flu. They're less likely to get it at all, and if they do, less likely to have a severe case. That article also gave a range of kids that die in a flu season.. 100s-300s. 200s of kids have died in the US of covid. I know if was a longer period of time, but the rate is still pretty close. This is further proven by the information in your third article.

So while I see what you're getting at here, please see it from my perspective. I am able to get my kids a flu shot. So I don't worry much about the flu. I am not able to get my kids a covid shot.

Will the fact there is a roof over my head *now* have any impact of my not having one in two days? Not really. Having an apartment Wednesday doesn't mean I'm not homeless Friday.

Talking about how good things are *now* doesn't make people feel more hopeful about how things *will be.* It might even make it worse, because you're reminding them of all the things they're going to lose, the things they're never going to enjoy again, the things that already suck and will only get worse.

But these are also issues we have faced for centuries and have made meaningful progress on all accounts. Every generation has their battles. 

This is you blithely dismissing climate change as just another generational battle. It's an existential threat to civilization, and one that cannot be undone. It's one we've faced since the 19th century, and we've risen to the challenge and made it faster, worse, and more dangerous every way. We're beyond the point of stopping it and are close to losing the ability to mitigate it either. It's the kind of problem that makes all of humanity's accomplishments irrelevant.

But if you don't care about that level of personal risk, or think the vaccines' extremely low level of risk is similar to the level of risk of catching covid so that getting vaccinated is a wash for you: If you do catch covid, you can spread covid (and no, teens are not magically immune from being contagious. There's no evidence whatsoever that teenagers can't transmit covid). You might spread covid to someone you know who is unable to be vaccinated for health reasons, or who has a compromised immune system for whom vaccines don't work well and for whom covid is very dangerous. And you contribute to the continued spread of covid, which can harm others even if it doesn't harm you.

And if you don't care about other people and aren't interested in getting a shot for their benefit, consider enlightened self interest: doing something with no immediate benefit to yourself but that can have positive effects on society at large ultimately benefit you. A society in which covid still spreads and harms other people can have negative consequences on you, in restrictions on things you're able to do, in economic harm that could lead to loss of jobs or lessened income for you or your family.

I would never tell someone what reproductive choices to make, I just thought I‚Äôd provide a counter viewpoint. 
We are lucky to be here and experience the things we do, as it seems clear we have a more ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù consciousness than say, a worm. We have great skills compared to the life this planet has produced before, but that doesn‚Äôt assign us this weird cultural ownership people have over being the ‚Äúdominant‚Äù form of life. Life would continue- I just think that maybe humans got a little TOO evolved. How many people actually experience a life without severe pain? We know it‚Äôs possible, but we repeatedly create poverty and pain and injustice for money rather than for our own survival. We are so deep in the shit we think money = survival. It‚Äôs hard to find any sort of reason we DESERVE to be here. Most species find a niche and fit in it in the wild. They are able to survive with other species. Humans have proved we can‚Äôt, as we actively make their niche hostile to them (and to ourselves as well, but later down the road). Why would I create life that is going to harm other life? And not just in a direct way (for food, etc) but in a way that means those species, that life, isn‚Äôt going to live because humans collectively decided not to do anything? I won‚Äôt do that. I won‚Äôt contribute to the next mass extinction event, and I won‚Äôt be bothered when I hear about failing birthrates or fertility rates, because we are single handedly the most destructive of species by doing nothing at all. It‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt deserve to be here, just that I‚Äôd rather take a utilitarian view of life on earth where suffering is minimized. In my own life, I don‚Äôt need to create a person to experience love.

There was a case in the early 1900‚Äôs where a pastor resisted the smallpox vaccine and was fined.

His objections were really good, too, because vaccines were actually unsafe at the time, he and his kid had personally had multiple bad vaccine reactions in the past, and the government was going foot to door and harassing people to get vaccinated in a very heavy-handed way that would turn everyone today into anti-vaxers.  It was bad.  But even in those circumstances the SupCt said it was ok for the government to force people to get vaccinated.  

The only differences here (other than modern vaccines being much, much safer) is the distinction between an emergency use authorization and the regular authorization, but most people find that argument pretty bogus.

I think that my peers also went through a period of time like that as well. I think if we didn't get obama in office we would have internalized it pretty hard.

Have you considered trying to focus not on the idea that ""the powers that be might be changing things"" to one more of ""we need to change the powers that be""?

as a metaphor - think about a house. It's got all the walls and doors and beams and shit - and a foundation.

The house is the current political power structure. Right now, I'd say that the house is failing. Things are falling apart, and it's due to the foundation - it's just not solid any more and needs to be repaired (if not replaced). Nothing above it will get better until the foundation has gotten better. (FYI I personally assign blame on both sides - R and D, but more blame on the R recently ofc.)

In this metaphor, the walls and stuff are like the economy, the help that people get when in crisis, etc. The foundation is the particular people in government that are at the helm of power.

Yes, therapy helped me recognize and understand how my fears and anxieties were formed, which helped me manage them, but that wouldn't have been enough without finding a partner I was compatible with. Someone whose temperament didn't trigger my latent fears. Someone who is very steady and reliable and consistent.

As a result of divorce, what we were lacking as children was that feeling of a secure base. We're probably seeking to fill that void with our adult relationships. But not all partners can be that or provide that. Relationship dynamics can be wildly different between any two given people. You can like a person a lot, even love them, but still be a terrible match.

One example of what I mean is if you can argue well. Many people argue in a way that, for us, it shakes the foundation of the relationship. It can ruin trust because the arguments stoke our worst fears. For children of divorce, constructive arguments were probably not modeled for us by our parents. We didn't witness that two people can argue intensely and still be there for each other at the end of the day.

So in hindsight, I would've let go of bad relationships sooner instead of grasping at straws to force them to work. I was trying desperately to establish a secure base with people who were never going to be that for me. My fear of losing a partner outweighed my desire to find the right partner.

I'm not even against the idea of people in certain professions stripping down in that way-- makes a lot of sense for doctors and nurses who know for a fact they were coming into contact with the virus every day! And of course it makes sense for professionals in lab settings like you're describing.

My point is that there are diminishing returns for the ""common person"" in terms of taking precautions since exposure levels aren't identical to professionals working in medical or lab settings. The friend of mine that took the extreme precautions? It eventually got to a point where she just stopped taking *any* precautions because she got so burnt out. It took a lot of convincing to get her to postpone her wedding last year-- it came down to some of us in the wedding party refusing to attend since it was going to be a large indoor gathering.

I understand the politicization of the virus and the damage that did, but I don't think there's enough discussion about how extreme measures caused some people to just give up entirely under the incorrect assumption that if they couldn't take ""all"" the precautions then it wasn't worth taking any.

I know we're not going to completely agree on this, heck, I agree with you that I'd rather have had one strong lockdown over the way this has panned out in the US.

Say [Bob Barker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Barker) still has and miraculously fits his old Navy uniform. He shows up tomorrow, in uniform, supporting some extremely controversial cause. Screw it. Let's go full insanity, insult a good man's character, and assume he's supporting something outright obscene. I don't know, maybe the most horrifically ridiculous thing I can think of. He's out there protesting for pedophilic cannibalism, proudly wearing his old navy uniform. I don't even know what ""pedophilic cannibalism"" entails, but it sounds like something so horrific that it might actually motivate the prosecution of a nonagenarian celebrity.  

So imagine Bob Barker is out there in his old Navy uniform protesting in support of pedophilic cannibalism. He's not actually participating in such horrific acts, just arguing that the law should be changed to legally allow them. In a purely civilian context, he's just practicing his First Amendment rights. As long as he's not personally engaging in or conspiring with others to engage in such acts, he's not doing anything legally wrong, in a purely civilian context.

You are literally presented with an updated CDC article dated yesterday, and you have this one article with a quote that says a coronavirus can survive for up to two years. This article has little to do with the actual question if you can realistically get covid from (frozen) groceries. The answer is no. There are simply to many factors at play that make it more likely that you win the lottery tomorrow than you catching a case of covid from those groceries.

People who grew up during the great depression are still affected to this day, the main period was between 1929 and 1932. They remember their parents losing their job, not having food at home. For their entire life they're hesitant of markets, don't like having their money in a bank, frugal with everything they have.

Even when it's just a single year it can shape the entire culture. Look at Great Chinese Famine (1959‚Äì1961), something like 40 million people died from starvation. People had to watch their family members starve and wide spread acts of cannibalism. There just wasn't any food. The people who lived through it that having food is no guarantee, you just have to take what you can. When Chinese people go abroad they're often seen as rude and having bad manners. Many older Chinese people have experienced true scarcity, and it changes people. They teach their kids the lessons they learned during the famine and it continues on.

As for COVID-19, Gen Z was already socially inept. This is really just cruel to them, the amount of social anxiety which will come from this...  Before covid schools still had regular flu seasons, kids were told to ""Wash your hands and stay home if you have a fever"" imagine how differently that sounds to a 12 year old today. If their parents were extra freaked out about COVID and in two years they're told it's flu season and they're friend gets the normal flu, ""Will the whole school shut down again?""

Then you have the actual impact to education itself. It's not like missing 1 year of a 4 year college degree means you still got 75% of your education. You need to actually understand the content of the course in the previous year to understand higher level courses. If one year is subpar and you're given a pass/fail grade with distance labs and open book exams where you just google every answer, it's not the same as a proper college education. These people need to fill actual roles in society, they're given a free pass in college ""because of COVID"" and now you have doctors, technicians, engineers who don't know what they're doing because they're education got screwed up.

I think this is a good comparison to Singapore since these players were in very close contact like the airport workers and have a strict testing regime like they do in Singapore. 

Basically, yes vaccines are not 100% effective in stopping transmission (nothing is) but they‚Äôre pretty damn close. This means that there are going to be scenarios like the Yankees and the airport cluster, but they‚Äôre going to be rare.

We've seen what happens when there is a failure in that regard in Italy and India where even being able to get on oxygen to prevent death was impossible and they had to triage cases and make choices of who would receive care and who would die.

We've been so effective at reducing the spread that hospitalizations for the flu dropped dramatically compared to the 2019-20 flu season. Which just goes to show you how infectious covid actually is comparatively. In fact there was only a single pediatric death from influenza for 2020-21 compared to 195 in 2019-20.

All of that said to address your point of living versus being alive. I miss my family and friends. I've made tough choices to keep the ones that I care about safe. Ive sacrificed some of my own happiness and sanity knowing that I did so in order to protect others. I'm okay with those choices because I know that I saved lives in doing so. We are nearly through this thing, but and especially because of the choices of a few, life isn't going to be the same. Covid isn't going anywhere - because herd immunity probably isn't possible, especially because of the anti-vaccine/masker folks.

You want to help with the mental health of children? - - Not that you care about their lives or the lives of any of their loved ones -- Then go get your fucking vaccine. Put on a fucking mask until you are two weeks out from the second shot.

That's how you help them. That's how you get back to being ""alive"". By listening to expert medical opinions instead of listening to fucking Facebook memes about Co2 levels with a mask or complaining about how your rights are being taken away by businesses refusing to serve your disease spreading ass.

Teaching drama to little kids is amazing because they're so creative and a lot of them just have no filter. They sometimes don't understand they shouldn't say certain things - whether because it could offend someone, or because what they're saying just doesn't make any logical sense.

Interacting with kids 12+ or so is just totally different. They become way more aware of and concerned with what their peers think. As you said, later in high school, I think a lot of that dissolves at least for *some* kids, but especially early on that fear can be paralyzing. It was paralyzing even before in the early 2000s but now kids have to deal with an online presence and their online presence (or lack thereof) being judged by everyone else.

It's like there's no off time, you know?

Valeria Heredia and Gabriela Quiroz (I)

One of the axes of the new vaccination plan will be the provision of fixed posts and mobile brigades for the administration of doses against covid-19. The Ministry of Health (MSP) will work together with municipalities , universities and other organizations .

It was announced yesterday May 25, 2021, without details, [by] Ximena Garz√≥n, holder of the Portfolio [the new Minister], in the possession event [swearing in]. There she met the team that will accompany her: Vice Ministers Miguel Moreira, of Comprehensive Care, and Jos√© Ruales, of Governance and Surveillance.

Vice President Alfredo Borrero , to whom Guillermo Lasso delegated the strengthening of the health system , participated in the meeting. In that space, Garz√≥n listed the pillars of the Vaccination Plan : ""order, dignity and transparency.""

The Minister recalled that today the administration of the second formulas [doses] will resume , to complete the protection scheme for those who were summoned by the previous Government. This is how it will work until Sunday 30.

The old regimen said it used two million doses . 500,000 would remain.

The mobile teams across the country will begin actively searching for people at risk for vaccinating today. The emphasis will be on the cantons with the highest incidence and mortality.

As of Monday 31st, the new Vaccination Plan will start ; no further details have yet been given. The process, Garz√≥n said, will be ""comprehensive"", since it will include the placement of the formulas and also epidemiological surveillance , early detection and diagnosis.

The plan will have three phases: We Save Lives, We Take Care of ourselves and We Reactivate.

Lasso's website indicates that they will use the 2 100 health centers in the country. In each one, 43 people would be immunized a day (five every hour or one every 12 minutes). In this way, more than 90,000 citizens are reached every day; added together they give 9 million vaccinated in 100 days. It is not specified whether with two doses.

But to these points the voting precincts will be added . It has not been specified how many will be used. Neither is the number of vaccinators there will be. The universities collaborated with their staff until the weekend and said they were willing to continue supporting.

President Lasso has made representations to the governments of China, Russia, the United States and Chile, to access more formulas. How many vaccines have been obtained has not yet been announced. The previous Regime negotiated 20 million, the majority would arrive from June.

The contagion curve had a slight drop

The risk of contagion remains high in the country: 28 out of 100 processed samples are positive, on average. 18 provinces exceeded 30% positivity, at the end of the partial state of exception.

The country accumulated 419,198 cases confirmed with PCR tests , until Monday 24.

In general terms, the contagion curve achieved a slight deceleration , from April 23 - which began to govern the confinement in 16 provinces [the lockdown/curfew]- until last Monday.

In those 32 days, the increase in new cases was 13%, four percentage points less than in the same period prior to partial isolation. However, before and after the measurements, the average number of new cases per day is still above 1,600.

An indicator that allows us to know more clearly the evolution of the pandemic is the percentage of positivity to the virus. In the north-central Amazon , it is seen, for example, that Pastaza registers 43 positives out of every 100 samples that are processed. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), being above 20 the risk is high.

On the coast, Santo Domingo is the province most affected, with a rate of 40%, followed by Manab√≠ and Santa Elena, El Oro and Los R√≠os. Throughout the Sierra, the highest percentages are found in Cotopaxi, Loja, Ca√±ar and Carchi.

Another weakness that the new Government will have to face is the low number of tests, which affects the prevalence rates of the epidemic, at the local and provincial level.

Up to the 24th, 1,397,765 samples were taken throughout the country. For every 1,000 inhabitants, 80 tests are carried out.

On the other hand, the number of daily deaths from all causes in these 24 days of May has been 321. While in May 2019, prepandemic, the average per day was 191, so it is generally known that the unusual mortality persists in the country.",,,1622048872,{},gzjacq9,True,t3_nllwva,False,True,t3_nllwva,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nllwva/ecuador_will_begin_new_vaccination_plan_on_may_31/gzjacq9/,1622139954,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_3kr0n,False,False,,

The reason case rates were so low last summer was because last spring their were the most severe restrictions in both US and Canada. They had very low case counts before lifting restrictions. For example, ontario dropped to some days below 100 cases. The lockdown last spring was the most severe, almost all businesses were closed. Across the border in Michigan this was also the case. Their were days where cases were around 100. In most populous US cities there were major restrictions. In fact many states and cities had stay at home orders. When restrictions loosened case counts were so low and therefore it took a while to surge. As a matter of fact if you look at individual states ie Florida and Texas last summer they had surges because they did not have as many restrictions. They then were forced to their biggest restrictions to date and cases dropped. Matter of fact Florida actually closed down bars I believe last summer and haven‚Äôt done so since.

At the end of last week, three countries promised doses totaling 75 million, with Italy pledging 15 million, and France and Germany each kicking in 30 million.

In related news, EU leaders welcomed the political agreement on the EU Digital COVID Certificate forged last week. The deal followed four tense trilogue talks, but the Parliament ultimately got money for coronavirus tests and changed the name of the certificate in exchange for MEPs' sign-off.  
  
Now it's up to EU countries to implement the certificate, which could be a struggle for some. Leaders urged a ""rapid implementation"" of the certificate and called for a revision of the Council's recommendation on travel within the EU by mid-June.

I have never said anything about restrictions in Canada. 

The situation in Texas and Florida isn't really relevant as they have a radically different climate compared to Canada and Europe. But because you mentioned it, it might be worth noting that Texas lifted *all* restrictions March 2nd, and their case count has dropped 76% since then. Anyway, if you look at the data, there are plenty of examples, mainly in Europe, where cases dropped towards the summer independently of restrictions. 

This isn't something I'm making up, there is loads of research on the subject, such as [this paper.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87692-z)

He pointed out my laughter as a defense mechanism. He said, ""You're telling me these incredibly sad things, but you're making a joke out of it."" He let me know that I can allow myself to feel the feeling without trying to downplay it or worry about making him comfortable. He had extraordinary empathy and it was really a breakthrough experience for me.

Friends are important but you're right that you don't want to overburden them. I try not to lean on friends too hard. A friendship is a mutual thing, and it requires the right balance.

It all depends on jurisdiction, but if you use the title ‚ÄúDr‚Äù to gain respect and legitimize your position, especially in the domain connected to your degree, you can get into to trouble.

For example, if as a medical doc you go on radio shows and say that the vaccine contains a Microsoft chip, you will get sanctioned  by the medical association. This can go from losing privileges for a few days (ie not being able to work) to being revoked. One dude lost his ability to practice by repeatedly saying some really whack ass shit in the media.

But how does it work if say you're an army lieutenant? Not showing up in uniform to a protest is reasonable enough, but your proper title in most contexts absolutely is ""Lt. _____."" 

Say you're an army lieutenant. While on proper and approved leave, you, on your own time, show up in civilian clothes to a protest for some cause you support. While there, a reporter asks you your name, title, and for a quote on the matter being protested. In almost any context, your proper title wouldn't be ""Mr./Ms. ____ ,"" but ""Lt ____."" 

If you went to speak at a friend's funeral, you would be introduced as ""Lt. ___."" In almost any formal social context, referring to someone as their military rank is perfectly acceptable; it's a title no different than Doctor, Father, Sister, etc.

A study was done by Marketwatch and concluded that American media was the most pessimistic of all media worldwide by far.  As a result, Americans had a horribly skewed view of the dangers of COVID.  A poll by the Brookings Institute showed that Americans thought 8% of COVID deaths were people aged 24 and under.  The actual number was 0.1%.   They asked 'what percentage of those who contract COVID need to be hospitalized.  Only 18% guessed the actual figure of 1-5%.  35% answered 'more than 50%'.  The doomsday coverage was so bad that fully vaccinated people are still afraid to leave their homes and children like yours are terrified of their peers.

Every time I mention these things I'm overwhelmingly hit with the response of ""well it's better than not scaring people enough.""  No, it's not.  That's like saying that it's better if people are washing their hands raw until they bleed than not wash their hands at all. This isn't a binary choice.  We could've had accurate coverage of the situation from the start but instead America decided to make it political.  This whole thing has just confirmed to me that people only pay lip service to 'mental health.'  They seem to believe that 'mental health' equals 'access to therapy' while refusing to acknowledge that their words and actions can cause a mental health crisis to begin with that isn't easily reversed by simply 'seeing a therapist.'  We should've never been teaching our kids to be scared but a large portion of those who claim to be the 'compassionate' ones thought that compassion was scaring the living daylights out of children so that they took precautions against a virus that the CDC themselves said was less lethal to them than the flu.",,,1622059338,{},gzjzhzq,False,t3_nl7e8l,False,False,t1_gzi0gr3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nl7e8l/their_tank_is_empty_childrens_hospital_colorado/gzjzhzq/,1622155570,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_o6z81,False,False,,

What I have a problem wrapping my head around is how the vaccination is so effective that apparently the positive rate is only 0.01% in fully vaccinated individuals? 

First of all, there is no way this value can be indicative of the true value. All it suggests is that it definitely does prevent you from being able to get infected to a certain degree which is pretty obvious already. However, I think 0.01% is a very misleading value. How many asymptomatic cases are being slipped under the crack? There are so many ways this value can be a gross under representation of the actual infection rate.

There are very few countries in the world which used a zero-Covid strategy.  The vast majority of countries used a mitigation strategy and only moved to lockdowns once they had hundreds if not thousands of cases and only to prevent their hospital systems collapsing.  

It has nothing to do with their contact tracing. Ours is no better than anywhere else. In fact multiple reports have found our contact tracing is quite poor and would be overwhelmed quickly in a major outbreak.  

There is really only one strategy that works and that is finding an outbreak while it is still a single individual or family or at most two people and using contact tracing, or if it's gone any further than that instantly locking down and staying locked down until it's certain every contact has been found.  Waiting a day or two means an even longer lockdown is needed, waiting a week or two and it's too late and only a months long Melbourne style lockdown will work, if that.  The only strategy is finding cases asap.  

&gt;Even for Taiwan, their measures have worked just great multiple times until they no longer did. They had even managed to avoid a lockdown entirely, unlike Australia or Nz. So it's a bit of a stretch to assume their system is inherently less effective than Australia's.

Taiwan's strategy has been concerning since the beginning.  I've been amazed they didn't have an outbreak earlier with their lack of testing and lockdowns.  The current outbreak has proven the weakness of their systems.  

&gt;I was talking about last year.

Last year Melbourne learned the hard way that elimination was the only approach.  Before their big outbreak they also opted for a mitigation/suppression strategy shunning full lockdowns.  It was by trying to avoid a lockdown for so long that they made it so out of control they had to lockdown for months.

I‚Äôm a student and I remember years ago kids in my grade were so full of life and loud and a little too much, now my teachers have trouble getting us to talk.  Some teachers have told us that we‚Äôre nicer than previous students but they miss when students would speak.  We often don‚Äôt speak to each other, either.

I agree that social media is bad for students mental health, but I never see any talk about how some kids have to give up their social life, their sleep schedule, their passions and hobbies for a few different reasons.  Maybe school, the pandemic, social media, home problems, etc.  Me and my friends just feel very silenced, because the main response to our problems is advice and judgement, not emotional support.

And a lot of us are scared to seek support, because of judgement and the worry of financial burden on our parents.  There are certain things we want to keep private, but since we‚Äôre kids, word has to get around to our parents and it‚Äôs relatively out of our hands who knows.  We don‚Äôt want to lose control of another aspect of our life.

Social media is a blessing right now for some of us, because otherwise the last time I‚Äôve seen some of my friends is March 2020.  This is also one of the only places I can go to and be honest without the worry of completely changing my life.  Judgment from a stranger is whatever, judgment from those I look up to and who can change my life, heavy impact.  Kids look to and rely on social media for that which isn‚Äôt provided or obtainable in their real life, in my opinion as a teen.  I could never feel safe saying any of this in real life.

I don‚Äôt mean to downplay social media though, it‚Äôs awful.  The most connected generation is the also the most de-connected from each other and reality.  But teens use it as an escape.  If there was no social media, they would find the next unhealthy thing to invest themselves into.  I just hate when people go ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù which is true, then don‚Äôt look any further because they think they‚Äôve found the cause.  It‚Äôs a symptom.

Once you provide children with a confidential environment where they know they‚Äôre safe and can have privacy, they‚Äôll be honest.  But nothing in this world is confidential.  And they have to live with this reality.  They‚Äôre still growing up, they will do what they think they need to do to protect themselves.

All the states applied different criteria but most states vaccinated high risk job people people first (healthcare and essential workers, etc.), plus older people. So right off the bat you will not get a meaningful result that you can say is real-world efficacy just by comparing to unvaccinated people. Second you have to follow people and know when they were vaccinated, compared to when people in the two groups tested positive. Most people don't exactly know or keep track of dates well enough to separate the two groups -- you have to make sure you're not mixing partially vaccinated people into either group.

So far only Israel has done such a real world efficacy calculation on 1.2M people (600K vaccinated/600K unvaccinated, demographically similar). It was possible there because they keep more centralized health records than any state in the US does. Their results were very similar to the Pfizer Phase 3 trial results.

Instead of produce anything scientifically valid, the headline above is just a simplistic and dumb calculation of number of vaccinated people who tested positive divided by the number of vaccinations.

[],,Vysharra,,,,,,[],"Your wages aren‚Äôt your total compensation when you accept some jobs. Other compensation commonly includes things like employer-funded healthcare or employer-matched contributions to retirement funds (unless common but still well known is travel, vehicles, housing, bonuses tied to performance). These things increase your total compensation without increasing your wages, and previously when this type of compensation became popular, the taxes you would pay as income (every ‚Äòemployee‚Äô experiences this somewhat as the employer pays a portion of the taxes on your wages, whereas contract employees do not experience this and are typically paid more up front to make up the difference).

So, you accept a job that pays less but comes with things that make up the difference. You can get 10k a year (untaxed) by maxing out your employer-matched contributions to your 401k and also enjoy the benefits of a healthcare plan that is negotiated as a large group (even a small business with 25 employees and their families can get large savings compared to an individual, even with the open marketplace facilitated by ACA).

So, no, you don‚Äôt *absolutely* need to rely on your employer for healthcare. But it is the only *affordable* healthcare for many. Examine the cost of COBRA healthcare plans, for example. Anecdotally, my mother retired early at the start of the pandemic. She had enough years of service (in a company that had eliminated this option but she was grandfathered in) so that she could keep her employer-negotiated healthcare and they would pay 50% until she reached the age when Medicare would take over (which is taxed as income). She pays more than $500 a month for her healthcare plan, which amounts to almost 20% of her net income. Also, she has a large deductible for visits/medication/tests, which is paid out of (the remaining) income.

It‚Äôs a special trick called Bayesian statistics that allows one to indirectly calculate that which cannot be directly calculated.

Here‚Äôs how it works: 
Let‚Äôs say you have two different situations going on. The first situation we‚Äôll call A, and it means that a person has contracted COVID. The second situation we‚Äôll call B, and it means that a person wants to get tested for COVID.

Obviously we want to chance (or probability) that a person has contracted COVID. We‚Äôll call that P(A), said as ‚Äúthe probably of A‚Äù. But to do that a person must get tested, and not everyone wants to gets tested. But we can calculated both of those. 

For the first one, we say that‚Äôs probability of contracting COVID ‚Äúgiven‚Äù they got tested, or P(A|B)‚Ä¶ which is not the same as P(A).

For the second one, we say that‚Äôs it the probability someone wants to get tested or P(B), which we can calculate from population data.

The trick here is something called Bayes‚Äô Law that says P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(B|A)‚Ä¶. But now we need P(B|A). What‚Äôs that?

That‚Äôs the probability that someone will get tested given they‚Äôve contracted COVID. But how do we test people that don‚Äôt want to get tested? The answer is at the hospital. When one checks into a hospital, they get tested whether they want to or not. The hospital confirms whether or not a person has COVID, and so P(B|A) can be more or less calculated.

Now that we have P(A|B), from folks getting tested; P(B) from population data; and P(B|A) from the hospitals, we can calculate P(A), the estimated chance *any* person has contracted COVID.

In real time, it‚Äôs a bit more involved than that.

For example, let's say that a child is really excited about going to the zoo on their birthday, but it ends up to be a rainy day. In my opinion, the best thing a parent can do is to validate the emotions (""It's okay to be upset because you were looking forward to this"") and then try to help the child to ""solve"" the problem (""Do you want to go somewhere else or do something else that's special?""). Allow them to express their emotions in an appropriate way but also make sure that they understand that sometimes things don't happen the way we want.

However, a global pandemic is not the same as life disappointments. Hell, lots of adults aren't coping well with this, I certainly don't expect all kids to be resilient right now and certainly not with all of the schooling and social disruptions.

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

Also, not sure this paragraph makes much sense: 
&gt;The studies may soothe fears that immunity to the virus is transient, as is the case with coronaviruses that cause common colds. But those viruses change significantly every few years, Dr. Hensley said. ‚ÄúThe reason we get infected with common coronaviruses repetitively throughout life might have much more to do with variation of these viruses rather than immunity,‚Äù he said.

We also have long-lived B cells to common cold coronaviruses too. Our immunity to those isn‚Äôt ‚Äútransient‚Äù. The viruses just evolve enough or our circulating antibodies wane enough such that that reinfections are possible, but our immune memory is sufficient to keep the infections mild or asymptomatic. We‚Äôre already seeing a similar process with SARS-CoV-2 where, for example, the adenovirus-vectored vaccines are less effective at preventing infection with the South African variant, but still very effective at preventing serious disease. That paragraph seems to suggest that things will be different with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the common cold coronaviruses, but I‚Äôve seen many experts suggest the opposite: like the common cold coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 will continue to evolve, reinfections will occur but they will hopefully be mild for most people.",,,1622054383,{},gzjnkvx,False,t3_nln733,False,True,t3_nln733,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nln733/immunity_to_the_coronavirus_may_persist_for_years/gzjnkvx/,1622148320,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_16yuw3,False,False,,

1) We weren't hit hard last year until the fall / winter so not as much natural immunity

2) Seemed like a decent amount of travel / movement started back up in the spring before vaccines were widespread (just my observation) and there is always a lot of tourists around so as more people started feeling safe, I'm sure there was more travel into the state than last year

3) Despite election results, there are a pretty high number of conservative / military / evangelical people that have stalled things a bit with vaccines. El Paso county has a large population and not a great vaccine rate and account for a good % of cases currently

4) If I remember right, a lot of the new cases are kids -- a lot of the districts stayed in-person or hybrid and I think some bigger ones in Denver came back in person in the spring, as well

Here‚Äôs what I mean: 
When you have a headache, you take Tylenol, right? It‚Äôs a drug. And most people drink coffee for the caffeine to help with wakefulness or to keep some headaches at bay I guess. 
Now, you don‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt take a huge amount of Tylenol or caffeine to help with symptoms. No, you take a prescribed dosage. 

I use medical cannabis to cope with certain things. In the cannabis field, it‚Äôs called micro-dosing. I control the amount I intake because too much send me to a nice but intense high and too little doesn‚Äôt address my problem. 

So I do believe drugs are good for you, but with balance. I think your perspective is that someone smokes a huge blunt and gets high off their ass. That‚Äôs not what everyone does but getting high off your ass is great, just not for coping with mental health issues. 

I LOVE microdosing because it makes me feel normal, provides relief and takes the edge off. I don‚Äôt do it everyday but I would if I needed to. 

So all I‚Äôm asking is to not make blanket statements that cannabis use for coping is bad. It‚Äôs really not.

As part of my job, I travel (or I used to in the Before Times) to A LOT of different schools. All ages, too, from about 2-3rd grade to seniors. I give presentations/talks that I always try to make more of a freeform discussion.

That is SO EASY in the younger grades. They can barely contain themselves, they want to talk and engage. If I ask for questions every hand shoots up.

And all that changes between 7th and 8th grade.

It‚Äôs actually crazy how consistent it is. If I‚Äôm headed to a 7th grade class, I know they will be exuberant and a little rowdy, excited to meet me and talk to me, and all I have to do is not be boring to have a great time with them. That grade is just about ideal for what I do.

And if I have an 8th grade class? It‚Äôs like pulling teeth. Out of a rock. They are so afraid of seeming uncool they won‚Äôt give me anything to work with, I have to make it all happen and try to draw them out, which is tough for a stranger.

‚Äúit's very easy to find places that are doing well.

Indeed. Go to worldometers. Sort by deaths/M, everything in the high group is doing well: with death/cases either low or declining quickly. Some of areas did get 2nd wave: MI, IL, France, Spain but by all appearance that wave is much weaker than the first one. Deaths are extremely low

Florida and Texas affect NY, NJ, CT, and MA

Why? If you look at NY,NJ,CT,MA's curves, they stayed stably low for 3 months despite reopenings and despite the raging epidemic elsewhere.

I see you didn't say Texas or Florida though.

Want a prediction? In a month, the case and death curves of TX and FL will be much lower and they will be much more open than CA.‚Äù

You were dead wrong about this so we should probably say you spit nothing but terrible information, right? Texas and Florida shot up dramatically. They closed up shop and had refrigerators full of dead people in cities. 

Or did the science or statistics or virus change your and the worlds trajectory?

Maybe take the overall scope of the WHO and COVID-19 at face value. They are the mouthpiece of the entire world, not a country or a city or an company but the entire world.

[],,-WizeGuy-,,,,,,[],"Im just a layman, but Ill offer some insight from what Ive gathered from experts...

The mRNA vaccines are highly effective (80%-95%) at preventing all infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic). You can look at the CDC studies where they regularly tested healthcare workers or you can look at Pfizer's trials in Israel where they rcvd real world data for proof of that. If youre not getting infected- youre not spreading the virus as COVID is an aerial virus.

Also, on top of preventing a majority of infections- even if someone who is vaccinated catches COVID, their viral load is usually severely reduced making it much harder to spread the virus. There are studies out there regarding this, and Fauci himself has mentioned it as well.

Nothing is fool proof, but if you live in a community with a high vaccination rate the virus should be curb stomped down to a level that will make it even less of the small threat it is for youngsters who are not vaccinated. If you can convince a lot of your close contacts to get vaccinated you're building a defensive barrier around your kid, so to say. If some close contacts arent vaccinated, then you may want to consider they wear a mask if they are around your kids. Everyone's risk level is different. 

One issue is this nearly sterilizing immunity may fade in time meaning vaccinated folks could become increasingly prone to catching the virus but not suffer severe symptoms due to their memory cells.

In the scientific world, phrases like ""seem to"" are basically saying "" this is the general consensus"", but there still might be rare exceptions.

Definitive wording is a big no no in the scientific world for the most part. The other thing to consider, is that scientists are looking at the tiny percentage where vaccinated people can still get infected and/or spread. So, because it's technically possible (albeit it rare), they have to use the kind of wording you're talking about here. Based on all current evidence, vaccines SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE transmission. They don't completely, 100% stop it. Just as the vaccines SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE chances of infection, but they don't 100% of the time stop it. 

If you'd like, I can find a study that showed vaccinated people were around 60% less likely to infect people they live with than unvaccinated people. Now keep in mind, you also have to remember that vaccinated people are significantly less likely to catch it in the first place.

Nope, bad methodology. 

If we were talking about healthy 35 year olds, I'd agree with you. But we're not. The average age of COVID deaths is near (or often past, in some places) life expectancy. And the odds of THAT population dying in a given period of time is quite high, especially with severe comorbidities. Literally the majority of people who move into Long Term Care Facilities are dead within a matter of months. When people are hospitalized already with end-stage diseases, they are sitting ducks for nosocomial COVID. 

When you add that to the fact that in some places and periods of time, we counted ""probable COVID"" without a test due to symptoms (symptoms seen with other issues that person may have), you get a little more bad data. 

&gt;in a 2 week period 

That's not how it's done, either. The period of time from ""positive test"" to death can be much longer and still be coded as a COVID death (with its higher reimbursement rate)

Same problems as before with deaths.

&gt;While data Ferguson provided from global flight tracker FlightStats ‚Äúseem[ed] to show that thirty-one flights left from Wuhan to cities in the US and Europe on or after Jan 23,‚Äù when Bell checked those against data from a website for the Civil Aviation Administration of China, he found that most of those flights were cancelled. And a handful of others originating in Guangzhou that ‚Äúin normal times would do a stopover in Wuhan on the way‚Äù to San Francisco instead flew ‚Äúdirect from Guangzhou, bypassing Wuhan.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúThe records show that flights out of Wuhan to the rest of the world stopped around mid-day on the 23rd,, the same day China stopped flights from Wuhan to the rest of China,‚Äù Bell wrote.

&gt;‚ÄúWhy does it matter?‚Äù Bell wrote. ‚ÄúIf the Chinese government did allow regular flights from Wuhan to Western countries after January 23rd, it suggests the Chinese government deliberately allowed, if not encouraged, the spread of the virus to five cities in Western countries after it tried to control it in China.‚Äù

&gt;We spoke to Ian Petchenik, the director of communications for Flightradar24, a global flight tracking service, and Petchenik confirmed that ‚Äúthere were no more normal, commercial flights‚Äù from Wuhan after Jan. 23. ‚ÄúThey did stop people from going to the U.S. and to the rest of the world,‚Äù he said.

&gt;After Jan. 23, flight data shows there were a few flights from Wuhan to destinations in Asia outside of China, Petchenik told us, but those may have been mostly empty planes returning to their base country. There were also a handful of flights from Wuhan chartered by the U.S. State Department to evacuate American citizens, including diplomats and their families, beginning on Jan. 28. Passengers on those planes were flown to military bases in California and were mandated to complete a 14-day quarantine.

&gt;On April 21, Ferguson provided an ‚Äúupdate‚Äù to his April 5 column in which he acknowledged, ‚ÄúData from sensors tracking actual flight paths would seem to indicate that no flights left from Wuhan itself to other countries in the world after January 23.‚Äù Ferguson wrote that he reached out to the U.S. company Flightspin, and that officials there ‚Äúconcluded that it was very unlikely indeed that any flights had gone from Wuhan to Western cities after January 23.‚Äù",,,1622060608,{},gzk2iwt,False,t3_nllo0m,False,False,t1_gzk0kbt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nllo0m/biden_orders_us_intelligence_to_intensify/gzk2iwt/,1622157354,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_n9yvr,False,False,,

But more AstraZeneca shots would give the EU a bigger cushion as it vies to hit a target of fully vaccinating 70 per cent of its adult population, about 255m people, by July. The bloc currently estimates it will have received 519m doses of all vaccines by the end of June, including 55m single dose Johnson &amp; Johnson shots.

EU officials have suggested extra AstraZeneca doses could come from the US, where the jab has still not been approved for use, or another international manufacturing site, such as China.

A verdict in the Belgian court case is expected next month.

The EU contends that AstraZeneca should have made up the shortfall using 50m doses from other manufacturing sites named as possible sources of production in the contract between the two sides. Almost 40m of these shots were made in the UK and most of the remainder in the US.

AstraZeneca insists it has done everything it can to meet the huge challenge of scaling up the complex production of Covid-19 vaccines. The company has consistently argued that it made the contractually required ‚Äúbest reasonable efforts‚Äù to fulfil the EU delivery schedule.

In an interview with the Financial Times last week, chief executive Pascal Soriot said it had been ‚Äúbad luck‚Äù that sites supplying the EU had struggled with production problems, while others, such as one in South Korea, had not.

The EU has been particularly riled that AstraZeneca has been more successful at fulfilling its UK contract. Soriot said the original contract between the UK government and Oxford university, before AstraZeneca became a partner, included priority access to vaccines produced at UK manufacturing sites. 

AstraZeneca is arguing that it told the EU in its original tender on July 24 2020 that the UK manufacturing facilities would only produce doses for the EU once they had fulfilled UK orders. 

AstraZeneca is still the second-largest supplier to the EU after BioNTech/Pfizer. Unlike many of its rivals, AstraZeneca is providing the vaccine on a non-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.

The 20m extra doses the commission is seeking from the company would make little difference to the EU‚Äôs accelerating vaccine rollout.

**Brussels wants penalty of ‚Ç¨10 a dose a day if pharma company does not supply more, lawyer tells court**

The EU has demanded damages potentially amounting to billions of euros from AstraZeneca if the company fails to increase deliveries of its Covid-19 vaccine by next month.

The European Commission wants the company to pay penalties of ‚Ç¨10 a dose a day if it does not supply 20m extra shots by the end of June, a lawyer for the European bloc told a court in Brussels on Wednesday.

The demand is part of a lawsuit launched by the European Commission in an effort to force AstraZeneca to deliver 90m doses in the second quarter of the year rather than the 70m currently scheduled. The legal action is an escalation of a battle between the EU and the company over longstanding delivery shortfalls on the 300m shot contract.

AstraZeneca said its lawyers would outline its case later on Wednesday.

Rafael Jafferali, a lawyer for the EU, told the court in the Belgian capital that the company ‚Äúdid not even try to respect the contract‚Äù with the EU.

AstraZeneca was originally expected to supply up to 300m doses to the EU in the first six months of this year but that forecast was cut to just 100m after production problems. The commission wants the court to order the company to raise that figure to 120m.

‚ÄúThe European Union does not accept the late delivery of the vaccines by AstraZeneca and considers that this is a violation of the contract,‚Äù the commission told the Financial Times. ‚ÄúAstraZeneca has to catch up with the agreed calendar as soon as possible.‚Äù",,,1622056852,{},gzjti4o,True,t3_nlp4ib,False,False,t3_nlp4ib,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nlp4ib/eu_to_demand_billions_in_damages_if_astrazeneca/gzjti4o/,1622151971,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_136cc9,False,False,,

Hospital capacity, 90% in January, is 13%.‚ÄúThe drop in cases and deaths is likely a combination of vaccinations, natural immunity following infection, and perhaps also changes in season,‚Äù said Emily Gurley, epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Gurley says vaccine immunity lasts longer than immunity from infection and another wave could be ahead.Another explanation is Mexico‚Äôs northern neighbor. The U.S. is rapidly vaccinating itself to better health. This means infections headed south are greatly reduced. And after President Joe Biden eliminated age restrictions this month and supply began outstripping demand, more Mexicans began going to the U.S. to get vaccinated.‚ÄúMany Mexicans have gotten their shots in the U.S., that‚Äôs for sure,‚Äù said Carlos del Rio, an epidemiologist at Emory University in Atlanta. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all a combination of factors that is inhibiting transmission.‚ÄùMexico reported 9.5 Covid-19 deaths per million inhabitants in the week through May 23, the slowest rate of fatalities in more than a year and down from more than 80 earlier this year.

**Vaccine Tourists**Mexico‚Äôs vaccination campaign has only covered about 14% of the population with at least one dose since it began in December, according to Bloomberg‚Äôs vaccine tracker. The strategy has prioritized health care workers, the elderly and teachers.That has led hundreds of thousands to seek shots up north. Although exactly how many isn‚Äôt known, some data offer clues.Passengers flying to cities in Texas, a hot-spot for Mexicans looking for shots, more than doubled in March from February to some 305,000, according to government data. That includes Houston, McAllen, Laredo, San Antonio and Dallas.Miami saw a 76% monthly increase in passengers from Mexico in March. Mexico‚Äôs travel agent association says members have sold over 170,000 vacation packages for people looking to fly to get shots.When the U.S. began the vaccine roll-out, Houston Medical Brokers set up a service to help people navigate the appointment process.‚ÄúThe word somehow got to Mexico and people started contacting us as the vaccination process is quite slow there,‚Äù a spokesperson said, adding that the company has helped 200 Mexicans book shots.The U.S. also sent millions of doses of the vaccine to Mexico and Canada.Last month, almost 2.3 million people traveled between the U.S. and Mexico, according to data posted by the Airlines for America trade group. The next highest country was the Dominican Republic, with only 606,000 passengers.And while a decision Tuesday by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to downgrade Mexico‚Äôs air safety ranking could reduce an uptick in traffic by Mexican carriers, it won‚Äôt impact current routes or prohibit U.S. airlines from expanding operations to the country.

**Opening Up**Mexico City, one of the hardest-hit regions during the December wave, is expecting to return to ‚Äúgreen‚Äù in the government‚Äôs categorization, the loosest since the pandemic began 14 months ago.That means the city is considering opening schools in June and even allowing concerts, unthinkable three months ago.The country, which has officially lost more than 200,000 people to Covid, will likely reach herd immunity in September, Mexico‚Äôs virus czar Hugo Lopez-Gatell said earlier this week. He told the Washington Post recently that half of the population may have antibodies and that variants haven‚Äôt become dominant strains in Mexico.Gurley from Johns Hopkins warns that relying on immunity acquired from the virus isn‚Äôt a good long-term bet.‚ÄúPopulation level immunity from infection is dynamic - a few months after a peak in transmission, it will likely start to wane,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúVaccine is the best strategy to keep immune levels in the population high.‚Äù‚Äî With assistance by Sebastian Boyd",,,1622052160,{},gzjiabi,False,t3_nln6ra,False,False,t3_nln6ra,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nln6ra/mexicos_covid_deaths_fall_sharply_on_immunity_us/gzjiabi/,1622144980,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_16a0fd,False,False,,

I went through this, recently, as my parents forced me to go back to school this year. It entirely depends on how they stayed together before - in my case, it was through gaming and voice calls.

I used to talk to 8 guys in the good old times, before the pandemic. After online classes started, I lost touch with 1, and, due to personal drama, cut ties with another 1 - total, 6. Stayed that way for a while, until we met another 1 who was into gaming. We became friends, and he showed us 2 other good guys, so, we also became friends.

With that, it went from 6 to 9 people, even with friendship losses. I also became closer to those people, as we stayed on Discord calls for hours a day (and still do!); which is how we kept in contact. Later in the year, we met a nice girl who's now a friend's girlfriend, so that's 10. Yay!

Now, I went through some really hard times last year, as I developed many /r/EyeFloaters in both eyes (for no reason; please fund research), and having those guy's/girl's support was great.

It wouldn't have happened without gaming, though. Without it, it'd be like the first guy I lost contact with. As for your question, with this guy (who I hadn't talked about in a year), and all others, it was exactly like the old times.

Nothing changed. We all still know each other, and talk like we used to - except for that asshole that I cut ties with, but hey, his loss. Even then, though, this all took a really large toll on my mental health - **especially** the floaters; which I theorize wouldn't have happened if life had proceeded as usual, and which now impede me from using white screens, paying attention to class like I used to, working in bright environments... fun stuff. Even with that, I took my new free time to learn programming, quickly, and can live off of it now, but still think I'd trade this security for just having my vision fixed.

It's definitely been hard on us, man, especially those who developed new issues, or truly isolated - both of which I did.

[],,vanyali,,,,,,[],"A formal collaboration is underway in North Carolina, where Siri &amp; Glimstad attorneys are co-counsel in a case brought last month in federal court against the Durham County Sheriff‚Äôs Department. The local attorney participating in the case, Jeff Dobson, declined to comment. The plaintiff in the case, Christopher Neve, directed questions to Siri &amp; Glimstad.
After Neve refused to disclose his vaccination status in March, the sheriff confiscated his badge, gun and bulletproof vest and placed him on administrative leave, according to the complaint. He was fired later that month, the complaint alleges.
Durham County Sheriff Clarence F. Birkhead declined to be interviewed but said in a statement, ‚ÄúRequiring the vaccine not only protects employees from covid-19, but also provides for the protection of anyone who lives in, works in, or visits Durham County.‚Äù
The arguments set forth in the North Carolina complaint mirror those outlined in letters from Siri, both sent on April 22, to the presidents of Rutgers and Princeton University.
‚ÄúICAN has received numerous inquiries from its members regarding this mandate, including students attending your university, and has asked that we send you the following notice,‚Äù reads the letter to Rutgers University President Jonathan Holloway. It urged him to reconsider the requirement that students be vaccinated before arriving on campus this fall.
A university spokeswoman, Dory Devlin, said the policy stands. ‚ÄúLike the hundreds of public and private universities who have followed our lead, we are entirely confident in our legal and ethical position with respect to mandating vaccines in the fight against the global pandemic,‚Äù she said in an email to The Washington Post.
Princeton, too, was unmoved by the letter. ‚ÄúWe conducted a careful review and are confident in our legal position,‚Äù said Ayana Gibbs, a university spokeswoman.
Putting ‚Äòyour imprint on an early area of law‚Äô
This month, ICAN updated its notice seeking plaintiffs for possible litigation, saying it is ‚Äúno longer accepting cases for legal action.‚Äù
Some legal experts suggested the group may be pulling back because it has accomplished what it set out to do. Its attorneys have made their mark on the early legal contest over vaccine mandates, through commentary as well as legal communications and filings, said Reiss, the University of California professor. She noted that other lawsuits filed against coronavirus vaccine mandates ‚Äúfollow very closely Siri‚Äôs piece in Stat.‚Äù
Attorney-client privilege makes the extent of the role played by ICAN‚Äôs legal team difficult to determine, said James G. Hodge Jr., director of the Center for Public Health Law and Policy at Arizona State University‚Äôs Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor College of Law.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre peddling specific legal arguments designed to attract anti-vaxxers and others who might be willing to listen,‚Äù Hodge said.
ICAN‚Äôs legal team remains active on other vaccine-related fronts. Earlier this month, Siri &amp; Glimstad filed a complaint on ICAN‚Äôs behalf asking a federal court to order Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra to remove the finding that ‚Äúvaccines do not cause autism‚Äù from all communication with the public.
A suit last year against Facebook and YouTube said these platforms had terminated or greatly restricted ICAN‚Äôs activities ‚Äî and offered a window into the group‚Äôs communications strategy. At stake was the group‚Äôs ‚Äúability to reach billions of potential viewers,‚Äù said the complaint, filed by Siri and Brehm, along with a California attorney, in federal court in California.
Asking the court to dismiss the complaint, Facebook and YouTube said they had acted against ICAN because it was ‚Äúspreading harmful misinformation about covid-19 that could exacerbate the ongoing public health crisis.‚Äù
Stripped of other platforms to press its case against vaccines, experts said, the group is turning increasingly to the courts.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a chance to put your imprint on an early area of law that hasn‚Äôt been litigated before,‚Äù Reiss said. ‚ÄúAnd to do it in a context that fits your beliefs.‚Äù",,,1622054064,{},gzjmtgu,True,t3_nljcmn,False,False,t1_gzjmn76,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nljcmn/resistance_to_vaccine_mandates_is_building_a/gzjmtgu/,1622147849,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_31jsv,False,False,,

Others said the hurdle created by the emergency use authorization, or EUA, is more rhetorical than legal. ‚ÄúThe FDA required as much for this EUA as it requires for full approval,‚Äù said Dan Troy, a former chief counsel to the agency.
But the issue has never been tested, Mello said. ‚ÄúEven legal scholars disagree about how to read these regulations,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a great deal of uncertainty.‚Äù
A legal warning
One of Siri &amp; Glimstad‚Äôs earliest challenges was brought against a county-owned skilled-nursing facility that has served the southern Wisconsin community for more than 160 years.
The 128-bed Rock Haven nursing home had 15 cases of the coronavirus and two deaths, said Rock County Administrator Josh Smith, prompting leaders to require staff vaccinations. A memorandum issued shortly before Christmas noted that failure to comply would ‚Äúresult in the employee being laid off,‚Äù not eligible to return until vaccinated.
Of nearly 200 workers, 16 are on layoff status, Smith said.
Representing a Rock Haven employee, Brehm, one of the firm‚Äôs New York attorneys, wrote to county officials that they were ‚Äúdeliberately taking away each employee‚Äôs statutorily guaranteed right to decide for him or herself whether to accept or refuse administration of the covid-19 vaccines.‚Äù
The Feb. 2 letter arrived on the same day as another from a Wisconsin law firm. ‚ÄúIt is our firm belief that ‚Ä¶ Rock County‚Äôs perhaps well-intentioned but heavy-handed policy concerning mandatory vaccination of county employees violates ‚Ä¶ constitutional rights,‚Äù wrote Michael J. Anderson of MJA Law, located near Madison.
The following week, Brehm wrote again on behalf of the same client, while noting 15 additional employees represented separately by Anderson. ‚ÄúWe hereby demand that Rock Haven withdraw its covid-19 vaccine mandate forthwith since requiring an unlicensed and unapproved product violates federal law and, likely, numerous state laws,‚Äù she wrote, this time with Siri also signing the letter.
Anderson, the local attorney, said he spoke four to six weeks ago with representatives from Siri &amp; Glimstad about the possibility of working together. A collaboration, he said, would allow the New York attorneys to practice law in Wisconsin on a temporary basis without being formally admitted to the state bar.
‚ÄúThis New York firm ‚Äî I believe they were interested in cases like this around the country,‚Äù he said in an interview. ‚ÄúGoing forward, if there is litigation, they may or may not be involved. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù
In the meantime, however, Anderson went ahead with a claim against the county earlier this month, demanding $50,000 in lost wages and other benefits for 11 employees of the nursing home.
About a week later, the county showed signs of backing down. Its health services committee voted 4-to-1 on May 12 to recommend that officials revoke the requirement at the nursing home and reinstate employees who refused the shots. The full county board will consider the recommendation on Thursday.",,,1622053990,{},gzjmn76,True,t3_nljcmn,False,True,t1_gzjm1oq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nljcmn/resistance_to_vaccine_mandates_is_building_a/gzjmn76/,1622147743,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_31jsv,False,False,,

I don‚Äôt mean to hurt other people‚Äôs feelings so I keep things to myself, especially from my parents when I should probably be telling them these things.

If it‚Äôs a really big deal and I‚Äôve been reluctant to tell others, it helps for that person to tell me it‚Äôs ok to feel that way and that it will stay confidential.

I want to know that I wasn‚Äôt worrying about nothing or maybe it‚Äôs reassuring to hear that what I‚Äôm worrying about is not a big deal.

Framed as a legal overview offered for the benefit of employers, schools and other organizations ‚Äúgrappling with whether to require Covid-19 vaccination,‚Äù the piece warned of ‚Äúcostly and time-consuming litigation.‚Äù
Left unsaid was the fact that Siri and a law partner were representing a Wisconsin nursing home employee objecting to one such requirement. The piece also did not note significant disagreement over what the law allows.
The fact sheet issued by the Food and Drug Administration for coronavirus vaccine recipients and caregivers says it is ‚Äúyour choice to receive or not receive‚Äù the shots. The language echoes a provision of federal law governing the emergency authorization of medicines that stipulates people must be informed ‚Äúof the option to accept or refuse‚Äù the product, but also ‚Äúof the consequences, if any, of refusing.‚Äù

Michelle M. Mello, a professor of law and medicine at Stanford University, said it‚Äôs not clear whether the statute was meant to address making the shots compulsory for work or school.

An employer can‚Äôt hold you down to get the shots against your will, said experts in health and employment law, but some believe a permissible consequence of refusal to vaccinate could, in some circumstances, be losing your job. In December, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said employers requiring the vaccine would comply with federal disability law and anti-discrimination statutes so long as they make exceptions for an individual‚Äôs disability or religious beliefs.
