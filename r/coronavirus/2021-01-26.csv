However, counseling at the beginning of the year overcrowded rosters to like 40+ kids per class so they could avoid hiring new staff. They knew kids would choose virtual so figured we'd never get fill classes this year anyway. Then when teachers get sick or quit, they double up classes.

So we ended up with several classes where kids are wall to wall as usual.

And then they don't enforce proper mask wearing so everyone goes around with their nose hanging out.

So here I sit, with Covid, trying to get better but a lot of lingering symptoms.

There's no need for plastic barriers around every desk if the classroom is in a true cohort (which is the recommendation for elementary and middle school).   If someone in the cohort tests positive, everyone quarantines regardless of seating configuration.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Good luck with that when it’s so freaking cold outside. It works in the summer but then you’ll need ACs, and we all know how ACs blow covid particles into everyone’s faces.

We live in Connecticut and temperatures have been in the teens for the last couple of weeks.  Windows and doors are open in every classroom and it's really not a big deal - some kids throw on a sweatshirt.

&amp;#x200B;

My kids attend a Title I public school.  Their school building was constructed in the early 1950s and has no A/C.  They've been in the classroom 4 full days a week since September, and their school of 400 students - including a significant special ed population - has had a total of 2 confirmed covid cases in that time.   Neither case resulted in any known in-school transmission.

This is not to say that it's super-easy - but at the same time we can't let perfect be the enemy of good.  There are simple, cost-effective ways to mitigate many of the risks of having at least younger students in classrooms and it's worth taking steps to stop the significant harm being caused to the most vulnerable children.",,,1611773686,{},gkzhqd8,False,t3_l62qgt,False,True,t1_gkzbgja,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l62qgt/sick_kids_in_class_teachers_punished_for_speaking/gkzhqd8/,1611794031,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

If I had to guess I would say that 50-60% of the US eligible population (i.e. adults) will take it this year, probably higher in some areas and lower in others.  It will gradually trend higher as the skeptics see no dire side effects.  If it ends up being required for certain things like travel or concerts then that might drive it up higher.  But for whatever reason people are widely skeptical of vaccines. I don't think they are necessarily outspoken, whacko Facebook-spamming anti-vaxxers but just quietly don't want to take it.

I went to the dentist a few weeks ago and asked my 60-something hygienist if she had taken the vaccine and she said she would ""wait a while"".

I mean they are doing things differently. 25 year olds are more likely to be working and going into society more. They are asking for you to take some precautions to try and slow the spread so the at risk people can be safer when they do go out. 

&gt;In fact I have been surprised that there has been a steady rate of hospitalizations and fatalities in the exact same demographic week after week, month after month.

Again yes the at risk people need to be careful but again the higher rate of community spread the higher at risk they are

&gt; In other targeted risks like breast cancer, once the target demographic is identified they become part of a campaign to screen and protect them, which is effective. But somehow this never happened with Covid, I think due in part to the fact that people just don't understand the facts.

I do not work for big pharma. I never have.

I did not do that as part of my job. I do not even expect to get paid for that work. 

Not a lot of money in writing Toxicology Textbook chapters. Even less money when you allow people to read them for free. 

Yes, one manufacturer of attenuated (i.e., weakened) polio vaccine did a poor job and some people were given polio by the vaccine. It was a deadly mistake. 

But even so things got better. That problem was fixed and lives were saved because enough people got the polio vaccine. 

That kind of mistake cannot happen with these RNA vaccines. It doesn't work that way. RNA viruses need both their RNA and their proteins to spread. 

And coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 have really long genomes. 

The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines use just a small part of that viral RNA to have our bodies make the proteins on the outside of the virus. 

That small piece is not nearly enough to make a functional virus. It's like trying to make a recipe without most of the instructions.

&gt;“If we add anal swab testing, it can raise our rate of identifying infected patients,” Li Tongzeng, an infectious-disease specialist at Beijing You’an Hospital, said on state-run broadcaster CCTV on Sunday. “But of course considering that collecting anal swabs is not as convenient as throat swabs, at the moment only key groups such as those in quarantine receive both.”  
&gt;  
&gt;...

&gt;China tried the testing procedure in small groups last year, with the results circulated in research journals. A group of Chinese researchers [published a study](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/10.2217/fmb-2020-0090) in the Future Microbiology journal in August reporting that for some recovering coronavirus patients, anal swab samples still tested positive after they tested negative through throat swabs.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 detection was positive in the anal swab of two patients and negative in throat swab and sputum samples,” they wrote. “We propose anal swabs as the potentially optimal specimen for SARS-CoV-2 detection for evaluation of hospital discharge of covid-19 patients.”  
&gt;  
&gt;As for how the test is conducted, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention published instructions last March. It said that a stool sample should be taken from patients, and if that is not possible, to do an anal swab by inserting a cotton-tipped stick three to five centimeters (one to two inches) into the rectum.

It's clear at this point that some people simply take this virus more seriously than others. A lot of the social circles filled people who don't give a shit have already seen outbreaks. In this sense you could have a micro herd immunity of sorts where the virus simply has less opportunities to grow because it has already infected a large percentage of the plague rats.

|

Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides on Wednesday flatly rejected AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot's claim that the company was only required to make a ""best effort"" rather than be contractually obligated to deliver a certain quantity of coronavirus vaccine.

""Pharmaceutical companies and vaccine developers have a moral, societal and contractual responsibility which they need to uphold,"" Kyriakides said. ""The view that the company signed a best effort agreement is neither correct nor it is acceptable.""

An EU official earlier in the day called the AstraZeneca's shortfall ""massive"": The EU will get only a quarter of what it was promised by the end of March.

|

Kyriakides said the EU is demanding that AstraZeneca make use of all of its production facilities — including two in the U.K. and two on the Continent — to fulfill the Commission's purchase contracts. The EU's contracts, which call for up to 400 million doses, didn't restrict production to its factory in Belgium, and the EU in fact expected the drugmaker would use all of its capacity.

""We reject the logic of first come, first served,"" she said. ""That may work at the neighborhood butcher’s but not in contracts and not in our advanced purchase agreements.""

She said that the Commission and AstraZeneca signed an advanced purchase agreement — which an EU official said was worth €336 million — to build manufacturing capacity ""so they can deliver a certain volume of doses the day [the vaccine] is authorized,"" a decision expected on Friday.

""The logic of these agreements is as valid then as it is now,"" she continued. ""We provide a de-risking investment upfront, in order to get a binding commitment from the company to pre-produce even before it gets authorization. Not being able to ensure manufacturing capacity is against the letter and the spirit of our agreement.""

Kyriakides also raised again the suspicion that AstraZeneca can't meet its first quarter orders because it sold doses to other countries.

""No company should be under any illusion that we don't have the means to understand what is happening,"" she said. ""We do have a knowledge of the production of the doses, where they have been produced and — if they have been sent anywhere — where this is.""",,,1611777594,{},gkzpzym,True,t3_l6cwlt,False,False,t3_l6cwlt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l6cwlt/eu_commissioner_astrazeneca_logic_might_work_at/gkzpzym/,1611798228,24,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The reason for that is that if a virus arrives at a vaccinated person, it replicates very little, so there are very few mutations that can happen before it gets eradicated. In theory, you could have a virus mutating in a healthy person, and hitting on a mutation that also avoids vaccine-created antibodies, but that it is also very likely so.  


Unlike with regular immunity, where a virus has way more copies and way more time to learn how to avoid the immune system - even then it took multiple millions people getting sick and almost a year to get a new variant that is somehow better at escaping immunity.

Why? Fulfilling a concrete set dates pre-existing contract does not breach ""best effort"" any more than following the labor laws does.

True, but prior AZ obligations have everything to do with what they can deliver to later obligations under best efforts.

The crux of the issue is that AZ has no ulterior reason to screw the EU in particular, especially as the EU is a larger market. Fact is they signed the contract later and the clause is weaker.

&gt;More than 40 percent of all reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths in the United States have occurred in nursing homes. As a result, health care workers’ access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and infection control policies in nursing homes have received increased attention. However, it is not known whether the presence of health care worker unions in nursing homes is associated with COVID-19 mortality rates. Therefore, we used cross-sectional regression analysis to examine the association between the presence of health care worker unions and COVID-19 mortality rates in 355 nursing homes in New York State. Health care worker unions were associated with a 1.29-percentage-point reduction in mortality, which represents a 30 percent relative decrease in the COVID-19 mortality rate compared with facilities without these unions. Unions were also associated with greater access to PPE, one mechanism that may link unions to lower COVID-19 mortality rates.",,,1611762948,{},gkym1tv,False,t3_l5us5n,False,True,t3_l5us5n,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l5us5n/mortality_rates_from_covid19_are_lower_in/gkym1tv/,1611765238,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

If you want a short answer, basically you create a piece of DNA that has the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein coding sequence and a few other features (e.g. 5' and 3' UTR, T7 promoter, polyA tail, etc.). Then you use E coli bacteria to amplify that DNA and produce a large quantity of template DNA. 

Then there is an in vitro transcription reaction where a T7 RNA polymerase enzyme uses the DNA template to produce many copies of RNA. You would need to supply large quantities of the RNA nucleotide building blocks, and in this case they are using N1-methyl-pseudouridine as one of the four to reduce innate immune system activation.

There is also a capping enzyme, I believe the article said it was a vaccinia capping enzyme, used to install a 5' cap on the mRNA sequence. 

The resulting linear RNA sequence is about four thousand base pairs long, and needs to be purified. 

Then the purified RNA is mixed with several specialty lipids to form lipid nanoparticles, probably under fairly precise conditions. For Moderna the lipids are:

SM-102, polyethylene glycol [PEG] 2000 dimyristoyl glycerol [DMG],
cholesterol, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [DSPC].

Then the lipid nanoparticles are dissolved in a pH-balanced solution and filled into the vials.

Also the article mentioned that many of these steps are being done at different facilities, so you might have purified RNA being transported to a whole other facility before it gets mixed with the lipids, or the LNPs being shipped to a fill and finish plant to be put in the vials.",,,1611762781,{},gkylkjn,False,t3_l5zkk5,False,True,t1_gkyaz2y,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l5zkk5/daily_discussion_thread_january_27_2021/gkylkjn/,1611764950,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The initial shortage was mostly a supply chain issue and that has been largely resolved. But the big hospitals only wanted to work with familiar supply companies whereas smaller companies that were sometimes in other sectors were able to quickly pivot and obtain small quantities (relatively speaking) of respirators. 

I know all of this because I have been running a website to help people with disabilities and chronic illnesses find N95 masks since the beginning of the pandemic. A lot of people still don’t know that anybody can buy them, not just hospitals, and sadly I believe that is causing unnecessary illness and death. But since the beginning, I knew that my home care workers would need medical masks and then suddenly Amazon blocked sales of N95s. I had to look for alternatives and that’s how I started the business. 

Cloth masks are fine to cover a medical mask, but alone, they really are not good enough to protect you in crowded indoor situations. Even an imperfectly fit N95 is going to be better because it will give you some protection from all of the people not wearing a mask or who have their noses hanging out and such.

I actually trust the respirators on Amazon less than I do the ones through my other suppliers. It’s too easy to list fake products on Amazon. Especially the KN95s, they are poorly regulated and people are trying to pass off fakes as ones that have received EUA. Quality KN95 masks are great but the bad ones are practically useless.

Considering how difficult it is to get Americans to wear any mask at all, I don’t think requiring respirators would work in the USA. But anytime someone asks me what kind of mask they should be wearing, I tell them N95 masks, or KN95 masks if they really can’t stand the head straps.

Sure, but even the low end estimates for rapid test accuracy are at about 80 percent. This means that 80 percent of people who are positive and take a rapid test will not be able to board the plane. That is a huge improvement over doing nothing.

&gt;  if it's a PCR test, by the time you get the results you could already have gotten infected or progressed enough in a current infection to test positive

Also true, but it will once again prevent the people who are definitely positive and have tested positive from flying. Preventing those people from flying will have a meaningful impact, even if a small percentage of people contract it after they take the test.

&gt; It makes much more sense to just limit the number of passengers on a plane, make them all wear masks, and anyone with a headache, a stuffy nose, a sore throat, needs to stay home

This would not prevent these other measures from happening. I agree with every single point you make here. They should be limiting the number of passengers on a plane, make everyone wear masks, and prevent people with any symptoms from flying. I also think that they should require a recent negative test on top of these other measures. None of these measures are 100 percent effective, but each one lowers the odds that a person who has COVID will spread it to other people on a plane.

 In the meantime, they are saying they will vaccinate teachers , but seem to just ignore that kids go home to their parents?

I think everyone agrees that keeping schools open is of paramount importance-- with the question being how to factor health safety in.

We had 2 choices in keeping schools open:

1)  Do whatever it takes to keep schools open.  

Everyone, with children or not, could have reduced social interactions, followed guidelines on masks and sanitizing, stopped going to bars, parties, dine-in restaurants, gabbing with friends, etc.  Design effective school safety programs, including modifying air handling systems, reducing class sizes and migration of students/teachers through the building.  Design an effective, affordable, and realistic method of testing and enabling quarantining/isolation when testing positive.  

Schools would be open, and everyone would be reasonably safe.

OR

2)  Do whatever it takes to keep schools open.

Don't ask anyone outside of school employees to actually make adjustments or concessions in their lifestyle. Don't give schools any money or resources to make it work safely.  Put schools absolutely at the bottom of the list in all considerations except demanding that they should be open.

   Change the definitions of risk factors:  Move the goalposts, and ignore them when you run out of space to move them.  Don't test, so you can claim there's not a problem.  Define terms so that obvious problems become 'obviously not problems'.  Hide data.  Don't share data you get stuck with despite the best attempts to have none with any interested parties, including parents, teachers, and taxpayers.  Ignore that fact that even if children aren't likely to get seriously sick or die, it doesn't mean that teachers, teachers families, student's families, school workers families, do get seriously sick and die.

Schools would be open, and no one would be reasonably safe.

The EU couldn't keep all Pfizer/BioNTech doses if it watned to because again, it's mostly an American vaccine due to the how it was funded. BioNTech partnered with Pfizer because they're a small company who wouldn't have had the resources to produce the vaccine by themselves. Also Pfizer's vaccine isn't just produced in Belgium, Belgium is one of many production hubs. 

But the EU can stop export of the the Pfizer vaccines produced in Belgium. It might not be a nice thing to do, but it is something they can consider. The EU has two option, take the high road, be nice and let the vaccines be shared amongst countries as they should be, or put it's citizens first and be a parasite to the world like the US is doing and keep the vaccines inside their borders.

It's a vaccine that has significantly by Germany and the EU and has received very minimal investments from the US and it was not part of operation warp speed. Also the technology comes from an European country and has been developed in Europe by a German company HQ'ed in Germany. And one of the major production plants, supplying a lot of countries, is in the EU too.

Also I completely disagree with forcing AstraZeneca using foreign production supply to meet the European demand. But I think that there is a pretty reasonable chance AstraZeneca didn't meet their ""best effort"" agreement and didn't notify the EU in time. Let's be honest, the 60% delivery cut to the EU is very significant and is completely the fault of AstraZeneca due to their extreme incompetence of getting the facilities ready for production. They didn't even get close to the promised amounts, with months of preparation and hundred of millions of up front investment to get it ready. A couple of percent or a couple dozen even, I can understand, but missing 59 million vaccines suddenly just shows the extreme incompetence from AstraZeneca. Also how it somehow happened suddenly one week before approval after months of preparation and hundred of millions euros up front investment for production facilities. No other warnings from them before that one announce that there might be a cut in deliveries. So also on communications they've been extremely incompetent or even worse, basically fraudulent (if they kept it quiet or lied). So don't blame EU incompetence for disgusting and complete incompetence from AstraZeneca. For this specific case there is only one guilty and incompetent party: AstraZeneca.

That's exactly what I've been trying to explain. There might be a breach of contract if the vaccines produced in The Netherlands could've been in European stock too, since AstraZeneca will also use a production facility in the Netherlands to produce EU's vaccines. Now they went to the UK to fullfil their contract. But IF the vaccines could've gone to the EU too, it can be considered a breach of the ""best effort"" contract.

Notice all the if's in my comment. It can happen. And if it doesn't, it'll have nothing to do with the UK contract taking precedence over the EU contract.

At first it was a phone appointment with my primary care doctor in March (cause I'd scheduled an appointment in February to be seen &amp; then COVID hit). She referred me to a Neurologist, because I was also having migranes &amp; she just thought all my symptoms were migrane related (even tho I didn't understand how that would be, but just went along with it) 

Neurologist ordered a brain MRI which came back clean. I'm guessing he was checking for MS because symptoms of these diseases can overlap. 

Then around June, in person visits finally opened up here (I'm in LA) and I was able to go in person to my doctor. She ran a bunch of different bloodwork and most everything looked okay, but my iron, ferritin, and vitamin D levels were very low. So she began having me take prescription supplements &amp; a few days after that, I woke up with trigger finger in my left hand. 

I talked to my mom about the weird thing that happened to my finger &amp; that's when she told me about how that would happen to her grandma &amp; how she had RA. 

I then look up RA &amp; was like, holy shit this could be the answer. I'd never even considered it before &amp; has no idea it ran in my family. 

So I went back to my doctor with this information and she referred me to my rheumatologist. 

Now all the typical blood work they run for autoimmune diseases was normal for me-- like ANA, CRP, ESR.

I was only able to get diagnosed because my Rheumatologist knew to run a test that's very specific for RA called anti-CCP.  So definitely make sure they run that test on her. Also be aware that ppl can have normal bloodwork across the board but joint damage in their imaging. So bloodwork isn't the end all for a diagnosis.

Anyway... About a month later I started treatment with HCQ &amp; about 2 months into that, I began feeling the difference. 

I used to wake up every morning feeling like I'd been hit by a truck. I had crazy fatigue, brain fog, stiffness, body aches.. I'd sometimes feel like I was coming down with the flu &amp; even get a low grade fever (the amount of times I thought I had COVID before I got diagnosed was too many). 

I later learned these are all very common symptoms in RA and my medication has helped tremendously in reducing my symptoms. I only have a handful of bad days a month now as opposed to like almost every day. 

I also later discovered it's very common for people with autoimmune diseases to have low iron &amp; low vitamin D. Not quite sure why, but it seems to be a thing. I was able to get my iron up, but still struggling with the vitamin D. So that's an ongoing thing for me still. 

It's a slow process to get diagnosed. Usually people wait months to see a specialist &amp; get tossed around to several before landing with the right one. I got lucky because of COVID, everyone else had cancelled their appointments &amp; therefore I was able to be seen fairly quickly in comparison. 

I hope your gf can find answers soon! I know how awful it is to be in the dark about what's happening to you &amp; knowing something isn't right. 

Just tell her to keep advocating for herself &amp; fighting for answers.

That's not true mate. AZ obligation to EU was to make ""best effort"" to deliver on time, which they have done.

 Reuters reports the following

&gt;“Best effort is a completely standard clause when you are signing a contract with a company for a product that does not yet exist,” one official said. “Obviously you cannot put a completely legal obligation” under these conditions.  
But the official said best effort meant the company had to show an “overall” effort to develop and deliver vaccines.

.

&gt;There is also the question whether AZ did everything they could to make those plants produce as expected. 

This can be called into question of course, but then these questions should first be directed at the sub contractor actually producing the vaccines. The plants aren't actually owned nor operated by AZ.

Furthermore, since the EU took it's sweet time signing the agreement with AZ, it makes sense that they had less time to iron out the supply chain and production for the EU. Remember that even though the UK production had 3 more months they still had production issues early. 

&gt; Btw. AstraZeneca signed the contract with Novasep in Belgium already in June (more than a month before the contracts with the CDMOs in UK). So AstraZeneca had enough time to get everything up and running in that Belgian plant 

AZ doesn't run that facility. Novasep does, so most manufacturing problems would fall on the subcontractor. Furthermore, signing the contract doesn't mean that funds got allocated right away, especially as scale was unknown prior to signing a contract with the EU. We're talking about hundreds of millions in investment, companies can't and won't just take that risk.

&gt; How on earth does a company notice that they can only deliver 40% of the committed volume only days before the deliveries start?  

No argument there, they should have notified the EU long in advance. This part is a complete disgrace for AZ.

&gt; hose things are phrased more like ""in the event of reduced product availability, the vendor allocates the available products fairly across the current commitments it has to its clients"". 

That would be a direct breach of the UK contract, as the UK contract specifies that all UK plants will first and foremost supply UK deliveries. There's also an export ban on vaccines in the UK, AZ would need to be asinine to accept that clause.",,,1611772614,{},gkzevsl,False,t3_l61y3w,False,True,t1_gkz5jk5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l61y3w/astrazeneca_cancels_steering_board_meeting_with_eu/gkzevsl/,1611791485,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The day the results were back, the day before she was planning on leaving, she felt ""a little tired"" and her result was positive. Trip halted, family isolating, she's feeling worse but stable. But if she hadn't gotten the test, 100% she would've fallen ill on the other side of the border.

Dr. Alina Alonso, the state health department director in Palm Beach County, confirmed Governor Ron DeSantis chose the county as a ‘test site’ for a pilot program where all vaccines will be funneled through the grocery giant.

She said vaccine doses that were initially supposed to be sent to the county’s **health department have been reallocated to Publix.**

County Commissioner Melissa McKinlay is not happy about Publix being in control, according to the [Sun-Sentinel](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/palm-beach/fl-ne-publix-vaccine-rollout-criticism-20210126-mwlta7s62ndnfdv42bhkas2o5q-story.html).

How many children and family members catching the virus is acceptable here?   If even one person dies from forcing children back into school, that's too many.

As to your comments on ""children left behind"", did you advocate the same when educational funding was cut continually over the last decade in the US?  Some of those children were going to be disadvantaged even if the pandemic hadn't happened.

I suggest you set aside your preconceptions about who is saying schools shouldn't or should re-open and re-examine the situation.

It isn't just teachers' unions saying that schools shouldn't re-open, it's a lot of people who are both knowledgeable in science and who have no bias toward trying to ""protect"" the economy.

You can blame whomever you like, but an objective examination of the facts will show that schools can and will spread the virus.

Wasn't that also the case in the US?  People who were working minimum wage jobs were actually making more on unemployment due to the CARES act?

I'm not sure that makes them better off 'economically' as you said.  Getting more per month doesn't make one better off 'economically', it just means you're temporarily getting more cash per month.  I'd rather take the security of having a job than to be laid off and relying on temporary government relief which would mean I'd be under the stress of what to do once that relief runs out.

&gt;You'd have to ignore decades of research to conclude that someone working minimum wage in a US grocery store is better off than a grocery store employee in another developed nation who became unemployed as a result of this pandemic. You could do that cross-analysis for every other sector, too, but you'd need to do it sector by sector to be a fair comparison.

&gt; The federal government signed a $16.2 million contract in April 2020 for the Department of Defense to purchase AutoMedx SAVe II ventilators from Combat Medical as part of an effort to increase ventilator supply.

&gt; However, officials at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) later found the ventilator was inadequate for treating COVID-19 patients.

&gt; HHS then entered into a $62.5 million contract with Combat Medical in June to purchase AutoMedx SAVe II+ ventilators, which was supposed to be an improved model. However, the new model was also found to be insufficient for those hospitalized with coronavirus.

&gt; “Reports and independent studies have indicated that the ventilators purchased by the federal government may not be appropriate for their intended purpose of treating COVID-19 patients, which raises serious questions about whether their purchase for nearly $70 million constitutes waste, fraud, or abuse,” Krishnamoorthi wrote.

&gt; HHS and the Defense Logistics Agency purchased 11,200 ventilators from Combat Medical, according to the Post. 

This was a screw-up of epic magnitude and a great big waste of taxpayer money. It should be investigated, and if anybody got a kickback, they should be prosecuted, and if the problem was merely incompetence, then we should know who was in charge of it and make sure they are ineligible for any responsible government job again.

You need to Google things before randomly spewing your opinions as facts:
Literally the first hit:
* One person dies every 36 seconds in the United States from cardiovascular disease. About 655,000 Americans die from heart disease each year (1,795 per day)—that's 1 in every 4 deaths..*
CVD = cardiovascular disease, which includes heart attack.

So you’re saying literally 0 of those 1,795 will have had the vaccine that day? In every day over the last month since we’ve been giving them out, not a single one?

I’m not going to break down the math on that because you won’t understand it. Suffice to say it’s not “ironic,” it is again literally statistics and just a confluence of obvious, unrelated, but sequential life events. How it “feels” to you is irrelevant.

This is why. IT IS NOT THE FLU. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FLU. It's not just a ""nasty"" virus like HIV. It's a *novel* Coronavirus and every single thing we've found out about it has been alarming.

It's like comparing the normal tides coming in and out to a tsunami. Sure, you can drown on the beach from a normal wave, but no one in their right mind would ever compare a wave to a tsunami.

This is the most dangerous virus in nearly 100 years because it is NEW TO HUMANS. While we know a lot more than we did a year ago, we know fuck all about what it will do next year.

There has been some positive news lately and we shouldn't only dwell on the negatives, but we also have to be honest about what this is and is not.

In the 17th century, London was a densely packed cesspool with decaying food, animals, and human waste lining the streets especially in poorer parts of the city, and the plague killed \~100k people between 1665 and 1666 thanks largely in part to those conditions as well as the lack of treatment and all of the medical knowledge we have today.

500 years later, a viral respiratory disease has killed roughly the same amount of people in the UK as a whole even with modern sanitation, medical know-how, ventilators, medicines, and treatment methods all within less than a year since the first death in the UK was recorded. Though it'll end up being a smaller share of the total population killed with this disease than it was 500 years ago with the plague, Covid will go down in history among the others in part because it was able to still do this much damage even though we have the benefits of all the modern medicine, communications systems, vaccine technology, and everything else that those who dealt with the last great pandemic (1918) and those that came before could never even dream of.",,,1611764214,{},gkypp58,False,t3_l6368n,False,True,t1_gkxzh3z,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l6368n/uk_covid_deaths_now_greater_than_great_plague/gkypp58/,1611767494,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That's not how this works. There are definitions in the contract to specify what exactly ""best effort"" means and I am 100% sure that the contract goes more into details about what when and how.

&gt;Reuters reports the following

Reuters doesn't have access to the contract. No one except the EU and AZ has.

But there is the CureVac contract which states:

&gt;In the case of delays to the anticipated availability of the ***Product***, the ***contractor*** aims to allocate the ***doses*** of the ***Product*** fairly across the demand of ***doses***, which the ***contractor*** has or will contractually commit to towards its present and future customers, as such ***doses*** become available.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This can be called into question of course, but then these questions should first be directed at the sub contractor actually producing the vaccines. The plants aren't actually owned nor operated by AZ.

True, but still the EU will ask AZ as they have the contract with AZ. And AZ has the resposibility to monitor it's subcontractors and should already have the answer for the EU. Because otherwise they have some serious management issues with their subcontractors.

&gt;Furthermore, since the EU took it's sweet time signing the agreement with AZ, it makes sense that they had less time to iron out the supply chain and production for the EU. 

AZs first CDMO was Novasep in Belgium. So it can't be that there wasn't enough time to fix processes. Plus, Novasep's part in the production process is the one that barely has any supply chain issues. It's fill-finish where you really run into supply-chain challenges.

So I guess it's more a production issue where the yields were too low because something was screwed up (like temperature or some dirt got into the system). 

&gt;Furthermore, signing the contract doesn't mean that funds got allocated right away, especially as scale was unknown prior to signing a contract with the EU. 

The scale was known well in advance of the contract signing. Basically all CDMO contracts were signed quite early by AZ. 

Also, it was clear from the beginning that whoever could deliver doses would be able to sell them on the market. 

&gt;There's also an export ban on vaccines in the UK, AZ would need to be asinine to accept that clause.

Ah! That would be then a true blocker. Pfizer has the same issue since the US since they can't export anything, so the EU has to accept that.

But the UK being uncooperative could backfire since most vaccine production facilities and most of the raw material production is in EU countries. Would the EU also ban exports, UK could lose access to Moderna and Pfizer vaccines immediately and even risk production of the AZ vaccine in UK.

Until now, the EU plays very fair in that regard and the UK receives a lot of doses from production sites within the EU. Let's hope the EU doesn't also switch to a ""EU first"" strategy like the US or UK.",,,1611774607,{},gkzjscz,False,t3_l61y3w,False,True,t1_gkzevsl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l61y3w/astrazeneca_cancels_steering_board_meeting_with_eu/gkzjscz/,1611795104,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,SaulKD,,,[],,,,text,t2_4qqs3,False,True,[],"Philadelphia is home to some of the most venerated medical institutions in the country. Yet when it came time to set up the city’s first and largest coronavirus mass vaccination site, officials turned to the start-up Philly Fighting COVID, a self-described “group of college kids” with minimal health-care experience.

Chaos ensued.

Seniors were left in tears after finding that appointments they’d made through a bungled sign-up form wouldn’t be honored. The group switched to a for-profit model without publicizing the change and added a privacy policy that would allow it to sell users’ personal data. One volunteer alleged that the 22-year-old CEO had pocketed vaccine doses. Another described a “free-for-all” where unsupervised 18- and 19-year-olds vaccinated one another and posed for photos.

Now, the city has cut ties with Philly Fighting COVID, and prosecutors are looking into the “concerning” allegations.

The group offered a partial apology Tuesday while defending the switch to for-profit status, and CEO Andrei Doroshin told Philadelphia magazine that claims he had helped himself to leftover vaccine doses were “baseless.”

Just a few weeks ago, Philly Fighting COVID was receiving glowing coverage from the likes of NBC’s “Today.” The group had a compelling story: Doroshin, a graduate student at Drexel University, helped orchestrate an effort to use 3-D printers to make free face shields for hospital workers at the start of the pandemic. By summer, he and his friends were running their own pop-up testing sites citywide.

But as Philadelphia magazine reported, the group’s “executive team” lacked anyone with a medical degree or advanced degree in public health. Doroshin himself listed a résumé that included stints teaching a high school film class, producing videos of people longboarding and practicing parkour, and founding a nonprofit that, according to Philadelphia magazine, “mostly consisted of a meme-heavy Twitter account, some minor community lobbying, and a fundraiser with a $50,000 goal that netted $684.”

Speaking to “Today,” Doroshin said that his lack of a traditional public health background allowed him to “think a little differently” and speed up the vaccination process. In another interview, he expressed hopes of setting up a McDonald’s-like franchise and suggested that best practices for administering vaccine doses “can go out the window.”

Philly Fighting COVID’s young, entrepreneurial leaders also openly talked about the potential for profit, one former volunteer told WHYY: “They were bragging about how rich they were going to get.” Another volunteer said the group’s executives “said they were gonna be millionaires” by billing insurance providers for administering vaccine doses that Philly Fighting COVID got free. (Doroshin has disputed these allegations.)

The city’s partnership with the group began drawing scrutiny last week after WHYY reported that Philly Fighting COVID had abruptly backed out of plans to host coronavirus testing clinics in predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods and “completely ghosted” community leaders, as one pastor put it. Then, on Saturday, dozens of seniors lined up for hours to be vaccinated at the Pennsylvania Convention Center only to be turned away because the group had accidentally allowed too many people to sign up.

“There were literally 85-year-old, 90-year-old people standing there in tears, with printed appointment confirmations, saying: ‘I don’t understand why I can’t get vaccinated. I’m 85,’ ” one witness told the station.

A registered nurse who volunteered with the group categorized it as a “disaster of an operation.” Katrina Lipinsky told the Philadelphia Inquirer and WHYY that she wasn’t asked for her medical credentials before she began administering vaccine doses, and that plenty of unused doses were left over after seniors were turned away on Saturday. She alleged that she saw Doroshin place between 10 and 15 of those doses in his bag and take them with him when he left.

The 22-year-old CEO attended a small gathering with friends that night, according to WHYY, and a photo that circulated on Snapchat appeared to show him “getting ready to administer an unspecified syringe” to an individual in a private home.

Philadelphia Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said at a Tuesday briefing that the allegations were “very disturbing” if true, and that any leftover vaccine doses should have been returned to the city. He also said that “in retrospect” it was a mistake to partner with the group.

The city announced on Monday that it would no longer work with Philly Fighting COVID for coronavirus testing or vaccine distribution, a day before the allegations of mishandled vaccine doses surfaced. The decision to sever ties was made after health officials became aware that the group had switched to for-profit status, Farley said Tuesday.

Farley also cited concerns about the group’s privacy policy, which were first raised by WHYY. For weeks, Philly Fighting COVID collected data from tens of thousands of Philadelphians seeking vaccine appointments without telling them how that information could be used. When a privacy policy finally appeared on the group’s website last week, it contained provisions that would allow Philly Fighting COVID to sell users’ personal data to a third party.

In a Tuesday statement, Doroshin called the inclusion of that language a “mistake” and said it had been removed. “We never have and never would sell, share, or disseminate any data we collected as it would be in violation of HIPAA rules,” he wrote.

Doroshin also apologized for “any miscommunications” as Philly Fighting COVID switched its focus from testing to vaccines, and said that he never intended to “cause confusion or harm.” The group lacked the resources to handle both testing and vaccinations at the same time, he said, adding that becoming a for-profit company was necessary for “scaling up.”

But elected officials still have questions. On Tuesday, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner (D) asked anyone with knowledge of potential criminal activity to contact his office, while Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D) invited Philadelphians who felt they had been misled by Philly Fighting COVID to open a complaint. Multiple city council members have called for an investigation, the Inquirer reported, and want to know why inexperienced college students were placed in charge of such a crucial task in the first place.

Notably, everyone on Philly Fighting COVID’s executive team is White, reported Philadelphia magazine — a fact that has raised eyebrows in a city that has struggled to vaccinate its substantial Black population, (Philadelphia is roughly 44 percent Black, but only 12 percent of vaccine doses have gone to Black people so far.) The city is also home to the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium, which pioneered one of the earliest efforts to conduct coronavirus testing in communities disproportionately affected by the virus.

“If there was anybody poised and ready to do this, it was us,” founder Ala Stanford told the magazine, adding that the city had suggested she team up with Philly Fighting COVID to administer vaccine shots. “I happen to have been a doctor for 23 years, longer than some of these kids have been living, but I need these white kids to teach me how to do it?”",,,1611774591,{},gkzjr1r,False,t3_l6411s,False,True,t1_gkyi62l,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l6411s/philadelphia_let_college_kids_distribute_vaccines/gkzjr1r/,1611795086,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Without serious numbers on aerosol emission rates of contagious virus, there is no base in these claims.
We knew the infection dose for the old strains, now this should have been done weeks ago for the new ones.
Viral emission rate studies were always missing decent first-phase patient numbers, though.

There are a few documented cases where it looks a bit like people got infected in minutes by aerosols.
On the other hand, grocery store workers see a dozen infectious Covid cases per day.

So without the above numbers, I can't take these ""expert"" opinions seriously. Aerosol infections could still be a rare thing.

You should also be careful about these random stories about ""Some guy got the vaccine and then the next week he got hit by a bus!"" This is a fallacy called [post hoc ergo propter hoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc) (""after this, therefore because of this"").

This issue is caused by the lengthy red tape the EU chugged through to make its order of the vaccine (halting attempts by its member states to do so earlier to take control itself). It didn't set up anything until a quarter of a year after the UK did, instead relying on the value of EU-made vaccines that never came to fruition. It's hard to catch up 3 months of anything, nevermind a continent-scale vaccination programme.

The vaccines exported out of the EU for the UK were to fulfil the supply contract the UK made with the vaccine provider. That contract dictates that the UK-made vaccine gets UK priority and everyone seemed fine with that at the time. You guys are complaining about doses of a vaccine that, right now, would still be sat on a shelf waiting for approval, instead of actually saving lives. 

This issue of seeing Britain as this nationalist anti-EU entity is the driver behind a lot of this. Frankly, the EU fucked up. The easiest scapegoat for them is the UK.

1) They want to have more supply in case the variants need boosters to vaccinate against them.  I, personally, think that this is why the Biden administration ordered an additional 100M of Pfizer and Moderna yesterday.  It seems like they would be covered anyways and those 200M doses won't come until Q3 anyways.  So an insurance policy against variants.   
2) AZ is having manufacturing issues.  US is supposed to be the second country (after UK) to get it.  I assume all the US doses will be made in US and they haven't been able to scale up yet and their US based phase 3 trial needs more information before it is completed. I am not sure if they will get supply from other countries but this is pure speculation.   
3) I have heard any plans to buy more J&amp;J vaccine.  I guess we will have to wait and see about the results before we know if it is a 1 or 2 dose.

The UK is the second worst at 1.87/100k, or just over 75% of Portugal's per capits death rate. This is currently higher than every US state individually (highest is Arizona at 2.32/100k) and much, much higher than the US at large (1.02/100k).

However, a few US states have exceeded Portugal's current death rate: 

- New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Massachusetts spent several days above 2.45 in the early outbreak that rocked NYC (these states all share the same metropolitan megalopolis).
- North and South Dakota and Iowa all spent a few days well above 2.45 in late fall/early winter. These are low population states where the vast majority of people live in one or two large cities; they're also anti-masker territory and had mostly just been dodging an inevitable bullet until they got hit.
- Alabama very recently was up there and may exceed 2.45 again as it is still at 2.24 with a rising trajectory. 
- Honorable mention to Arizona which is our current worst state that has so far hit up to 2.41 and also has a rising trajectory with a current rate of 2.32/100k.

Also, some countries have been worse off as well, these are all the countries that have had higher death rates at any point in the pandemic:

- Belgium - 2.89/100k in mid-April
- Slovenia - 2.48/100k in early December
- Lithuania - recent peak at the insane 3.48/100k in early January

There was no Merck order. It was always too far out. And you said Sanofi was key, when it was actually smaller than Johnson &amp; Johnson for example - and we could see results for that quite soon. As I said, you had a nice answer, but needed to add a little umph by this silly claims. Sanofi was a solid 5th option. Merck was on the horizon for option #9 or thereabouts. 

&gt; Incorrect. The original dosing allocations were 60m by March for the UK and 100m by March for the EU. The UK order as we are made to believe was 'guaranteed doses' and the EU was 'best efforts'. It seems the EU did not check what they signed thoroughly enough.

I guess we will eventually find out. I agree that if EU indeed did sign an order that did not commit the other party to ship, that was a horrible mistake.  The delay clauses in the CureVac advance purchase agreement don't equate to best efforts, even though they acknowledge that delays can happen. In fact, that APA specifically says "" In the case of delays to the anticipated availability of the Product, the contractor aims to allocate the doses of the Product fairly across the demand of doses, which the contractor has or will contractually commit to towards its present and future customers, as such doses become available."", which I believe the EU is alleging AstraZeneca is not abiding to.

&gt; Yes, so much so that when the Germans realised the EC made a mistake they went outside of the EC Vaccine Purchase Scheme and bought their own doses.

That they obviously haven't received, as there are production problems, and [the order is schedule to be shipped after the EC purchase](https://www.politico.eu/article/germanys-coronavirus-vaccine-side-deal-at-odds-with-legally-binding-eu-pact/). I'm not sure if you meant to agree or or disagree, but I'm saying that no amount of extra orders would led to larger shipments at this time, as the production issues are the problem. Saying Germany did put in an extra order, but did not receive them, adds evidence for my argument. 

&gt; It is almost like building a supply network and production locations from scratch in months not years is a tough task. It seems the EC appears to believe the production shortfalls should only apply to their other customers.

Yeah, that is the fundamental issue, but for Pfizer, EC was making noise because they announced smaller deliveries to EU while keeping full shipments to countries that ordered later. I'd guess the Pfizer and AstraZeneca clauses are similar to CureVac in that they say that if there are delays, the contractor treats all customers equally.",,,1611759640,{},gkyctum,False,t3_l5zkk5,False,True,t1_gkxzikj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l5zkk5/daily_discussion_thread_january_27_2021/gkyctum/,1611759791,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Ya know what pisses us off? Not the restrictions. They do in a minor way but we all understand (mostly) it's for the common good and want to do our part.

What pisses us off is the SHEER HYPOCRISY of particularly Newsom and Pelosi. Newsom's wineries have remained open and in business, he still goes to swanky dinners that are NOT outdoors, and then goes on TV and says ""please have thanksgiving but eat it outside in individually packaged portions and six feet apart."" Pelosi gets caught getting her hair done, not even wearing a mask, and then LITERALLY THE NEXT DAY goes ""haha okay salons are safe now jk!""

There is a petition in California to hold an emergency recall election of Newsom and it currently has 80% of the required signatures to make the ballot in March. Newsom is opening because he is terrified of it -- it's been steadily gaining traction. If you're a Californian reading this, please consider signing it.

We want to be safe and we want to follow the science. If the numbers say salons are dangerous and restaurants are dangerous and schools are dangerous, then let's adjust and do it! AND in turn if the numbers say they're not, then let people have their businesses back as best they can and show us what other areas need to do better. But whatever you do DO NOT waggle your finger at us and then go off ignoring your own rules. Post photos of you eating your own Thanksgiving dinner outside in a park, Newsom. Let your gray roots show Pelosi, you're 80 we've known the whole time that wasn't natural and you've been sneaking, come on.

Just for the love of God, play it smart and go through it WITH us instead of playing little-dictator.

A letter proves that the German Minister of Health, Jens Spahn (40, CDU) and his counterparts in France, Italy, and the Netherlands had to hand over the procurement of the life-saving vaccine to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen (62). They had to humbly apologize for their efforts to obtain the vaccine. This letter is exclusively available to BILD.

BILD has learned that both Chancellor Angela Merkel (66, CDU) and von der Leyen considered it important that the Letter by Spahn and his colleagues should sound as humble as possible.

The background is that Spahn and his colleagues had jointly tried to procure a sufficient amount of the vaccine for all Europeans. Merkel, however, wanted to make the procurement, as a big gesture, a matter of the EU.

The result is that the EU has failed disastrously to procure enough vaccine in time for all Europeans.

The letter says: “Unfortunately, the parallel approach of the Alliance caused concerns. Therefore we believe that it is of utmost importance to have a common single and joint approach towards the various pharmaceutical companies (…) We also agree that speed is of the essence in this case. So we deem it very useful if the COM [Commission] takes the lead in this process. Of course, we are more than willing to continue our further support and expertise.”

Almost apologetically, the four Ministers of Health write that they “have not started negotiations on the funding agreement of Astra Zeneca so far.” Moreover: “We would very much welcome if the COM were to take forward these negotiations”.

BILD has learned that, as early as June 2020, the four ministers had serious doubts about the EU’s ability to procure sufficient amounts of the vaccine in time. However, they were urged by their respective governments – i.e. in Germany, Angela Merkel – to hand over the process to Ursula von der Leyen.

What is striking: in contrast to the present claim by the EU, the chancellery, and Spahn, the letter at no point concerns negotiating good prices for the vaccine or preventing any “vaccine nationalism”. In contrast to the present portrayal of the matter, such considerations apparently played no role in the handing over to the EU.

All four ministers signed the letter in person. Then the vaccine disaster took its course …",,,1611782897,{},gl03r5b,True,t3_l6es3d,False,False,t3_l6es3d,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l6es3d/with_this_letter_by_jens_spahn_the_vaccine/gl03r5b/,1611805091,22,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Let’s be honest, this is about the incompetence and glacially slow movement of the EU, which most of its member countries have vaccinated only ~2% or less of their people, compared to almost 11% for the UK. Ironically, in this instance, the Brexiters were right - cutting the bureaucratic middleman of the EU out of the process does make for a smoother operation.
