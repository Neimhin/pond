Technically and legally the EU has the ability to do so. It has chosen not to do so.

And the UK and US are not exporting anything themselves - so pointing at them as some great benefactors to the world is questionable.

&gt; What I do know is that the Pfizer deal is the reason you‚Äôre at such low vaccination rates today. 

Disagree. I blame this fully on AZ. AZ fucked up royally and was dishonest from day 1 (prior commitments in the APA) - when it was evident to them that they would not be able to deliver on their promises in a spectacular fashion they could have saved lives by telling the EC straight that they are having productions issues. This would allow the EU to contract additional doses from other manufacturers.

Unfortunately this has cost lives and will cost a few more lives in the near future.

idk where the article takes it's recovered % from. But the Israeli gov tracks the recovered, if they get vaccinated then they are detracted from the recovered count and added to the vaccinated.

Real numbers are 56.3% vaccinated (at least 1 dose), and on top of that 6.9% recovered but not vaccinated. That's from official Israeli health ministry publication, see [here](https://rotter.net/User_files/forum/606ed21546be60fd5.png). Total number of recovered is (vaccinated and unvaccinated) can be found on the [official gov COVID dashboard](https://datadashboard.health.gov.il/COVID-19/general) and is 835k, or about 9% of the population (hence no idea where they take 15% from).

&gt; What about asymptomatic infections, missed by testing? 

Israel has some of highest testing rate in the world throughout the pandemic, furthermore despite early thoughts of asymptomatic cases, later studies found those to be rare.

Still I'd expect that on top of the 835k (9%) detected recovered, there'd be about 4-6% additional recovered that weren't tested. Many of whom statistically probably got vaccinated.

We can kind of assume herd immunity in Israel for over a month now. Virtually everything is open. We had massive street parties with thousands of people and cases haven't gone up. We have 15,000 people strong packed demonstrations and cases haven't gone up. We had a family based holiday where most of the country gathered in groups of 15-30 (Israeli families are large) and still cases haven't gone up.

Sports events, theaters, restaurants, gyms, pubs, clubs and concerts are happening. Schools are open and in person.

Generally the vaccine should be used where the virus spread more, so to limit the variants.

First off, I'm appreciate that this is a deadly virus and that governments around the world are struggling to make decisions that balance livelihoods and lives. But there's a lot I don't understand about vaccine passports and how they would help when used domestically.

I travel quite a bit and always carry my yellow-fever vaccination card with me alongside my password, despite only having needed it in a few countries. I think it would be reasonable to require a COVID vaccine in the same booklet as my yellow fever vaccination when traveling between countries, particularly when going from a high covid rate area to a low covid rate area.

It's the domestic use of such passports that I find bizarre and worrying. The vast majority of vaccine passport concepts I've seen to date are electronic, and will be used anywhere from airports to restaurants to hotels to any other public place one may want to go. No one is tracking me with my paper yellow fever certificate. With a digital vaccine passport suddenly anyone with access can track everywhere it's been scanned.

And for what? If I understand things correctly just because you're vaccinated doesn't mean you can't still spread covid it just makes it less likely. If all the staff are vaccinated, who cares if the people coming into the restaurant or hotel are? The (deliberately) unvaccinated don't care, and those that are unable to get vaccinated due to medical issues are going to have to always take extra care anyway considering they could potentially catch it from a vaccinated person.

In my mind, the downsides of these vaccine passports FAR outweigh the potential upside, I'm hoping someone can convince me otherwise.",,,1617960806,{},gtwuysi,False,t3_mnbmyg,False,True,t3_mnbmyg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnbmyg/daily_discussion_thread_april_09_2021/gtwuysi/,1617960818,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This undersells the vaccines IMO and I fear it would send the wrong message. For efficacy against hospitalization/death don't they basically all come in a rounding error away from 100%? The risk of a severe outcome is already substantially lower for the younger demographic that's likely attending concerts (in OP's example); vaccination would render it down to ""lightning strikes twice"" levels.

I'm really averse to seeing us make decisions based on ""*technically* there's still a risk"" when we start getting down to the .00X% threshold of ""see, the risk isn't zero"".

Otherwise, it's protection against mild/moderate symptoms where you see a several percentage points' difference from 100% and where some vaccines fall a little further against some variants. That's fine; the risk of catching a mild to moderate cold from a large gathering has existed since the dawn of time, and since the dawn of time it's been a personal decision whether or not to change that risk. There's no need to change that system.

I think your logic about having passports be a temporary measure for cruises, concerts, or plays only until the spread dies down is fine, but I'd worry about the execution.

My reply to the question of who has the right to define whether mormons are christian or not was ""unprompted"" (if such a thing even exists on a discussion forum...). But the following discussion on respecting religious beliefs etc. was not unprompted, there I was challenged.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Sounds like you would consider Mormons less misquided if they didn't consider themselves Christian. Maybe I'm just reading it like that tho so who knows? Words on the internet have no thoughts other than what they literally express.""

No, if they believed in god they would still be misguided. All these theological variations doesn't really mean anything, as the fundamental premise, that there exists a god, is wrong anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Strongly believing that all religions are a bunch of lies is a belief man. Not sure how you can claim otherwise. Beliefs aren't a religious thing. There are political beliefs, societal beliefs, economic beliefs, etc. This is definitely a belief.""

Do I ""believe"" in gravity too? Or do I know it is real? Knowledge and beliefs are not the same thing.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Default, normal position huh? ""Normal"" is decided by society, not an individual alone. ""

OK. I'll give you this one. But it is sad that we still have the need for the word ""atheist"". One day we hopefully won't need it anymore, it will just be assumed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""...horrible...  
&gt;  
&gt;You literally compared us to anti-vaxxers and climate change deniers, among other harmful groups. These people literally reject actions and deny movements that save lives. Unless you somehow think these are great people, you are insinuating that we are as bad as them. You don't need to use it to mean it.""

I was not talking about the ethics of it. But about how reasonable, or not, these beliefs are.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""You can't claim something is a negative without proving that it is. That's just scientific logic.""

It is not scientific logic. It is a debated philosophical question, but in practice it is not how any real acquiring of knowledge works, scientific or otherwise. But I don't think negative is the most descriptive word here, it is more about the absence or presence of something. If we were to decide if god existed, what is most reasonable, that I prove his absence or that you prove his presence? 

It should be really easy to prove his presence, he could just who himself and perform some cool tricks. But to prove absence is impossible because believers are just going say he is is built in such a way that he won't show up on any measuring instrument we make anyway, not today and not in the future.  And it is really easy to imagine any such supernatural entity and know that it can never be disproven.

Let's say you are selling expensive cars. A buyer comes back and says he wants to cancel the deal  because there is something wrong with the car. He can't show you what is wrong with the car, but he says you  must prove that there is nothing wrong with it. That is unreasonable. There are no symptoms of anything wrong with it but you are supposed to take it apart and send each piece of it to laboratories for analysis?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""The flying spaghetti monster was a clear and obvious joke... ""

&amp;#x200B;

Of course it is a joke. That is not the point. There have been thousands of different religions throughout history, and prehistory, that have made claims about the existence of supernatural beings. And they have all claimed that their beliefs happened to be the right one. And none of them are any more reasonable than any of the others.  The point is that it might as well not have been a joke, or that it doesn't make a difference if it is a joke or not. 

There are no reasons to believe in these religious teachings. The only reason someone believe in them are because they are taught these beliefs by other people. If for example the christian god truly existed, he should somehow have showed himself to the aztecs of Mexico. But their children was raised to believe in many gods, for example Yacatecuhtli, the god of merchants. But if Yacatecuhtli is real, why did only the aztecs know him? Why didn't Yacatecuhtli show himself to the ancient greeks, who did believe in the god of the sea Poseidon?  Because these gods are all man-made, just like the spaghetti-monster.

&amp;#x200B;

Our infrastructure, once the pride of the world is decaying. Many Americans still drink out of lead pipes. Much of rural America still has no broadband. We have no ability to built a massive solar farm in the desert and transfer that energy a few hundred miles.  It takes nearly 12 hours to take a train from New York City to Pittsburgh when it takes half that time to drive because of how out of date our rail is.  

Wealth inequality in America has MUCH worse than almost anywhere else on earth. Our wealth gap is as bad as countries like Rwanda. I'm supposed to feel proud of that?

We are also still one of the only countries that offers little to no maternity leave for the majority of working women in this country. And let's not get started on the gender pay gap as well.

I think there are definitely people out there who still believe that any % risk is too much. The misinformation that was spreading two weeks ago about vaccines not being effective at preventing transmission had a really nasty impact on a subset of people and I think it is going to be very, very difficult to get them to come around to reality. Similar to the way that the misinformation about mask effectiveness last year exacerbated anti-mask sentiments (when experts went out and told the public masks didn't actually work that well so they could manipulate people out of panic-buying supplies that were needed by healthcare workers). I believe the vaccine transmission rate misinformation likely had similar motives, and was an effort to keep unvaccinated people from using the growing vaccination numbers as justification to expand their bubbles.

I don't think these people are generally going to be in positions of power though. Society will fully reopen whether or not the reopening is compatible with their own personal risk tolerance.

I mean just explaining my thoughts on this: I have no idea whats going on in Australia or New Zealand that makes their governments more resilient, although I do know NZ Labor party is really effective and seems to be pretty impactful over there. 

As I see it, the difference is probably that those are states largely in the sino periphery and are benefiting a lot from the growth engine that is China (and also India to some extent). I know Australian trade with China has grown massively and they continue to be able to ride the coattails of that. 

The truth about the US/UK/EU though is that the last 2-3 decades of policy have cratered their economies. [The real unemployment rate in the US is something like 26-40% dependecing on segments](https://www.axios.com/americas-true-unemployment-rate-6e34decb-c274-4feb-a4af-ffac8cf5840d.html). There has been [almost no meaningful recovery in jobs since the financial crisis](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-05/americans-are-bringing-forward-retirement-plans-because-of-covid?srnd=premium) in the US.  Its similar in parts of the EU. High real unemployment is not actually a structural problem in a country with a huge informal sector, like say Kenya or something, but since western societies are on a declining trajectory from a previously better position, it has made governance nearly impossible. Legislatures swing back and forth between opposing ideologies. Commercial interests have overrepresentation in policy making and tend to can influence policy too much. The more wealthy segments of those societies live in constant fear of the lower segments and there is basically just a pendulum of inefficacy that swings back and forth. Nothing meaningful has been accomplished as of late. That's my opinion anyways.

You might still not feel that ties directly back to pandemic response, but I believe that once a populus and its state have essentially given up hope on meaningful changes in policy or governance, they enter a stasis where society essentially accepts that nothing will fundamentally change (coincidentally words that Joe Biden actually said to donors before), and government services decline and crater. A lot of people have pointed to [this decline in pandemic preparedness budgets](https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/mar/30/federal-pandemic-money-fell-years-trumps-budgets-d/) but I feel its probably just part of a larger mindset that made it impossible for certain western governments to have ambitious responses.",,,1618000353,{},gtyzy9c,False,t3_mnd39m,False,True,t1_gtyvnn7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnd39m/herd_immunity_probably_not_necessary_to_end/gtyzy9c/,1618003589,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,Viewfromthe31stfloor,,,[],,,,text,t2_3nelaphm,False,True,[],"&gt;Amid the staggering amount of suffering and death during this historic pandemic of COVID-19, a remarkable success story stands out. The development of several highly efficacious vaccines against a previously unknown viral pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in less than 1 year from the identification of the virus is unprecedented in the history of vaccinology. A frequently asked question is how such an extraordinary accomplishment could have been realized in such a short time frame, when timelines for other vaccines are measured in years if not decades. In fact, concern about this truncated timeline has contributed in part to the hesitancy in accepting these vaccines. What is not fully appreciated is that the starting point of the timeline for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was not 10 January 2020, when the Chinese published the genetic sequence of the virus. Rather, it began decades earlier, out of the spotlight.

&gt;Two activities predate the successful COVID-19 vaccines: the utilization of highly adaptable vaccine platforms such as RNA (among others) and the adaptation of structural biology tools to design agents (immunogens) that powerfully stimulate the immune system. The RNA approach evolved over several years owing to the ingenuity of individual scientists, including Drew Weissman and Katalin Karik√≥, and the concentrated efforts of several biotech and pharmaceutical companies.

&gt;The discovery of an immunogen adaptable to the multiple platforms (messenger RNA and others) used for COVID-19 vaccines resulted from collaboration across different scientific subspecialities. At the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a group led by Peter Kwong had for several years used tools of structure-based vaccine design to determine the optimal structural conformation of a trimeric protein on the surface of the virus (the envelope protein) that allows HIV to bind to cells and ultimately trigger the production of antibodies that neutralize many HIV viral strains. Although this sophisticated approach has not yet led to a successful HIV vaccine, it caught the attention of another VRC investigator, Barney Graham, who was interested in generating a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Graham joined Jason McLellan (of Kwong's team) to adapt a structure-based approach to an RSV vaccine. They identified the prefusion conformation of the viral spike protein as highly immunogenic and created mutations to stabilize that conformation for successful use as an immunogen. This was a huge step toward the creation of a successful RSV vaccine.

&gt;VRC researchers and colleagues then built on the RSV advances. Graham's team, including Kizzmekia Corbett, and collaborators in the laboratories of McLellan and Andrew Ward adopted this approach of mutational stabilization of prefusion proteins in their work on the spike protein of the coronaviruses that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). So, when the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 became available, Graham's team lost no time in joining their long-time collaborators at Moderna to develop an RNA vaccine using a stabilized, prefusion spike protein as the immunogen. Pfizer and BioNTech, where Karik√≥ was working, also used the RNA platform that she and Weissman had perfected and the immunogen designed by Graham to develop an RNA vaccine. Additional companies also used Graham's immunogen in other vaccine platforms that had been evolving for years, to make SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

&gt;SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on the new immunogen rapidly moved to clinical trials. Several of these vaccines were tested in phase 3 efficacy trials at a time when the level of community spread of SARS-CoV-2 was extremely high, allowing vaccine efficacy endpoints of greater than 90% to be reached in a timely fashion. The speed and efficiency with which these highly efficacious vaccines were developed and their potential for saving millions of lives are due to an extraordinary multidisciplinary effort involving basic, preclinical, and clinical science that had been under way‚Äîout of the spotlight‚Äîfor decades before the unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Well that's simply factually not true. Other countries like Canada have outstanding orders as well, which can't be filled, not because the US government is so good at drafting contracts, but because the US government has an executive order preventing those factories from meeting demand outside of the US.

It even says so explicitly in the [executive order](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-12-11/pdf/2020-27455.pdf):

&gt;It is the policy of the United States to ensure **Americans have priority access** to free, safe, and effective COVID‚Äì19 vaccines. After ensuring the ability to meet the vaccination needs of the American people, it is in the interest of the United States to facilitate international access to United States Government COVID‚Äì19 Vaccines. 

US first, then everybody else.

Now, again, if people support that kind of nationalism, fine, but make the honest argument. What's annoying is that you get policy that clearly shows the US comes first, but then some people want to pretend as if the US is currently this amazing international partner in fighting the pandemic, it isn't. It might become so in the future, but right now it isn't.

But you know people that take mass transit or people that work in the STM they're not considered essential workers apparently everyone that works at the local grocery store that I go to none of them have been vaccinated nor have they even been told that they're going to be able to get a vaccine soon to me that's like Frontline essential workers and they should be vaccinated more so than Jim who's working from home and really a lower risk but you know ....

I'm acknowledging that diseases like influenza and their outbreaks can be insidiously threatening and have proven to be deadlier than SARS-CoV-2. We develop and continue to modify vaccines for influenza because of a continued need, and yet we don't require proof of vaccination to enter public spaces which **always** had health concerns. At what point after vaccine passports are enforced do we deem covid to a manageable level so as not to require them? If we applied the same parameter to the Spanish flu, people would still be showing their flu shot records today. If it's up to private businesses, that could mean indefinitely. 

I would say that your connection between driving and sharing public spaces is a nonsequitur because the latter is an integral part of, well, society. The longterm effects of the vaccine **are** unknown, and some people need time before they can make that choice for themselves. To not say ""no,"" but instead, ""I cannot take this drug in good faith right now."" When has it ever been medicine or society's place to make that choice for them by barring people from participating in commerce unless they ingest something before they're ready? 

Our hospitals are not yet requiring covid vaccinations as conditions of employment. I don't think you actually have to have received a flu shot that year if you apply for an exemption. You get suspended for noncompliance where I work, but it's not a full termination, and I suspect that it's because the organization does not agree with effectively forcing employees to get vaccinated. Yes, we work in healthcare and SHOULD be vaccinated, but don't have the right to force people to take a drug.

&gt;Travelers can choose between hotel quarantine, home quarantine or government group quarantine facility. All of which are electronically monitored by cell signal.

That's my point. There is a choice. We don't have that in NZ.  We and Australia require all arrivals to stay in a state run quarantine hotel.  If you give people the choice to be at home, you can take far more arrivals.  

&gt;This can be done without restricting entry from your own citizens.

No it can't.  We have thousands of citizens wanting to return.  We only want to have a couple hundred people arriving per day maximum.  

&gt;This is an enforcement issue that can be solved without restricting entry from your own citizens. For instance, fines:

You don't understand what I'm talking about.  The issue is not people escaping quarantine.  We have military and police guards on all hotels, surrounded by layers of fencing and we have prosecuted and jailed multiple escapees.  

The quarantine failures are when a hotel worker gets infected and enters the community, or an uninfected guest is infected by an infected guest in the facility but after their final test then is then released into the community and spreads it.  This is what keeps happening.  A new hotel security guard tested positive just yesterday and had been in the community with symptoms for 4 days before being tested.  

&gt;This is not unmanageable. When the UK variant first popped up, Taiwan halved the flights between the UK and Taiwan. All travelers who flew in from the UK had to quarantine under a government group quarantine facility (https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En/Bulletin/Detail/GG7jcHMmpCl3_6qRVc2Arw?typeid=158). Both conditions reduce the risk significantly while allowing your own citizens to enter the country.

This is what we are already doing.  Flights had already been reduced and extra testing introduced.  We required proof of negative test before boarding a flight and have immediate tests on arrival.  We still kept getting more and more cases arriving.  

The pause on flights from India is so that we can see if there are any more ways we can reduce the risk.  If we come up with better systems, the flights will resume.",,,1617934220,{},gtvvgid,False,t3_mmjd8b,False,True,t1_gtvneqr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mmjd8b/new_zealand_announces_a_temporary_ban_on/gtvvgid/,1617937725,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You could also ask vice-versa. The downside of vector vaccines is the potential, but very low risk of the vector doing damage. The downside of the RNA vaccines are that they take longer to give protection and that they are experimental and lacking long-term studies.
It's great that RNA vaccines have finally worked, after all mRNA vaccines during the last 30 years were withdrawn due to failure or severe side effects.

Sometimes there just isn't a right or wrong. Sometimes both can do a good job.

You know we we have grossly underplayed the importance of household transmission and so I I think my my big fear we will see something akin to and I take note on the problem with comparison of this virus to influenza and I think he's absolutely right but let's remember that the 1918 19 influenza the bulk of all the death occurred in just six weeks in the fall of 1918 after the virus mutated and went through a significant phenotypic change not just a few little nuclear tides in its RNA and this change resulted in it being far more transmissible and more virulent and I my fear is that we are applying with absolutely no oversight no surveillance of any kind of monoclonal antibodies we're applying vaccines that have you know by definition been rushed to the market and rush to use without a really good surveillance infrastructure to look at the impact the vaccines are having on viral populations. We're applying substandard medication that is keeping patients alive but with virus still in their bodies and keeping them kind of giant petri dishes partially immune suppressed systems cultivating selection pressure for the virus.  I will populate my fear we are now doing to SARSCOV2  since we have been doing since the 1940's with antibiotics. we're using our tools inappropriately and inadequately and helping promote escape mutations, helping select for forms of the virus that will defy our vaccines as we eventually get more in the pipeline. That will defy are monoclonal antibody therapies, defy whatever we throw at them. And we're conducting this an atmosphere of chaotic rollout of every single intervention that we apply. Whether it's testing, vaccination, whatever. No serious attempt to build cohorts and follow the classic models of epidemiology 101 to create cohort systems for looking at the repercussions of our interventions and determining whether we're promoting a selection process and this is I mean I hope I'm just being paranoid I hope that I hear from now I'll look back and everyone will be like oh what's silly ideas you had, I would love for that to be the case. But I really fear that this is where we are.  What does that mean it means we're going to have an epidemic that goes on and on and on and there will be to normal everything before 2019 we need to forget it cuz it's not ever going to go back like that it will never be the same for the rest of our lives we're going to see new normals and restaurants and movie theaters they might not even the arts will be changed forever,  at least for our lives. And we as North Americans will refuse to take any of the Chinese interventions. So we'll just continue to have this tension  between our economic sector and our public health sector over which is more important reopen the restaurants etc or maintain lockdowns. and we're just going to have this ongoing fight that you know it will have a slightly different flavor to it because now we have Democrats and Trump is gone but we won't be better at fundamentally stopping the virus. You know yeah we're doing testing, but the role that in the US is complete chaos. So that the testing in North America that we do is so chaotic and that it's disconnected for any  real measure of incidents or prevalence. So we really don't know what's going on montreal. We don't really know how widespread the virus is we know it won't we see the numbers rise and patients show up in the hospital but we don't know at the community level what's really going on. so in testing and not connecting it with any real data  or real strategic planning. Why are you testing who are you testing what's the point  it will fail. And now we're doing the exact same thing with our vaccination. you say on the one hand we should vaccinate all the front line workers but the front line can't get on the computers and even make an appointment and get a vaccine. And I like I get it we need to f****** figure out a happy medium in between the two because as we're doing now which we need to reopen because the longer the economy stays closed the harder it's going to be to bounce back and the more expensive it's going to cost us as taxpayers and just in general for everyday cost of life but I get that you're like at an elevated risk to reopen the the economy but until open things back up but whose life are you really risking probably not yours and is that your decision to make shouldn't be you know like that would be like really unsafe and callous and just another failure of the government's responsibility to make informed and good decisions for its people that it's governing you know as a whole but it's just been one s***** thing after another and I am impressed and I fear that had it for a outcome that might be a little bit harder to backtrack out of with another lockdown or curfew to slow the roll you know.",,,1617964966,{},gtwzgw4,False,t3_mn2rj6,False,True,t1_gtwwzon,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mn2rj6/canada_is_likely_to_exceed_the_us_infection_rate/gtwzgw4/,1617964977,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Vaccine   nationalism makes no sense. No country is self-sufficient. It takes  over 300 ingredients to produce a vaccine and supplies come from all  over the world. In the massive production ramp-up phase we are going   through, the supply chain must follow, as any disruption of the supply   chain could have dramatic consequences on production capacity.  
I   therefore opened a dialogue with my American counterpart in charge of   these industrial production issues to avoid any interruption in the   production lines, particularly for filters or disposable bags in which   the vaccine substance is manufactured. Through this dialogue we are   solving very concrete problems.  
The  same applies of course to the  UK. Two thirds of the 30 million doses  administered to UK citizens were  produced in Europe. The UK depends on  Europe for the second dose.

&gt;In a supply/demand free economy the distribution of a good would not have huge gaps like between the EU and UK. When you have, it is because of non economic reasons.
&gt;
Yes - non economic reasons such as being much quicker and more agile than the EU at securing vaccines. This is the EUs fundamental mistake and problem (and I say this as a Brit who on balance wanted to stay in the EU) - it is sometimes too slow and bureaucratic especially when dealing with crisis.
&gt;Also UK imported millions of Pfizer doses; so it's not only British sandwich. UK is also eating German or american one. 
&gt;
But it is the UKs sandwich if they paid for the sandwich, you see what I am saying? For a similar allegory, if McDonald's comes to the UK and builds a restaurant, it doesn't mean the UK owns all the McNuggets. If McDonald's wants to, it can sell all of its McNuggets to Fritz Von German or Pascal de Fran√ßois, and the UK can't stop them. You get what you paid for at the end of the day - if you buy a factory you get a factory, if you buy a vaccine you get a vaccine. Only if you buy a factory and contractually buy the vaccine produced there are you secure (as the UK did with AZ), otherwise somebody else can buy the vaccine from the factory.
&gt;It would be fine if AZ didn't miss the contractual obligations with EU while at the same time hiding 29M (probably more) in Italy.
&gt;It is ultimately company responsibility; but being AZ British obviously creates interesting doubts about the influence of the UK government. And being Covid vaccines so important for life and economy, this influence is almost granted.

Completely understand your frustration, but this is conjecture and conspiracy ultimately. AZ is Anglo-Swedish, headed by a Frenchman and a Swede. It has a huge vested interest in the EU, being I imagine it's biggest customer (beyond just Covid), and having so much of its production there. AZ also missed it's contractual obligation to the UK back in late 2020, the issues are not isolated to the EU.

The head of the association that represents the intensive-care sector said earlier Friday that the situation in Germany‚Äôs hospitals is ‚Äúreally dramatic‚Äù and ICU staff are ‚Äúdeeply worried.‚Äù

Gernot Marx, the president of the DIVI association, told ZDF that there will be more than 5,000 Covid-19 patients in intensive care by the end of this month.

‚ÄúThese are really very high numbers and what is really worrying is how few beds there are free,‚Äù Marx said. Many staff have indicated they plan to leave the profession after the pandemic due to the pressure of the job, he added.

With only about 15% of Germany‚Äôs 83 million people having already received a Covid shot, stricter curbs are necessary to prevent an overload of hospitals, Merkel has argued.
Some regions have failed to implement restrictions agreed with her government, prompting her to threaten to seize central control of pandemic policy.

Germany‚Äôs Covid-19 incidence rate started climbing again around the middle of February, though its steady rise appeared to be checked over the Easter vacation.

Spahn, who has also called for tighter lockdown restrictions, said Friday that Germany will be able to comprehensively vaccinate the population by mid summer. Allowing the country‚Äôs health system to get overloaded so close to that achievement is unreasonable, he said.


‚ÄúDo we want to test the limits? Do we want to test what the country can handle, in an emergency situation, in the intensive care units? What kind of thoughts are those?‚Äù Spahn said.

While some are calling for restrictions to be eased as the inoculation program ramps up and the weather warms -- and people grow increasingly weary of measures that have been in place for about half a year -- Spahn urged people to hang on for a while longer.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about some weeks, months with one another, to keep avoiding an overload of the health system that we‚Äôve successfully avoided for 12 months,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd yes, I‚Äôm suffering exactly like everyone else.

Germany has doubled its pace of Covid-19 vaccinations after a sluggish start, as it battles a third wave of the virus that threatens to overwhelm medical facilities.

The country administered about 720,000 doses on Thursday, a fourth straight daily record, thanks to a surge in vaccinations being performed in doctors‚Äô offices. That pace should continue for most of April as a network of some 35,000 general practitioners offices receive 1 million doses more in each of the next two weeks -- and even more after that.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on a good path with vaccinations,‚Äù Health Minister Jens Spahn said Friday at a news conference in Berlin.

Germany‚Äôs vaccine push comes as authorities try to check a rise in infections that‚Äôs putting increasing pressure on intensive-care units. Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for tighter restrictions, but has faced opposition from some of the 16 regional leaders, who disagree about the measures needed to prevent more infections and deaths.

The two sides appeared to put some of their differences behind them on Friday, with Merkel‚Äôs government announcing a deal with state premiers and ruling coalition lawmakers to update Germany‚Äôs infection protection law.

The changes would set out nationwide rules on which curbs must be imposed if the seven-day incidence rate rises above 100 per 100,000 people, Merkel‚Äôs spokeswoman, Ulrike Demmer, said at a news conference in Berlin. 

A meeting planned for Monday to discuss the next steps in pandemic strategy has been canceled and the law will be signed off by Merkel‚Äôs cabinet on Tuesday, Demmer said.",,,1617967936,{},gtx3bip,True,t3_mnf7gz,False,True,t3_mnf7gz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnf7gz/germany_doubles_pace_of_covid19_shots_amid_surge/gtx3bip/,1617967946,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

As for the history of Canada losing its vaccine production capability, that was actually never a problem up until now. Because in the west we largely let the free-market organize itself in the most efficient way possible. Canada was never short on vaccines prior to this moment.

The shortages come as a result of everyone playing by free-market rules when the going is good, but then playing by nationalist rules when the going gets tough.

Forcing every individual country in the world to build up its own vaccine production capabilities, or face suffering shortages, is the most inefficient way to organize vaccine production. And worse, it's utterly unnecessary, if we just maintained an open and free exchange of goods.

Now obviously the US will export vaccines when they have met full internal demand, that's not exactly impressive. What country/system in the world would produce more vaccines than it needed and then refuse to export them?

The whole point is that Canadians also paid for those vaccines with their tax dollars, the US government is just refusing to let companies honor those contracts by blocking exports. It's not like the US is paying for Canada to get vaccines.

Americans paid for them. Canadians paid for them. It's just that one group is claiming the output first. With limited supply, that means benefiting one group, at the expense of the other. In this case, Americans over Canadians.

bad direction from federal health early on: don't wear masks; lets pursue a china relationship for a vaccine (this is truly WTF); allow air travel but block border traffic; overly optimistic forecasts of vaccine delivery.

bad provincial response. earlier on we had it right, but this third lockdown is probably too little too late (when we should have known better), particularly in BC and Ontario. 

fatigue is setting in big time. While the US has varied from 'head in the sand its not happening' and life continues as normal, canada has been in social distancing mode / lockdowns for over a year. its beginning to have major wear on people, and financials are stretched to the limit.

we also had bad luck. we have domestic vaccine production, but the companies involved (mainly Glaxo Smith-Klein) don't have a formula. so we're dependent upon imports.

we also have Trudeau posturing that they have more vaccines than we know what to do with, and shifting blame to the provinces, and the provincines shitting on trudeau for being so slow in the vaccine delivery.

Which leads me to my second point, that my numbers are accurate and yours are not.

At this time, people would generally get sick for about five weeks from being variolated. Variolation wasn‚Äôt an injection with a needle but rubbing powdered scabs or fluid from an infected person into scratched skin to develop a case milder than what would be caught in uncontrolled conditions but this also made them highly infectious to people who had no immunity

In the opening years of the Revolutionary War, infectious disease was responsible for 90% of military casualties with smallpox being the biggest single contributor. Washington controversially mandated variolation for troops beginning in 1777 and it wasn‚Äôt discovered for another 20 years that vaccines could be made from cowpox that have the same immunity.

I think most people realize this will be endemic for the foreseeable future.  Eradicating diseases is incredibly hard and we already know that this one can mutate around and while vaccines still prevent severe disease and death, these mutations make it all the harder to eradicate.

I guess my issue with this can be summarized by this:  How exactly are we going to get to a ""mild endemic state"" without herd immunity?

If only 50% of the population has immunity, this thing is going to keep swirling.  Not necessarily at the dangerous ""We can overwhelm the hospitals"" level, but at the ""This is causing a lot of illness and death and this isn't a good thing"" level.  Levels higher than I, a layman, would consider a mild endemic level.

To me, those two basically go hand and hand.

The process is incredibly complex, and it‚Äôs not just a matter of ‚Äúpublishing the method‚Äù. The mRNA code used by Moderna (for example) is already public knowledge. The hard part is encapsulating the mRNA and that requires dozens of specialized suppliers making very complex ingredients and then combining those ingredients in a very specific, controlled way to get the final result. Any little deviation and you either deliver too little useful mRNA and people don‚Äôt develop immunity or you deliver too much and people get sick. You don‚Äôt just copy and paste that process to other plants, it would take longer to spin up other factories and try to distribute the resources between when while validating their manufacturing process than it does to just let the folks that know what they are doing make it on proven lines. And you know that other labs would cut corners to make it work, release ineffective or dangerous vaccines, and end up destroying confidence in all the vaccines. How are you going to convince anyone to take a shot after some Moderna-knockoff lab kills a few dozen people with bad vaccine? I wouldn‚Äôt take one.

There's several things wrong with that notion. The biggest problem with their statement (amongst many problems) is that this person's assertion is that the immune system can't clear infections in the central nervous system, which isn't true.

But even if that was true, their argument is that if someone gets vaccinated, the immunity won't protect them from all neurological involvement if they later get infected. But the exact same thing can be said about natural immunity as well -- if someone is getting infected, and if you assume the immune response can't enter the CNS, then you'd still be left with that neurological impact. In short, their argument is not actually an argument against vaccination, it's an argument against getting infected.

He linked to two great sources - both of which are at around 28%. You have to account for overlap, though. So if you carve 33% off the 28%, you have 18.76% with natural immunity only, 33% with vaccine or vaccine and natural immunity. Those numbers you can add, totaling 51% with some form of immunity right now.

There's a ton of assumptions in there - immunity s not immediate for vaccines, less prior infected people may be getting the vaccine, the upper/lower bounds are wide - 15-48% per the Wyman  link - on prior infection, etc. - but any estimate like this is guesswork. What's indisputable is that every day we get closer to herd immunity.

Also remember that the US is/will be sort of a vaccination oasis. We need to do this globally to finally put this thing down and there are countries that as of now have zero vaccinations. Russia and China are at something like 5%. So the war won't be over when we go back to normal (or normal-ish).

You said ""people who in all seriousness are discussing Santa Claus and the logistics of distributing gifts with flying reindeer"". Who are you talking about in this context? I'd assume Christians, since Santa Claus is affiliated with Christmas.

&gt; I too would love to find that argument. But the problem isn't with the issue being argued, but with the persons that needs convincing.

So you make these comments to rant about the illegitimacy of religion, but then proceed to say that religious people are not the intended audience. Then who are you trying to convince? And I said that I would love to listen to your argument. I consider myself a very open-minded person and I have no qualms about listening to an argument meant to sway me off my beliefs.

&gt;Unprompted? I wasn't even talking about you in my first reply (where I referred to wikipedia). I was only commenting on the topic of who has the right to define who is christian or not. 

I'm just gonna point out that you replied to my parent comment, where you said (emphasis is my own) ""It is not up to **you** to define what is and isn't christianity."" This ""you"" made it sound like a targeted comment towards me and so I took it as so. Definitely unprompted in my view. If it was meant to be generalized, then sure, but that's not how it came off as. There's a reason you got downvoted quite a bit on that comment.

&gt; I didn't even know that you were christian when I wrote it

That's my bad I suppose. Before replying to your comment, I was replying to another comment by someone replying to my parent comment asking me to explain some more differences between Mormons and Christians that would show why they are different religions, and I mentioned in my reply that I was a Christian. I guess I was in the mindset that you would see it when I was replying to you.

&gt; Then you accused of hating christianity, of attacking you etc.

You were pretty frickin aggressive in your comment man, and you very clearly showed your distaste of Christians. Saying this didn't help either

&gt; &gt; If the mormons believe that Jesus actually was the son of god, they are equally misguided as all the other christianists, and have an equal right to be considered christian.

Sounds like you would consider Mormons less misquided if they didn't consider themselves Christian. Maybe I'm just reading it like that tho so who knows? Words on the internet have no thoughts other than what they literally express.

&gt; First I don't have a belief. 

Strongly believing that all religions are a bunch of lies is a belief man. Not sure how you can claim otherwise. Beliefs aren't a religious thing. There are political beliefs, societal beliefs, economic beliefs, etc. This is definitely a belief.

&gt; Come to think of it, I should really stop using the word ""atheist"" about myself. As if a dedicated word should be needed for what should be the default, normal position. There is no word for people who don't believe in Santa Claus, so why would there be a word for people don't believe in god(s)?

Default, normal position huh? ""Normal"" is decided by society, not an individual alone. The majority of the world dabbles in religion, so I'd argue that being religious is the norm. Maybe if you grew up in China or a Baltic nation with a majority atheist view, you can argue that it is normal, but for most of the world it is not. And Santa Claus isn't viewed by anybody the way a god is, so you can't equate those two. This is a weak argument.

&gt; Second, I'm not forcing anything on you. This isn't unprompted as you said, on the contrary you are driving this debate forward. Which is fine by me, but don't pretend you are not.

I am driving this debate forward? I dunno man this debate seems pretty mutual to me, don't act like you didn't reply to me first and then proceed to reply to my replies. And yes, constantly insisting to someone that there is no God when they didn't initially ask for it is a form of forcing your belief onto them. There are more forceful ways that you could do so, sure, but it doesn't have to be an 'un'holy war for this to be considered as forcing your beliefs. I already explained why it was unprompted in my point of view so I won't address that part again.

&gt;My opposition to religions has nothing to do with the ethics of them at all. So this is 100% irrelevant. It is about the irrational views on how the physical world is built. The existence of god(s), paradise, hell, miracles and stuff like that. This, and only this, is the basis for my opposition to religion. 

Hey, this is the closest you've actually gotten to writing an explanation for your beliefs. Finally. Well, I'll say that I understand your reasoning. I feel that way for many of the religions out there that aren't my own (although I wouldn't go out of my way on Reddit to exclaim my disbelief and any form of dislike for those beliefs). I think that is one of the most typical and common reasons that people would give. I don't understand your devotion to telling people why they are so wrong, but looking at your post history (I apologize if this makes you feel violated. Just want to understand the type of person you may be and it's all public), you seem to by pretty cynical in general so I'm not gonna hold anything against you.

&gt; (I'm a fan of this guy ... who wrongly believed god existed.) When it comes to good and bad behavior, religions aren't any worse or better than ideologies or other moral frameworks people build. They are all just human made rules, some are good some are not.

Don't jump the gun there buddy until you have proof, which I know you don't care about, but until you can prove anything you claim, you can't treat it as a fact. But yeah Benjamin Lay is an interesting figure.

&gt; Also, I don't think I have used the word ""horrible"".

&gt;&gt;You could argue that religionism is even worse than anti-vaxxers, climate change deniers and similar groups because they at least try to construct rational looking arguments.

You literally compared us to anti-vaxxers and climate change deniers, among other harmful groups. These people literally reject actions and deny movements that save lives. Unless you somehow think these are great people, you are insinuating that we are as bad as them. You don't need to use it to mean it.

&gt;You don't have to prove a negative.

Lol. You can't claim something is a negative without proving that it is. That's just scientific logic. With your sense of logic I can just say Norway doesn't exist and as long as I disregard whatever anyone else says I'm justified to think I'm right. You can claim I have no physical proof of the existence of God, but I can literally claim the same regarding your proof of no God.

&gt;I'm not a spaghetti-monster expert, but I suspect you can't disprove that either In this paragraph you only have questions, and then you somehow try to see if there is a place for christianity in there.

The flying spaghetti monster was a clear and obvious joke made in a letter protesting an education board's decision to teach intelligent design as an alternative to evolution. And I'm not replying to you to convert you to anything, so I don't know why you are trying to challenge some philosophical questions about how the world exists. In this instance, since you are the one trying to make unfalsifiable claims, you need to address Russell's teapot and prove that you are right. Your two sentences about not believing in miracles and whatnot proves nothing.

Also, I saw that you are arguing another guy who said he's an atheist. You might wanna consider his words, cuz he's speaking facts. Shitting on my beliefs doesn't help your cause. It's more annoying than anything else. And it's pretty hilarious to see an atheist arguing with both an atheist and a Christian while using the exact same points against both.

The simple fact is, UK domestic production supply is outstripped by domestic demand stipulated by the contract with AZ. The EU could have signed a similar contract with AZ and scaled up production to help meet demand, knowing that AZ could also export vaccines elsewhere from its existing factories if it signed such contracts (which it did). The EU, rather na√Øvely, didn't (or at least not to the extent it should).

This isn't even a moral issue. The UK doesn't have domestic production to export en masse like the EU, but it has contributed significantly to COVAX, more per capita than pretty much every other developed nation. Because even if the UK can't export it's domestic production, it can in effect export vaccines it has paid for.

There seems to be a misconception that AZ (or any other company), by having factories inside the EU, owes the EU vaccines produced there. That is not how the world works.

And you think that fast forward 7 months during summer time that it's going to be anywhere close to the same restraint that people had during Christmas I don't f****** think so I don't know what world you're living in but I talk to a lot of people kind of like all over the world when I'm playing video games and pretty much basic consensus from UK Canada United States like people want to do the right thing but the majority of people are f****** finished with this virus don't care what the thing says they don't care if they get sick with it and are at Busch gardens on vacation and f****** just I don't f****** know I don't think Denmark lost a month I think the global scale we've lost a year and a half if you think about it I'm glad things are looking good over there and stable like there's another thing though the lesser known Murphy's law that if everything must go wrong it probably isn't going to go wrong so the only thing that could make all that thing change and everything just go even worse would be a lot of wrong things all happening at once and the virus becoming a way better virus that it currently is and the right things to happen at the right time and too many variables to be able to happen at once so.

I guess it's hard to try to find a medium or a path to control this while also not having to lock everyone down and it's  crazy you've got like scientists as they call themselves saying oh no the virus is fine we've tested it with carbon monoxide filters yeah but the particles for covid aerosol particles are a lot smaller than carbon monoxide particles so I don't even know why they're comparing those as if they're the same thing in order to not have to spend money on HEPA filters in schools thanks Quebec, but no.  But then again kids need to be socialized cuz kids that are like homeschooled they grow up to be pretty weird adults like same as dogs you have to socialize them with other dogs or else when they turn into adult dogs they bite people and stuff or attack other dogs like so socializing kids is probably very important for the mental health of both parents and kids not to mention the last year and a half of the inequalities of internet access to poor communities and that whole f****** s*** show which has had absolutely nothing done for trying to bring internet connectivity to everyone for it to be fair thanks bell, but no.

But I also believe in our resilience as humans and when it comes down to it I think human beings want to do the right thing and will at the end of the day do the right thing for other people and help people instead of hurt people and I think that'll be our saving Grace and eventually this too shall pass, even though it seems like it's taking a little bit longer than 2 weeks as they initially said ....

So maybe taking a stupidly small chance of giving somebody the sniffles in order to have friends and see my grandma makes me abstractly selfish. Well, have fun with that.

The reasons, mostly unfounded, still make a lot sense.

You are right though, the adoption &amp; acceptance has moved a ton.  All for the good though.

Based on the main reasons, they should get muted as more people they know get vaccinated and are fine. 



‚ÄúBy far the most common reason people have cited for why they might not get vaccinated, a late February AP-NORC survey found, was concerns about possible side effects, which a 57 percent majority named among their top reasons (people taking the survey were allowed to select multiple options). That was followed by 48 percent who said they were waiting to see if it was safe, 45 percent who said they didn‚Äôt trust COVID-19 vaccines, 30 percent who weren‚Äôt sure the vaccine would work, 28 percent who worried about an allergic reaction and 27 percent who said they believed other people needed the shot more.‚Äù",,,1617929101,{},gtvlnd9,False,t3_mikbdd,False,True,t1_gtvkthq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mikbdd/dr_anthony_fauci_does_not_expect_a_4th/gtvlnd9/,1617933059,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Imagine calling someone arrogant when that someone was *genuinely* trying to be helpful... while you exemplify arrogance by laughing at them. Laughing at someone (in the condescending way you freely admit to doing above) is one of the most obvious social demonstrations of arrogance.

I wasn't laughing at you even in the slightest- it seemed a kind and reasonable question from a kind and reasonable person. I mean I guess ""kind"" certainly wasn't part of it- I'm certain anyone reading this would say you have been far more cruel in this exchange than I. This is even if they *agree with you* about me being arrogant, citing no shit information, etc.

&gt; No sh*t, Sherlock.

This is completely unnecessary. You are yet again attacking me.

&gt; There isn't a human being with a brain who doesn't understand that lockdowns (and pretty much everything about the pandemic) are complicated.

Plenty of very intelligent people have areas of ignorance- in fact we all do. You can try to weasel out of this by re-quoting your ""with a brain"" part, but that is a pretty nebulous phrase. Information that I gave freely in my reply was meant to inform those who may not have considered some nuances on the discussion- I simply offered my perspective. 

The condescension just drips from the part I quoted. I can almost *hear* the tonal inflection...

&gt; We all know that some people can be passionately pro lockdowns, because they can work from home and have no financial issues.

I would argue with you on this- like really- but I think at this point you would just insult me.

&gt; Others are against lockdowns, not because they don't believe in the seriousness of COVID, but because they need to work in jobs that they can't do at home. In Brazil, COVID is out of control because the president is a COVID denier. New Zealand, a completely different story. S. Korea has COVID under control because of the country's past experiences with SARs and MERs, additionally, a lot of the general population are scarred from deaths from those previous outbreaks, so they don't mind masks or contact tracing. Many Americans think wearing masks infringe on their rights. China is a completely different story altogether. African -Americans in the US tend to be vaccine fearful, due to a large distrust of government medical intervention (because of things like the Tuskegee Study), which makes them hard to vaccinate. There are different reasons why each country (state or city) has or does not have control of COVID.

This is all entirely reasonable. In fact I agree with all of it. Why not just say some of this.. or again *just fucking ignore my comment if you already knew* rather than *purposing* to be cruel?

&gt; An important part of being able to connect with people is to actually hear what they are saying and respond to that, rather than respond with a bunch of crap you want to say because you think you know so much. It's one thing to have a discussion with a person and quite another to just be a windbag.

You are *lecturing me* and then you close with the term windbag (which is at least an implicit insult). Your last response was only about 100 words less than my first one... yet I am a windbag and you are not. Is somewhere between the 100 words the line between windbag and not?

I'm aware that my replies don't trend towards concise, but I certainly will NOT apologize for them: I can stand confidently behind the position that they were/are offered in good faith.

Did my long-winded response prevent them from responding to you? No. And I was interested in what they had to say as well; though not overly relevant, I've been to Japan and love the place- I had my own reasons for responding. You lost *nothing* by simply ignoring my response and waiting for theirs... yet you *went out of your way* to insult me. Why?

Obviously vaccinating 75% of the world's population just isn't going to happen, and obviously the virus will continue to mutate.

I live in Thailand and they have barely started vaccinating anyone here.  The government's response and input related to that is bizarre to say the least, too long a story to really go into.  But then current known deaths in Thailand are still under 100, versus the half a million plus in the US, so this recent third wave of outbreak--started in the last week--lacks the same context of necessity for resolution.

The other part that's too complicated to go into is about how there are other versions of vaccines, coming out of China and Russia, and soon from India, with some degree of uncertainty about effectiveness or risk.

The problem with this line of thinking is that SARS-CoV-2 is going to become (or is already) endemic.

(see my other, tongue-in-cheek comment; the animal reservoir is a real thing and will continue to be one even after we have a vaccine for kids)

Our litmus test for ending restrictions needs to be ""would this virus, in its present, post-mass-vaccination state, have prompted these restrictions had it been what we got in March 2020?"" No present variant is able to overcome the vaccines' airtight efficacy at preventing severe outcomes, hospitalizations, deaths. What we'll have after mass adult vaccination is a virus that causes a mild cold for those who still (rarely) get it, including the exceedingly vast majority of children.

Given that, and also the speed at which new mRNA boosters can be rolled out, *and* also what we've seen theorized about how total vaccine escape mutation would require total loss of the spike protein, which would nullify the virus' ability to infect us meaningfully, I am 0% sympathetic to the idea that restrictions need to continue because of a future mutation that *might* materialize.

But there is almost no proof it works to significantly stop symptomatic disease, and no proof whatsoever it stops hospital or deaths against these variants.

We know it works well against the old variants and the UK variant, but here in the Netherlands, the SA and BR variant already accounts over 5% of cases (UK variant 91%) three weeks ago. I do not want my family to be injected with a vaccine that could possibly be worthless in 1 or 2 months. The blood clotting is not a huge risk, but it possibly not being effective in a couple of months worries me. There is some proof it does not work against symptomatic spread. No proof it can stop hospitalisations and deaths (against the SA variant).

It's finally warning up - dear God, finally.

Our vaccine supply is steady, and exceeding our initial expectations. We are a country of 40 million, and are now averaging close to 2 million vaccines delivered a week. 

Because we went shotgun approach, by the end of the month we'll have 4 different vaccines circulating in our systems, which is great if any one of them have distribution issues. Johnson and Johnson should start this month. Novavax, hopefully, next month or the one after. 

We are currently at about 17% of the population vaccinated with a single dose, and are on track to double that in a month, probably less, as we're currently vaccinating ~0.6% of the population a day (and ramping up). 

We've always been pretty good at keeping deaths and case counts low via non vaccination mechanisms - which will make the job of vaccines easier. Especially now as we start focusing on hotspots, and not just the elderly. 

We have really really high standards in Canada - we have the united States as our neighbors, and we want to always beat them or match them at everything they do. It's not really realistic, but it's just a part of our personality. But on the world stage, there are very very few countries that are doing as well as us, and have a better trajectory. 

More good news could come in, as we have continuously moved up vaccine deliveries, and the United States has stated that they'd like to start helping their neighbors with supply constraints soon.

If anyone is curious, take a look at some of our Canadian subs today - r/ontario puts out a comprehensive covid breakdown every morning at around 10:30am est, and r/CanadaCoronavirus gives pretty good summaries every day. The anxiety inducing news is everywhere if you're in Canada, and it unfortunately overshadows all the progress we're making.

So 150 million in total.

&gt;At a Monday morning staff meeting at the plant, Emergent officials claimed the mistake was an isolated incident and the media had exaggerated its significance, according to a person briefed on the meeting. They urged workers to be proud of what the plant had accomplished in such a short time.  
&gt;  
&gt;But quality-control managers are now required to test anew every lot of Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine made at the plant ‚Äî 62 million doses in all ‚Äî to make sure they weren‚Äôt also contaminated. Another roughly 70 million doses of AstraZeneca‚Äôs may also need to be tested.  
&gt;  
&gt;F.D.A. inspectors are expected to intensely scrutinize the plant before certifying it to release doses to the public. It remains uncertain whether that would occur in time for Johnson &amp; Johnson to deliver the 24 million doses it has promised to ship to the federal government this month.

However, when you consider the amount of disgusting vitriol the British press has thrown at the EU in the past few weeks for something that was entirely not the EU's fault, you can't help but feeling a little bit sour.

Additionally, some of the actions taken are at the very least somewhat suspicious. Namely, how could the UK government possibly not be aware of those doses secretly exported to Australia? You repeatedly claim you cannot export AZ doses to the EU because your contract gives you priority, despite the EU recording thousands of deaths every day, but then ""somehow"" those doses end up being exported to Australia which is basically covid free? And then you even claim you don't know anything about them, despite the contract you yourself have cited boldly stating every dose produced by AZ can only be exported after your approval?

We have to start with the basics:
1. PR campaign explaining the vaccine works and that getting it will lead to normal. Not some fake normal were you have tk show papers but a real normal. Set a goal of 80% people vaccinated and we can be normal. 2. Your PR campaign should explain how kids under 5 are at risk. Not from just covid but from mask and lockdowns. Let people know getting vaccinated will help them. People tend to be willing to sacrifice for the children, and we have largely ignored them for the last year.
3. Don‚Äôt talk about variants or how we gonna never be normal. Biden and the CDC should ask all ‚Äúexperts‚Äù to focus on the science and stop the fear spreading. We know the vaccine is the only chance for normal so maybe telling people it won‚Äôt stop spread before we know is a bad idea. We lost millions of people with those comments. 
4. Don‚Äôt be political. If you constantly batter Republicans and call them names your only making more of them not want the vaccine. It‚Äôs a fact that the highest group who is turning down the vaccine is African Americans. It‚Äôs not political it‚Äôs trust and by making it political your undermining the trust.

If you want people to be vaccinated the CDC needs to gain their trust. This is don‚Äôt with good PR and a constant positive message. 

When someone tells you they are anti-vaccine you follow these steps: stop what your about to yell. Ask them why they feel that way. Be empathic to them. Explain to them why it‚Äôs important to be vaccinate for others. Let them know your support them no matter what and give them space. 

We can do this but we need tk be supportive. I have been able to get two people who are very very anti-vaccine (not covid vaccine like real anti-vaccine) to get  covid vaccinated by doing what I said above.

I wouldn‚Äôt worry about this. There‚Äôs about to be an absolute glut of vaccines. Existing deals with Moderna/J&amp;J/Pfizer are in line with having enough supply for every adult by mid-June. But at least 1 in 5 won‚Äôt get the shot, and their unclaimed Pfizer/Moderna doses cover all the kids, which are already approved for some kids. So we won‚Äôt need to order more of these. 

In the event of a variant we would just get Moderna to print new rna meant to counter the new spike. Those would be more effective against the variant and easier to sell to the public than stockpiled AZ doses from today.

So at least the 500m AZ doses are absolutely worthless to the US as anything other than diplomatic bargaining chips. We‚Äôll sell or donate all of those somewhere this summer.

The J&amp;J vaccine manufacturing mixup that you heard about [isn't a problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/mhhf8x/johnson_johnson_statement_on_us_covid19_vaccine/) There are no tainted or flawed doses from J&amp;J being distributed, all our doses of J&amp;J came from a different manufacturer in the Netherlands and are both safe and effective.

The mRNA vaccines [*still* work](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfp89k/neutralization_of_sarscov2_spike_6970_deletion/) on the three most worrying variants.

Variants [are not currently evading vaccines](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mg0l7a/study_shows_no_vaccineresistant_strain_exists_in/), and seem unlikely to do so.

**Vaccines Seem to Reduce Spread**

Vaccination and previous infection[ reduce viral load, which reduces spread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s).

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) article does a good job of explaining the likelihood of vaccines *at least* reducing spread.  [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lf744r/daily_discussion_thread_february_08_2021/gml0gyi/) may help too.

Milder cases, especially asymptomatic cases [are worse at spreading](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kcy2e0/weekly_question_thread_week_of_december_14/gg8tp7n/).  

Looks like the amount of virus in people who've gotten one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and then infected is [greatly reduced compared to those not vaccinated](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfiqma/decreased_sarscov2_viral_load_following/).  This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a great reduction in ability to spread the virus. [Maybe even with just one dose!](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242) You should [get both doses though.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m2mtnv/immune_response_to_sarscov2_variants_of_concern/)

Any answer you get that is either ""yes"" or ""no"" isn't 100% correct, for now (though that may be changing very soon!). For now, we have only ""probably not, it looks like vaccinated people don't transmit the virus, not that they can't ever transmit it"".  The best we have now is that [""it's really *really* unlikely"".](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm?s_cid=mm7013e3_w)  Getting less likely by the day.

Can vaccinated people get infected?  Yes, sometimes, it's a lot less likely than in unvaccinated people. 

Is it a big deal if they do? No. Cases in people who are vaccinated are much milder.

Even variants? At this point, a breakthrough infection by one variant is the same as any other for vaccinated people.

Also, you'll notice that any reputable person talking about this subject always says ""may be able to spread"", or ""maybe"", or ""we don't know if"". And that's because there is a small chance that vaccinated people will be able to spread the virus. But it's not a big chance. Doctors, scientists, and regulators are being very careful with their language on this subject, some would argue they're being too careful. That said, if they were to say that ""vaccinated people cannot spread the virus"", and then we find out that in some situations that vaccinated people have spread the virus, [that would end up worse for the experts than if they hedge for a while.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/los8r9/daily_discussion_thread_february_21_2021/goa8cu0/) So at least to me, the way these experts are framing it seems pretty reasonable, you just have to put yourself in their shoes.

That said, they now seem to be [saying what I've been saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s).

**Additional Thoughts/Cool Stuff**

Even the shittiest masks do seem to work, [but why?](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/md436k/another_explanation_for_why_cloth_masks_reduce/)

Testing and the Positivity Rate: It's been said a lot in other subs that the positivity rate should go up over time as more people are vaccinated and don't require testing. Last year, it was *the* metric to watch, but it will likely wane quickly in importance as overall testing drops.  Don't necessarily worry about sudden high positivity rates, as mass testing will likely drop off pretty quickly, particularly as testing sites are converted to vaccination sites. 

We may want to use our newly found testing and sequencing capacity to test and sequence a higher proportion of flu samples.  This might give us a head start on which flu genetics are circulating, and help eliminate a flu or two.  We're in the single digits of flu cases most places, which is awesome!

The problem is that you have to wait longer for the second dose, and therefore, full protection.

I like [thegracefuldork's prediction about vaccine availability](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lcatpp/daily_discussion_thread_february_04_2021/gm0bwc8/) more than my own previous prediction.  Not because it's ""rosier"", but because it's just better.

**Which vaccine should I get?**

When someone asks me what my favorite beer is, the answer is always the same.

It's the one in front of me.

So get the first vaccine you can, the differences are pretty minor.


[**Conclusions**](https://gfycat.com/cleantalkativedassie)

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms.  This currently seems to also be true with post vaccination infection with any of the known variants. We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well. 

In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections and symptoms in those who do get infected. Therefore, vaccines should reduce spread.

Regarding side effects of the vaccine:

Nobody is saying there aren't side effects. There are clearly side effects. I'm not even saying there aren't side effects from the vaccine that could last for years. The effects of an infection may not show up for a while, [and we know they can last a long time](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m4jhpf/rapid_implementation_of_a_cohort_for_the_study_of/), most notably a loss of sense of smell.

I'm saying that we'd find out about all the side effects within a few months. There won't be side effects that suddenly show up six months after vaccination that haven't already shown up in some people.

If you have an example of a side effect from any vaccine where side effects not seen within the first four months were suddenly found over four months post-vaccination, I'd change the wording in my post.

I'll tell you though, I've still not gotten an example of a vaccine side effect that didn't show up in at least some people until way after the vaccine was administered.

The sentiment has resounded for decades, so my statement still stands. 

You said people have been telling the US to mind it's own business for 20+ years. Now you bring up other invasions that the US carried out prior to that. So my point does stand, you were talking about foreign interventions.

You're the one linking together the idea that people in Canada are hypocritical because they don't like American wars, but they do want vaccines produced in America. Which is a crazy statement.  


&gt;Canada is free to support the development of its own vaccine manufacturing facilities and to pay the costs of maintaining their presence within their borders as part of a national defense. Their lack of facilities is not the US‚Äôs doing, but your own government‚Äôs careful calculus that it wouldn‚Äôt be necessary. Perhaps you will lobby for additional manufacturing facilities in Canada? 

Why would I lobby a foreign government to build pharmaceutical factories?

Now the whole problem isn't can Canada individually build or not build vaccine factories, Canada is a rich country, I'm sure they can afford it.

The problem is that the most efficient production chain for pharmaceutical companies, means a global production chain. Instead, you propose that the world shifts to building dozens of inefficient national production chains, so they can protect themselves from future vaccine nationalism.

So when we look at it from a global perspective, in your scenario, the entire human race gets less vaccines, rather than more, because instead of building the most efficient production chain, we're all supposed to practice pharmaceutical Juche.

&gt;I wonder what would Canada‚Äôs response be if their country contained those manufacturing facilities? Send it to everyone else around the world first? Most likely not. More probably it would do the same as the US, because we always try and take care of those we more closely identify with, a carryover from our communal tribalism most likely, and to see others being assisted ‚Äúbefore we‚Äôve helped our own‚Äù is something that resonates with people of every nation. 

Maybe it is buried in our human instincts, but that doesn't make it the right thing to do.

And as for what Canada might do in an alternative universe, I can't pretend to know that. They might do the same, better or worse. Nobody can claim to know that.

&gt;I won‚Äôt say ‚Äúfuck em‚Äù, I want to get this out to everyone as quickly as possible, but a government has a responsibility to ITS citizens first. 

And you can have that viewpoint. I don't agree with it, but at least its consistent and honest.

Despite being an article in Nursing Times, this study was on the general population and also highlights the disparities.

&gt; Findings have been published today in the journal Brain Behaviour and Immunity and are based on data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study which surveyed more than 12,000 people on their views about the vaccine last year.


&gt;On the whole, researchers said intention to have the Covid-19 jab was high among those involved in the study, as more than 53% of participants were ‚Äúvery likely‚Äù and a further 28.5% ‚Äúlikely‚Äù to take up the vaccination when offered.

&gt;But despite this, there were marked differences in uptake among some ethnic groups and among younger ages, researchers said.


&gt;Overall, those who were Black or Black British had the highest rate of vaccine hesitancy, with almost 72% of people in this group stating they would not have the jab.


&gt;Meanwhile, those from Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds reported the second highest hesitancy, with more than 42% saying they would not have the vaccine when offered.


&gt;Across all groups, the main reasons for vaccine hesitancy were concerns over future unknown effects of a vaccine, with 42.7% citing this as their main reason.


&gt;But researchers identified that although reasons for not wanting the jab were similar across ethnic groups, Black and Black British participants were significantly more likely to state they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt trust vaccines‚Äù (29.2%) compared to those in the White British and Irish group (5.7%).


&gt;It was also found that those within the Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups reported worries about side effects (35.4%) more than those in the White British and Irish group (8.6%).",,,1617994355,{},gtymz2b,False,t3_mnhsx1,False,True,t1_gtyioj3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnhsx1/1_in_5_americans_are_fully_vaccinated_and_a_third/gtymz2b/,1617997050,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I guess it was too much for me to assume other's realized that I was aware that not everyone constantly has COVID so I saved myself the ""(if I come into contact with COVID)"" because then I was worried someone would think that I didn't understand viral loading was a thing and I'd have to explain that I'm aware that it isn't tag and that you need to be exposed to certain levels of the virus before you can catch it.  I guess ""(relative to my unvaccinated peers)"" would have been an easier way to say it that probably would have avoided the issues.

Yeah, right now in my state there's 1500 new cases per day.  Let's assume there's a 3 day window in which it can be caught before each of those cases is ID'd and a 10 day window in which the undiagnosed cases, that we'll say are a 1:1 ratio these days (probably low-balling it there).

For future reference, the studies done where the ""100%"" number came from have big problems. For example, the placebo control groups ALSO had very little or no hospitalizations/deaths:

[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-vaccines-compared/618226/](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-vaccines-compared/618226/)

&gt;The two vaccine trials that did explicitly report hospitalizations as an efficacy outcome make this latter issue very clear. For the [AstraZeneca](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf) vaccine, one person in the control group had severe COVID-19, but eight people were hospitalized; for [Johnson &amp; Johnson](https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download), 34 people in the placebo group had severe COVID-19, but only five people were hospitalized. It‚Äôs true that zero vaccinated people were hospitalized in either study after the vaccines took effect. But with numbers that small, you can‚Äôt draw a reliable conclusion about how high efficacy may be for these outcomes. As Diana Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research [pointed out](https://www.center4research.org/testimony-of-dr-diana-zuckerman-of-nchr-before-the-fda-advisory-committee-on-j-j-covid-vaccine/) about the Johnson &amp; Johnson trial, **‚ÄúIt‚Äôs misleading to tell the public that nobody who was vaccinated was hospitalized unless you also tell them that only 5 people in the placebo group were hospitalized.‚Äù** She‚Äôs right. And you can‚Äôt be confident about predicting effectiveness precisely in a wider population outside the trial, either. For example, some of the vaccine trials included relatively few people older than 60 as participants.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can see how fragile these numbers are by looking at those compiled for severe disease. In the [Pfizer trial](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download), for example, just one vaccinated person developed severe COVID-19 versus three in the placebo group‚Äîwhich meant that a single bout of disease made the difference between a calculated efficacy rate of 66 percent and one of 100 percent\*\*.\*\* For the [Novavax](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3) and [Oxford-AstraZeneca](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf) trials, there were zero people with severe disease in the vaccinated group versus only one in the control group, so adding or subtracting one would have been even more dramatic. **The problem is even greater for deaths. For that efficacy analysis, only two of the vaccine trials‚Äîfor Moderna‚Äôs and Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs‚Äîreported any COVID-19 deaths at all in the control groups.**",,,1617980263,{},gtxqvjg,False,t3_mn3sja,False,True,t1_gtw27w0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mn3sja/nearly_20_percent_of_the_us_population_is_fully/gtxqvjg/,1617980688,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You know what? This is a weasel response that I'm seeing all over, as it tries to couch a vaccination status as a person's private ""medical info"".

Nobody's asking for your genetic profile or whether you're being treated for diabetes, or even whether you have poor health habits like smoking or eating junk food.   Those are private *because they only affect you*.  

Instead, people are asking for you to show that you're responsible enough to care about the health of the 100 people that are going to be in the same indoor room as you while an airborne global pandemic is ongoing.

When the AIDS pandemic was destroying the gay community at its peak in the 80s and 90s, do you think it was a violation of a person's ""medical info"" to ask for proof of a negative AIDS test before having sex with somebody, as people, in fact, did?

In the short term (months) you are more at risk of death if you don't get the AZ vaccine than if you do, so unless an alternative is readily available you are putting yourself at more risk. This is true for all age groups (including you) unless covid prevalence is below what it is even in the UK currently https://wintoncentre.maths.cam.ac.uk/news/communicating-potential-benefits-and-harms-astra-zeneca-covid-19-vaccine/ - so unless you're in AUS/NZ you'd actively be putting yourself at more risk of death for no reason, pretty idiotic if you ask me. Over the next few months herd immunity isnt really relevant, if people aren't dying everything will go back to normal.

&gt;A study finds that COVID antibodies elicited by the Moderna vaccine are two times less able to neutralize B.1.429 (SARS-CoV-2 variant first identified in California) and 9.7 times less able to neutralize B.1.351 (variant first identified in South Africa). COVID antibodies elicited by the Novavax vaccine are 2.5 times less able to neutralize B.1.429 and 14.5 times less able to neutralize B.1.351. Given the high levels of antibodies generated by these vaccines, **the researchers speculate that both will be able to protect against B.1.429 but not against B.1.351.**

Extending that period would swiftly increase the number of people with the partial protection of a single shot, but some experts fear it could also give rise to dangerous new variants.

&gt; In the United States, two-dose vaccines are spaced three to four weeks apart, matching what was tested in clinical trials. But in Britain, health authorities have delayed doses by up to 12 weeks in order to reach more people more quickly. And in Canada, which has precious few vaccines to go around, a government advisory committee recommended on Wednesday that second doses be delayed even longer, up to four months.

&gt; Some health experts think the United States should follow suit. Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a co-director of the Healthcare Transformation Institute at the University of Pennsylvania, has proposed that for the next few weeks, all U.S. vaccines should go to people receiving their first dose.

Your risk is significantly reduced but it is not eliminated. You can still die of covid or have serious symptoms after being vaccinated. Or you could get it have mild symptoms and spread it to others.

&gt;With that said, I agree this would definitely be a benefit, but if it became socially unacceptable for people to go out in public while sick and not wearing a mask (as I believe is the case in much of Asia already) could also have a similar affect, and help with reducing the spread of other flus and colds.

True, people should do that as well. I could support both. 

My take is that there will be a period where lots of people will have vaccines but there is still significant spread of the virus. Basically right now in the US.

In that period, i am open to private businesses requiring vaccine for a limited number of high risk non-essential events. Such as a cruise concert or play.

COVID takes a while to kill, especially with medical treatment, and it can be difficult to turn off life support if a person is unconscious without a preexisting Do Not Resuscitate order (even longer if family members insist on ""doing everything"" to keep a loved one alive). 

Furthermore, there are reporting delays. Counties and even hospitals have different reporting procedures which can delay timely reporting. Some states are requiring, for example, formal certification of a person dying ""of COVID"" rather than ""with COVID"" to prevent a COVID-positive individual who died in a car crash from being included (as happened in April 2020 in Colorado). This often takes up to a month to verify.

Finally, death counts are generally given by date reported, not date occurred. Most deaths in California reported on April 8, for example, happened in March.

Prior to contracting covid in December, I followed every recommendation and barley left my home. I was so for getting the vaccine before contracting covid that I constantly kept tabs on phase trials and all news regarding it. So here is my question 

When I had covid, I was very lucky to have a mild go of it. Had a fever for less than 12 hours and most of it was sinus congestion, never had a cough or SOB thank god, and lost my sense of smell and taste for a few days. It did take me atleast a month and a half to feel back to myself. 

When it comes to the vaccine, everyone I know so far who had covid and took the vaccine are saying it‚Äôs been a way tougher go than covid, fevers spiking 102-104, horrible body aches, etc. 

From what my layman self has read is that most people who are reinfected, as small as that is, have a milder to asymptomatic experience. 

My question is if the vaccine causes individuals who contracted it before to have horrible symptoms, and reinfection stats show to a milder form of illness than the 1st, what is my incentive for getting it. It just seems like there so much back and forth information for people who had covid and recovered and are getting the vaccine (only need to get one shot for example)

BT's goal was to be completely independent from the US because they still has export bans.

Until now Pfizer was producing 40% of the active ingredients of the vaccine, Biontech was producing close to 60%, but that was a one-sided deal since the US doesn't allow any exports (not even materials).

&gt;The mRNA is first produced, then purified, concentrated and filtered. BioNTech has brought in German company Rentschler Biopharma SE to help with these steps. Swiss company Novartis is also negotiating a contract to produce DNA molecules used in the first step.

&gt;In the next step, the mRNA is encased in its fatty envelope. The lipids are supplied by the German firms Merck and Evonik Industries AG, while Austria's Polymun Scientific Immunbiologische Forschung GmbH, Canada's Acuitas Therapeutics Inc., and Germany's Dermapharm Holding SE are helping with the formulation.

&gt;During the final step, the solution is filtered again and filled into vials, a process known as finish and fill. This will be done by Delpharm SAS, a French company; Siegfried AG; Baxter Oncology GmbH from Germany; Novartis, Dermapharm and Sanofi.

I'll be ok if they choose to not vaccinate, if they also agree to isolate themselves. Example:

In Uruguay, the first group to receive the vaccine included teachers, so by march (southern hemisphere, start of the year for education) they could start with students at high schools. Results?

60% of teachers actually vaccinated. 40% choose not to.

But of that 40%, a majority (seems most of them) still went to their jobs in person to do their teaching.

Results? 2 weeks after the start of the high school, you had about 50% of high school institution in Uruguay capital city with at least 1 class in quarantine. The idea for the early vaccination effort for the teachers was for student to actually attend teaching in person.

Relatives in my family in Uruguay received this sort of letter (sorry, it's in spanish, so it's a google translate of a portion of it):

""
We are communicating with you to inform you that one of the members of the teaching staff of this generation notified us today that he tested positive for Covid-19. The last day he was at the Institution was last Friday, March NN. Faced with this confirmed case, the authorities are immediately consulted and it is determined to follow the following steps as preventive measures:

All 3rd year High School students (who were in direct contact with the teacher) have to go into quarantine for at least 7 days.

Once that period has elapsed ‚ÄìFriday, March XX‚Äì the M.S.P suggests that the corresponding swab be carried out. It must be managed with the health providers of each student or individually. 

""


Net effect? Now the country testing system is completely overwhelmed, because for each teacher on each high school, you have up to two or three groups going to quarantine, each doing student doing swabs, then their parents and family, and so on.

And this is EDUCATED people that not only do NOT vaccinate, but KEEP GOING around their business with other people as if nothing had happened. There's no rule to ask them if they vaccinated or not.

It was offered to have weekly test on the teachers that did not receive a vaccine.

If you're selling a TV, and I bought the TV, but the US government is blocking the export, then that's not exactly a free market.

&gt;I don't believe that Americans should skip to the head of the line. No way. We should pay and use our internal manufacturing to get us through this. It's just like how we import items from China. We are held to what they do and the prices they offer. But supply and demand are holding. 

Well that's the entire point.

The vaccines are rolling off the factory floor. The US paid for them, Canada paid for them, who knows who else has orders. Everybody has orders outstanding. But the factories can't deliver on those orders, because the US government is blocking them from exporting.

In placing orders, everybody is equal, but by blocking the exports, the US essentially moves itself to the front of the line. When an item is in short supply, that means any advantage to one party, comes at the expense of another. The US advantages itself, by disadvantaging all non-US parties.

&gt;How in the world does Americans, paying with our own money, using companies run and manufacturing in the US nationalism? Because I want the vaccine before we ship it abroad!?!? Wut?? 

YES!

There are vaccines being produced. The US paid for them. Other parties paid for them. Everybody paid for it with their own money, everybody is the same in that sense.

Now the question is, how do we get from a situation where everybody has an order for a product, to a situation where only 1 buyer is getting their orders filled?

The only way that can happen, is if that single buyer is somehow advantaged over all the others. In this case, the US is placing itself ahead of all the other outstanding orders, by making it legally impossible for factories to fulfill those other orders.

That moment, where one country skips ahead of the line ahead of everybody else, that's the vaccine nationalism. And it's nationalism, because the only real motivating reason, is nationality. It's not sick people &gt; healthy people, it's not rich people &gt; poor people (although partially/indirectly), it's Americans &gt; Non-Americans.

&gt;Btw... The US didn't produce them! Private companies did!! This has nothing to do with nationalism. Money talks. That's the sad state of our world but to say the US is stopping you from having your own infrastructure is just blame for blame sake. Build it and don't rely on us assholes. Hell i really would. 

Obviously it's private companies, do you think the US is a communist country? What kind of an open door comment is that.

It's not money talks, these orders aren't being filled based off who paid most, they're being filled because the US government blocks these companies from filling any order from any other country.

Yet their talking points/desired approach as a society has literally been Brazil‚Äôs top down strategy (much to the chagrin of Brazil‚Äôs local healthcare professionals and systems).  

And yet when I point out that Brazil is having their worst days as we speak (4000 deaths yesterday) they pawn it off on the idea that it‚Äôs a 3rd world country (in their minds).   I literally had a pro HCQ person ask me how I knew that what they were taking was really HCQ and not some counterfeit drug.  

The postmortem on this pandemic will obviously show the limitations of lockdowns and mask mandates but it will be brutal to large swaths of people who refuse vaccines and prefer to just let it rip.

What I wish people would realize is this isn't the flu vaccine or MMRs. This is a new vaccine under emergency use only and it is going to cause some hesitancy in pro-vaxxers, especially if they have natural immunity right now.

What does ""efficacy"" mean?

Efficacy measures the relative difference in any given setting of the levels of infection (or symptomatic illness, or hospitalization, etc.) between a group of people that is vaccinated and a group of people that is unvaccinated.

It is NOT a measure of any one person's ""chances"" or ""odds"" or ""probability"" of getting infected at any given time. It is also NOT a measure of how ""ready"" or ""prepared"" to fight off an infection your immune system is at any given time.  It is a measurement that is *relative* to the number of infected people in an unvaccinated group.

A very simplified example:  we have 2 cruise ships, Cruise A and Cruise B

On each cruise, we have 200 passengers: 100 vaccinated with a vaccine that has 90% efficacy against infection and 100 unvaccinated.  A breakout occurs on each ship. 

By the time the cruises end, 20 of the unvaccinated people on Cruise A are infected.  Based on the vaccine's efficacy, we would expect no more than 2 of the vaccinated people to have become infected.  

On Cruise B, the breakout was more severe, and infected 80 of the unvaccinated group.  Based on the same vaccine efficacy, we would expect no more than 8 of the vaccinated group to have become infected.

The difference between now and then is that we have multiple effective vaccines on the market that federal, state, and local governments are spending considerable resources on to get in as many arms as possible. It's not a question of will we reach heard immunity. It's a questions of when. There are several very good reasons why we would want to slow down the spread of infection right now, the most important being that we want to limit the possibility that variants arise that the vaccines might not work against. If this happens, it could prolong the pandemic indefinitely, which no one wants.

&gt; Two, the lockdowns didn‚Äôt work the first time, at a huge toll on people and the economy. Why would everyone just do it again?

Michigan and many other states that enacted lockdowns were able to flatten the curve. Cases only began going up when restrictions were lifted.

&gt; Three, there‚Äôs no evidence any variant is more deadly.

Yes, there is evidence that this variant is more deadly.[ ""The B117 COVID-19 variant, which was first identified in the United Kingdom in October 2020, may pose a 61% higher risk of 28-day mortality, according to a study published today in Nature.""](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/03/b117-deadlier-other-covid-19-strains-more-data-affirm#:~:text=The%20finding%20is%20in%20line,remains%20low%20for%20most%20populations.)",,,1617984957,{},gty1k3l,False,t3_mnj447,False,True,t1_gtxws69,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnj447/whitmer_asks_for_2week_pause_of_michigan_youth/gty1k3l/,1617986184,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You answered this yourself:

&gt;but what it does is make covid cases not so heavy so the disease doenst kill affected people as often as it would have when they were not vaccinated

There's also some evidence that vaccines do reduce spread, and countries with high vaccination rates are seeing their case counts drop dramatically.

We might not ever get to zero cases, but we can get to the point where there's no real threat of having hospitals overloaded if you go out to a stadium or whatever (and even a reasonable expectation of such a thing generating zero covid related hospitalizations).  We have other diseases that the majority of the population is vaccinated against that still circulate around (Measles and Chicken Pox come to mind), but for the most part you can do your normal day to day thing without worrying about them.

It really brings questions on where are hosptializations (not just cases) are coming from.

It's the news job to question this. People have to be cautious. Could still be a lag in statistics, but it's better to remain cautious right now in that it's not over yet.

I still question where so many cases and hosptializations are coming from, even more so after news of less surface spread and a high amount of vaccinations with older people. I can understand more cases with increased testing and schools but wonder about the hosptializations. 

Deaths have been down quite a bit so I guess it could be explained by more caution with hosptialzing people earlier.

Less than 1 in 250,000 would experience this side effect.  
  
_____
The unusual, and sometimes fatal, conditions were documented in at least 86 instances, 18 of which were fatal, as of March 22, the European Medicines Agency said in a statement. But this was across 25 million people who‚Äôve been vaccinated with the AstraZeneca jab, meaning that the condition, from the data reported so far, seems to occur in fewer than one person in every 250,000 vaccinated. These are the kind of rare side effects that are unlikely to be picked up even in large-scale clinical trials. 

Meanwhile, the EU is mandating that AstraZeneca carry out additional tests to try to determine the exact cause of the rare blood clots and what risk factors may predispose people to developing the condition. The EMA is asking two European universities to carry out studies that look for risk factors for the clotting conditions. 

The two rare conditions‚Äîcerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), which involves blood clots in veins leading from the brain, and splanchnic vein thrombosis, involving clots in abdominal veins‚Äîwere both accompanied by low levels of blood platelets and sometimes bleeding, the EMA said.

It said the conditions seemed to occur mostly in women younger than 60, and within two weeks of receiving the first dose of the vaccine. It said the cause of the condition was unclear but might be related to the immune response the vaccine induces.

European medical experts said it was possible the blood clotting could be related to the technology that underpins AstraZeneca‚Äôs vaccine. It uses a modified chimpanzee virus, an adenovirus, to carry instructions to the body‚Äôs cells to make the spike protein associated with the coronavirus, which in turn prompts an immune response. The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine also uses an adenovirus, and European officials said there were hints in the J&amp;J clinical trials, in which a few people also developed blood clots, that clotting might emerge as a potential side effect for that vaccine too. But they said the number of cases in the J&amp;J clinical trials had been too few to make any clear connection at this time.",,,1617991435,{},gtygh0x,False,t3_mnfuy6,False,True,t1_gtxg79j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnfuy6/prac_investigating_thromboembolic_events_after/gtygh0x/,1617993753,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

From a medical perspective, there really isn't a realistic ""worst case scenario"" that would cause a doctor to be cautious in recommending the vaccine at this point. Some physicians are simply much more conservative in their recommendations than others and will not make a recommendation unless there has been a lot of study on that topic in particular; others are more willing to consider the balance of evidence as a whole and draw reasonable conclusions about recommendations. Neither approach is inherently wrong, per se, although I certainly know where I stand on that spectrum.

I can't speculate on exactly what the doctors recommending that your wife wait are thinking, nor do I know your wife's medical history, but what I can tell you is that the CDC and the relevant medical societies (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, American Academy of Pediatrics, etc.) all feel comfortable in saying that the balance of evidence supports vaccinating pregnant women that want the vaccine.

Until the post-marketing studies and/or the pregnant woman studies are completed, it's going to be hard for them to formally nail down a recommendation that it be given... but they would not recommend that pregnant women be allowed to receive the vaccine unless they were confident it would be safe and effective.

I know that's not the most satisfying answer, but hope that helps!",,,1617991360,{},gtygazz,True,t3_mnitdo,False,True,t1_gty2s0k,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnitdo/vaccine_faq_variants_chronic_conditions_nsaids/gtygazz/,1617993665,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Now it's back, because they never completely eliminated it in the December to end of February shutdown. People weren't as scared or engaged.

Testing never did ramp up, but then the outbreak didn't either. They tried tracking and isolating cases but really that overreaction seemed to be what kept the country clear of impact.

The army, on the other hand, is somewhat more neutral. Those that served our last dictatorship (they are very anti-PT) are mostly retired already, so the ones currently in charge will try to be on the winning side. Once there is a clear winner, they will be very obedient.

Our Legislative is the most corrupt thing one has ever seen. Composed mostly by priests, rich farmers, lords (we don‚Äôt have formal lordship, but some families on the countryside rule over regions for decades), they are currently enemies of PT and Lula (Dilma‚Äôs impeachment, Lula‚Äôs imprisonment etc), so they will back Bolsonaro. Actually they already back Bolsonaro a lot by not proposing impeachment even though we are clearly on a genocide.

Our Judiciary supreme ministers are like a Cardinal School, where a minister is indicated by a president whenever a seat is open and remains there until 75 years old. So, it is a very divided one. Of the 11 ministers, 1 is clearly Bolsonaro, 3 or 4 switch sides very often and the rest have working brain cells.

This is as of yesterday afternoon (April 8). I thought there was a coronavirus vaccine sub, but all I can find are some similar threads from a UK forum where people are saying they've already received their first crossover shot (or are scheduled to get it).

I also started receiving texts last week that I'm able to register for a vaccine shot. I'd like to stay in the study both for personal gain (getting the vaccine that I think is better than the two already on the market) and since it would help with their data I presume to have people stay in the study. However, I cannot find any info from other people to see if maybe some other locations are getting the crossover shot, when I might be able to get it, etc. -- basically, if there is any credible way to figure out if it's like a week's wait, or if I'm looking at late May or something.

Because as a general rule vaccines that have bad side effects almost exclusively have them in the first couple months after vaccination. That general rule transcends vaccine *type* too. It's basically everything. Yes, mRNA vaccines are a new type, yes there could be an exception to the rule, but it's not *zero* evidence. It's a statistical body of work going back decades that gives us a good *probability* that there are no long term side effects. Also worth noting that one of the key elements that makes mRNA vaccines so attractive is their theoretical safety because they're very specific in what they do and how they train our bodies. Other vaccine types theoretically would have more potential for side effects because you're kind of using a blunt instrument to train the body.
