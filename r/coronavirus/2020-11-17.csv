Change to per hour... today... last 7 days, etc.

Nevada took a huge leap forward today. Now in #1 spot. Expect things to go downhill in coming weeks there.

A surprising one - over the last 4 hours, Alaska has had the most searches. Expect cases going up there a bunch in next few weeks.

A breakout term today: ‚ÄúAnik‚Äôs armory Covid test‚Äù

I had to look where that was: Minnesota. Things already very rough there. 

Today Washington DC popped up on top 10 list. I‚Äôm keeping an eye on that one next few days. For a lot of reasons.

Keep in mind, this isn‚Äôt a perfect crystal ball. But it has been proven very accurate since March when I started following searches closely. There are some days an area or state will make a leap, then you‚Äôre expecting cases to pop there in a couple of weeks, and then it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs the ones that remain there day after day that show what‚Äôs already moving up in cases and new comers as cases start to spread... then you have lead time for getting a test, test results, reporting, etc.

Interesting fact: The peak of daily searches for Covid testing happen around 8 AM - by a lot.

But there's a very large public interest in getting this thing to market and getting it to market QUICKLY.

I think the general consensus would be that the economic and societal damage being inflicted warrants taking a bit of a risk with a vaccine.

So I absolutely understand anyone who is hesitant to take it immediately, and would rather wait a bit to make sure that it still seems okay.

I would of course ask anyone who wants to wait to take the vaccine to avoid contact with anyone who is unable to take a vaccine due to medical reasons (immunocompromised, the elderly, etc), but I'm sure you already know that.

Personally, I'm probably fine with rolling the dice on there potentially being some unforeseen side effects. I think the chances of that are fairly low and I know my wife has been going nearly insane being cooped up all year.

It is also worth bearing in mind that at least some of the vaccines in development (the Oxford one in particular comes to mind) is based off of already existing research into a SARS vaccine. Presumably this vaccine candidate has greater testing, although I'm not certain on that and would need to do some digging to be sure.

Edit - I think u/clar_ response is better than mine and outlines better the risk / reward ratio of taking a vaccine early. The odds of death and long-lasting side-effects from catching COVID are substantially higher than the risk of death and other effects from a vaccine.",,,1605588098,{},gckwio0,False,t3_jv5mem,False,True,t1_gcjrcv7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jv5mem/modernas_coronavirus_vaccine_found_to_be_nearly/gckwio0/,1605654632,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Excerpts from *Nature*:

&gt;In a June paper5, he and his team analysed clinical details for 125 people in the United Kingdom with COVID-19 who had neurological or psychiatric effects. Of these, 62% had experienced damage to the brain‚Äôs blood supply, such as strokes and haemorrhages, and 31% had altered mental states, such as confusion or prolonged unconsciousness ‚Äî sometimes accompanied by encephalitis, the swelling of brain tissue. Ten people who had altered mental states developed psychosis.

&gt;Not all people with neurological symptoms have been seriously ill in intensive-care units, either. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen this group of younger people without conventional risk factors who are having strokes, and patients having acute changes in mental status that are not otherwise explained,‚Äù says Michael.

&gt;**Infection or inflammation?**
The most pressing question for many neuroscientists, however, is why the brain is affected at all. Although the pattern of disorders is fairly consistent, the underlying mechanisms are not yet clear, says De Felice.

&gt;Finding an answer will help clinicians to choose the right treatments. ‚ÄúIf this is direct viral infection of the central nervous system, these are the patients we should be targeting for remdesivir or another antiviral,‚Äù says Michael. ‚ÄúWhereas if the virus is not in the central nervous system, maybe the virus is clear of the body, then we need to treat with anti-inflammatory therapies.‚Äù

&gt;A team led by Mary Fowkes, a pathologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, posted a preprint in late May9 describing post mortems in 67 people who had died of COVID-19. ‚ÄúWe have seen the virus in the brain itself,‚Äù says Fowkes: electron microscopes revealed its presence.",,,1605588012,{},gckwdon,False,t3_jvlj9m,False,True,t3_jvlj9m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvlj9m/18_nonhospitalized_covid19_patients_are_diagnosed/gckwdon/,1605654555,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In Japan people would wear a mask when they had a cold so as not to spread it to others in the office. Too few Americans can even do it for pandemic. No wonder we're often see as selfish and stupid. In addition to all the sick, dead and dying this is a national embarrassment.

The normal, default, base case for immunity is that it is functionally forever, since [the human immune system stores countermeasure information against pathogens in memory T and B cells which last for life.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunological_memory)

In fact, this is the whole reason vaccines work: they feed data to be stored in immune memory, so that when the real infection comes, your body is ready to deploy antibodies immediately instead of having to ""learn"" it.

Unfortunately because some percentage of scientists and reporters want to fearmonger over COVID - maybe because they think keeping people afraid will boost mask compliance or something - you got a lot of VERY EQUIVOCAL takes these past few months where some scientists said maybe there is no immunity. These claims were false. 

[You don't need antibodies in your blood to be immune.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/jtt9sy/sweden_admits_it_fucked_up_and_herd_immunity_is/gc8czdt/) If you did, vaccines wouldn't work.

It's unfortunate, but sometimes scientists lie. They lied to us when they told us not to wear masks in Feb/March, and they lied when some of them claimed COVID infection did not result in lasting immunity.

Early in the pandemic, they said we‚Äôd be lucky to get a vaccine that‚Äôs 60% effective, and they expected 30%. Call me paranoid all you want but when vaccines have traditionally had a 92% failure rate (for making it to market) and now we‚Äôve got 3 claiming 90% or more effective is too suspicious for me to trust. There is an enormous amount of money wrapped up in all of this and huge profits to be made, and let‚Äôs not forget the impact on the stock market.

There‚Äôs a vaccine in trials now that is based on reliable, tried and true methods currently in clinical trials - that‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm waiting for. It isn‚Äôt dependent on the spike protein which means mink are a non-issue (fingers crossed). I can‚Äôt remember the delivery method, but it‚Äôs a boring one used by tons of reliable vaccines - as opposed to front runners who rely on new stuff.

Space shuttles don‚Äôt use the newest technology - most of what they use is decades old. They don‚Äôt want new - they want reliable and trustworthy - because the stakes are too high to risk it all on a theory. I have a similar level of risk acceptance when it comes to injecting things into my body. I‚Äôm a veterinarian and I‚Äôve vaccinated tens of thousands of animals. I got the flu vaccine this year (and many others) and got a tetanus booster recently. I‚Äôve even been vaccinated for Rabies. I‚Äôve also learned the hard way that new treatments, drugs, vaccines, etc can have severe unforeseen consequences. I‚Äôve learned the hard way to be cautious about early adoption with medical things. 

All that being said, I maintain my position: I will certainly get A vaccine, but I won‚Äôt get the first ones until they have been further studied, and I‚Äôd prefer to wait for one that uses a reliable delivery methods and has a tried and true, well known target. I will not attempt to persuade anyone else, I‚Äôm just explaining why some of us aren‚Äôt planning on being among the first to get it once the vulnerable and the essential have been vaccinated first.",,,1605657244,{},gco0178,False,t3_jvzvzg,False,True,t1_gcnq4yz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvzvzg/some_in_la_are_getting_covid19_tests_so_they_can/gco0178/,1605715281,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I‚Äôm sorry but this was not how the virus spread in Sweden. The returning travelers from the alps were contact traced and the spread contained. The outbreak was instead seeded by travelers returning from the UK, Netherlands and USA, which during those crucial few weeks did not have any known cases so it spread completely undetected until week 11 when community spread was starting to pop up. At that point it was to late to stop.

&gt;	During March, there was a great focus on Italy and the Swedish sports holidaymakers who went to the Alps to ski.  So also from the side of infection control.

&gt;	- In our analyzes, we clearly see the enormous imports from Italy, says Karin Tegmark Wisell.

&gt;	But from the samples and analyzes made in April, a different pattern can be seen. The Italian infection was much less common and instead it was other countries that stood out.  From this it can now be established that the infection entered Sweden from several different countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands and the United States.

&gt;	The conclusion the authority draws from this is that infection control in the regions through isolation and infection tracing to a large extent prevented the infection from Italy from gaining a foothold in Sweden. Instead, the infection entered the country from a number of different countries because the pandemic was already a fact.

&gt;	- It was important that we were aware of those who came from Italy and had the infection with them. It has been important for the effect.

‚ÄúInterestingly, we found that cellular immunity is stronger at this time point in those people who had symptomatic infection compared with asymptomatic cases. We now need more research to find out if symptomatic individuals are better protected against reinfection in the future.‚Äù

Wisconsin is on track to become the first US region to see a dramatic slowdown in covid due to partial herd immunity. This is not a compliment, or something to be proud of.

Wisconsin, a state of 5.8 million. Has seen 335,000 documented cases. Research varies but there is consensus that testing, particularly in a state where large portions of the population appear to be ambivalent about the disease, misses the true number of cases by multiples.

Assuming Wisconsin has had 6x as many cases as they've tested, that's around 2 million total or almost 35% of the state population. Covid is presumed to have an R0 of around 2.5. This suggests that R0 will get below 1 once over 60% of the population is immune or resistant.

60% of 5.8M is around 3.5M. If there are an average of 6500 new cases per day (which is what Wisconsin is averaging over the last couple weeks, x6 is around 40,000. If Wisconsin has already seen 2M infected, at 40,000 new cases each day, it will hit 60% infected just 37 days from now.

Given that recovery lags by about 30 days behind, Wisconsin should expect to see a distinct down turn in cases as January comes to an end with far more deaths than they should have.

Once the mushrooms are cooked down, add a few tablespoons of flour and stir to mix it in well with everything (you'll get lumps otherwise), then pour in a few cups of cold milk. Heat, stirring constantly until it thickens up, then add a few ounces of grated parmesan. Add canned or fresh boiled green beans, taste for salt and pepper and season to taste. Pour into a casserole dish and top with french fried onions. Bake covered for a bit before pulling the cover and let it brown.

The evidence for it is quite lacking, to say the least. One on hand there are emails of public health officials and scientists discussing various strategies and outcomes, with herd immunity being one of them. On the other hand, there have been recommendations and restrictions in place to limit the spread as much as possible, and both the government and FHM have time and again said how we need to keep at it until a vaccine is widely available.

And all this bullshit has had some very dangerous consequences. While some use the country of an example why we need to lock down, others use it as an example of why we should let the virus run wild. And this becomes a problem, as the whole premise is based on false facts.

Sweden did have a softer approach than most other countries, but it was based on the idea that people actually follow the recommendations in place without them needed to be backed by law. The measures have also only been a tad softer than the neighbours the vast majority of the time.

Don't get me wrong, there are a good number of things Sweden did do wrong (e.g. lack of crisis preparedness and acting too slow), but the weird thing is that these are never the focus.

This is actually quite likely, given Japan's outlook.  While on the one hand our testing and numbers are absolute bollocks, on the other, we have zero social distancing or closures here, but mask compliance is around 90%, which has been theorized to lower the viral load.  When Japanese people get sick, they tend to keep going to work anyway (masked up), which means probably a lot of people have it here, but not serious enough to warrant taking time off from work to get tested (in the typical mentality here).  Add that to the fact that they're still really only testing people who are admitted to hospitals with serious cases, and you can see that the general population here seems to be taking it well (as in, probably a lot of mild and asymptomatic cases not requiring hospitalization, likely due to compliance with masking up).",,,1605595421,{},gcl68sc,False,t3_jvi6xo,False,False,t1_gckjvzf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvi6xo/us_covid_update_more_than_73000_people_currently/gcl68sc/,1605660065,23,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

**What really applies to public gatherings and with the exception of seated audiences?**

\- We have the issue out and talk to the Government Offices, they interpret the legislation for us. We have to wait to know for sure what applies, Anders Tegnell answers

**Tegnell is asked what really applies to cinemas and whether they can be open or not?**

\- Now I do not say more about it, I get different information from different lawyers and we collect information and get back.

\--- there are multiple variations of this questions and the answer seems the same. This is a bit connected with a confusion that followed yesterday when Tegnell commented that the regulation doesn't affect cinemas, but then that turned out to be wrong. So basically the government is going to make clarification which situations are affected by the law that governs public gatherings and which not. 

**The local restrictions are extended in Sk√•ne and Uppsala until 13 December.** **DN asks what happens to the remaining regions?**

\- Our ambition is for all local general councils to end by 13 December. Instead, we will then try to come up with national advice before the Christmas weekend.

## Abstract

The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 humoral response in infected individuals remains poorly characterized. Here, we performed a longitudinal study of sera from 308 RT-qPCR+ individuals with mild disease, collected at two time-points, up to 6 months post-onset of symptoms (POS). We performed two anti-S and one anti-N serology assays and quantified neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). At month 1 (M1), males, individuals &gt; 50 years of age or with a body mass index (BMI) &gt; 25 exhibited higher levels of antibodies. Antibody levels decreased over time. At M3-6, anti-S antibodies persisted in 99% of individuals while anti-N IgG were measurable in only 59% of individuals. The decline in anti-S and NAbs was faster in males than in females, independently of age and BMI. Our results show that some serology tests are less reliable overtime and suggest that the duration of protection after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination will be different in women and men.",,,1605618374,{},gcltwyv,True,t3_jvsnax,False,True,t3_jvsnax,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvsnax/sex_differences_in_the_decline_of_neutralizing/gcltwyv/,1605673574,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; While current treatments and prevention efforts don‚Äôt seem to be affected much by this change to the virus, the mutation does raise questions about how fast new strains are emerging and whether or not one of those might cause a problem in the future, Baric says.

&gt; One development that Baric and other scientists are closely watching is the emergence of new strains found on mink farms in Denmark and the Netherlands that have been shown to infect humans.

&gt; There‚Äôs work being done to confirm that at least one of those strains -- the so-called cluster 5 virus -- may have evolved enough changes to its spike proteins that help it escape the vaccine.

&gt; Baric says the research needs to be verified, but early work suggests that the virus appears to have changed to help it infect minks more efficiently, while also keeping its ability to infect humans.

If it does mutate to something the vaccine does not help with, how long to modify this vaccine? Can't be longer than what it took to create it?",,,1605585177,{},gckrplz,False,t3_jvjaql,False,True,t3_jvjaql,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvjaql/study_new_mutation_sped_up_spread_of_coronavirus/gckrplz/,1605651985,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; The first known coronavirus infection in the city of Wuhan presented symptoms beginning on Dec. 1, and by late December there was alarm in Wuhan‚Äôs medical circles. That would have been the moment for the authorities to act decisively.

&gt;And act decisively they did ‚Äî not against the virus, but against whistleblowers who were trying to call attention to the public health threat. A doctor who told a WeChat group about the virus was disciplined by the Communist Party and forced to admit wrongdoing. The police reported giving ‚Äúeducation‚Äù and ‚Äúcriticism‚Äù to eight front-line doctors for ‚Äúrumormongering‚Äù about the epidemic; instead of punishing these doctors, Xi should have listened to them.

&gt;China informed the World Health Organization of the virus on Dec. 31 but kept its own citizens in the dark; as other countries reported infections even as China pretended that it had confined the outbreak to Wuhan, Chinese joked grimly about a ‚Äúpatriotic‚Äù virus that only struck foreigners.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/15/opinion/sunday/china-coronavirus.html

&gt;Once the outbreak occurred, other Chinese scientists rapidly identified the virus and sequenced its DNA, posting it on Jan. 10 on a virology website for all to see. That was extraordinarily good and fast work.

&gt;Meanwhile, the Communist Party instinctively organized a cover-up, ordering the police to crack down on eight doctors accused of trying to alert others to the risks. National television programs repeatedly denounced the doctors as rumormongers.

&gt;One of those eight doctors, Li Wenliang, caught the virus and died ‚Äî causing public outrage. Some Chinese make the point that if Li had been in charge of China, rather than President Xi Jinping, many lives might have been saved.

Lastly, regarding virus teams, Trump tried to send in US virus teams in January at the behest of Fauci and others, and Xi wouldn't let them in.",,,1605585120,{},gckrm4c,False,t3_jva6q7,False,True,t1_gckfgoj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jva6q7/coronavirus_update_us_averaging_150000_covid19/gckrm4c/,1605651931,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The goal of pushing them out there wasn't for you to believe them, but to believe that reality was too complicated to worry about and who knows what's true when ""both sides"" had compelling points.

The byproduct of this short term profit seeking was the total shredding of civic society itself. Paranoid lunatics who are looking for a boogeyman behind every corner are great people to sell random bullshit to but they're not great people to have in the voting booth.

Notice how all of this really ramped up in the post-war era, when the modern notions of ""marketing"" really took form.

The results for both vaccines come from interim analyses of large clinical studies. In the Moderna study there were 30,000 volunteers. Half got two doses of the vaccine 28 days apart; half got two shots of a placebo on the same schedule.

There were 95 instances of COVID-19 illness among the study participants; only five of those cases were in the vaccinated group. Ninety were in the group receiving the placebo. Of these, there were 11 cases of severe disease. The results indicate the vaccine was inducing the kind of immune response that protects people if they were exposed to the coronavirus.

China has not completely eradicated COVID, you're thinking of the city of Wuhan. China has had several outbreaks since Wuhan and have been extremely transparent about it; if their goal was elimination, they have failed...or maybe that's not their goal and they're not losing sleep and panicking over a few outbreaks because they know how to handle them.  Unless you're a member of the CCP, you have no idea what their goals are. Remember that they didn't even react proactively at first, which is why they needed to lockdown Wuhan so severely in the first place.
