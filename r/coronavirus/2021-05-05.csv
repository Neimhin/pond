There's a reason why the US didn't delay the 2nd dose.  Fauci was pretty explicit: it's really critical to the immune response.

Delaying the 2nd dose with production schedules in the US would have made no real difference in our rollout speed longer term.  At best moved things up a few days. But it  would have complicated getting people back for that second dose.

They fully expect the vaccine to only be a stopgap.  That's the reason the US ordered so much more than it technically needs (if one vaccine proves less effective, we could in theory administer a second one to boost immunity).  

That's the reason why boosters are being planned right now.  Vaccines aren't the silver bullet /r/coronavirus likes to think of them as.  We expect the virus at some point to render it ineffective. 

There's two ways to crush this:

1. High vaccination rates globally.
2. Enough measures in place to keep the virus under control.  What's happening in India and Brazil right now really fucks the globe.  The virus is replicating rapidly which gives it a ton of opportunity to evolve. Trillions and trillions of opportunities a day.

Neither of these is more important than the other.  

We also don't know the date when the vaccine will become less effective.  It could be slow and linear.  It could be June 14, 2021 at 13:25 GMT.  We won't know until days, weeks, maybe months after when the effects show up, since all our telemetry on the virus is based on effect (people getting sick, people dying).

That's the real reason to keep wearing a mask.  By the time anyone says ""hey, maybe we need to rethink this""... we'll already have a serious problem.  That's not politics or negligence.  That's just how our tracking of viruses work.  We're reactive, not proactive.

In the 1980's the WHO recommended to vaccinate children as well with the Merck/GSK recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. However, the vaccine was rather expensive at 23 USD, something a lot of countries could not afford. A new Indian biotechnology company founded in 1993, Shanghai Biotechnics, approached a Western company for a technology transfer at a WHO transfer, and was told what you said. This happened around a decade later in 1993. By 2002, 9 years later, the company managed to obtain WHO pre-qualification for their 1 USD recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine. And 7 years later, by 2009, they managed to sell 120 million doses of the vaccine and we're bought by Sanofi during that same year. 

We need more COVID-19 vaccines now and in the coming years. If this story is a precedent, sharing the IP will do absolutely nothing for the current pandemic, because by then enough doses have been produced for the entire global population.

Okay let's start with the fact that Justin Trudeau and his government paid double what other countries did and got the vaccines (still getting) it months later than them is... a botched rollout and acquirement. 

Or how about why Trudeau didn't pursue a Canadian domestic vaccine production partnership with India, the world's largest vaccine producers... but instead picked the Chinese (Cansino) instead, and then lost. 

How about this though? With a government email showing how much they paid for a late AZ shipment (paying more than the other countries like Israel but getting them late and always delayed e.g. AZ and Moderna) 

&gt; Pissed about lockdowns with no vaccine appointment? Would we be in this situation if the Liberals had delivered us vaccines in January and February? This email shows that as recently as Sept 24, Astra wasn't scheduled to begin to arrive until the end of March. Deadly failure.

You have one of the best rollouts of vaccines for 1st doses in the world, but in the G20, USA, UK, France, Germany, Turkey, Italy, and Mexico are all ahead of you. Even while the US and UK are pretty much the only countries with huge domestic production.

It is a simple statement of fact that *as the market is run today*, major pharmaceutical companies invest billions of dollars into research and drug development. Apparently you want to argue that the spending could be better distributed and that they also make unreasonable profits off of government funded research, but again you would be arguing with no one. You can't possibly believe that all current medical innovation is exclusively a result of public research.   
  
The fact of the matter is that the investment exists and that it is important to the process that we have today for developing and bringing medications to market.

For this virus unfortunately, the selective pressure to be less lethal is very low. People are already most infectious before symptoms show or in the very early stages. Whatever happens after that is almost meaningless for the virus' success in spreading. So there is almost no selective pressure to become less lethal (thankfully also none to become more lethal).

70% is above what *would* be required *with very high vaccination rates and no change in baseline transmission rates.*

The reproductive rate (R) of a pathogen is a function of its baseline reproductive rate (R0) and the rate of immunity in the population, which itself is a function of vaccination rates and vaccine efficacy. We bring an epidemic under control by getting R below 1. For that purpose, the lower the vaccine uptake, the higher the efficacy needs to be. Similarly, the more contagious the virus, the higher the efficacy needs to be.

Unfortunately, the high rates of vaccine hesitancy combined with the rising number of variants that are both more contagious *and* more vaccine-resistant may spell trouble in the short term. There was already some reason to be concerned that the US might not reach the herd immunity threshold even under the assumption that the vaccines work equally well against all variants. Countries relying on AZ and J&amp;J might have an even bigger problem.

(Thankfully, mRNA vaccines are extremely quick to develop, so I'd expect to see boosters with better protection against these variants being tested in relatively short order.

Basically, when we're thinking of possibility of long-term reaction, there's going to be two categories of reactions: direct reaction to a component of the vaccine or indirect reaction as a result of the immune response -- basically, an autoimmune reaction. The first one, as you pointed out, isn't going to be plausible because the mRNA is degraded very rapidly. The second done is going to present within 2-6 weeks -- remember, an autoimmune reaction is your body's immune system attacking your own body, and if that happens at all, it's going to happen when you have a strong immune response going on.

That's exactly what happened with the Pandemrix situation, and it's actually a common misconception that the narcolepsy cases presented after years. They didn't! They presented within a few weeks of getting the vaccines, but they were so incredibly rare that it took years to realize that was occurring. I go into more detail about that situation here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnitdo/vaccine_faq_variants_chronic_conditions_nsaids/gu4cols/

 I've had medical colleagues who have worked, done rotations or trained in India, and I've walked through an average hospital in India before the pandemic and it's not a pretty sight.. I wouldn't have wanted to be a patient there before this pandemic.

The surprising part isn't that it's happening, but that it took this long to happen. Which meant that India did very well initially with their initial measures. I think they actually could have kept it down for longer and beaten it had they not allowed political rallies and religious gatherings to happen. However India got complacent and let their guard down due to their early success, when they should have held strong until sufficient vaccines were delivered (which might take another year or so).

In seeing the videos and hearing stories of what's going on now, I feel for all the patients, families and healthcare staff currently in India dealing with this horrifying wave. Everyone is being negatively affected by this wave.

As you likely know, there was a pause of use in Janssen after noting 6 cases of rare blood clots with low platelets after nearly 8 million doses were given.

Bottom line is all 3 are very protective, and specifically women under 50 should weigh benefits of convenience of one dose (and full protection within 2 weeks) and this rare risk compared to the 2 dose regimens which would take a 2nd dose and a bit longer time to get fully protected. - Dr. Pan",,,1620336670,{},gx78f8x,True,t3_n6gqal,False,False,t1_gx70i3f,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6gqal/hey_reddit_im_dr_erica_pan_ca_state/gx78f8x/,1620389306,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

 The U.S. government will pay the companies $1.95 billion upon the receipt of the first 100 million doses, following FDA authorization or approval. The U.S. government also can acquire up to an additional 500 million doses.

Americans will receive the vaccine for free consistent with U.S. government’s commitment for free access for COVID-19 vaccines.

“We’ve been committed to making the impossible possible by working tirelessly to develop and produce in record time a safe and effective vaccine to help bring an end to this global health crisis,” said Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO. “We made the early decision to begin clinical work and large-scale manufacturing at our own risk to ensure that product would be available immediately if our clinical trials prove successful and an Emergency Use Authorization is granted. We are honored to be a part of this effort to provide Americans access to protection from this deadly virus.”

“Expanding Operation Warp Speed’s diverse portfolio by adding a vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech increases the odds that we will have a safe, effective vaccine as soon as the end of this year,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “Depending on success in clinical trials, today’s agreement will enable the delivery of approximately 100 million doses of this vaccine to the American people.”

&gt;Specifically, if you take 10 million people and just wave your hand back and forth over their upper arms, in the next two months you would expect to see about 4,000 heart attacks. About 4,000 strokes. Over 9,000 new diagnoses of cancer. And about 14,000 of that ten million will die, out of usual all-causes mortality. No one would notice. That’s how many people die and get sick anyway.

&gt;But if you took those ten million people and gave them a new vaccine instead, there’s a real danger that those heart attacks, cancer diagnoses, and deaths will be attributed to the vaccine.

If the issue was that prices were too high for this vaccine, I could see your argument. But that's not the issue; this was never an expensive vaccine. Supply simply cannot meet demand right now. That's it. Which makes sense considering how high demand would be for something like this. The more manufacturers who can produce as many vaccines as fast as possible, the better.

“Waiving” the patent just gives generic manufacturers the legal right to make these vaccines without paying a license fee. 

The problem is that with these vaccines there’s as much engineering involved as science. When someone like Pfizer sets up a new plant they it involves flying out experienced engineers to set things up, and it still takes months to get up to speed. 

Which probably explains why there’s no generic Moderna manufacturing despite them promising not to enforce their patents.

Correct me if I'm wrong but boosters are not there to actually ""boost"" neutralising antibodies but to make sure they neutralise emerging variants that evade vaccine induced immunity or at least some of it effectively bringing vaccine efficacy lower. 


Also I do think that it is true that during trials severe disease and death were considered the primary focus. After trials and even some time after rollout there wasn't too much concrete data on whether vaccines actually stop you from passing the virus, obviously now we know that this seems to be the case indeed.

Germany used to be the world leader of the pharmaceutical industry, when they had a very ""loose"" patent system. They did not patent actual products, but patented the processes to make the product that specific way. This was a great way to spur innovation and competition. RND had to be heavily invested in to be the leader in an area. And others could use and innovative way to bring competition to the market. 

 Patents are not inalienable rights, they are bestowed by society/government in order to grant monopolies which would encourage innovation. We the public grant them in order to benefit the public. The intent is innovation. The pendulum has been continuously swinging too far, however. Instead of research and development with scientists and statisticians, we now have loophole finder lawyers and marketers. We're now at WWI trench warfare of pharma. There's a lot of spending being done, a lot of damage being done, but no progress being made. The activities of regulatory pathway manipulations are failing to move medicine forward. It's subverting the intention of the patent system in the first place. It's blocking innovation and better drugs.

I can get at most 45 minutes to one hour of mask compliance from my daughter, and that’s in comfortable conditions (as opposed to the confinement of a plane), so I knew there was no way I could get her through a 10-hour flight. Given our circumstances (this was a one-way repatriation flight after having moved to Europe in 2019, we were required to have negative Covid tests for boarding, the flight was only 34 passengers in a @ 300 capacity plane, she was just a few months over 2 years), I was able to get her an exemption. I was armed with all of my paperwork in case we were questioned, but no one ever asked or seemed to care.

I wouldn’t put her on a plane by choice right now, especially not an American carrier where there’s no exceptions made (and we’re certainly not traveling internationally any time soon). I couldn’t take the stress of wondering if she’ll comply when the pressure’s on, and there’s no way to force a mask on a kid her age. 

I think that a toddler who will wear a mask for several hours in an airplane is the exception, not the norm. It’s really an unfair/unrealistic expectation, I suspect that’s somewhat the entire point - the airlines and government made it this way to deter travel, hoping that families decide to not bother or take the risk of trying to get their young children to comply with such strict rules. They’ll just stay home or drive for this year’s vacation.

So let's analyze the evidence: If the Chinese government has been lying, there're two possibilities:

Theory One: The pandemic is still not under control in China. Many many people are still getting sick today and the situation there is much worse than what is being reported.

Theory Two: The pandemic was indeed controlled earlier (say, before April 8, 2020, when the lockdown of Wuhan was lifted). However, the actual numbers of infected cases and deaths were waaaaaaay higher than they were reported.

If Theory One was true, we'll witness a significant recession of the Chinese economy as the productions were heavily damaged by the pandemic. Instead, everything is good, including the import/export figures reported by other countries. Products made in China still keep running into western markets. Thus, all evidences are against this theory.

For Theory Two, the real curves of infected cases and deaths would be totally different than what we are seeing right now.

We should know by now that big corporations will never do the right thing unless there is profit in it.

I would hesitate to lump all academics into any particular group, though it's true that any educated group is likely to be heavily pro vaccine, because it's the only sensible thing to be. Some academic disciplines are incredibly conservative (not trumpian).

You're connecting a lot of dots, and reading in a great deal to one anecdote thats short on information. This reveals a lot more about your biases than it does about academics, who can't agree on the name of a fucking conference, let alone a public health policy.

Keep in mind that academic conferences aren't exactly money spinners, and quite a few are in cheaper hubs, where vaccination rates are low.  There isn't some massive profit people are turning down, so any degree of hassle of concern about attendance and people will rip the cord. Any hosting institutions have bigger fish to fry right now anyway, given losses to most institutions this last year.

Regarding zero covid... yes, burning covid out almost entirely locally would be any rational persons goal. Some consensus on this and we'd get pretty damn close, and we'd get there faster. We won't of course, but that's neither here nor there. While one side bleats about their crazy idea of 1/3rd of the US not being irredeemably stupid, others will bleat about their impatience.

What you're doing is giving the commonly held conservative ""supposition"" of how you think a perfect little ideological world should work. That's not how the real world actually works though.

The largest incentive is legal manipulation. We right now are not incentivizing actual pharmaceutical innovation. Medical innovation. The profit motive more heavily incentivized trench war fare in legal battles. It incentives changing products very little, and getting another patent. The lowest amount of cost put forward for the largest amount of revenues. That does not include heavy and risky RND. That includes patent evergreening. Product hopping. Colluding with generics to prevent competition. [https://www.i-mak.org/overpatented-overpriced-excessive-pharmaceutical-patenting-extending-monopolies-driving-drug-prices/](https://www.i-mak.org/overpatented-overpriced-excessive-pharmaceutical-patenting-extending-monopolies-driving-drug-prices/)

This is why we have things like esomeprazole vs omeprazole. For all intents and purposes these are the same thing. And yet, Americans have spent a wasted 100+ billion dollars, on this one product mind you, because of a BS patent. There was no incentive to innovate here. It was to repackage the something.

It's also why we have the story of Asacol, literally just putting a sugar coating around an existing pill to charge through the roof for the new product, and remove the old product so no one could make it. Asacol is a famous example of product hopping. It's patent was expiring in 2013 so Warner Chilcott made some particularly bold moves to keep their monopoly. Of course they did the typical; making a higher dose XR version of the tablet. It was granted new patents. However, this version was only approved for moderate indication, not both moderate and mild like the first version. So, despite illegally marketing the the drug for off label uses, the drug, unusually so, did become widely adopted. So, they also brought out delzicol, a bioequivalent version of asacol, only surrounded in a cellulose capsule. Literally cut it open and the old pill falls out. The folks paying attention to pharma were fed up. Here's where it gets a bit complex. Because this was bioequivalent, it couldn't be given a new molecular entity status, however it was given a patent. In summary: these mothers literally wrapped up the old pill like a present to executives and called it a new one. From the CEO even: ""it's a hard conversion. We're stopping, going to stop the shipment of asacol shortly, and it will be all delzicole. I think they're all familiar with what's going on."" Now not only this, but the company also used citizen petitions and reverse payments to keep their monopoly.

Patents are not inalienable rights, they are bestowed by society/government in order to grant monopolies which would encourage innovation. We the public grant them in order to benefit the public. The intent is innovation. The pendulum has been continuously swinging too far, however. Instead of research and development with scientists and statisticians, we now have loophole finder lawyers and marketers. We're now at WWI trench warfare of pharma. There's a lot of spending being done, a lot of damage being done, but no progress being made. The activities of regulatory pathway manipulations are failing to move medicine forward. It's subverting the intention of the patent system in the first place. It's blocking innovation and better drugs. The balance of public good and private incentive is now fully depressed rather than evenly weighted.

\&gt;the company earned $115 billion on sales of $528 billion during the 10 years from 2006 through 2015, for an average profit of almost 22 percent. During the same period, Pfizer spent $139 billion on stock buy backs and dividends; over $155 billion on sales, informational, and administrative expenses; and only $82 billion on research. Revenues generated marketing partner under the Bayh-Dole Act.

\&gt;According to aggregated data from Statista, Johnson &amp; Johnson earned one third of its pharmaceutical revenue between 2011 and 2015 (about $30 billion) from sales of Remicade — a federally funded discovery made at New York University. Similarly, between 2006 and 2015, Amgen derived $90 billion from the sale of Neupogen and Enbrel which were discovered by federally funded researchers at Memorial Sloane Kettering and the University of Texas. 

\&gt;Since 1984, patent extensions have provided well over $100 billion in extra monopoly revenue during the period of the extensions. The cholesterol-lowering statin drugs alone generated $60 billion from patent extensions and another $5 billion from pediatric extensions. For that $5 billion the government could have covered the entire cost of thestudies needed for the 200 drugs that have received the pediatric patent extension. Instead, the pediatric extensions generated many billions in extra revenue for dozens of blockbuster drugs having annual sales of $1 to several billion per year.

If it was bullshit and the 2nd dose didn’t matter, Public Health Canada would allow Canadians with the 1st dose all the freedoms the CDC has given to fully vaccinated Americans and would actually give a re-opening timeline.

The reason they haven’t done so is because their shipments are still unstable and the only big dog who has been shipping vaccines consistently to Canada throughout this pandemic is Pfizer. They’re unsure about when they can actually get everyone fully vaccinated so they just throw out the September target.

It should start to change in the coming months but they definitely botched it up till now. If it weren’t for Biden lifting the Pfizer export ban, Canada would still be getting 1m doses per week. 

Science and data does not equal the “only metric to try and convince people Canada is doing badly” 

It’s the truth. 

Yes no fucking shit having 35% of people with the 1st dose is great! But don’t expect the Canadian government to start lifting restrictions until there’s actually millions of people fully vaccinated.

Or they would have already done so and lifted restrictions. But they haven’t. Why? Because Dr. Theresea Tam knows full vaccination is needed to prevent a 4th wave of variants.

Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine had great efficacy of 89.5% vs B117 variant &amp; 75% vs B1351 of South Africa variant for infection—but only with 2 doses. The 1 dose efficacy was just ~29% vs B117 &amp; ~17% vs  B1351.

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2104974

Now make sure to go and wonder why Justin Trudeau always say “we will listen to the science and data from experts” and then say nothing about easing restrictions. It’s because those same experts know that Canadians will never be protected as much as other countries are with high vaccination rates until they are fully vaccinated.

And guess what? Canadians have to wait 4 months for their 2nd dose. So they can’t fully vaccinated and follow the 21-28 day spacing for doses as the science has suggested.

Why?

They’re all predicated on a false reality manufactured from your lack of actually understanding a complicated amalgamation of business, government, science, manufacturing, and a raging pandemic. Operation warp speed was a blank check to fund vaccine/therapeutics development. It was effective, but it gave companies lots of money with little to no oversight. Yes, I think vaccine distribution might be different than a blank check vaccine development program. I don’t know how you can even argue a successful vaccine development program means you get credit for establishing a subsequent federal distribution network, but I’m starting to think you’re bias is getting in the way of you seeing the truth. Why was the vaccine distribution so awful in December and January? What happened in late January that made the number of vaccines given in the US dramatically jump? Who deserves blame for fomenting half our population to not get vaccinated? Remember “anyone who wants a test can get one”, but very few people could actually get a test at that time or for the subsequent next few months? The previous administration should get credit for establishing a funding program to develop vaccines, but holy hell were they awful at implementing specific policy details regarding rollouts of tests and vaccines. They pushed everything on to the states instead of having a unified federal plan. You even listed the numerous companies who’s vaccines failed, but they still received government money to cover all their expenses. Pfizer/BioNTech didn’t take that money, and gambled billions.

Just because I quote information from someone that you don't agree with politically means that I have some ""motives"" and that we are all wrong and Canada perfected it's vaccine rollout?

It doesn't work that way.

I'm sensing a trend that after months of avoidable cases, deaths, and lockdowns, betting on different vaccines and receiving literally months later, is finally starting to work a bit wherein you have a high % percentage of 1st doses but not 2nd doses which is what matter. 

If the 1st dose was enough, Public Health Canada would say so and lift the individual restrictions placed on Canadians lives if they're fully vaccinated,  just as the CDC has done for fully vaccinated Americans here.

But Public Health Canada, Justin Trudeau, Patty Hajdu, and Dr. Tam know that the Liberal Party screwed up the vaccine acquirement and did it too late, later than Israel who is already at herd immunity from a correct vaccine rollout. Canada had the same chance to get as much Pfizer just as fast, but waited too long.

Only now will things begin to change because 1.26m Canadians have gotten Covid-19, who knows how many have long term damage now, and and 24k lives have been lost with countless and non-sensible lockdowns.

Even Justin Trudeau and Dr. Howard Njoo have publicly admitted last week that international travel at the borders account for less than 1% of Canada's cases and that community spread and workplace spread is the highest contributor.

Canada's bet on Novavax won't even begin to bear fruits until the mid of 2022... A bit too late while the USA, EU, and UK are already opening up everything. Moderna shipments are unstable at best with their unknown delivery schedule and delays. The little amount of 300k J&amp;J delivered has been put on pause even though the FDA has cleared it again.

And thank you for agreeing with me on fully vaxxed citizens being able to cross the border. If the logistics are being worked out at all, than they are being done behind the scenes. Otherwise the Majority Leader of the Senate, Chuck Schumer, including countless House Reps of Border States wouldn't be pushing for a plan. And if they aren't being worked out behind the scenes, the government of Canada is just purely incompetent for not even having clear benchmarks or metrics to use for re-opening.


Although, things in terms of Canada's rollout are definitely getting better now. Pfizer will export 2m doses per week in May, and 2.5m doses in June to Canada. Biden will likely also send more. He should just make a quid pro quo to vaccinate Canada's entire population to re-open the border, I don't know why it hasn't been done so. It's only logical.

I genuinely could not care less about the roughly $8 each we paid for AZ doses, the vast majority of which we haven't even received. Like what were these even paid for? The 500k we got from India at a desperate time when they'd have been worth well over $20 a dose if they wanted them? The American doses that were given as a loan and thus not even part of our order? Theoretical doses that may or may not be delivered in the future from our actual AZ contract? Like I cannot begin to explain how little this point matters. 

Canada bet on pretty much every vaccine. They're not all going to work and Cansino was certainly an example of that. We also bet on Novavax which we *will* have domestic production of. And which also may turn out to be a bet with a middling return since it isn't approved yet. Luckily we also bet on Phizer, Moderna, AZ, and J&amp;J. Sensing a trend here? As a country with no production capability, we have an extremely diverse vaccine profile and it is *working*. Which is why despite what you've claimed from who knows what data, we're #3 in the G20.

However when you look at the data more closely you can see that after 14 days, the standard length of time required to produce an effective response from a vaccine, the efficacy increases to 92% (and only increases a further 2% to 94% after the second dose). Including the initial 2 weeks post vaccination data brought the overall efficacy rate down. Once researchers saw that data it made sense to try to get as many people as possible 92% protection rather than fewer people 94% protection.

I know people that are going ahead with their wedding ceremony/reception in June, requiring masks and social distancing. By this time in the US, everyone who wants to be vaccinated in their families will be vaccinated (besides a few kids). There just comes a point where you have to go on with your life, and if people don't want to get vaccinated and choose to go to a large gathering like a wedding, then the risk and chance is on them. The vaccine is free, available in most places 7 days a week, at least 8hrs a day. Unless you have severe allergies to the vaccine, cannot get the vaccine for medical reasons, or live in an area ignored by your current state (for reasons the bot thought was not appropriate) there is no other excuse but your own cognitive dissonance and recklessness.

Very true. Most people don't understand this. Without patent protection, inventors would have to keep their inventions secrete for as long as possible.

The real issue is the way AZ gave supply estimates, clearly overestimating for everyone leading to the inevitable situation of AZ failing to meet demand. Aside from a strictly legal perspective there's a moral question here as well. You overpromised vaccines in a global pandemic and are inevitably going to underdeliver, how do you allocate such underdelivery?

Pfizer-Biontech vaccine is even more complicated and apparently only one who is even capable to manufacture it in relevant numbers is USA/EU/China.

I personally see only disadvantages - lower intentions to develop new stuffs from big-pharma and more f-ups leading to lower trust in vaccines.

Just look at EU - they just ordered plenty of vaccines and then they was surprised that companies wasn't capable to delivered them. It needs a lot of effort and money to increase production.

India sells vaccine all over the world, but forget to actually invest big money into covid vaccine productions. They are still under 100M per month.

The studies have been all over the map, and as you said they tend to only look at 14-28 days after the first shot. 

The most-cited one is the CDC study.  But the CDC's study showing 80% single-dose efficacy was tiny - about 4k participants (and they were young-ish healthcare workers).

The UK and Israel ran much larger studies (24k in the UK one, and a huge 1.2M in the Israeli one.) The UK found 72% efficacy three weeks after the first dose; Israel found 66%.

Most recent study on reinfection published in the Lancet

“SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positivity protects against reinfection for at least seven months with 95% efficacy”

&gt; Among 43,044 antibody-positive persons who were followed for a median of 16.3 weeks (range: 0–34.6), 314 individuals (0.7%) had at least one PCR positive swab ≥14 days after the first-positive antibody test. Of these individuals, 129 (41.1%) had supporting epidemiological evidence for reinfection. Reinfection was next investigated using viral genome sequencing. Applying the viral-genome-sequencing confirmation rate, the incidence rate of reinfection was estimated at 0.66 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 0.56–0.78). Incidence rate of reinfection versus month of follow-up did not show any evidence of waning of immunity for over seven months of follow-up. Meanwhile, in the complement cohort of 149,923 antibody-negative persons followed for a median of 17.0 weeks (range: 0–45.6), incidence rate of infection was estimated at 13.69 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 13.22–14.14). Efficacy of natural infection against reinfection was estimated at 95.2% (95% CI: 94.1–96.0%). Reinfections were less severe than primary infections. Only one reinfection was severe, two were moderate, and none were critical or fatal.

I’m also in my twenties and much of the issues with low antibodies and T cells comes from older immune compromised individuals.

Public health guidelines are crafted at a 4th grade reading level. They’re meant to be shared with the public and they rarely show the nuance and science behind the decision as it can be too confusing to those without a science background. 

I am quite healthy, had a robust immune response, and I can tell you that for those in a similar category, we have more protection that say a standard American in their 50’s who had covid. 


They don’t give different guidance for healthy people who had covid vs unhealthy people who had covid. Instead they give blanket guidance for all groups.

Well I like to actually do my research and make the best decision for my health. I don’t think the vaccine will provide me protection that’s worth getting a vaccine at the moment. I’ve seen 0.65% reinfection rates in quite a few large studies SIRENS, Denmark, Israel, etc. those reinfections tended to be in older people with 60% being asymptomatic. Reinfections are extremely rare, and with all of this information I feel safe enough to not contract or pass off covid.

Whether you believe me or not is up to you, but I’ve done the research and formed conclusions based on research at a college level and not based off generalized public health recommendations crafted at a 3-5th grade level.

Most recent study on reinfection published in the Lancet

https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589537021001413

“SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positivity protects against reinfection for at least seven months with 95% efficacy”

&gt; Among 43,044 antibody-positive persons who were followed for a median of 16.3 weeks (range: 0–34.6), 314 individuals (0.7%) had at least one PCR positive swab ≥14 days after the first-positive antibody test. Of these individuals, 129 (41.1%) had supporting epidemiological evidence for reinfection. Reinfection was next investigated using viral genome sequencing. Applying the viral-genome-sequencing confirmation rate, the incidence rate of reinfection was estimated at 0.66 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 0.56–0.78). Incidence rate of reinfection versus month of follow-up did not show any evidence of waning of immunity for over seven months of follow-up. Meanwhile, in the complement cohort of 149,923 antibody-negative persons followed for a median of 17.0 weeks (range: 0–45.6), incidence rate of infection was estimated at 13.69 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 13.22–14.14). Efficacy of natural infection against reinfection was estimated at 95.2% (95% CI: 94.1–96.0%). Reinfections were less severe than primary infections. Only one reinfection was severe, two were moderate, and none were critical or fatal. Most reinfections (66.7%) were diagnosed incidentally through random or routine testing, or through contact tracing.",,,1620308762,{},gx5e0sq,False,t3_n5vfgz,False,True,t1_gx5aq7c,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n5vfgz/cdc_says_coronavirus_could_be_under_control_this/gx5e0sq/,1620354198,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech uses a completely different technology, mRNA. It carries genetic code for the spike protein ised by SARS-CoV-2.

Others in good families may have thrived because of their parents being able to spend more time with them.  Some kids who are just shuffled from one activity to the next every day may have benefitted from having less sports and such, and more time to just hang out and be kids.

MANY countries have rigid import/export regimes that would stand in the way of importing cheaper vaccines, particularly if they are embargoed, sanctioned or have governments that are ""open to persuasion,"" (read: bribery). 

The reason that price is not an issue right now is because the sole manufacturers are setting the price. In this circumstance, ironically the corporation is keeping the price low since they have MASSIVE reserves in place to off set any kind of losses or ""missed profit"" that they could make. It would also be a PR nightmare if they priced the vaccine too high.

Along with this - look at the opposite side of the equation: if these manufacturers price the vaccine BELOW what the developers are pricing, then they will end up winning business since they do not have research and development costs to recooperate - they were handed the patent.

I'm of the opinion that pretty much all restrictions should be getting removed or at least seriously discussed in any/all locations where vaccination has been available to all adults for several weeks, almost regardless of the metrics.  But most of the time when I say that, I get a bunch of sarcastic responses about how I'm such a bad person for not ""wanting to wear a little piece of cloth over my face"" (as though I haven't been willingly doing that for the past year).  

They always want to act like life is totally normal except for a cloth mask.  It's not.  Events and large gatherings still aren't allowed.  Many parts of the country still have business restrictions in place.  I still haven't been to the office since March of last year.  Many of my friends and family are still scared despite being fully vaccinated, largely because of the CDC not being willing to update its recommendations.  You can't force people to believe they're safe, but pulling back on pointless restrictions (such as outdoor masking recently) is the first step toward showing people.  And yes, the masks too.  Nobody likes wearing masks.  If people liked wearing masks, you would've seen people wearing masks sometime in the past 100 years in this country.  Mask requirements are not a terrible price to pay, but we're very quickly approaching a point where we need to seriously ask why we're still paying it.

Patents reduce competition, but they significantly increase innovation. You aren't going to spend years of your life trying to build a better plow if you think that every farmer around you is just going to steal the idea. You're going to keep doing things the exact same way everyone around you is doing them, which is great for consumers in the short term since that makes for a lot of competition, but bad in the long term because they don't get any innovation.

It's really amazing to me how much hate there is around here for intellectual property when *that's literally the reason this website exists.* The whole reason this website is here is because the people who sunk the time and money into it knew they could patent its unique features and trademark its name and have protections against employees stealing the code, and therefore be relatively protected from competition while they built it up. 

&gt; . . . once you hit gold with an invention or discovery, why bother improving it when you are the only one allowed to profit from it? You have no incentive to invest more time and money making the production process better, faster, or cheaper.

I would separate the idea of a patent from the issue of a monopoly. A true monopoly has little incentive to improve, but that isn't automatically the case for the holder of a patent, since there are often near-substitutes, and of course, patents expire.

Apple's iPhone is a good example: they had a near-exclusive product for a short period of time thanks to many of their patented technologies, but had plenty of incentives to innovate, because they knew that there were near substitutes for their product (flip phones, GPSs, personal computers, tablets) and that their competitors would be catching up sooner or later.",,,1620251988,{},gx2vn5t,False,t3_n5o08z,False,True,t1_gx2qn4o,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n5o08z/us_backs_covid_vaccine_intellectual_property/gx2vn5t/,1620300960,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;  
&gt;The United States had been a major holdout at the World Trade Organization over a proposal to suspend intellectual property protections in an effort to ramp up vaccine production. But President Biden had come under increasing pressure to throw his support behind the proposal, including from many congressional Democrats.  
&gt;  
&gt;Katherine Tai, the United States trade representative, announced the administration’s position in a statement on Wednesday afternoon.  
&gt;  
&gt;“This is a global health crisis, and the extraordinary circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures,” she said. “The administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for Covid-19 vaccines.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Ms. Tai added that the United States would participate in negotiations at the W.TO. over the matter, adding, “Those negotiations will take time given the consensus-based nature of the institution and the complexity of the issues involved.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Activists have been pressing for the waiver but have also said that a waiver alone will not boost world supply of the vaccine; it must be accompanied by the process known as “tech transfer,” in which patent holders supply technical know-how and personnel.  
&gt;  
&gt;“This is a start,” said Gregg Gonsalves, a Yale University epidemiologist and longtime AIDS activist who has been pressing for the waiver. “We need the writing of the text of this waiver now to be transparent and public, but as we have always said we need tech transfer now.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Earlier Wednesday, members of the W.T.O. held another round of discussions about waiving intellectual property protections. Further discussions are expected in the coming weeks, as India and South Africa, which proposed the waiver, are preparing a revised plan for nations to consider.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the director general of the W.T.O., urged members to proceed with negotiations over the text of the plan.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I am firmly convinced that once we can sit down with an actual text in front of us, we shall find a pragmatic way forward,” she [said at a meeting](https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/spno_e/spno9_e.htm) of the organization’s General Council.",,,1620251422,{},gx2uddv,True,t3_n5rkfr,False,True,t3_n5rkfr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n5rkfr/the_biden_administration_says_it_will_support/gx2uddv/,1620300246,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Right now, in Brazil, there are several governors and mayors imposing local decrees banning people from being able to circulate about after/before certain hours (effectively curfews). Many of these have been struck down by judges already because those lower courts have found them to be unconstitutional.

There is a pending case in the supreme court to determine the validity of ~~these~~ ***curfew*** types of decrees, and whether or not they are against the Brazilian Constitution, so, right now, these curfews are in a bit of a legal limbo.

In conclusion, the study by Taquet et al. indicates severe neurological and psychiatric illness following infection with COVID-19. The knowledge reaped from this study can assist in health services planning and in identifying future research goals. Globally, the cohort approach reported offers useful, timely, and critically required information for other researchers and funding providers to guide the future steps in the COVID-19 research related to clinical neurosciences and mental health strategy.

People who are naturally infected are 84% protected according to the SIREN study, i dont know the effect of preventionof severe infection:

&gt;People who had COVID-19 had an 84% lower risk of becoming reinfected and a 93% lower risk of symptomatic infection during 7 months of follow-up, according to findings from a large, multicenter study published late last week in The Lancet.

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/04/previous-covid-19-may-cut-risk-reinfection-84

Vaccination is on par with that after *one dose:*

&gt;Following a single dose of either vaccine, the participants’ risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 was reduced by 80 percent two or more weeks after vaccination.


And that is for asymptomatic infection, too. 

https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0329-COVID-19-Vaccines.html

&gt;The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is 91.3% effective up to 6 months after the second dose and 100% effective against severe disease as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to updated data today from the phase 3 trial.

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/04/pfizer-covid-vaccine-91-effective-least-6-months

&gt;Vaccine efficacy starting two weeks following the second dose and based on the updated adjudicated cases remains consistent with prior updates, including greater than 90% against all cases of COVID-19, and greater than 95% against severe cases of COVID-19.

There’s not any discernible change in the slope after the second dose, but the numbers are pretty small and it would be hard to see any change. 

My (not a doctor) understanding is that the second shot might be more important for long-term protection, based on how out immune systems work, than it is for an actual change in the vaccine’s short term (months?) efficacy.

I have a friend who got a positive covid test two days after his first vaccine shot. He thinks he was exposed the day before he got his shot, and had to deal with that (and his family also all got sick) for a couple weeks. He’s doing OK now.

There is a specific test that can determine whether someone is affected by VIPIT which is recommended if someone experiences clot symptoms or other specific symptoms after an AZ shot. The causes AND the treatment regimens are entirely different. The treatments usually used for clots actually make VIPIT worse and probably contributed to the initial high death rate.

[],,FiammaDiAgnesi,,,[],,,,text,t2_4ev9ttvc,False,False,[],"So I haven’t seen the claim that you’re responding to, since the post got removed, but I want to address your question about excess mortality. Excess mortality is calculated using averages over the past few years for a given day, week, or month that serve as an estimate of how many people we would expect to have died on the corresponding day/week/month in the present. Excess mortality is calculated by subtracting this number from the actual mortality over the timespan: if it’s positive, more people died than expected, if it’s negative, then fewer died. 

So, the thing to note about that is that changes to mortality rates aren’t just influenced by covid deaths: they’re also affected by changes to other causes of death. These have the ability to be affected by behavioral changes brought on by the pandemic. Earlier in the pandemic, I heard that deaths from vehicular accidents were down, and I’d imagine that deaths from other infectious diseases have also decreased as a side effect from mask wearing. 

So, TLDR, if the number of covid deaths ever drops below the amount of people alive due to lifestyle changes (assuming this is a positive number), then it’s entirely plausible that it could even out to no excess mortality. Whether or not this actually happened for March is a lot more suspect, but you would need to dig into the data to find out.

1. The vaccine has less impact on people's health than the disease, so even if we just avoid people being stuck at home sick for a week, it is a win.
2. More importantly, a partially vaccinated population puts selection pressure on the virus to mutate so that it can overcome the protection given by the vaccine.  If people under 60 get the vaccine, it will stamp out the virus before it has time to mutate.  If people under 60 do not get the vaccine, the virus could mutate and infect the vaccinated elderly, leaving us back where we where in March 2020.

These wild viruses or bacteria are attenuated, or weakened, in a laboratory, usually by repeated culturing. For example, the measles virus used as a vaccine today was isolated from a child with measles disease in 1954.

There was a study on blood donors there in October of 2020 that estimated that around 76% of its residents had gotten the virus. That’s above most thresholds that we have for herd immunity. Nevertheless, they had a huge wave in January that never should have been able to happen. Notably, most cases in this second wave came from the variant. Sabino and Buss wrote a nice article about it in Lancet, if you want evidence from a medical journal. 

They do bring up several potential alternatives explanations. A) It’s possible that the size of the first wave was overestimated, and so a smaller population had immunity than they supposed. B) We don’t know how long immunity lasts - maybe by January, many people who had caught covid early on were no longer immune. C) The variants might be more transmissible than base covid to the extent that the herd immunity threshold would need to be revised significantly upwards. 

I do agree that I probably overgeneralized: they’ve done a few studies that have shown that getting base covid protects you, at least to an extent, from some variants like B117.

When I google this/talk to people it seems like most people say - yes, they can. For example, the whitehouse and CDC still recommends vaccinated people wear masks and social distance.

This really challenges my preconceived notions of how vaccines work and their purpose. I was taught in school that you get a vaccine to protect those who are too old/young/sick to get one themselves.

Vaccination and herd immunity: what more do we know?

However, there have been some recent conceptual developments in vaccine 'herd immunity' or 'herd protection' that address the complexities of imperfect immunity, heterogeneous populations, nonrandom vaccine uptake and 'freeloaders'. Some vaccines may provide better protection than others; for instance, meningococcal conjugate vaccines are superior to polysaccharide vaccines, as is true of pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines. **Achieving a very high uptake rate should be the target for certain vaccines, for example, measles vaccine, in order to prevent the disease effectively**. Emerging issues, for example, waning of immunity after pertussis vaccination, are fresh challenges.

&amp;#x200B;

we have herd immunity for measles.

and

we have anti-vaxxers

therefore

we have measles outbreaks.

Those 65 and older were included in the first tier because they make up about 70% of the deaths.

However, those 50-64 - who are 20% of CA C19 deaths - were the last tier before it was opened up to everyone.

What's the science behind the decision to make millions of people at high ICU risk wait behind millions of people at lower ICU risk?

Are there any studies you can point to that would back up your decision?

-----
To put it another way:

- If you make 1 million people aged 18-29 wait 1 month for doses, a certain number of them will die waiting. Call that number ""LOW"".
- Now, do the same calculation but with those aged 50-64. Call that number ""HIGH"".

Isn't ""HIGH"" higher than ""LOW""?

(Note that those 50-64 are 20% of CA C19 deaths, while those 18-29 are 0.5% of CA C19 deaths.)

You'll frequently hear that young/healthy ""essential workers"" are at ""high risk"", but there are different risks. They're at high infection risk, but they're at low ICU/death risk.

Some also say the goal of vaxing young/healthy before seniors/high risk was to limit the ""spread"". Yet, now that we have doses, the real danger of the spread is who it's spread to. If it's spread to someone young/healthy, they might not even notice getting C19. If it's spread to a senior, they might die. Vaxing by ICU risk would make worries about the spread less of an issue.

Some also say it was OK to make seniors wait for doses because they can continue to take precautions.

The new simulations suggest that glycans act as a dynamic shield on the spike protein. They liken them to windshield wipers on a car. Rather than being fixed in space, those glycans sweep back and forth to protect more of the protein surface than initially meets the eye.

But just as wipers miss spots on a windshield that lie beyond their tips, glycans also miss spots of the protein just beyond their reach. It’s those spots that the researchers suggest might be prime targets on the spike protein that are especially promising for the design of future vaccines and therapeutic antibodies.

This same approach can now be applied to identifying weak spots in the coronavirus’s armor. It also may help researchers understand more fully the implications of newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

I work in child support and there has been some qualitative research (Kathryn Edin is the best source) about why parents with low incomes have children when they can’t afford them, and I think that question can be applied to pandemic parents as well. Why bring a child into a shitty world as it’s collapsing? The findings from research suggest parents have children for similar reasons, regardless of income or other environmental factors: to bring meaning to their lives, to give them motivation to be better people, to pass on their heritage, to leave their mark on the world. Those are all very compelling reasons(but they are also pretty selfish considering the environmental impact of having children alone). To add, there are people who view having children as a moral obligation because they see raising a child as an act of selflessness. They’ve transformed the sacrifices, frustration, and hardship of child rearing into a virtue. My sister is one of these people and she views childless adults as morally deficient; her reasoning is that these adults are too lazy and selfish to give all they have to a child (cue eyeroll).

That... is not how herd immunity works friend. Unless your 60+ population is entirely segregated from the rest of your population, we're all part of the same herd. 

The concept of herd immunity is that enough people are immune to the virus so the virus cannot spread in that population. Herd immunity effectively lowers the R value of the virus to the point where it will just burn itself out, instead of spreading around between us. 

Think of it this way, if you have a vaccine that's 80% effective at preventing infection from a disease, but you're in a population that isn't vaccinated and that disease is raging, you have a 1 in 5 chance of catching it.

BUT if you you ALL have a vaccine that is 80% effective in preventing infection, even if someone with that disease comes into your population, it won't be able to spread because of your herd immunity, so your chance of catching the virus is almost 0, because you'll never run into someone with the virus.

Herd immunity is exactly that, your HERD being immune from infection because you have reduced the ability for the virus to transmit within that herd. You cannot claim herd immunity on a subset of your population, that just doesn't work.",,,1620326544,{},gx6jypo,False,t3_n64rnw,False,False,t1_gx5kozh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n64rnw/covid19_herd_immunity_is_a_difficult_target/gx6jypo/,1620376267,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;So a few days back we published a preprint from our lab that N440K variant (also known as B.1.36) has more infectious fitness than its parent lineage A2a ( also known as D614G mutant or B.1.1.8) and an unrelated A3i variant (aka B.6). We have also suggested that based on the sequence information on GISAID till April 24th 2021, the proportion of N440K variants are increasing, clustering in some regions more than the others. Nowhere in the study it's been said that the N440K virus is the deadliest. Nowhere in the study it's been said that it is definitive cause of second wave happening in India, and nowhere in the study it's been said that #N440K is more dangerous than #UK strain or #DoubleMutant  
&gt;  
&gt;**Totally agree with the fact that UK and double mutant will ultimately take over N440K at their current rate of spread, and no need to panic about N440K** being more 'deadly' Being more infectious and being lethal are two totally different things.  
&gt;  
&gt;Infectivity of a strain depends upon many factors which involves how efficiently it can enter the host, how fast it can use host machinery to replicate and make new virus particles and how efficiently it can escape the immune response from the host  
&gt;  
&gt;We did not compare the infective titer of N440K with UK or double mutant in this study. We compared it with its parent strain which did not have N440K mutation and with another strain which is now almost lost among the population. And we found that N440K is 10 times more infective than A2a and about 1000 times more infective than A3i. The comparison between UK and double mutant is yet to be done...and all these are in cell culture models.  
&gt;  
&gt;But with the sequencing shortage from Indian subcontinent and lack of clear patient data and history among this pandemic, it will be challenging to perform a clinical study.... difficult but not impossible!  
&gt;  
&gt;Therefore my sincere request to media and other people with high reach, please go through the data properly and kindly do not misinterpret the findings.

Based on UK stats, more people from younger age groups have had blood clots than from age groups 50+ despite younger groups not being vaccinated in huge numbers as of yet.   


It's not incredibly rare. It's fairly rare but the data is incomplete and the occurrence rate increases as the age decreases.  2 weeks ago, UK data suggested that the risk was 1 in 125 000 (ignoring the age of vaccinated people). As of April 28, the numbers lowered to 1 in 93 000 (as the age of vaccinated people starts to get lower). It is possible that it'll get even lower than that as we go move towards the lower age groups. It's also important to note that there could be potential lag in reporting problems as blood clots can show up as late as 20-25 days after the vaccine was given.   


Personal circumstances shouldn't be ignored either  as they do change risk/benefits ratio significantly. A healthy 31 year from a low risk area old, who works from home and can continue to do so and is willing to wait 1 or 2 months for another vaccine is better off waiting as the risk of catching covid-19 and getting hospitalized with it is lower than if they shared a house with other people and worked at a shop. And lower risk of catching covid-19 and getting hospitalised with it means that blood clot risk may be far greater for their personal circumstances. But  a 19 year old in India may benefit greatly from getting AZ vaccine despite the risks associated as risks from Covid in their circumstances far outweigh the risk of blood clots.

These measures were implemented and stated as fact based on modeling and laboratory studies that showed these interventions reduce transmission. 

We have laboratory studies and real world evidence that vaccines reduce transmission, but there still has to be this conversation around whether vaccinated people still transmit on a large scale.

This is contrary to what we know about vaccines and viruses in general. The vaccine trains the immune system to fight off the virus and if it doesn't spread in your body you can't shed it.

But there are other possibilities. Like the virus could get into your body in a place that your immune system can't fight it, like stuck in your mucous membranes or hair, and you could shed it that way. There is no evidence that this happens but is theoretically possible.

[There was a case in 2014](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/04/measles-outbreak-traced-fully-vaccinated-patient-first-time) where someone fully vaccinated against measles gave it to 4 other people, 2 of whom were vaccinated. They studied it and found that her vaccine defenses had waned somehow. But this was just one isolated case.

[There was a study in 2013](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/11/whooping-cough-vaccine-does-not-stop-spread-disease-lab-animals) that showed that animals vaccinated against the whooping cough could still transmit it to others.

You using examples of things that are sad and worrying (which I referenced in my original comment) does not prove me wrong. I agree with you that those things are sad and worrying. I'd also argue that the system we have in place to be able to transport people to ICU's where there are more space is an example of the failsafes we have in place to help manage a very hard-to-manage situation.

You seem to be under the impression I am making an argument in regards to lockdowns which is... Odd, being that I haven't made that argument. 

Again, this is a question of relativity. If you want to bring up a bunch of bad news, ignore the news everywhere else in the world, and pretend we live in a vacuum, then it's easy to conclude Canada is doing badly at managing the worst public health crisis of our lifetimes. But on a worldwide scale, ""ICU's in some provinces got really high and non COVID related surgeries had to be pushed"" is really not that bad compared to our peers who actually had *way* more people die of this virus, often did put their healthcare workers in the position of who lives or dies, and who are mostly much further away from the end of this nightmare due to being behind us in vaccinations.

To be clear since a lot of responders don't seem to be understanding this part, *I am not saying high ICU numbers and pushing off surgeries is not bad. It is bad. Pandemics are bad. This is a real pandemic. Bad things have happened and will happen.*

But as I mentioned in my first comment, relativity is a thing.

I will say that the perception of the country has changed much though, so you're not wrong that the PR messages aren't as polished as they used to be.

Two, we absolutely had to stabilize things here before we can begin aiding other countries in any effectual capacity. If the plane depressurizes, they always tell you to put your mask on first before trying to help others, because it's very easy to let your self slip into unconsciousness before you could help anyone else successfully. Same thing here, unfortunately because the citizens of the US were not willing to be responsible, we were honestly one holiday or large even away from a similar death spiral as India, and if we hadn't gotten a good handle on things before trying to help everyone else, things could have gotten bad enough to where logistics broke down, and no one would get the vaccines, they'd spoil in the freezers and production could potentially stop, and then there's would be three of the biggest manufacturers in the world out of commission.

1. Yeah wealthy people have a lot of money in unrealized capital gains. They also have a lot of money as raw income, that they use to invest which could also be taxed at a higher rate. And they make so much more money in capital gains than can be paid for from actual dollars then that is on them. It's not going to spiral the market out of control if they have to pay 10% more on capital gains. If they have to liquidate some assets to cover the taxes their total wealth still goes up significantly. Really, it will be ok. 
2. People will continue to invest in the US even if capital gains are taxed higher. And beyond that, this isn't what is keeping our economy going at all. How much better is the US b/c wealthy people and companies around the world buy up all our real estate as investment properties and invest in the stock market? Who benefits from this?
3. This alone lets me know you aren't a serious. It never worked, it wasn't even proposed as a serious economic theory but as a way to justify economic looting by the rich. In a closed system it doesn't work either b/c rich people have demonstrated they would rather live lavishly surrounded by people dying on the streets than ever give up any money for a greater societal good. It's not about internationalization, its about humans and incentives. Sure a strong economy is good for overall society.

&gt; To date 62.2% of its population is fully vaccinated

&gt; By April 12, 59% of the doses administered were Sinopharm vaccines and the rest were Covishield, a version of AstraZeneca Plc’s shot made under license in India.

&gt; Just under two thirds of [current cases] are either unvaccinated or have only had one dose, and the rest have had two doses, he said.

It doesn't specify how many of the cases had Sinopharm and how many AZ, so we don't know exact efficiencies for each vaccine, but we can roughly calculate the efficiency of that vaccine mix to the variants spreading in the Seychelles. If the vaccine didn't do anything, 62.2% of new cases would have been fully vaccinated, but it's about a third, or 33.3%, so efficiency is 1-0.333/0.622= 46%. 

It was reported that AstraZeneca has lower efficiency against the South African variant (most likely behind the Seychelles spread), and there's not much data on Sinopharm and variants. This is probably the main reason for the Seychelles spread. There's little information about who they vaccinated and who is getting sick now, but I'd expect there to be some effect of social mixing distributions: e.g. they may have vaccinated the elderly and the virus is not spreading among young adults.

Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J and Novavax, on the other hand, have had good results against the SA variant in both lab tests and real-life monitoring studies, so I don't expect this to be too relevant for the US/EU.",,,1620297829,{},gx4vwvk,False,t3_n61cu5,False,False,t1_gx4sr2l,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n61cu5/daily_discussion_thread_may_06_2021/gx4vwvk/,1620344272,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

If you are trying to target front line workers who are exposed to the public, it wouldn't be enough to just look at individual companies. You'd have to distinguish between somebody who is an office worker of some sort at a company, vs. a public facing role. 

Even if you are just going by companies, organizing that full list of what companies pay stubs are valid is going to be a huge pain. Think of how many small grocery stores and convenience stores there are around, for instance, each of which would have to be covered by this. If you just go with 'Lets cover the big companies employees', that's hugely unfair to small businesses and the people who work for them.   


Also, how easy is it to fake the pay stubs (if that is the route we went)? Especially if we are (necessarily) opening it up to employees of hundreds of different organizations.

Who is responsible for actually checking whether they are valid or not, and what kind of training are we going to give people to determine that? 

How do we organize said training for the presumably tens of thousands of people running vaccination sites across the country? 

How much time, effort, and money does that process waste, that could be going towards the vaccination effort, or other healthcare services? 

Do we just not bother checking, and let people blatantly cheat? Is that fair?

Da Nang is in central Vietnam while the rest are in the north.

The Hanoi cases are patients, family members, a medical staff, and people who have come into contact with previous cases at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, which has been put under lockdown after the frontline hospital for the Covid-19 fight became a coronavirus hotspot.

All the patients in Bac Ninh are also all linked to the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases. They are either patients there with other diseases, family members of patients at the hospital or people who have had contact with such people.

In Thai Binh, the patients got infected from taking care of family members at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases. They are now being treated at the Thai Binh Province General Hospital.

In Hung Yen, the two patients have come in contact with a coronavirus case at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases. They are being treated at the same hospital.

The Lang Son case is a 26-year-old woman who had received treatment at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases.

In Vinh Phuc, the patients aged 20-53 were associated with outbreaks at either a local health center or a karaoke parlor.

The Hai Duong case is a 32-year-old man who sought coronavirus tests after suffering from heavy coughing. He’s being treated at the Hai Duong Province Hospital for Tropical Diseases.

The Da Nang cases are two women, 25 and 56 years old, and a 61-year-old man.

The Quang Ngai case is a 26-year-old man linked to the outbreak at a bar in Da Nang.

Four imported cases were recorded in Thai Nguyen, Ha Tinh and Khanh Hoa.

Nationwide, Vietnam has recorded 120 Covid-19 community transmission cases since last week as a fourth coronavirus wave swept through the country.

The data does show that compared against the rest of the state (even more so when compared to the rest of the country), the Bay Area is doing leaps and bounds better than virtually any other decently populated region, particularly when you normalize for population.

Remember, SF Bay Area was the first place in the country to announce lockdowns.  SF declared a state of emergency before the first case was even confirmed within the city (so they could activate emergency planning offices and funding), the region and state secured early contracts for PPE, testing, and some of the first vaccine orders, opened multiple mass-vaccination sites, and yes, had a much higher masking and lockdown compliance rate than virtually anywhere else in the country.

The U.S. government will pay the companies $1.95 billion upon the receipt of the first 100 million doses, following FDA authorization or approval. The U.S. government also can acquire up to an additional 500 million doses.

Americans will receive the vaccine for free consistent with U.S. government’s commitment for free access for COVID-19 vaccines.

“We’ve been committed to making the impossible possible by working tirelessly to develop and produce in record time a safe and effective vaccine to help bring an end to this global health crisis,” said Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO. “We made the early decision to begin clinical work and large-scale manufacturing at our own risk to ensure that product would be available immediately if our clinical trials prove successful and an Emergency Use Authorization is granted. We are honored to be a part of this effort to provide Americans access to protection from this deadly virus.”

“Expanding Operation Warp Speed’s diverse portfolio by adding a vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech increases the odds that we will have a safe, effective vaccine as soon as the end of this year,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “Depending on success in clinical trials, today’s agreement will enable the delivery of approximately 100 million doses of this vaccine to the American people.”",,,1620316006,{},gx5ujnw,False,t3_n5o08z,False,True,t1_gx2elw3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n5o08z/us_backs_covid_vaccine_intellectual_property/gx5ujnw/,1620363094,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

What we know is what we did clinical trials on and that’s why we can say this vaccine has this value for efficacy. The 3 or 4 weeks for 2nd dose were determined based on some basic science that it was the fastest time to get a good response because we needed the trials to be as short as possible.

Going “off label” is a risk just because it wasn’t tested but that doesn’t mean it’s worse.

The U.S. plan would create “severe complications” for the production of vaccines, a German government spokeswoman said Thursday in an email. Without the incentive of profits from research and development spending, drugmakers might not move as aggressively to make vaccines in the future, the industry has argued.

Pharmaceutical stocks that had sunk on the news of the U.S. proposal rebounded on Merkel’s stance. Moderna Inc. was down 2.1% after falling as low as 12% earlier. CureVac NV fell 5.4%, an improvement from its earlier 13% decline.

The U.S., Germany and other countries will take up debate over the idea in the coming weeks via the World Trade Organization, pitting the idea of sharing proprietary know-how against the need to boost global supplies, especially in developing countries that have struggled to get their populations inoculated.

Officials and diplomats in Brussels cautioned that such discussions will take months and will likely result in partial waivers only, as there’s little chance the EU and the U.S. will agree to cede intellectual property for the revolution of its mRNA technology with China. In any case, most poor countries in the world have neither the capacity nor the expertise to produce such advanced treatments. A more immediate solution to the problem, the officials said, would be for the U.S., the U.K and others to follow the EU’s lead and lift their effective restrictions on vaccine exports to those who need it.",,,1620320642,{},gx65n25,True,t3_n6c2br,False,True,t3_n6c2br,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6c2br/merkel_pushes_back_on_vaccine_patent_waiver_in/gx65n25/,1620368917,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Citation needed.  You might be confusing this with mandatory licensing in some cases.  But that is not the same as ""waving"" a patent. 

&gt;The Supreme Court has even ruled that the patent office is way over worked and may issue patents which shouldn’t have been issued in the first place.

Well, yeah - but those patents get invalidated by judicial proceedings with due process, not by president's say-so.   Besides,  there is no question here that patents would be invalid.  There has been real technological break-throughs here.

We haven’t had a chance to start vaccinating older kids yet now they are eligible, plus the success rate of one dose against variants is questionable. 

“However, the group of volunteers who had not been infected showed a much weaker immune response to the variants after one dose. The study showed that their level of neutralizing antibodies was 11- to 25-fold lower against the B. 1.1.7 variant compared with the original version of the virus, “resulting in the majority of individuals falling below the protective threshold.”

Companies spanning the globe, from Canada to Bangladesh, are ready to produce hundreds of millions of doses if provided with the know-how. But they are unable to start. Were the technology shared, those manufacturers could produce doses quickly, just as Moderna and Pfizer did last year. This would get more people vaccinated in more countries, and make fewer countries dependent on wealthy ones. Monopoly control over critical public-health technologies cannot be justified in a global emergency.

\&gt;We’ve got this production capacity and it’s not being put to use. If we had started this last year, we could have shipped millions of doses by now. This is supposed to be like a wartime effort, everyone in it together. But that doesn’t seem to be the case.”

Of course, be careful, but don't be too anxious about it. Plus, as far as I know, at least some of the vaccine manufacturers are working on boosters against variants (and since most variants show somewhat similar changes, one booster would likely be effective against several different variants at once). 

Another thing to remember is that the vaccine might not work as well against infection with the variants, but that has nothing to do with how well it protects against severe disease or death. This is determined by T-cell immunity, and the spots on the virus targeted by T cells are largely unchanged and generally take much longer to undergo significant changes.
