After a small outbreak at Christmas, people who went to visit family interstate at Xmas have been trapped in the other state and not allowed to return to their homes. Thousands of them. A woman was forced to have a miscarriage under tree because the cops wouldn't let her cross state lines to access medical care.

Sure, just stay in a hotel like a prisoner for two weeks when you return from overseas, cool and normal! Here in Australia we have tens of thousands of citizens stranded overseas who can't even get back to do so.

How about businesses? New outbreak... boom business shutdown overnight... sorry, stiff shit, you lose. Next time choose a better business idea.  Who the fuck is going to plan or open a business in this situation?

So no, people can't live and plan normal lives in these situations.

But sure, these measures have saved lives! More than the typical year in fact. Thousands of flu deaths have been prevented along with covid deaths! We've also saved a little on the annual car based carnage too (the leading cause of death for Australian children).

They tested me and said it's was probably something wrong with my blood. Very nonchalant about. I asked if it would be okay to go to work. They said sure, just go to the hospital if anything changes. I worked as a server at this point. 

Well I accidentally pinched my arm with a tray. It immediately turn in a blood blister and bruised. I got lucky that a coworker was two weeks away from graduating with her RN. She told me to go to the hospital. ER had tested me and found 5000 platelets at the time. So they admit me into the hospital.

THE VERY NEXT MORNING I get a call from the clinic panicking.

* Residents and staff of old age homes, mental health facilities, social shelters
* Age 60+
* Immuno-compromised: Transplant recipients, including bone marrow transplants, oncological patients during treatment

There is an added note to be flexible. For example, an elderly man and his careworker should both be immunized.

Second tier (from highest priority to lowest within the tier):

* Additional at-risk groups: Diabetics, morbid obesity, lung disease, hypertension, hematological patients, etc. (don't know what the etc. includes)
* High exposure populations: Teachers, prisoners and prison staff, first responders.

Third tier: 

* General population
* Pregnant women will be immunized if they want, and should be encouraged to if they have any high risk factors

No immunization:

* People recovering from COVID
* Anyone who has had a previous allergic reaction to any of the vaccine ingredients

Our industry is already short staffed in many chains and in many areas throughout the country. Depending on where we work we may have to fill hundreds of prescriptions, while giving COVID shots and other immunizations to people. 

Giving shots is no small task. We have to screen for safety and appropriateness. We have to run the paperwork through the computer system. Getting vaccines ready can take time, time away from us being able to do our actual job. I'd say each shot takes at least 10-15 minutes unless you have a clinic set up.

We don't have enough time in the day to give 40 shots and fill every prescription.

Most of us don't get to take breaks or even have a lunch, working 8-12 hr shifts. The COVID shots will have to be billed by the end of the day so we will likely be doing a lot of overtime, potentially not for pay.

So my point is, be nice to your pharmacy. We are about to get hit hard, and I don't believe we will be well reimbursed for all of this effort.

How many people are staying home voluntarily if the government is saying ""Look, there are 10 cases in your city, so we shut it down for 2 weeks""?

And the answer is: Nearly no one. Because people don't understand exponential growth.

Now I hear things like ""I am tired of this pandemic"". Yes, I am also tired of it. But what can we do now? It's like saying ""I am tired of drowning in this lake, so I stop drowning"". It doesn't work like this. If countries like Canada or the US lift their measures, then it will take about four weeks until there will be an even bigger disaster. See, the current death rates are under the assumption, that there is a working healthcare system and that we try minimize contacts.

If that's not the case, then both, the number of infected people and the death rate will increase significantly. Because once the healthcare system is over capacity, sick people can't get treatment. And if the virus spreads exponentially, then you might catch a higher load of pathogens (or even multiple loads of the virus).

Indeed so:

&gt; On a population level, an entire city experiencing an epidemic could produce staggering amounts of virus aerosols, yielding something not unlike the medieval concept of infective miasma. It has been suggested that this mass of infective particles is responsible for the seasonality of influenza by using global convective currents in much the same way as the ventilation system of the Amoy Gardens housing complex used air currents. 

&gt; Originating in Asia during the winter, aerosol particles may be conveyed into the upper atmosphere by frequently forming cyclogenic systems. Here, the low temperature and relative humidity of the upper atmosphere may enhance long-term survival of viral particles, allowing them to be picked up by a westerly air current and transported to North America within the span of a few weeks. Once over the North American continent, they are forced lower by frequent cold fronts.

The EMA has already approved two vaccines, that of Pfizer / BioNTech and that of [Moderna](https://businessam.be/europese-farmawaakhond-keurt-moderna-vaccin-goed/) . Two others, those from AstraZeneca and Janssen Pharma, are in the pipeline in the short term.

Some time ago it was sounded that there was not enough data to quickly approve the injections of AstraZeneca, but it now appears to be making progress. 'At the end of December and this week, we received a new set of data with answers to a few questions,' says Wathion. ""If those answers are satisfactory, we can move on to the next phase in the coming days and if no further problems arise, we will only need a few more weeks for preliminary market approval.""

The process took three weeks for the Pfizer vaccine and a little longer for the Moderna vaccine. The UK has already authorized AstraZeneca to market its vaccine in the UK.

## Rolling review

The vaccine from Janssen Pharmaceutica and its American partner Johnson &amp; Johnson is currently in the so-called *rolling review* , where the data from the clinical studies will be reviewed immediately after the study has ended. CEO Paul Stoffels has already told various media that the tests will be completed by the end of January, but it will then have to wait a while for approval, according to Wathion. ""I don't want to put a date on it, but it will be a while before we can start the next step there.""

&gt;  
&gt;The Rev. Derek Allen said the wave began the first week of December, during a post-Thanksgiving coronavirus surge that sent infections skyrocketing across the country.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Right now, people are coming off of. So, people are getting better,” he said. “We have a few members in the hospital and talked to one just yesterday who’s coming home. And we have another who’s hoping to come home in the next few days.”  
&gt;  
&gt;It was not the first time COVID-19 has intruded on the church. Allen said like all churches, his has struggled to navigate the pandemic, which has impacted parishioners and staff, alike. He said a few church members have died from the virus.

&gt;Among employees, Allen said, it’s easier to count who hasn’t had the disease. All but five of the 19 staff members have been sick at one point. Allen said, he himself, had a mild case in November.  
&gt;  
&gt;Allen said that over the summer, 10 employees had the disease at roughly the same time, making virtually shutting the church down. The church has about 130 people in its music ministry. At one point, he said, the leader of that ministry went on vacation and lined up someone to assume his duties. That person contracted the virus. A backup person had to quarantine because of exposure to someone who had been infected. And a third person, Allen said, got a stomach virus.  
&gt;  
&gt;Like all Alabama churches, the congregation shut down in the early days of the pandemic, offering services exclusively online. Since then, Allen said, the church has offered a mix of in-person and online services and has considered whether to shut down live worship services, altogether.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We have debated shutting down, not shutting down; being wide open, shutting some services down or some aspects down,” he said. “And so, we gave thought to all of it. At the end of the day, what we’ve decided especially most recently is that we’re just going to stick as closely as possible to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Allen said churches are no different than other parts of society when it comes to vulnerability to the virus.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Part of our calculation is that we see the rest of the community is not shut down in any real way,” he said. “And so it’s not a question of whether our people are going to get COVID or not. It’s a question of, are they going to be able to come to church or not?”  
&gt;  
&gt;Allen said he had only been in his position for about four months when the pandemic hit, forcing him to make hard decisions before he even had sufficiently gotten to know his congregation.  
&gt;  
&gt;That’s not to say the church has done nothing, though. Allen said a home school group that normally meets at the church has not done so since he pandemic. He said the church has invested in new video equipment to beef up its online program.  
&gt;  
&gt;In October, church members spent 2½ hours removing all of the pews and replacing them with chairs so that it is easier to spread people out. Instead of a packed house of 400 to 500 people, services now are limited to about 225.  
&gt;  
&gt;But often enforced occupancy limits have not been necessary, Allen said, because many people have stayed away. He said the church was “like a ghost town” during period just before Thanksgiving and Christmas.  
&gt;  
&gt;“This is the first time as a pastor, I’ve said, ‘I hope a lot of people don’t come to church,’” he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Allen said it has been difficult tending to his congregation. Hospital visitation restrictions have prevented him from meeting with ill parishioners. He said he has conducted funerals with restricted numbers of mourners and even has livestreamed those proceedings.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We estimate as a staff that last year, 2020, we were able to do about 30 percent of what we would have done in a normal year even counting the virtual things we were doing and that kind of thing,” he said. “And that just has an impact, spiritually, emotionally, mentally, on our people they count on gathering together with one another.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Talking with fellow pastors, Allen says he believes his church’s experience has been typical. There is no playbook for the pandemic.

Countries who caught it early and had some inherent advantages and managed to not make any mistakes in implementation did manage to control it. Those who were too late had basically no good options at their disposal. We both agree the response wasn’t early enough. It it is early enough, you don’t even need to lock down (for example Taiwan) success stories like NZ are a fuckup compared to Taiwan because they are late, they had to lock down to fix it. But once it truly gets roots, then even lockdowns won’t fix it. Or they will have to be so severe, or so long, or a combination of the two, that they will cause more harm than good (see Canada for example)

I am not certain that if countries like Canada or the US lifted their top down measures, that there would be an even bigger disaster.

Sweden has relied on mainly voluntary compliance, and although compliance was much much lower than in Canada and US in terms of masking and social distancing (staying home), their results were significantly better overall:
Excess deaths of all causes:
USA: 16.83 pct
Canada: 9.36 pct
Sweden: 5.61 pct

My guess is that it is because there are fewer serious unintended consequences if you rely on voluntary measures. This shows in the data too. Both US and Canada, which have quite similar top down approaches, although Canada dragged their feet on masks.

2. Rip water apart with electricity to make O2 and H2 (and some other stuff like O3 Ozone). The oxygen is made at the positive anode and you can let it stratify to get pure O2 without much/any O3 (you can also artificially decompose the O3 with UV Light).

There are other methods that try to absorb Nitrogen and filter CO2 from compressed air to make oxygen rich air that would be suitable for therapy, but they aren't making pure O2. It's probably the lowest tech way, but not the cheapest to run and has volume limitations.

&gt;The public health order issued on Tuesday night could result in patients being shipped to northern California from southern California and the agricultural San Joaquin Valley, where 14 counties were immediately ordered to delay non-essential “and non-life threatening” surgeries in order to provide beds. The order, which will last at least three weeks, also applies to any county where ICU capacity to treat Covid-19 patients is bottoming out.

&gt;”If we continue to see an alarming increase of Covid-19 patient admissions at hospitals statewide, some facilities may not be able to provide the critical and necessary care Californians need, whether those patients have Covid-19 or another medical condition,” said Dr Tomas J Aragon, the state’s public health officer.

First: there is a 30% chance I receive a placebo.

I don’t want to be guessing on whether I’m vaccinated or not. Would I have to choose between not knowing if I’m safe or having to mix Moderna and Novavax?

Secondly: I’m reading about the new South African strain (not to be confused w the British strain) which actually possesses a change to the SPIKE PROTEIN itself! This is scary to me because the Novavax vaccine targets the spike protein, and I’m speculating that it will not be effective against this mutated coronavirus. I have no idea how the mRNA vaccines of Pfizer/Moderna will react to this new strain either, but it seems the Novavax one will be the least likely to be effective. Can anyone help me?

The article you linked only discusses healthcare workers who got sick in January which supports the official stances of the Chinese government. It's unfortunate but with a novel virus it's reasonable to take a couple of days or weeks to evaluate transmission. Especially when a virus has a long incubation period and a/presymptomatic transmission. In hindsight everything seems so obvious but it still appears that no one knew what they were dealing with in December and January.

Also ""knew"" is a bit strong even into April there was debate about how transmissable covid19 really was. I assume that it was difficult to see the pattern of HTH with few identified cases and the long incubation period and inconsistent pathology. Covid19 is a unique infection among known Coronaviruses. 

&gt;There have been reports that officials may have noticed it as early as October but had the matter buried at that time. 

The only thing I've seen that speculates October as the beginning of identification is the released photos of hospitals in Wuhan taken by American spy planes. I don't trust those photos because on of the hospital parking lots is clearly under construction in one of the comparison photos but is still treated as evidence of the increased traffic.

This issue is address in the article I posted, and here's another one that specifically talks about [sterilizing immunity in covid](https://www.verywellhealth.com/covid-19-vaccines-and-sterilizing-immunity-5092148). 

"" As game-changing as the Pfizer vaccine (and Moderna's equally effective mRNA-1273 vaccine) may be in affording protection against the [COVID-19 illness](https://www.verywellhealth.com/covid-19-signs-symptoms-and-complications-5082890), the results do not reflect complete ""sterilizing immunity.""

This is the type of immunity that completely prevents a disease-causing pathogen like COVID-19 from establishing an infection. Sterilizing immunity differs from [effective immunity](https://www.verywellhealth.com/effective-immunity-and-the-covid-19-vaccines-5093205) in that the latter can prevent illness but still lead to [asymptomatic infection](https://www.verywellhealth.com/types-of-white-blood-cells-and-immunity-2252553).""

I'm not anti vaccination and will take the covid vaccine. But it's dangerous to spread inaccurate information. We don't know (yet) if the covid vaccine provides sterilizing immunity. 

Here's another section of the original article that talks about sterilizing immunity:

""While vaccines are known as one of medicine’s most valuable tools, their function is more complicated than people often realize... One key to these successes is that these vaccines provide sterilizing immunity — recipients are not infected by the viruses that cause the diseases and don’t pass it on. 

**But smallpox and polio aren’t typical. More often**, **vaccines do not perfectly protect recipients from getting infected and transmitting the pathogen.** With flu, for instance, the virus can invade the cells of some vaccine recipients, reproduce inside them without causing any symptoms, and then go on to infect other people who can get sick or even die. Instead of severing chains of transmission, **vaccinated individuals can serve as links in the chain, bringing the pathogen to vulnerable hosts who haven’t been vaccinated. This scenario is common among respiratory diseases like COVID**, since it’s easy for pathogens to invade our respiratory tracts and reproduce there before triggering a major immune response. 

**If vaccines do not achieve sterilizing immunity, experts say it’s likely that the virus will continue circulating and we won’t see an abrupt end to the pandemic, even when a big majority of people have access to a vaccine and they agree to take it.""**",,,1609988444,{},gids96x,False,t3_krqgol,False,True,t1_gic7j7b,/r/Coronavirus/comments/krqgol/immunity_to_the_coronavirus_may_last_years_new/gids96x/,1610015342,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; Well, we’ll se if Sweden can run past France too, their trajectory just might make it if it keeps up. They have maximum 15% with antibodies in Stockholm...lots to go on before it stops, and it’s spreading elsewhere in the country too now.

New Zeeland has it's peak season July-October, and the reason I said starting in March is that for the last few years has been earlier than usual. 

&gt; Public Health Physician Sarah Jefferies says GP consultations for flu-like illness increased to seasonal levels at the end of May, peaked late in June and then declined to below the baseline level at the end of July. 

 

&gt; Dr Jefferies says the pattern of flu in New Zealand was similar to Australia, which had an early start to the influenza season after higher than usual activity at the start of the year, and with declining numbers following a peak in July.

I get your point that measures should be stricter if necessary, but considering staying home and wearing a mask are pretty much yes/no and we are still at base point since people will still not follow them, I doubt they will follow stricter rules unless heavily enforced.

I've read from multiple sources but yeah, makes sense and I was referring on how long it will take to release the new vaccine overall, since they already have the main component.

My point is that if canada is flooded with the new virus and have 40/100 vaccines, they can just sell them to mexico that has the previous virus if the vaccine is proved ineffective against that strain.

Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is set to declare a state of emergency in the Tokyo metropolitan area on Thursday evening, authorizing more robust measures to fight a recent surge in coronavirus infections.

The emergency declaration, which will be effective from Friday to Feb 7, will entail asking residents to stay home and calls for restaurants and bars to stop serving alcohol by 7 p.m. and close by 8 p.m. Gyms, department stores and entertainment facilities will also be subject to the shorter hours.

The move comes as officials said Tokyo saw more than 2,000 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, eclipsing the previous day's record by more than 400 and fanning concerns hospitals could soon become overwhelmed.

Residents of the area covered by the state of emergency -- Tokyo and adjacent Kanagawa, Chiba and Saitama prefectures -- will not be subject to a hard lockdown as some other countries have imposed.

The government will ask them to refrain from nonessential trips outside their home, especially after 8 p.m., according to a draft of a revision to the government's basic plan for dealing with the coronavirus obtained by Kyodo News.

Schools will remain open, unlike the nationwide closures during the previous state of emergency last spring. Firms will be encouraged to have enough employees work from home or stagger their shifts, with the goal of reducing the number of people in the office by 70 percent.

Large events are expected to be capped at 5,000 people or 50 percent of venue capacity, whichever threshold is reached first.

The government will offer up to 60,000 yen a day in financial support to each dining and drinking establishment that complies with its request to shorten business hours and ""name and shame"" those that do not, according to the basic plan.

An advisory panel of experts on infectious diseases and public health as well as economic and legal matters approved the government's plan for the state of emergency on Thursday.

Yasutoshi Nishimura, the minister in charge of the response to COVID-19, will explain the decision in the Diet before the government task force finalizes it later in the day, with Suga set to hold a press conference shortly afterward.

Coronavirus infections have been increasing nationwide, with the daily number of new cases topping 6,000 for the first time on Wednesday.

The Tokyo metropolitan area has been hardest hit, accounting for about half of all cases in the country in recent weeks.

Tokyo Gov Yuriko Koike has repeatedly called on the government to declare a state of emergency, warning that the health care system is on the brink of collapse. She had asked restaurants and bars to close by 10 p.m., but many have not complied and the outbreak has only worsened after the New Year holidays.

Other parts of the country are also seeing an increase in coronavirus cases, with Osaka and Aichi prefectures reporting 560 and 364 cases on Wednesday, both record highs.

Aichi Gov Hideaki Omura has said he will ask the government to add his prefecture to the area covered by the state of emergency if the worrying trend continues for several more days.

Legislation was enacted last year giving the government the authority to make the emergency declaration, which provides a legal basis for governors to ask residents to stay home and enables stronger steps to deal with outbreaks.

The steps include the requisition of medical supplies and food as well as expropriation of private land for emergency health facilities.

A state of emergency was previously declared in Tokyo and six other prefectures in early April last year during Japan's first wave of infections, and was expanded nationwide later that month. It was lifted in steps in May as coronavirus cases subsided.

Suga had been reluctant to repeat the move, hoping instead to strike a balance between curbing outbreaks and reviving the battered economy. But the prime minister has faced mounting pressure as his support ratings have plummeted in part due to public dissatisfaction with his COVID-19 response.

A third wave of infections across the country, by far the largest yet, forced Suga last month to announce the suspension of his signature ""Go To Travel"" subsidy program for promoting domestic tourism.

The government has also halted new entries into Japan of nonresident foreign nationals due to concerns over new, potentially more infectious coronavirus variants discovered in Britain and South Africa.",,,1610021700,{},gif215v,True,t3_ksc3dr,False,True,t3_ksc3dr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ksc3dr/suga_to_declare_state_of_emergency_for_tokyo_3/gif215v/,1610044879,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I do believe that we all have been undercounting deaths, but I don’t think it has been malicious.  Especially during the first wave (which was terrible for my home in the U.K.) testing was very limited and Covid deaths were undercounted.  However, that is where excess deaths comes in and can’t be fudged.  I believe every excess death is due to Covid, even if the person died never had the virus.  Here in Britain, many people put off going to hospital when they were in the early stages of a heart attack thinking that it was something else and not wanting to put stress on the NHS, or not wanting to go to somewhere that they feared they might catch Covid.

SO CA is having hospital problems because they are a BIG states where the pandemic hit first AND they started with very average hospital capacity compared to other states. 

New York has 2.7 hospital beds per 1000. FL has 2.6, so it's actually a fairly big difference and disadvantage for CA.

&gt; The genetic sequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was published on January 11, 2020, and the rapid emergence of research and collaboration among scientists and biopharmaceutical manufacturers followed. Various methods are used for vaccine discovery and manufacturing. As of December 17, 2020, The New York Times Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker listed 63 vaccines in human trials, and at least 85 preclinical vaccines were under investigation in animals. [1]  A number of antiviral medications and immunotherapies are also under investigation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

&gt; On December 28, 2020, the National Institutes of Health announced the fifth phase 3 trial for COVID-19 vaccines in the United States has begun enrolling adult volunteers.

To his loved ones and patients, Miami Beach doctor Gregory Michael will be remembered as a “pure soul” and “gentle person” who enjoyed fishing and playing guitar.

**The 56-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist, who died Sunday about two weeks after he received a COVID-19 vaccine,** is said to have helped “grow Miami one baby at a time,” delivering hundreds of healthy children into the world.

“He almost felt like a TV doctor,” said Carmen Costomiris, a patient of 10 years whose son Michael delivered in 2013. “Everybody loved him.”

Michael ran his own private practice at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach for 12 years, according to his website. The Miami native also worked as a clinical instructor and faculty member for the physician assistant program at Barry University and Miami Dade College.

The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner’s Office is investigating Michael’s death in conjunction with the Florida Department of Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Pfizer, the manufacturer of the vaccine Michael received Dec. 18, said Michael died of a “highly unusual clinical case of severe thrombocytopenia, a condition that decreases the body’s ability to clot blood and stop internal bleeding.”**

“We are actively investigating this case, but we don’t believe at this time that there is any direct connection to the vaccine,” a company spokesman said in an email.

The Medical Examiner’s Office, which conducted an autopsy Tuesday, has not ruled out a connection to the vaccine, said Darren Caprara, director of operations at the county office.

“The cause of death is pending the completion of studies being done by the medical examiner and the Centers for Disease Control,” Caprara said in an email. “The case is still under investigation, so nothing has been finalized.”

In a statement issued Wednesday, Mount Sinai said it could not “confirm or deny any information about any patient.”

“Mount Sinai follows all protocols, guidelines and regulations from all governing agencies and strictly adheres to patient privacy laws and HIPAA guidelines,” the statement reads. “To the extent that we are aware of an incident involving any patient, the appropriate agencies are contacted immediately and have our full cooperation.”

### ‘HE WAS PRO VACCINE’

To Michael’s wife, Heidi Neckelmann, his death illustrates the risks — however unlikely — associated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

Neckelmann, who has not responded to requests for comment from the Miami Herald, penned an anguished [post on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/heidi.neckelmann/posts/10157817790183977) announcing her husband’s death and asking her friends to share the news widely, to make the public aware of possible side effects of the vaccine.

“He was a pro vaccine advocate that is why he got it himself,” Neckelmann wrote. “I believe that people should be aware that side effects can happen, that it is not good for everyone and in this case destroyed a beautiful life, a perfect family, and has affected so many people in the community.”

The post has been shared more than 20,000 times. An [online fundraising page](https://www.gofundme.com/f/dr-gregory-michael?member=7860460&amp;utm_source=twilio&amp;utm_medium=sms&amp;utm_campaign=contacts-v2-invite-to-donate) set up on Neckelmann’s behalf has so far raised over $20,000.

In her post, Neckelmann said Michael — whom she called “the love of my life” — was vaccinated at Mount Sinai on Dec. 18 and within three days he noticed bruising on his feet and hands, which prompted his hospitalization. Doctors at the hospital diagnosed him with Immune thrombocytopenia, or ITP, a [blood disorder caused by an immune reaction](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/idiopathic-thrombocytopenic-purpura), Neckelmann said. Michael died of a stroke after attempts to raise his platelet count were unsuccessful.

“He was a very healthy 56 year old, loved by everyone in the community, delivered hundreds of healthy babies and worked tireless through the pandemic,” Neckelmann wrote.

Researches have found evidence of an association between ITP and the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, according to a [2003 study published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1884189/#:~:text=The%20risk%20of%20ITP%20occurring,in%2025%20000%20vaccinated%20children.). It is an “uncommon condition” that rarely leads to health complications, the study says.

“The risk of ITP occurring within the 6 weeks after vaccination with MMR is significantly increased. However the attributable risk of ITP within 6 weeks after MMR vaccination remains low at 1 in 25,000 vaccinated children. Complications or long-term consequences of ITP in this age group are rare,” the researchers wrote.

### MORE THAN 5 MILLION HAVE BEEN VACCINATED IN U.S.

In a statement, a CDC spokeswoman said the agency is “aware of a reported death in Florida of an individual who received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine about two weeks before passing away.”

“Our thoughts are with the family during this heartbreaking time,” she said.

More than 5 million people have received COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. to date, the spokeswoman said. The CDC and Food and Drug Administration are tasked with reviewing COVID vaccine safety and presenting their findings to safety experts, who are then required to provide an “independent review,” she added.

“CDC will evaluate the situation as more information becomes available and provide timely updates on what is known and any necessary actions,” she said. “It’s been a difficult year as each of us grapple with a worldwide pandemic. Use of COVID-19 vaccines is the next step in our efforts to protect Americans and reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

The Pfizer spokesman said the company is “closely monitoring all adverse events in individuals receiving our vaccine.”

Rare earth metals, if prices tripled, would suddenly become economical to extract in places that currently are not economical.

Even something like an electric car has on the order of 10lbs of rare earth metals.  On the order of $50-200 raw price.  At maybe 20x price it would be noticable, but at 20x the price suddenly rare earth mines will be popping out of your asshole.  


Drinking water, similarly, is just not realistic to be a problem.  Water is difficult only insofar as it is a logistical headache.  Desalination is on the order of dollars per thousand gallons.  If bulk water price got to, say, $0.1c per gallon ($10/day for the average household) you would see pipelines springing up in any developed country experiencing scarcity.  


A single Keystone XL sized pipeline would carry approximately 10% of Toronto's water supply.  It would be on the order of billions to supply water to any major city within 1000km of the sea.  It sounds like a lot, but this is assuming no change in behaviour _and_ that the solution is built economically for profit.

The growth starts as a smooth exponential, and if you do nothing it will continue like that until you hit 50% of the herd immunity threshold, then it will start to resemble something more [sigmoidal](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259395938/figure/fig9/AS:341806387613697@1458504401241/Three-phases-of-growth-in-a-typical-sigmoidal-curve-A-sigmoidal-curve-solid-black-line.png) (not a true sigmoid, but this is a reddit post, not a thesis). However, for all intents and purposes, it's going to be what you illustrated: shockingly fast growth. 

However, when you enact restrictions, even our half-assed restrictions, the curves get very complicated. **Really what is happening all over is that various small communities/areas are separately building up immunity such that Rt\* = 1** ***under baseline restricted conditions*** **(i.e. general social distancing).** So with social distancing in place, you might hit Rt = 1 when only 20% of the population is immune. These surges are basically us hitting ""herd immunity"" under social distancing conditions. Of course if we relinquished social distancing, we'd need to gain a higher level of immunity to hit ""herd immunity"" under these new conditions.

So every community, town, neighborhood, etc... is getting ""hit"" one by one and experiencing these mini surges and then entering a state of pseudo herd immunity (i.e. linear growth). Then as the will of people to social distance breaks (or restrictions are lifted), a new percent immunity is required and you re-enter a state of exponential growth until that new state is reached.

So what we're really seeing is a breakdown of restrictions and the will of the people, which results in a slow bleed all across the country. Then, when you have a particularly sudden swing in will power/restrictions/level of interaction, the difference between your current level of immunity and required level of immunity is large and you'll experience sigmoidal growth until you reach the new ""required"" level of immunity. These events are also often exacerbated by high seeding events (i.e. super spreader events). This is what's happening in California. A change in conditions + a breakdown of the will of the people, combined with a low initial level of immunity meant that a surge would occur. 

In essence, the virus was given a lot of breathing room.

\*Rt is the reproductive value considering immunity and environmental conditions. R0 is the reproductive value considering only environmental conditions (assuming an immunologically naïve population).",,,1609977242,{},gid3xt3,False,t3_krdncc,False,True,t1_giagdma,/r/Coronavirus/comments/krdncc/human_disaster_unfolding_in_la_will_get_worse/gid3xt3/,1610002371,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I think this precisely describes the problem in North America and Europe. We are analyzing the pandemic from a cost-benefit perspective. We say things like *oh, an extra week will only SLIGHTLY reduce the number of infectious people entering a population* 

It makes a huge difference if that country has a high population density and if there is a lot of air conditioned environments in the community.  I feel like North America and Europe are marginalizing the longer term effects of *slightly* reducing the number of infected people entering our borders because we perceive we're safe because we live in countries with lower population densities. 

I think this Hannah Clapham person needs to quiet herself and let the health authorities in Hong Kong do their job protecting their citizens. Good on Hong Kong's public health for lengthening their quarantine period, despite all the complaining from travellers.

Latter could be a good indicator, but is also a lot harder to interpret. Who knows if 2020 would be a year where 87000 died in Sweden, or 92 000? What would the numbers have been in Finland? Norway? How many lives saved by reducing traffic, reducing other infectious diseases, alcohol related injuries etc, how many lost through mental illness-suicides/late Health care for other causes? It’s just deaths overall, and hard to know the number if covid and measures wasn’t thrown into the equation. 

As a parameter it is worth to discuss, but it is also a lot easier to use to obscure comparisons of direct covid deaths between countries.

Either way though you just need to get the most people vaccinated as fast as possible, but it would not really matter if we are immune or we all still get a watered down common cold like COVID19 infection. 

We could all still get it and spread it and over time those who didn't get vaccinated will be 'naturally selected' over a long enough period of time that it's not disruptive to society.. if that's how they want to go out.

The other big logistic problem and reason to not talk about herd immunity is that everybody is going to think once you get herd immunity.. BOOM your done and with coronavirus specifically USUALLY immunity wears off in 6-24 months. There is currently, ABSOLUTELY, no reason to think this is any different as a matter of a public policy. You can dream all you want, but as a matter of policy we have to assume the vaccines wear off unfortunately rapidly and we have to do the vaccination part all over again.

To me that puts a nail in the concept of what MOST people consider herd immunity.. as in you are like immune from the problem and don't have to worry about it at all. 

We should stop calling varying levels of immune resistance immunity, it's very confusing to use the world immunity to mean so many different things medically while also have it used in non-medical terminology to have synonyms like invulnerable.

No that means that you completely lose the factor of each countries inherent causes and patterns of deaths from diseases that may be more prevalent than other countries that you compare with. 
Prevalence of all the major risk factors for covid-19 death differs from each countries in Europe, for example Denmark have high rates of certain deadly cancers and alzheimer's disease by compared to thest of Nordics. 

South Korea has had [10-30% excess deaths in it's 85+ pop all year](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/excess-mortality-p-scores-by-age?tab=chart&amp;stackMode=absolute&amp;country=~KOR-3&amp;region=World) following it's rapidly aging population.

Using excess mortality every countries has a predictable baseline of mortality based on years of data.

So no I don't agree, I don't even understand what this means:

*For Sweden the count seem to resemble the excess death you would expect due to other causes of death decreasing as well.*

Monday afternoon I started developing a cough. I have a history of chronic coughs every year due to post-nasal drip caused by allergies. My doctor told me last year when my allergies flared up to take Claritin. I’ve been taking a daily Claritin every day since Monday and my cough seems to get better after it. I have no other symptoms. No fever, no loss of taste or smell. If it matters I’m also pregnant.  I plan to go get tested today just in case. Here’s my question: I work in a preschool. We haven’t had any known or suspected covid cases for months. I haven’t really participated in social events other than with partner’s immediate family (who we live with), and at times with my mom and masks are worn. I do go to the store occasionally but try my best to follow safety guidelines. To ease my mind, is it likely just my allergies flaring up? Should I be adamant with my job that I need to stay home until I get test results?",,,1610053709,{},gigur2g,False,t3_ks8o73,False,True,t3_ks8o73,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ks8o73/daily_discussion_thread_january_07_2021/gigur2g/,1610087253,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,porlos67,,,[],,,,text,t2_149fn6,False,False,[],"The forms and database are fairly straightforward and I'd think that the states would be willing to share the db structure and forms with each other.  Which means that the states that don't have forms either don't have the money/infrastructure/staff to implement the website, think they'll get around to doing something like this later on ""when it becomes necessary"", or they're planning on just ""letting the market handle it"".

""Letting the market handle it"" is obviously a *terrible* idea, at least from an ethics perspective.  I guess if you're rich political donor, it's a great idea.  The ones that aren't capable yet are probably hoping to get money from the feds to implement it.

Its the ones who are ""well, let's do that later, when we *really* need it"" that bother me.  They're looking at this as an implementation tool, but its an incredibly helpful planning tool as well.  It lets you know how many people in each area are interested in getting vaccinated, and how much risk there is to those people.  If there's a cluster of high-risk people close together, its easy to plan a vaccination day or five there.

You can play around with the numbers as well: If you know that you have a case of 1000 Pfizer vaccines headed to one location but there are only 900 high-priority people who live/work there, you can bring in other high-priority people who live near-*ish*, or rope in some of the slightly less high-priority people who might still be at above-average risk.  If you have spare doses that might go to waste, you can run the database and see who lives nearby and drop them a text: ""Please respond Y/N to this message: can you get to &lt;X&gt; by this-time today to be vaxxed?  Please note: if you don't respond to this message within 15 minutes, we'll give the slot to the next person on the list.""

And finally, setting up the database early means the instability that comes when everyone tries to sign up at once happens before you actually need the system.  You also have the ability to clean the data if necessary and to handle any issues that come up.  Then, when its finally time for the database to be put into use, its all nice and clean and stable, and not under a huge strain.

 Are you living just for yourself and only you? If so then don't consider the bigger picture and avoid risk that doesn't aid you! Ignore vaccines it's a risk you probable don't gain from. 
 Or are you you living for the community and the greater good?

 In my opinion vaccines are good and everyone who can, should have one. I'm not saying they don't have a one in a million chance of causing trouble but in the grand schemes of things including virus like mumps, measles, rubella, polio, vaccines are the way forward. Think about this, forgetting there used to be wards of people confined to iron lungs with polio (which is so close to be made non existence with vaccines)  when we didn't have measles vaccines women had to think about aborting pregnancies when an outbreak of measles occurred in a neighbouring area.    When have you recently heard of women discussing abortions because there are measles outbreaks in areas near or including themselves? Give me a year?

Yet our vaccination process has gone like this

1) Send vaccines to hospitals to vaccinate healthcare workers. About half of them refuse the vaccine, hospitals have tons of doses on their hands. People just sort of sit around not knowing what to do because they're not allowed to move to phase 1B. Also vaccinate IT staff.

2) Some states vaccinate people 75+, but availability in the community is still pretty low despite there being tons of vaccines distributed, again because they're sitting in hospital freezers.

3) Argue about which essential workers should go first for vaccines and prioritize 25 year olds with positions that are well represented by local unions over older Americans.

We've prioritized at least 50 million people so far ahead of the general public 65+. Getting it to these people is difficult and confusing, but failing to do so before it's available to lower priority groups now has political consequences.

It’s absurd.

Lockdowns slow the spread of the disease and less people are dying on net because of them. 

 While lockdowns do stop some people who would otherwise act normally, many people aren’t going to go out now during a pandemic.

People were staying home in the US before lockdowns were ordered.

* Our three youngest demographics are at records for their 7 day average for cases.  Our two eldest demographics are very close.  Terrible numbers in general as of late.  This suggests there's far more people heading to our hospitals in the coming days.

* There was a sharp decline in ER beds being used.  I strongly suspect it is a reporting issue which also makes me wonder if the ER visits were higher than reported.

* Here's a flashback.  Remember back in August nearly 200 doctors signed [an open letter to Cara Christ calling for her resignation](https://www.kold.com/2020/08/07/nearly-physicians-calling-dr-cara-christs-resignation/) because she wasn't following science?  Turns out the collective genius of 200 doctors was correct and here we are.

Everything is just a series of moment to moment instinct driven actions with many layers, as if their conscious mind is simply on a ride through a body roller coaster ride. There is no thinking or much higher brain function involved except in very fleeting moments when they are forced to.

I know this because I've been there before after a stint of sleep deprivation + substance use. It's fascinating going through an experience where you're brain chemistry regresses to a state of becoming instinct driven, where conscious thought stops being a thing and your mind is 100% satisfied by just handling the present moment. And also you're still high functioning thanks to what you're on, fully capable of being out in the world and wearing as many masks as I needed to fit in + look normal. Then finally after enough rest and sobering up, feeling like Ive gotten my rational mind back &amp; being able to reflect on just how different of a person I was in that moment.

The thing is, it felt nice the whole time and I didn't feel like I was struggling, tired, or suffering. Being an instinct driven animal is a ""feels good"" way to experience life. But it did make me realize that for people who are like this all the time, there quite genuinely is no reasoning that can work, no logic, no rationale. Because their brains simply do not work that way, they don't process information where ""thinking"" really enters the equation much at all. They're the kind of people that will play along with society only if they are forced to (either through law or serious social stigma that even their masks can't save) or if they directly benefit from it.

1. The short term side effects are not that bad. Mostly similar to the flu shot and rare cases of allergic reactions.
2. There was no realistic timeline to observe long term side effects. Long term side effects, if there were any, wouldn't arise for 5, 10, maybe 15 years. It's not realistic to wait that long. I can't depend on others getting the vaccine and protecting me through herd immunity.

Also, considering these are mRNA vaccines, I feel more at ease. mRNA degrades very easily (which is why they must be kept so cold), have no ability to mutate/infect and can't integrate into DNA. The trials were of high quality and massive in size. The risks with the vaccine were incredibly low. Meanwhile, the risk of getting infected with COVID19 is very high and while I would likely recover, the risk of death or long-term injury with infection was still much higher than anything that would happen with the vaccine. 

I got vaccinated last week. A bit of arm soreness for a day, but that was it.

What rationing oxygen means in this case is that us (hospital staff) and EMS are now doing is going by clinical presentation in regards to oxygenation for the most part. There's no magic number to really go by for ""oxygen saturation"". Sa02 and Pa02 are both looked at when trying to oxygenate patients adequately.  We look at clinical picture of the patient, things like work of breathing mostly. If the patients fail to improve on oxygen we increase the flow rate or try different modalities like high flow nasal oxygen or non-invasive ventilation (Bi-PAP machines) before intubating. There are different types of oxygenation we look at to determine how much is needed. In many Covid cases, a Sa02 reading of 83-88% may be fine if they're not short of breath. Is not ideal, but the patients are stable as evidenced by low arterial C02 and adequate arterial 02 and improvement of signs/symptoms. (For the record- Sa02 is the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin which is what transports oxygen molecules to the tissues and is usually what people refer to as ""oxygen saturation"". Pa02 is the amount of oxygen dissolved in arterial blood that could be readily available). That being said, it's a complicated issue. Current practice is allowing patients to remain with low oxygen readings as long as they are stable so this statement is mostly correct.  We need to ration resources at all levels right now. In EMS, pretty much everyone got at least some oxygen because it is a benign modality. The policy has been this way for years in Los Angeles but we've never needed to ration it before so it's just reinforcing existing policy. TLDR: we're allowing oxygen levels to be lower than normal if patients are stable. The quality and ways we're delivering it is the same. If they need more, they get more.",,,1609991172,{},gidxwgk,False,t3_krl503,False,True,t1_gicgx04,/r/Coronavirus/comments/krl503/as_the_coronavirus_rages_in_california_la_medics/gidxwgk/,1610018362,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The former refer to the virus itself. The latter refers to the disease the virus causes. It's just like the distinction between the HIV virus and the disease AIDS. 

The distinction between the two matters a LOT when it comes to HIV (since most people go for many years before they develop AIDS, if ever), but less so for COVID-19, especially since asymptomatic spread (not to be confused with pre-symptomatic spread) is considered incredibly rare or even nonexistent. 

Back to your pedantry: Since Chinese/Wuhan coronavirus predates COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2, I still don't think you can make a blanket claim. However, it's true practically speaking that, given the wide prevalence of COVID-19 and its synonymousness with the virus itself, likely almost everyone who says something along the lines of China virus is choosing to assert a value judgement instead of simply using the first label they heard.

And yet.. COVID-19 was a conscious value judgement in the opposite direction. Regardless of people's intentions when using that label, that is precisely what it is.

I only have first-hand knowledge of my own hospital/region in Canada, but even with only a moderate degree of outbreak we are very tight on nursing staff. Due to local nursing home outbreaks our hospital has taken over their management and floated in nurses from our wards/ER. As a result we've had to cut a lot of elective procedures, even ones that don't require admission (ex. Endoscopy), to free up those nurses to work in other settings.

We could have a second hospital magically appear next door and we wouldn't have the ability to care for twice the people.

Over Christmas our ICU was full with another 40% overflow into ER acute care beds. If the ICU nurses were solely responsible for all patients they would have been at worse than a 1:3 nurse to patient ratio, but instead ER nurses were occupied with the overflow patients and the ICU was at 1:2 which is still suboptimal for ICU. This lead to delayed care for ER patients, longer waits etc. I don't think anyone was harmed in a meaningful way due to effective triaging, but it is definitely suboptimal.

I share my experience just to anecdotally exemplify the challenge with staffing moreso than space. Certainly we can push ratios further through use of more PSWs/RPNs or other designations of ""lower trained"" HCWs under management of RNs and MDs, but this is not ideal and we all feel the strain when forced to do this.

I honestly don't know if I had the virus. It was a bit early for my allergy season but I took some of my store-brand antihistamine in case it was allergies. No testing was available in my area unless you had severe symptoms. I stayed home from work and rested.

My symptoms were kind of mild but persistent. They went away with a few days on antihistamines and ibuprofen. They persisted until I took the antihistamines. I chalked it up to early allergies at the time but thought it was weird because there was still lots of snow on the ground and most of my allergies are pollen-related.

Weird thing was, my daughter had a slight fever ~2 weeks after me. Nothing alarming...we were in lockdown and she hadn't left the house so I didn't think the virus. I gave her some ibuprofen and the fever went away in a day. Then, she developed these spot-like rashes all over her torso ~4 weeks after that 2-day fever. I was baffled at the time about what that was and I didn't connect it to the fever because the fever happened several weeks before (I know now that those rashes are often seen on kids with MIS-C). 

I went nuts thinking about what could cause those weird spot-like rashes (it almost looked like measles or something). I went through my house looking for evidence of mites, fleas, bed bugs...because those rashes just seemed to come from nowhere. I was baffled at the time bc there was no info at all about MIS-C.

Naturally acquired protection against polio generally results in loss of nerve function. Experts generally recommend against exposure to polio at all.

Because, as I've said elsewhere. With every single host that gets infected, the virus is acquiring changes. Most of them are insignificant, and lead nowhere, but they might make it on to another generation. Some of them might not even mean anything until hundreds of generations down there line, when suddenly, a random mutation in a host makes them useful. For instance, they might suddenly change the spike protein, which means that now our immune system can no longer recognize the old protein, which means everyone who was already infected can beer infected all over again, but even worse, since most of our vaccine effort relies on teaching or immune system to recognize that protein, that means that or vaccine efforts go completely in vain just like that and we need to start all over. What if that new spike protein closely resembles a normal protein our bodies need, like hrh1 (histamine) or oxytocin, involved in vasoconstriction and blood pressure regulation?

Thinking majority and minority is shortsighted. You should be thinking vulnerable/less vulnerable. I get your point and would love to be able to run in parallel simulations but with healthcare you have to try and stop people from dying as fast as possible.

I don't think we can count on that in America.

I think we've avoided NYC 2.0 in most places through things like general social distancing, WFH when possible, masks (some places, where people wear them), and voluntary measures being taken by many individuals. These are important. However, the rest of it seems to be sort of hogwash. If CA is any indication, putting off a surge in the summer just sets you up for a bigger one in the winter if you can't sustain the measures.

Again, the objective in the pandemic is to vaccinate as many people, as quickly, as possible. Nobody is saying we ignore marginalized groups forever.

&gt;  It would be great if there wasn't all the red tape but there is, and some of it is important like the ADA requirements.

Again, the **majority** of Americans do not need websites to meet ADA requirements. Help  the largest number of people in the shortest period of time. Keep that in mind. 

&gt;  Chad missing his appointment because he is hungover could result in expired vaccine.

Airlines deal with that problem with standby flying. 

&gt;  Or if a delivery of the vaccine is delayed/snow storm/power outage/car drove through the front door, etc. closes the office, they need to notify everyone scheduled so they don't show up.

How do you think airlines deal with this? Do the same thing. These are rare incidents that should not hold up the deployment of the common case. 

&gt;  If the government is in charge of the process, they would need to be in charge of the whole process. If Delta fucks up your seat, you complain to Delta.

[],,atealein,,,[],,,,text,t2_zj96m,False,False,[],"**Sweden looks set to move to an excess mortality rate of between 6,000 and 7,000 people by 2020.**

**- We have had a peak this spring where many died for a limited time and so now in November, December where we also see a peak.** **The rest of the year it has been at fairly normal levels, says Tomas Johansson, investigator at Statistics Sweden.**

The corona pandemic has hit Sweden and the world hard. Over the past five years, an average of 91,000 people have died each year. So far, Statistics Sweden, Statistics Sweden, has registered a little over 95,000 deaths, but the last Christmas week and the holidays are not yet fully reported.

\- But we have a pretty good grip. Based on the level we now see, we can expect to end up with around 97,000-98,000 deaths when all have been reported. In absolute numbers, 2020 will be a year among those with the highest number of deaths since 1749. Since then, we have had three years with more than 100,000 deaths, one during the 18th century (1773), one in the middle of the 19th century (1857) and so during the Spanish flu in 1918, says Tomas Johansson.

**Despite the high numbers, the** death toll **must** be put in relation to the number of inhabitants. Comparing Sweden in 1773 (2.0 million) or 1918 (5.8 million) with 2020 (10.4 million) is difficult.

\- If we take a long perspective, 2020 does not show a historically clear excess mortality, but it will be a gloomy notch in a time series. It becomes most clear if you look at some times during the year, but looking at the whole year, much of this has taken each other out.

Compared with the average over the past five years, the number of deaths has been around 91,000 in Sweden. If 2020 ends up at 97,000 to 98,000, there will be an excess mortality of 7 to 8 percent on an annual basis.

**Is that excess mortality clearly linked to covid-19?**

\- I think so. We have had a peak this spring where many died for a limited time and so now in November, December where we also see a peak. The rest of the year it has been at fairly normal levels, even sometimes lower than a normal year, says Tomas Johansson.

How hard the corona virus struck was clear at the end of the year when, for example, Gävleborg showed an excess mortality rate of over 50 percent during weeks 49 to 51. Together with Gävleborg, it is currently Skåne and Stockholm that stand out.

**During the year, Sweden commuted** between months with fewer deaths than average to very high excess mortality during April (38.4 percent) and May (24 percent). This is according to statistics from the EU statistical authority Eurostat, which is based on data for the years 2016-2020. How large the excess mortality will be in November and December has not yet been reported.

Several countries stand out as Italy, which had 48.9 per cent more deaths in March than in previous years, Spain with 78.9 per cent in April, Belgium with 72.8 per cent in the same month and the Czech Republic with 53.1 per cent when it was hit by it. second wave in October.

**The fact that so many more have died in** one go temporarily affects life expectancy. In a report from 2020, Statistics Sweden states that life expectancy has increased steadily in Sweden from 53.6 years for women and 50.8 years for men in 1900 to 84.7 years for women and 81.3 years for men in 2019. An average increase of one extra life years every four years.

But during the 2000s, the increase has slowed down to suddenly rise again between the years 2018 and 2019, much as a result of a mild flu season that required the lives of fewer elderly people. When the corona pandemic hit Sweden in 2020, life expectancy also appears to decrease from 84.7 years to 84.4 years for women and from 81.3 years to 80.8 years for men.

**The report runs until** August and does not take into account the second wave that hit Sweden during November and December.

\- Which is a lot, says Tomas Johansson. We end up back at the same average life expectancy as 2018 or possibly earlier depending on how the year ends. In Stockholm County, life expectancy appears to be declining by just over a full year.

\- On the other hand, 2019 was an abnormal year for another, so when we could see an unusually high average life expectancy increase, much thanks to a mild flu season.",,,1610026512,{},gif8mle,True,t3_ksdcs6,False,False,t3_ksdcs6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ksdcs6/sweden_on_its_way_to_7000_in_excess_mortality_in/gif8mle/,1610049765,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

However we still can't rely on immunity, global cases are far too low for anything close to herd immunity based on any data we have. 8 months isn't really that long either.

SO right back to where we were really. Immunity is still not something we can bet on or build policy around. There still more questions than answers really as to why some nations are do so much better than others even with far fewer resources. Some geographies or genetics seem to do better, but that could be a lack of modern understanding/modeling of pandemics too.

There's still very little chance the immunity is truly long lasting as in 10+ years, which means IF the virus stays in circulation much of the world may need to be re-vaccinated in X amount of months AND unfortunately mRNA vaccine immunity has to be studied completely separately from natural immunity. That's one benefit of traditional vaccines, they produce natural immune responses and the datasets are more likely to be similar and the mechanism is something nature has selected over time. Soo they use of weakened viral particles is not only the more tested vaccine model, it also produces an immune response that is in and of itself more natural and predictable.

One big question will be which vaccine model produces the longer lasting immunity. I don't expect it to last reliable more than 2 years and I'd average that guess to 12 months if I had to guess.. reliably though. 

Coronaviruses just don't produce long lasting immunity and that's the best long term data we have. Ideally we would have studied coronavirus better up to this point.

Now that we're almost a month into the global vaccination effort, I'm convinced that's the way to do it. The United States has distributed almost 20,000,000 vaccines and we've only used about 5,000,000. If we weren't being as strict about the priority system, we would probably have about 6% of the country vaccinated by now.

I really, really hope we start to see more states drop or loosen the priority system. It's just not working out the way we'd hoped and we need to switch to a system that's meeting expectations.

Edit: Some people have pointed out that Israel is only giving it by age right now, which is true, but the reason I referred to that as ignoring the categorical system is because it's so easy to verify age and to distribute broadly if that's the only category that I don't even consider it comparable to the current American system.",,,1610056770,{},gih1hhr,False,t3_ksbmer,False,True,t3_ksbmer,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ksbmer/covid_cases_rose_by_almost_a_quarter_over/gih1hhr/,1610090962,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

So their quarantine time is up, but problem didn't end there. The manager that governs stores in their area decided to up their nose here and ""investigate them"" said person if they truly were infected with covid-19. Saying ""suspicious"" that they got covid right before Christmas started to happen. Under HIPAA, protections the manager can't snoop up for information to get their birthday to see if they were planning a birthday vacation.

Controlling covid spread into the company is a TEAM EFFORT. If someone is sick and suspects to be sick you'd want them to tell us "" hey I might have covid."" What the area manager is doing is punishing people who have covid for having covid.

* We have temperature scan, this is completely useless, I did temperature check on said individual day prior before person started getting concerned of covid. They came out ""okay"", but the next day massive fever. Through the person's caring and their information they prevented spread in the store.

Do you want people to no report they have covid? Do you want covid to spread amongst the entire work force? Do you want our store to be a hot zone of covid?

Despite massive case spikes, not being essential (unless high end fashion is essential), we are literally throwing people out in the fray to make money.

While rare, it is entirely possible to get one kind of polio, recover (which is rare enough on its own), and get a different strain of polio later (for which the outcome is usually... Unfortunate). The polio vaccine protects against all three forms, so even if you already had polio, you STILL NEED to be vaccinated. Similarly, if you already got the first wave of COVID, you can still catch the new UK variant (due to both reduced antibodies and changed protein structure). The vaccine IS likely effective against both strains. Just because you got sick once doesn't necessarily mean you're in the clear. Not all viruses infer lifelong immunity, and even that that do, usually have more then one form. Implying that because your already got the virus means you're okay is stupid.

Pain at the injection site was the most frequent and severe solicited local reaction among vaccine recipients. After dose 1, the younger age group reported pain more frequently than the older age group (83.1% vs 71.1%); a similar pattern was observed after dose 2 (77.8% vs 66.1%).

&gt;The cumulative incidence of Covid-19 cases over time among placebo and vaccine recipients begins to diverge by 12 days after the first dose, 7 days after the estimated median viral incubation period of 5 days, indicating the early onset of a partially protective effect of immunization. The study was not designed to assess the efficacy of a single-dose regimen. Nevertheless, in the interval between the **first and second doses**, the observed vaccine efficacy against Covid-19 was **52%**, and in the first 7 days after dose 2, it was **91%**, reaching full efficacy against disease with onset at least 7 days after dose 2. Of the 10 cases of severe Covid-19 that were observed after the first dose, only 1 occurred in the vaccine group. This finding is consistent with overall high efficacy against all Covid-19 cases.

&amp;#x200B;

***Redwood City, CA – The Public Health Order for people to shelter-in-place safely in their homes will soon be extended until at least May 1.***

&amp;#x200B;

Public Health orders are issued by the respective Health Officers of each jurisdiction.  The Bay Area is fortunate to have a group of dedicated public health leaders who are working together to address the interconnectedness of our region.  We have said an extension might be expected as we work together to slow the spread of the COVID-19 disease. Additional details about the updated order will be available when it is finalized in the next day or two.

That's ahistorical.

2. The UK Variant.

People go with #2, not to assign blame but because they have no other choice because there are no other names available.

Edit:  
Homeopathy is the most popular form of alternative medicine in France. Its use rose from 16% of the population in 1982 to 29% in 1987 and 36% in 1992.[14] In a 2018 survey, 77% of French answered to have used homeopathic remedies at least once, 58% have used them ""several times"", and more than 40% have used homeopathy for over 10 years. Nevertheless, in July 2019 the French ministry of health announced to no longer reimburse homeopathic medicines starting from 2021 as they are deemed to ""not provide sufficient public health benefits"".[15]

Look, man, I've got a family and coworkers that depend on me.  I don't have time to keep debating these topics when the data is clear.


There has been no statistically significant increase in total deaths during the pandemic.  There has been no disproportionate increase in deaths in the elderly cohort during the pandemic.  Healthcare providers get paid more for Covid diagnoses.  PCR test Cycle Thresholds are cranked way up to generate positive results from RNA fragments and sample contaminants.


This information is out there, literally at one's fingertips, from reliable sources like John's Hopkins University, Snopes, and the WHO.  



You seem like a liberal leaning guy.  It's so crazy that you would put so much faith in mass media.  Relevant Noam Chomsky quote:


&gt;...the mass media. What are they? They're huge corporations, massive corporations, linked up with even bigger corporations. They sell audiences to other businesses, namely advertisers. So when you turn on the television set, CBS doesn't make any money. They make money from the advertisers. You're the product that they're selling, and the same is true of the daily newspaper.

&gt;The first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine has an estimated efficacy of 85% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66 to 93%) in preventing COVID-19 cases as compared with a placebo, between 11 and 21 days after vaccination. A strategy of using 100% of initial allotments immediately during the early stage of the vaccine rollout (January/February 2021) is more effective in preventing COVID-19 cases as compared with the initial strategy of reserving 50% of initial allotments as second booster doses.

&gt;Interpretation

&gt;Administering Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine during the early stage of the vaccine rollout (January/February 2021) to as many individuals as possible would decrease the overall number of COVID-19 cases in Ontario, as compared to reserving half of the initial allotments as second booster doses.

&gt;On-label use of the vaccine with the administration of two doses is important, as the second dose significantly boosts the immune response and results in a substantial increase in neutralizing antibodies. It may also be important in assuring the overall durability of the immune response. Using 100% of the initial allotments immediately to vaccinate as many individuals as possible does not preclude on-label use with two doses, with the second booster dose administered from a subsequent allotment as soon as it becomes available.

&gt;These conclusions also apply to Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine, which has a similar efficacy of the first dose.",,,1610046017,{},gigdlp3,True,t3_ksjxus,False,False,t3_ksjxus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ksjxus/rollout_strategy_covid19_vaccine_in_ontario/gigdlp3/,1610077136,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Absolutely. The difference is that a lot of doctors, nurses, or in general medical professionals state more or less public that the vaccine is not safe. And they get listened to because they are medical professionals.

And people believe them for this exact reason. It is essential to know that just because you're a doctor or nurse, you're not an expert on vaccines.

[],,cyranix,,,[],,,,text,t2_buoq5,False,False,[],"Agreed. I seem to be reminding a lot of people lately that the vaccines are NOT a magical shield that PREVENTS infection. The concept is that your body learns to recognize the infection and knows what to do with it before it is able to take hold and cause a problem -- that doesn't mean the virus can't still get into your body and replicate in a handful of cells before your immune system stops it. That doesn't mean you're not still spreading a few germs around before you fight it off either. Still, it does mean you're spreading LESS germs, and it hopefully means you're NOT taking up a hospital bed that your might have otherwise.

Even if the immunity inferred is measured in months... It's a big weapon. People being infectious for hours or a few days as opposed to a week is a huge difference. The concept that a person who gets exposed might not spread it to anyone overnight in the time it takes then to fight it off, as opposed to spreading it everywhere they go for 5-10 days is significantly better. If that's the best we get, that's still not bad, but it's important to remember this is still just our second volley against the virus (the first being hand washing and sanitizer). Our best defense so far has been wearing masks and social distancing. Vaccines have the chance to start beating the virus back. Alone, they're not enough to stop it, no. But they can start pushing it back... Better testing can help us set up better defenses against it, and continuing to combine all these things is what is going to stop it if it can be stopped...

Even 24 months isn't that good though and most vaccines we use on the public at large outperform that by a ton. Even a 2 year constant vaccination for life would be a ton more vaccination than most people get and it will be hard to keep them coming back.

My hope is that in the likely case this only lasts 12-24 months we can develop a longer lasting one, because even every 2-3 or 5 years will prove to be a big pain in the ass for a virus this infectious.

I got Covid back in march of 2020 and was just looking to see if anyone else is sharing the same issues as me and or can offer any help to me. Initially after contracting the disease, I was met with very moderate symptoms thankfully, but the worst thing to come from it was an immediate loss of all taste and smell which lasted about a month. As I began to regain my sense, I noticed everything had this absolutely awful taste and smell of something I can't describe as I have never experienced anything so foul before. This rotten smell and taste lasted for about 3 weeks and then I was able to start differentiating different smells and tastes. While I was able to start smelling and tasting things again, everything that I ate tasted unfamiliar as well as everything I smelled. Food I used to love became far less appetizing and any sort of candle or scent that I enjoyed was nothing like what I previously remember it being. I would wonder to myself if I was just imagining these differences and truly there was no change but something odd started to happen which seemed to prove that wrong. Every once in a while a weird thing would happen where for a split second a flavor would pop into my mouth or a smell into my nose that I recognize instantly, just for it to leave my mouth or nose just after noticing it. This has been going on for the past few months and every smell or taste is different but I can recognize all of them and exactly what it is immediately as it happens. All of these are scents or flavors that I would experience before having covid but would instantly disappear and return to what I am currently expecting it to taste or smell like.
