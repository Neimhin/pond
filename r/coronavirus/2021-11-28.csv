Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahhahahahaha. 

You've never dealt with a CBP officer in a bad mood then. They can absolutely detain you for any number of reasons as part of the legacy of the Patriot Act. They cannot deny you entry if you are a citizen(which is an international standard not an American one). But they absolutely can detain you. Try entering the US with 5kg of heroine in your luggage and then tell the CBP ""it is basically illegal to detain citizens for any reason."" Come on dude. I, and numerous of my friends, were detained upon reentry when ISIS was a thing because I have extensive travel history to Turkey and a few other countries. A few of my friends have even been to Iraq years before ISIS became a threat. They too got detained and questioned for hours upon reentry. Despite all of us being nearly as opposite to ISIS-supporters as you can get! You have no idea what it is like to go through such a process. One of my previous trips in London I was actually pulled aside prior to boarding and was told, very bluntly, that I had been ""randomly selected to go through enhanced security screening at the request of the United States government"" and proceeded to be strip searched and had all my belongings taken apart in front of me and tested for any number of things. I was then stopped when I arrived in back in America to go through that process again and questioned, over and over again, where I had been on my trip. So yes you can absolutely be detained as a citizen but that isn't the same as being denied entry into the country. Immigration officers in the USA have a great deal more power than you seem to realize.

As for quarantines, history has enough examples of quarantines being enforced in the USA that only someone who has researched it would say we don't quarantine individuals. We have the legal precedent to do so(Mary Mallon being one of the most infamous examples). But what we lack is willpower to enforce said rules. Some states are actively banning enforcing quarantines and other public health tools. It is appalling.  God help us if we get a truly lethal airborne virus with a high mortality rate as so many states have banned containment measures, we won't have any tools left to stop the next outbreak. I hate people saying ""we can't do this."" We absolutely *can* do this if people actually stood up and did their jobs. Plenty of other nations have more than adequately demonstrated you can quarantine people. The USA could very well do so as well! But so long as people have no willpower to do anything, I mean you cannot be surprised when nothing is done.",da8bb7b07607abfa567414473f8185a0000f2c78,True,False,,,,,0,1638172079,,0,{},hmiaszp,False,t3_r4olgy,False,True,t1_hmi0i7n,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r4olgy/us_does_not_impose_new_omicron_testing_for/hmiaszp/,1638172093,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

[],False,,Silly-Weakness,,,[],,,,text,t2_5o3c14ob,False,True,"It's ""very high risk"" precisely because we do not yet know whether or not it will compete with Delta. I'm sensing a misunderstanding about what it means for viruses to ""compete"", which is understandable given the way the word is used in other contexts.

If it does compete, that means antibodies for either variant are effective against the other, so being infected with one is likely to prevent infection with the other. In that scenario, whichever one is more effective at spreading may replace the other. If Omicron competes with Delta and is less likely to cause severe disease, that could be extremely good as it may end up out-competing Delta.

However, what if they don't compete? That would mean antibodies from one are not effective against the other and we could end up with 2 variants infecting communities simultaneously and/or consecutively. In that scenario, even if Omicron is less likely to cause severe disease, the total number of cases could skyrocket. That could lead to higher case loads for hospitals that are already at or near capacity. That would be extremely bad. 

The worst-case-scenario is that both Delta and Omicron are extremely dangerous and transmissible, that they do NOT compete, and that Omicron bypasses vaccines.

Right now, we just don't know enough, so the safe option is to treat it as if they do not compete and prepare for the worst while the scientists work.

Now there's actually more nuance than that as there are more than just a couple scenarios, but the point is that, right now, our best tool is to take the data we have and make projections, then prepare for any projections the data deems more likely and/or more dangerous. As we get more data, projections will improve.

[],False,,Cheburashka2019,,,[],,,,text,t2_452jqa52,False,False,"I think that's mostly wishful thinking at the moment. COVID becomes transmittable before a person is symptomatic, so the virus doesn't really have much evolutionary pressure to become less severe. 

So far it seems more young people can get affected by Omicron, which would mean higher percentages of people ending up in the hospital. Even if it is less severe, if more transmissible it will likely pack hospitals better than Delta, and that in itself will lead to deaths or a greatly reduced quality of life for many people (at least for some time). Furthermore it will likely put immense strain on the US insurance system, given the exorbitant cost of hospital stays.

Then there are the economic implications. Businesses have just started to bounce back in some places, but this will likely deter patrons, partly also due to the media hysteria. Winter time is also notoriously bad for viruses. Likely this will lead to more confusion around anticipating consumer demand, and screw up supply chains all over again (they are already terrible, not just for consumer goods, but also for companies in machine manufacturing, high tech, and other industries)

I also expect implications for vaccine hesitancy. The booster shot was not fun (for me), and I know people who support vaccination who have been hesitant to get it due to the awful side effects that can last days. The picture that is emerging is that we will need boosters every X months, and some people won't be willing to go a long with that. For many, they barely agreed to get 2 shots, now you'd be asking them to get one on a reoccurring basis. And yes, the virus is undoubtedly far worse than any reoccurring need for vaccination, however fatigue and mental trauma caused by this whole ordeal hasn't exactly made people think clearly. Couple with that the absolutely insane politics in the US, where one party (in a 2 party system) has effectively taken up the anti-vaccine mantle, and you have a recipe for disaster.

Does it make me furious that people don't want to take vaccines and believe in BS conspiracy theories? Yes - they are literally participating in killing off their fellow countryfolk through ignorance and stubbornness, also damaging the economy and causing economic impact that will be felt for many years to come. Furthermore, wealthy western nations need to do a lot more in terms of making the vaccine available globally, including opening up the patents, I think the CEOs of Pfiser and Moderna have enough billions by now to afford their nth yacht or mansion.",818a7af80e92e2be57d2b621092fb503f1dbb617,True,False,,,,,0,1638190482,,0,{},hmiy4dl,False,t3_r4uaiy,False,True,t3_r4uaiy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r4uaiy/new_ômicron_variant_could_infect_more_and_kill/hmiy4dl/,1638190499,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

Most other eu countries has no full travel bans. 

If you want to talk about the risks I would say having new cases being reported being generally above 30k new cases a day, for months is a massive risk to generating new
mutations. So personally I would say the situation is far worse in the UK than it is in SA. 
 

Also ofcourse we are going to have 400% increases but this is the start of our 6 month cycle next wave. 
We’re at the bottom of our wave. And cases have been low for months. So our actual movement have been 2k ish new cases the last couple days. Compare that to the UKs over 30k new cases every day since July. Or since you like precision then 7th of July. Also, since you like percentages that’s 1500%. Every single day. Since July. The UK has been a new variant factory for months. Where are these effective travel bans for this rogue nation?

And our increased cases figure isn’t directly attributable to the new variant either, or atleast this isn’t truly demonstrable. It is also due to year end functions and parties of the school going ages for year end among other things.

If you went through this whole pandemic without ANY loss of confidence in our ""social institutions"" or to even research the systemic failures that lead up to this, then that is very irresponsible in terms of citizenship on your end. Just because you are a ""social institution"" doesn't mean you don't make terrible decisions at the expense of your constituents (again read my posts).

If ""social institutions"" such as the CDC, WHO, national governments, corporations, etc have failed and they need to systemically address their shortcomings. Not just for COVID, but in many other areas (such as climate change, etc).

Anti-vax zealot may face charges after death of Covid-19 patient

Ali Bracken

November 28 2021 02:30 AM

Gardaí are recommending criminal charges be brought against anti-vax extremist Antonio Mureddu in connection with Covid patient Joe McCarron’s departure from hospital in Donegal while gravely ill.

The 67-year-old Covid-sceptic patient returned to hospital two days later, but subsequently died.

The Sunday Independent understands an investigation into the matter is “near completion” and gardaí in Donegal will send a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions, recommending Mr Mureddu be charged in connection with the incident, according to a senior security source.

“All the circumstances” surrounding Mr McCarron’s decision to reject medical advice and leave Letterkenny University Hospital are being probed.

In a video that later went viral, Italian anti-vaccination extremist Mr Mureddu is seen encouraging the Covid-sceptic patient to leave, despite a doctor telling Mr McCarron he could die.

“Among what’s being examined is whether this patient was forced or coerced to leave hospital,” said a well-placed source. Charges of trespass and whether hospital staff were threatened are also being considered.

Medical staff and Mr McCarron’s family members have been interviewed, it is understood.

The video of the incident on September 14, the Italian can be seen telling Mr McCarron: “Put your trousers on, we are going now, you are safe, you follow me.”

A staff member tells the patient he has the right to decide what he wants to do but adds: “You are barely able to breathe there now. We want you to stay and help you.”

“No Joe, they’re going to f***ing kill you Joe,” Mr Mureddu says before telling the staff member: “Because you are killing people.”

The medic then tells Mr McCarron: “I’m very worried about you and I want you to stay. I think he is saying something very dangerous. What he is saying is very wrong and very dangerous, and I think he is endangering your life.""

“It is a very difficult disease that you have and I’m not lying to you, you could die. This will be your best chance in the hospital and getting the support we are giving to you.”

Mr Mureddu then intervenes and accuses hospital staff of “lying” and says: “We go.”

“Think about this,” the staff member then tells the Italian. “You are endangering his life.”

Two days later Mr McCarron was readmitted to hospital. He was placed on a ventilator but his condition deteriorated fatally.

His family have criticised what happened and urged people to follow medical advice in relation to Covid-19.

An offence of endangerment states: “A person shall be guilty of an offence who intentionally or recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of death or serious harm to another.”

It carries a sentence of one to seven years in prison.

Mr Mureddu (44) appeared at Letterkenny District Court, Co Donegal last Monday, on road traffic charges of having no insurance, using a fraudulent licence plate, and failing to give information to gardaí at Meencarragh, Ballybofey, Co Donegal on October 23.

Judge Raymond Finnegan asked if he had a solicitor and he replied he had no legal representative.

He told Judge Finnegan: ""I don't give jurisdiction to this court. I can represent myself.""

He then attempted to hand paperwork to Judge Finnegan but the judge said he was not accepting it.

Mr Mureddu, who did not wear a facemask at any stage of the sitting, claimed he had items stolen by gardaí at Letterkenny garda station.

Judge Finnegan again told the accused he strongly recommended getting legal representation.

Mr Mureddu replied: “Absolutely not. I don’t give any consent. I am the king and you are the public servant.”",7b1a4f747123154863ed44ced2725b094f20697d,True,False,,,,,0,1638147291,,0,{},hmh0a7x,False,t3_r4htcb,False,True,t3_r4htcb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r4htcb/antivax_zealot_may_face_charges_after_death_of/hmh0a7x/,1638147306,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

[],False,,Greenjeff41,,,[],,,,text,t2_gl5b0,False,False,"Then wouldn't that just be more evidence to enact longer or more strict travel restrictions?  If the likelihood of another variant originating from Africa is high, wouldn't it be in the best interest of other countries to just put a long term travel ban in place and put pressure on increasing vaccinations or other preventative measures to prevent more variants from emerging?

You're right, it's probably in many places by now, but wouldn't shutting off the flow of the variant to all corners of the world be a smart move at least temporarily?  Like others have mentioned, it buys everyone some time to figure out how this one is different. It lets the countries that have had people come from South Africa get contact traced and isolated.  It can't be too many people at this point in the grand scheme of things. If it is as contagious as early reports make it out to be, isolating the majority of it in one area seems intuitive.

On the other hand, you may be right about the future repercussions of this decision.  But, say another variant is detected in a country, and that country, in an effort to prevent this from happening to them, withholds information about it.  Eventually that information would come out and I think the backlash and repercussions could possibly be worse than a temporary travel ban had they shared the info early. Especially if it's a smaller country that doesn't hold much sway in the world.  Living in the US, if a new variant came from here, I would expect other countries to put travel restrictions in place.  If I recall correctly, many did for US citizens early on.  I'm guessing some still do.  That's just too be expected in the times we are in.  

Say you have a boat.  And the boat has a bunch of leaks.  You know eventually the water is going to get so bad that it will sink.  You also have life boats, but it's going to take some time to get them loaded and get them away safely.  Would you try to plug some of those leaks so you can load more people in the lifeboats?  Would you have someone bailing water, knowing each minute you gain means more lives saved?  Pfizer has said it can get a new vaccine rolled out in 100 days of necessary.  Then it will take time to vaccinate people with this new batch.  All we need is a little time.

I guess the fear is that Omicron is going to be much better at evading the protection incurred from the vaccines, so the more we can boost the immune response now, the more likely when/if it starts surging in a couple of months, enough protection remains to prevent severe outcomes.

I think they're finally going with the ""go hard, go early"" response to pandemics urged by the WHO. There are likely to be no downsides to topping up with boosters other than cost, but if you wait a couple of months to find out if they are necessary, you waste the time and you can't get it back.

No. I'm merely stating that the media should stick to the facts, instead of contributing to the general noise. And while at it, limit the facts to actually relevant ones.

What we need is factual reporting. Right now, the facts are that there is a new variant with numerous mutations, it is already present in several countries around the world, we know more or less nothing worthy of note about it, and various governments are reacting to it by limiting travel and/or introducing other restrictions. That's what we have right now. 

If we want to reassure people, we could also reiterate that the mRNA technology enables relatively quick production of a new vaccine, should it become necessary, and that pharma companies are already testing whether the current vaccines will stand the test.

That's what I wanted to say. Stick to the relevant facts. Until we have definitive proof that it's more/less infectious – don't repeat speculation. Until we have definitive proof of the efficacy of current vaccines or lack thereof - cut the speculation. Just because Fauci said something during the presser, doesn't mean that it needs to be blasted for the entire world to see, especially given that he's speculating just like everybody else (""it might evade the immune response, it doesn't have to be the case, but there's a chance!"").

I just lost a family member 2 months ago. I might be glad he died so fast that he didn't kill my family but I'm not glad for the trauma or losing him or watching my husband cope with his brother's death and the panic attacks he's now having watching his idiotic family gather, wondering which is next. 

On top of that, I had a medical emergency this spring. I spent two 9-hour days in the ER, my condition got even worse and ended up with 2 emergency surgeries and a week in the hospital. As I'm about to go into surgery, there's a hostile man who won't mask, refusing a covid test and he's there for emergency surgery because he shot his own dick off. (I really can't make this up. I wasn't even drugged at this point and 4 security guards were called). So it was very terrifying me being 2 weeks post 2nd shot and hoping being unmasked around him wouldn't kill me.

Why am I so worried about that? I'm a blood cancer survivor who got heart and lung damage from chemo so I can't go on oxygen or ventilators without it likely killing me or requiring a transplant. I'm in my mid-30s, I was healthy enough to run 5Ks and hike mountains but Covid could kill me. I'm in antibody and t-cell vaccine studies and I still can't be sure I'm even protected by the three vaccines I've received.

So it's not enough to care about vaccinated v unvaccinated. People like me can't afford to stop caring because of our risk. You can't afford to stop caring because you might have your gallbladder fail. You might not care about the unvaccinated but surely you'll be affected if they die.

More kids are being admitted than during the early stages of the country entering the current fourth wave of infections, although a similar trend occurred during the third wave when delta was dominant, said Waasila Jassat, public health specialist at the institute.

South African scientists were last week the first to identify the new variant now known as omicron, and while symptoms have been described as mild, the exact risk from the new strain is still uncertain. Governments across the globe stepped up travel restrictions in response, and the World Health Organization warned that the variant could fuel a fresh surge in infections.

“The very young children have an immature immune system and they are also not vaccinated, so they are more at risk,” said Jassat, who was part of developing and managing South Africa’s national hospital surveillance system for Covid-19.

She said that part of the increased rate of admissions may reflect extra precaution on the part of parents given the new concern about the mutation. A pediatric report due later this week should provide more information.

“People are more likely to admit children as a precaution because if you treat them at home something can go wrong -- especially very young children because there is a higher proportion of death,” Jaffat said. 

Vaccine Protection

Scientists in South Africa said Monday that existing vaccines are still likely to protect against severe illness, though very small children are not able to get shots yet. About a third of the country’s population is fully vaccinated. 

During the delta-driven third wave, hospital admission for those under the age of 19 jumped 43%, and the country has since opened up vaccinations to adolescents between 12 and 17 years. 

“It does however appear that in this early part of this wave a higher proportion of children are being admitted than they were in the past,” Jaffat said.",2776d2c9b6b78e131a8418ee2ba6e6e4e2a98f38,True,False,,,,,0,1638207978,,0,{},hmk024c,False,t3_r5169r,False,True,t3_r5169r,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r5169r/toddlers_make_up_10_of_hospital_cases_in_omicron/hmk024c/,1638207989,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

[],False,,stillobsessed,,,[],,,,text,t2_j54oj,False,False,"Headnote on the CDC vaccine tracker I haven't seen before today:

&gt; When possible, CDC links a person’s first, second, and booster doses together. However, linking is sometimes not possible because CDC does not receive personally identifiable information about vaccine doses. This can lead to over-estimates of first doses and under-estimates of subsequent doses. CDC encourages people to bring their CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Record card with them to their appointment for another COVID-19 vaccine shot because having the card will help ensure the doses are linked. Learn more about how CDC estimates vaccination coverage in the footnotes of this page.

The referenced footnote says:

&gt; **How CDC estimates vaccination coverage** 

&gt; * CDC estimates the number of people receiving at least one dose, the number of people who are fully vaccinated, and the number of people with a booster dose. CDC estimates are based on data that includes a dose number (first, second, booster or additional dose). However, the dose number may be incorrect because the data that CDC receives does not have personally identifiable information.

&gt; * To protect the privacy of vaccine recipients, CDC receives data without any personally identifiable information (de-identified data) about vaccine doses. Each record of a dose has a unique person identifier. Each jurisdiction or provider uses a unique person identifier to link records within their own systems. However, CDC cannot use the unique person identifier to identify individual people by name. If a person received doses in more than one jurisdiction or at different providers within the same jurisdiction, they could receive different unique person identifiers for different doses. CDC may not be able to link multiple unique person identifiers for different jurisdictions or providers to a single person. 

&gt; * There are challenges in linking doses when someone is vaccinated in different jurisdictions or at different providers because of the need to remove personally identifiable information (de-identify) data to protect peoples’ privacy. This means that, even with the high-quality data CDC receives from jurisdictions and federal entities, there are limits to how CDC can analyze those data.

&gt; ** For example, most people receive their first and second dose of a 2-dose vaccine from the same provider because those doses are given within just a few weeks of each other. As they receive their booster dose months later, it’s possible they will go to a new location for that dose. The person may have moved or the provider who gave them their initial doses may no longer offer vaccination. This often happens for people who went to mass vaccination clinics that have since closed. In such a scenario, the person’s booster dose may appear to be their first dose when reported. This is just one example of how CDC’s data may over-estimate first doses and under-estimate booster doses.  

&gt; * Another issue that poses challenges to estimating doses administered is that not every jurisdiction and provider uses the same reporting practices. As people receiving doses are attributed to the jurisdiction in which they reside, the reporting method might change between doses if they move to a different vaccination location. Also, CDC may lack information about a person’s residence. These issues can cause CDC’s dose number estimates to differ from those reported by jurisdictions and federal entities.  

&gt; * CDC has capped the percent of population coverage metrics at 99%. This cap helps address potential overestimates of vaccination coverage due to first, second, and booster doses that were not linked. Other reasons for overestimates include census denominator data not including part-time residents or potential data reporting errors. 

&gt; * CDC is also updating COVID Data Tracker and the CDC website with prominent statements to better explain the limitations of vaccination coverage estimates shown in Data Tracker’s “Vaccination Delivery and Coverage” grouping. This change will help people appropriately interpret vaccination coverage data.",d52e4cf7efb3a2588114c2a11faccb14488ff7d3,True,False,,,,,0,1638225464,,0,{},hml7it2,False,t3_r4qv73,False,True,t3_r4qv73,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r4qv73/daily_discussion_thread_november_29_2021/hml7it2/,1638225477,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

Read up the history and see how we went from that to pre-covid times. Over time we forget the fear if the virus fizzles out. For all of us longhaulers and people who lost someone, we won't forget and this new reality will stick with us forever since we now  have PTSD from this experience and we will act in a safer more sanitary manor because of it. We will with time ease up and go to normal life, but it'l be a process for a lot of us who are mindful about the situation, which we all should have been.

Hopefully covid doesn't turn into something worse, but given how much we as a species are ruining the earth, it isnt illogical to say we won't have another pandemic with another virus soon if we don't fix up our gross act of animal treatment. If wet markets dont get regulated and eradicated, they will just be ticking time bombs like they've always been. And the more our species grows in numbers over the years, the worse our situation will get in general since over population causes issues with sanitation and food demand. 

Overall, am I painting a doomsday picture? Yes, but I think it's better we look at the reality of what we are living in instead of turning a blind eye and acting shocked when we see the truth after ignoring it for so long. I didn't think our country was as fucking stupid as it showed me these last couple of years, but god damn, did I learn a lot about how selfish and ignorant ppl can be.",071f84de92bc42811f4e7c1cc04385dcdfae23cb,True,False,,,,,0,1638167351,,0,{},hmi4dxl,False,t3_r46k0c,False,True,t1_hmgwqlx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r46k0c/fauci_says_us_must_prepare_for_omicron_variant/hmi4dxl/,1638167366,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

A patient zero, who is immunocompromised and contracts Beta strain, is given supportive care over a long duration, but has difficulty overcoming the infection.

A bit of inadvertent gene sequence splicing occurs in the process of replicating the viral RNA and some sequences swap between viruses, causing mutations to occur.

The only news – if any! – at the current time should be:

- New variant of concern, named Omicron by the WHO, was identified and found in several countries around the world.
- So far, we don't know if the new strain is more transmissible or more virulent than the existing strains, studies are underway and the results should be known in days and weeks to come.
- We don't know if the new strain is going to evade vaccines – studies are underway and the results should be known in days and weeks to come.
- Vaccine companies said that getting new mRNA vaccines made and tested will take X days.
- The current countermeasures deployed are…

Cut the baseless speculation (I literally read an article in the national paper that was nothing but speculation as to why the WHO decided to go with Omicron, instead of Xi or Nu…), cut reporting every single case of it worldwide, cut the predictions based on 4 cases in place A or 10 cases in place B…

LONDON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Scotland reported six Omicron cases on Monday, some not linked to travel in southern Africa, raising concerns that the mutation-heavy coronavirus variant is already spreading in the community.
Britain as a whole has reported nine cases of the new variant, which the World Health Organization said on Monday was likely to spread internationally and posed a very high risk of infection surges. read more

The four nations of the United Kingdom have all restricted travel to southern Africa, where the variant was first detected last week, in a bid to slow its spread.

But Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said not all of the six cases had recent travel history or known links with others who had travelled to southern Africa.

""This suggests that there might already be some community transmission of this variant,"" she told a news conference.
""There is no evidence yet that this is sustained, nor any evidence from the enhanced surveillance that it is widespread at this stage.""

Sturgeon said the timeframe of the cases suggested it was unlikely but not impossible that there was a link to the COP26 climate change conference that took place in Glasgow earlier this month.
COMING HOURS

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has responded to the emergence of Omicron by making mask-wearing compulsory in shops and on public transport in England.
He also asked the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to review the booster programme for under-40s, and look at reducing the gap between second and third vaccine doses.

""We'd expect that (review) within the coming hours,"" junior health minister Edward Argar told Sky News.
Ministers and scientists say even if vaccines prove to be less effective against Omicron, they should still offer protection against it and help keep a lid on numbers of hospitalisations and deaths.

Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the JCVI, said that given it would take time to develop a variant-specific vaccine, raising immunity in the population was advisable.
""Inevitably, everybody will be offered a booster, but what we want to do is make sure that it's done in a sensible order,"" he told BBC TV.


Scientists say Omicron has about double the number of mutations to the spike protein as the currently dominant Delta variant.
Argar said that cases would inevitably rise further, but ""we don't know by what speed or by what numbers ...We're trying to give ourselves the time to understand how it works and how it interacts with the vaccine.""",ad17e7b1eed68ab63678a03a84bebdc07ff1da18,True,False,,,,,0,1638189109,,0,{},hmivyo9,False,t3_r4ub45,False,True,t1_hmiuke3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r4ub45/scotland_reports_six_omicron_cases_some_not/hmivyo9/,1638189126,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

Ok did you read what I wrote? I'll quote exactly what I wrote:

*""A lot of pandemic planning was reversed in the 2010s,* ***not just by Trump (who reversed some pandemic-preparedness programs)*** *but also in Europe as well.""*

So am I absolving Trump of the blame? No, he weakened a lot of the US's prepardness and has blood on his hands. So I have no idea why you would suggest that.

But is he the only reason? No, far from it. The causes are much, MUCH more systemic than a simple ""Trump did it"" conclusion. 

We can clearly see, from my original post, that MANY countries outside the US had terrible pandemic preparedness as well, including also the World Health Organization. 

[Congress did not resupply mask stocks after the 2009 H1N1 outbreak](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/why-were-running-out-of-masks-in-the-coronavirus-crisis/609757/), where the remaining focus was on natural disaster/bioterrorism preparedness, with infectious disease not as a primary focus. I also again point you to [France's shift to just-in-time logistics after the H1N1 outbreak](https://www.publicsenat.fr/article/politique/penurie-de-masques-une-responsabilite-partagee-par-les-gouvernements-successifs) (French language article) which depleted their mask reserves. Many western countries outsourced mask manufacturing to China in order to save on labor and manufacturing costs through JIT. The problem becomes that JIT is horrible when it comes to disasters and large negative disruptions (such as COVID), where the supply chain becomes disrupted. Many countries gambled on this and it backfired.

Other examples? In 2006, California invested $400 million to shore up the state’s capacity to respond to a pandemic or natural disaster by building three mobile crisis hospitals and a stockpile of emergency medical equipment such as N95 masks (as well as ventilators). In 2011, Governor Jerry Brown (yes, a Democrat) passed an [austerity budget](https://www.latimes.com/local/la-xpm-2011-jul-01-la-me-state-budget-20110701-story.html) (and remember, austerity fucks over the poor) that, among other things, made massive cuts to state services. Of these was $5.8 million annual expense of maintaining the mobile hospitals.

Meeting up with friends and family inside with no masks only if they are vaccinated, and somewhat infrequently

Mostly getting takeout from restaurants but I have eaten in restaurants a few times if it's not too crowded and the tables are far enough apart.

I think it's up to everyone to determine their individual risk. Even though I'm young and healthy, I am being cautious because I hate being sick, and I don't want to get my significant other sick.

[],False,,BSantos57,,,[],,,,text,t2_f61kn,False,False,"Thirteen cases of the Ómicron variant have been identified in Portugal, the National Institute of Health Doutor Ricardo Jorge (INSA) announced this Monday, adding that the 13 positive samples are ""associated with cases of infection of Belenenses SAD players, since one of the positive cases had a recent trip to South Africa.

""Preliminary tests carried out at INSA strongly suggest that all 13 cases associated with Belenenses SAD players are related to the Ómicron variant of concern,"" reads the INSA statement sent to the press.

To ensure the break of transmission chains and following the precautionary principle in Public Health, ""pending further information regarding the transmission, impact and vaccine effectiveness against the Ómicron variant"", the institute states that health authorities ""determined the prophylactic isolation of contacts of the infection cases associated with this outbreak, regardless of vaccination status and level of exposure"".

""These contacts remain isolated and will undergo regular testing as early as possible at day 5 and day 10,"" the institute says.

New variant discovered in South Africa has an increased risk of reinfection.

INSA also indicates that it has analyzed samples from ""218 passengers on a flight from Maputo that landed at Lisbon airport on November 27th"".

On this flight from the capital of Mozambique, ""only two positives were detected, one of them being associated with the variant Delta and the other not allowing the correct identification"", and INSA has begun genome sequencing for final confirmation of these cases. However, ""the predictive value of the tests already performed is very high"".

The Dr. Ricardo Jorge National Institute of Health recalls that the new variant, initially identified in South Africa and some southern African countries, has also been identified in recent days in some European countries. ""However, there is still no scientific data to support its greater transmissibility or its ability to reduce the effectiveness of current vaccines,"" said the INSA in the statement.

Like other countries, Portugal has also taken measures against this new variant, considered of ""concern"" by the World Health Organization (WHO). The INSA says that throughout the territory the health authorities ""strengthen epidemiological surveillance, implementing control measures, with the prophylactic isolation of contacts of cases of infection by the Ómicron variant or with a history of travel to southern Africa in the previous 14 days, regardless of vaccination status, the precautionary principle in Public Health.

INSA continues to monitor the genetic variants of the new coronavirus, stressing that ""Portugal is aware of this situation, maintaining its ongoing monitoring program of variants at national level"".

""Baden-Württemberg wants to ban cultural and sporting events

Leisure, cultural and sporting events are to be banned or at least significantly restricted in Baden-Württemberg in the future. The contacts would now have to be radically reduced, said Prime Minister Winfried Kretschmann (Greens). Unfortunately, this also applies to those who have been vaccinated because the vaccination protection wears off after four to six months. The tightening should be decided tomorrow - on the basis of the Infection Protection Act.

He does not believe that the legal framework provided by the Infection Protection Act is sufficient in the fight against the pandemic , said Kretschmann. ""We need the entire instrument kit.""

In Baden-Württemberg, the 2G-plus rule already applies to all events in culture, leisure and sport . This means that so far only those who have been vaccinated and recovered have access to all events who can also show a negative test.""

""Karl Lauterbach announces closure of bars and clubs

According to the SPD health expert Karl Lauterbach, the traffic light coalition wants to tighten the corona measures in the short term. There will be proposals this week, Lauterbach announced on the Phoenix TV station. In view of the high number of infections, Lauterbach believes that bars, clubs and discos must be closed . In addition, there will probably be a mandatory mask requirement in schools as well as further restrictions for unvaccinated people. 

The background to the tightening is also the new omicron variant of the virus, which, according to Lauterbach, comes at an inopportune time. There is nothing worse than getting a more dangerous mutation during a severe wave of infection. That is why he once again strongly advocated vaccinations.""

""Munich introduces compulsory masks in outdoor catering

The city of Munich is tightening the rules for outdoor catering. From Wednesday, the 2G regulation will also apply here and thus the same requirement as in the interior , the city announced. Only those who have been vaccinated and recovered, as well as children up to the age of twelve years and three months will have access.

*Further analysis has shown that the people who have tested positive so far have probably contracted the virus in different places. ""In any case not during the flight,"" De Jonge writes to the Lower House.*

&gt;First, the idea that ""viruses evolve to be less deadly"" is just wrong. Viruses vary in their methods of transmission, shedding capabilities, and diseases they cause. There is simply no mold with which to apply to all viruses all the time, let alone one in which the prediction is some sort of ever-decreases virulence, even for zoonotic viruses. Throw this idea away. Some viruses are virulent due to aspects of their previous host adaption, but this is not some sort of rule, it's a case-specific hypothesis. Alternatively, it's a misunderstanding of case fatality rates decreasing after novel viruses are introduced to a population due to acquired immunity. Notably this is not an example of a virus ""evolving"" to be less deadly, though it is observed for all previous pandemics we have modern data on.

&gt;Second, what we're seeing currently is, by and large, mutations which do one of two things: increase replication capacity of the virus, and increase affinity for human ACE2. In doing so, the byproducts are going to be higher viral loads, marginally (though I'm simplifying). This is what is causing marginal increases in virulence, as we know from a wealth of immunology and COVID specific therapeutics early viral loads and dissemination predict worse prognosis. These specific adaptions and pressures are not necessarily related to other virulence factors (which is the tie in to the above point). This isn't an issue of ""the virus is adapting to be more deadly"", but transmission bottlenecks are favoring viruses which replicate faster and have stronger affinity for the entry receptor.",f6dcae9a6b2bd024ad1c160679c7a6cccf6de4d6,True,False,,,,,0,1638212075,,0,{},hmkadoq,False,t3_r4qv73,False,True,t1_hmk8gr8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r4qv73/daily_discussion_thread_november_29_2021/hmkadoq/,1638212089,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

The spike protein is the mode of entry into cells and therefore large changes to the spike protein were predicted to not function as well in terms of viral entry. On top of this it is surface exposed.  Finally, the virus information replication system (genome replication) is relatively not error prone and therefore rapid changes to the genes encoding the proteins were not expected.

For those reasons nearly every therapy/vaccine we have made has not only just targeted the spike protein, but also just a region of the spike protein.

Omicron, regardless of severity is scary because it has lots of mutations in the spike protein:  
This means: 

1) The spike protein can mutate and still be effective at entering cells

2) The virus can mutate at an appreciable rate for mutants to develop

Given all of our vaccinations have targeted the spike protein, there is huge selective (evolutionary) pressure for mutations to occur in the spike protein that will evade the immune response.  The Omicron variant means these mutations can occur, and occur at an appreciable rate.  Add to that the giant amount of unvaccinated people where the virus can replicate somewhat freely and develop mutations.  Now all these mutations are near a large population of hosts that are vaccinated/providing selection for the mutations that evade immunity from vaccination.

Altogether this equals S is Fed, having a large mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated people is about the worst thing we could've done if we wanted to prevent new mutants.....ugh",c54373e0f9f54a21ce0f9d526667ae0f7d5b6e0d,True,False,,,,,0,1638211902,,0,{},hmk9xwr,False,t3_r4qv73,False,True,t3_r4qv73,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r4qv73/daily_discussion_thread_november_29_2021/hmk9xwr/,1638211914,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

No this is a misconception. Mutations are random in every aspect. From outside pathogens experience evolutionary pressure. Covid experience no pressure to become less lethal because enough people live (long enough) to spread it. Pathogens would only experience this pressure if hosts are killed swiftly and reliably enough to reduce spread. New variants can become less lethal or more lethal, but there no pressure either way.
Furthermore lethality is independant from infectiousness. A more infectious pathogen doesnt have to become less lethal to a certain degree.

Your example on flu is correct. We had experienced it many times therefore only weak hosts die from it - still a lot each year. But due to our constant reinfections its relatively harmless. We did not have previous sars-cov-2 infections hence so many deaths. 

It is theorized that nowadays trivial, endemic common cold coronaviruses were the cause of previous pandemics, with many deaths but since then everyone came into contact with it many times.

YOu're basically talking about normal T-cell response towards any new pathogen.

&gt;Vaccination is still key. Too many severe infections will overload already fragile heath systems. Get vaccinated/boosted, wear masks, wash your hands frequently.

If everyone is equally prioritized then trying to combat obesity would be moot correct?

WWII lasted six years. This pandemic has barely lasted two. They went through hell during one of the darkest periods of modern history. We had to wear a piece of fabric and watch Netflix. If that's all it takes to break us, the west has had it too good for too long. The world has not faced a genuine crisis in half a century and it shows.

I think it’s going to sort itself by region and probably by political persuasion.”

In deep-blue New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) declared a state of emergency over the weekend though mid-January to allow the state to prepare for a covid surge by purchasing additional supplies and letting hospitals postpone nonessential procedures.

But the weariness is evident even in such blue regions. And some Republicans were already suggesting that omicron is a fabrication.

“They are going to try and sell us new ‘Variants’ for the rest of our lives if we don’t tell them to shove it,” tweeted Kari Lake, a GOP candidate for governor in Arizona who is backed by former president Donald Trump.

Ronnie Jackson, the White House physician turned GOP member of Congress from Texas, also hinted at a conspiracy.

“Here comes the MEV — the Midterm Election Variant!” Jackson posted on his Twitter feed. “They NEED a reason to push unsolicited nationwide mail-in ballots. Democrats will do anything to CHEAT during an election — but we’re not going to let them!”

Some Republican officials have acted on the anti-lockdown sentiment. New state laws in Kansas block state officials from closing businesses, for example. The Montana legislature prevented health officials from quarantining those exposed to the virus. And North Dakota has passed a law barring health officials from issuing mask mandates, even in cases like an active tuberculosis outbreak.

The supreme courts of Michigan, Wisconsin and Kentucky curtailed the ability of those states’ Democratic governors to implement emergency measures such as statewide mask mandates.
Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee (R) recently signed legislation banning government mask mandates in most situations as well as vaccine mandates, and he allowed another bill stripping local public health authorities of emergency powers to become law without his signature.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) called a special session and signed legislation this month to block efforts to control the virus, including a prohibition on employer vaccine mandates and on school boards issuing mask mandates or quarantining students who have been exposed to the virus.

The new laws follow measures to prohibit localities from mandating masks or fining businesses that violate covid restrictions, which some county officials said undermined their ability to respond to a summer surge that led to record hospitalizations, infections and deaths.
Over the weekend, state and local officials largely used the interest in the omicron variant to reiterate current restrictions rather than publicly discuss new ones.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont (D) urged vigilance against the variant and said its emergence accentuated the urgency of vaccinations and wearing masks indoors. 

Connecticut does not have a mask mandate, but some towns, including New Haven, still do.
“This news of the Omicron variant reminds us about the importance of being vaccinated and getting a booster,” Lamont tweeted Sunday. “We have now entered the winter holiday season and still need to mask while in indoor public places, practice proper hand hygiene, get tested and stay home if you feel sick.”

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) received a booster shot Sunday and encouraged others to follow his lead. “The best way to strengthen your protection against covid-19 is to get your booster shot,” he tweeted, with a photo of himself receiving a shot.

Kanter, Louisiana’s top public health official, said the state’s immediate priorities for responding to omicron are shoring up its genetic surveillance systems to detect the variant early and to ensure that labs that can detect the omicron variant while conducting routine coronavirus tests are prepared to do so.

He said social distancing measures such as restoring an indoor mask mandate, imposed by Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) in response to the summer delta surge, are premature while scientists and health officials await additional information about the variant.

A previous variant, detected in South Africa before it was found in Louisiana, ended up not being concerning because it was not highly transmissible, Kanter said, even though early data suggested it might be resistant to vaccines or therapeutics.",ebae27a8ee03b777076b543f7da2cc2ec45dec49,True,False,,,,,0,1638224414,,0,{},hml51aw,True,t3_r573va,False,True,t1_hml3ulf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r573va/as_omicron_emerges_a_tired_public_has_little/hml51aw/,1638224430,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

She and her colleagues are preparing to test blood from fully immunized people against a synthetic version of the Omicron variant.

&gt; Creating such a “pseudovirus” — a viral stand-in that contains all of the mutations — takes time, but results may be available in about 10 days.

Neutralization against pseudovirus is always lower.  We went through this the first time back with the mink mutants.

Doing it right requires actual virus and a BSL-4 lab and takes longer.

Headlines from the pseudovirus will almost certainly be released soon and be alarmist.  It also doesn't really matter because they're testing neutralizing antibodies (although will have implications for spread, but anyone paying attention already expects it to become endemic, and may have implications for various monoclonal antibody treatments).

&gt; Already, a computer simulation has predicted that those mutations may alter about six of the hundreds of regions that T cells can recognize, said Wendy Burgers, an immunologist at the University of Cape Town.

&gt; That may not seem like much. But people make varying sets of T cells, so depending on which targets the mutations knock out, some people may barely be affected by Omicron — and others may be left vulnerable.

This is the real question to answer, but testing T-cell responses is much slower.

The death rate in vaccinated/recovered individuals is probably how we'll know first if the T-cell responses are still maintained, rather than lab results.  And the safe bet is that they are, and the reports out of South Africa that it causes milder disease are probably the first indications of that.",93a0bbac440eda965230403026f609a38b0ef0fc,True,False,,,,,0,1638168747,,0,{},hmi6dk0,False,t3_r4mqfu,False,True,t3_r4mqfu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r4mqfu/will_the_vaccines_stop_omicron_scientists_are/hmi6dk0/,1638168760,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

New variant may infect more and kill less, experts say
None November 29, 2021

The large amount of Ômicron mutations is an unusual fact that needs to be investigated in Brazil, say scientists consulted by Estadão. Discovered in South Africa, the new variant of the coronavirus has 50 mutations. About 30 are located in the so-called spike protein, the one that allows the virus to enter human cells and is one of the main targets of vaccines against covid-19.

Ômicron variant is confirmed on four continents; Austria and Brazil study suspected cases
Ômicron variant is confirmed on four continents; Austria and Brazil study suspected cases

A first hypothesis for the occurrence of so many mutations (three times more than what was seen in the Delta variant) is that it developed in an immunocompromised patient who harbored the Alpha variant for a long time in South Africa. The tests detect the Ômicron because it does not have a specific gene – the same as Alpha, according to international experts. “We had never seen a variant with so many mutations”, says professor Amilcar Tanuri, coordinator of the Virology Laboratory at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

Tanuri says he supports the hypothesis that emerging viruses tend to attenuate as they spread through the human population. With each mutation, the tendency is for them to become more transmissible and less lethal.

The first reports from doctors in South Africa indicate that the virus spreads rapidly, but without a large number of serious cases. “This observation in South Africa is still empirical, but it corroborates the hypothesis of attenuation of the virus and increase in transmissibility”, says the coordinator of the UFRJ.

“In Brazil, we still haven't had access to the Ômicron variant to study it”, says Tanuri. “As soon as it is detected in the country, the first thing to be done is to isolate the virus and put it in contact with the serum of patients vaccinated here in Brazil and also infected with the Delta variant”, says the virologist.

In this way, it will be possible to know whether having overcome other coronaviruses confers some immunity (cross-protection) against Ômicron. The second question that will need to be answered is how the new variant will behave. In other words: if it is going to replace Delta in Brazil, as it seems to be doing in Africa. As the virus can be transmitted faster than the competitor, it wins the dispute. The former continues to circulate, but to a lesser extent. It is worth remembering that Delta ended up not causing an increase in cases in Brazil – according to many experts, because of a combination of vaccination and sanitary measures.

According to Tanuri, several groups have published the sequencing of viruses found in people who have had persistent or prolonged infection with the previous variants. In a study carried out at UFRJ with two dozen of these patients, the researchers observed that the accumulation of mutations in the spike protein is proportional to the time the virus remains in the individual.

For epidemiology Cesar Victora, professor emeritus at the Federal University of Pelotas (UFPel), the reports from doctors in South Africa may be a sign that the coronavirus is evolving like many other viruses that are very aggressive at first, but become attenuated with time. “This could be happening, which would be good news, but it's too early to know,” he says.

The specialist believes that the country needs to expand its variant monitoring system. “We have to increase capacity. We've still done little sequencing. The variant may already be here and not yet discovered”, says the coordinator of the scientific committee of Instituto Todos Pela Saúde.",66b5cd9192b9332c81bb5a5e0ad9b650db4868c2,True,False,,,,,0,1638188383,,0,{},hmiuv5a,False,t3_r4uaiy,False,True,t1_hmit3yw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r4uaiy/new_ômicron_variant_could_infect_more_and_kill/hmiuv5a/,1638188398,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

&gt;Pfizer and Moderna both are now starting to work on updating the vaccine, so the current vaccine is ineffective.

This wrong. Pfizer and Moderna started evaluating if they need to update the vaccine. They'll answer that question in a week or two, but as of now that's just not confirmed.

The vaccines worked reasonably well in reducing symptoms from all previous variants. The most likely thing to happen is that Omicron will lead to relatively mild breakthrough infections in vaccinated people and will lead to relatively severe symptoms in the unvaccinated population. 

Honestly the best bet to keep the number of infected and hence the number of mutations down is by vaccinating as many people as possible, which reduces infections.

&gt; On the basis of the mathematical models presented here and the results of the surveys on vaccination acceptance, we consider a target vaccination rate (vaccination protection through full vaccination) of 85% for 12–59 year olds and 90% for people aged 60 and over necessary and also achievable.

AMSTERDAM - The Royal Netherlands Military Constabulary detained a couple who had fled from a quarantine hotel at Schiphol Airport on Sunday evening.

The couple was detained as they were about to leave the country: they were found in an airplane. ""Both persons have been handed over to the GGD,"" the military police reported on social media. They would have set their sights on a flight to Spain, reports AT5.

A spokesperson reveals that the hotel in the Kennemerland region is where positively tested travelers from South Africa are in isolation. Inside the hotel, private security guards ensure that the guests who must remain in isolation do so. Outside, police and military police make sure that no one enters the hotel who has no business there.

The couple may be prosecuted for violating the quarantine, up to and including years in prison. The hotel where the couple was in isolation did not want to say anything about the matter on Sunday evening.

The important point here, too, is that there has been ""barely enough time for infections to have had time to progress to severe disease and hospitalization.""


This means they need more time, at least two weeks, to study the data. At that point, they'll be able to determine the variant's severity and more info about its transmissibility.

As you can see testing in US is really inhomogenous. Places like Vermont report quite high positive cases despite their high vaccination rate, but this is due their good testing rate. If you dont test, you cant detect cases.

Also check this out for international numbers, they feature datasets for testing but also for hospitalisations etc https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing

As a rule of thumb you can look at positive rate in testing numbers. If it is high the dark field is also high, meaning many cases are undetected and the virus runs rampant in the population.
While the US vaccination rate is pretty bad compared to many european countries the US was the hardest hit country aswell in many categories, e.g. deaths per capita.

My boyfriend and cousin who got it with me only got sore arms. I had the sore arm, &amp; the worst chills/fever ever in my life. I’m talking I was in sweats, a huge puff jacket, socks, under 3 massive blankets with a heating pad under me, *in the middle of south Florida summer*. I was also extremely dehydrated, had horrific body aches, and I could barely walk. I literally felt like the walking dead. Massive headache, and I had to cancel a doctors appointment the following day because I literally couldn’t get out of bed. 

I finally started feeling better after about 3 days but I was still sluggish for about 4-5. I have never had a reaction like that to a vaccine, and my entire family including my parents and my elderly grandma who survived stage 4 lung cancer and only has half of her left lung literally had 0 side effects.

I live next door to my grandma so I quit my front desk job on March 7th 2020 because I was not going to expose her if I could help it, my work literally said at my last meeting in late Feb/early March “the flu kills x amount of people per year, we’ll get some mobile hand sanitizers for the trails on the property/don’t shake hands” and they were totally willing to let me handle all the guests coming in from all over the country/world while they sat back in their offices. I bounced so fast. I had been following the outbreak since there were only whispers online about a new deadly respiratory virus in China. So I knew it was coming, and it was going to be bad. The job wasn’t great though I did enjoy our historical museum/park and volunteers, but that was the nail in the coffin that they didn’t give a shit about me or my health since I’m the one who dealt with dozens to hundreds of visitors a day face to face. 

I guess my point is that even though the 2nd shot really knocked me on my ass, it’s so much better than contracting a deadly virus that in some cases causes lifelong debilitations. I’m not the healthiest person anyway, I’m overweight, and I’ve gone this long without me or any of my close family/friends except for 1 friend getting COVID. I don’t care if the booster or a possible new vaccine makes me feel like death again, I *will* be getting it.

[],False,,Redfour5,,,[],,,,text,t2_5lyy1dyq,False,False,"On the virulence question. I had to take off an article because the bot said it was inappropriate...although it let it through first time... 

**The virulence question and MORE enhanced transmission discussion.**  
  
This article was written in like February of 2020. Remember our halcyon days of denial? https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0690-4  
  
It discusses both tranmission and virulence as a function of mutations. If you really want to drill down, the references are a good place to start.  
  
From this, and the above, there is another ""twist"" in transmission dynamics. I remember reading about this years ago, and the article above provides context on it, but this is the first comment on it below (with as yet no proof).  
  
URL triggered mode delete... But here are the questions. 

Question: What if a virus mutates to such a degree that it ends up harming its viability in the whole?  
  
Remember SARS? It appeared to be evolving toward something that makes Covid19 look like a cake walk. What happened to it? We don't know for sure and the extreme Community Containment response may have helped, but...something changed. MERS? seemingly scary potential. All three of these ""recent"" variants on Coronaviruses have zoonotic origins. SARS and MERS for whatever reasons never took off in the human population although SARS made a run for it. I doubt personally it was anything humans did that stop them. So, it was likely in their genes. Covid19? Well, it appears to have what it takes to jump species and ""stick"" like the other Coronaviruses we presently live with quite easily... https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/coronaviruses  
  
So what does all this mean?  
  
The above linked article (newshub) asks the question, did mutations stop a country level outbreak of Covid? Maybe?  
  
Conclusion? It is way too early to panic on the new variant that everyone appears to be panicking about. It, more than likely, will be another variation on the theme we should be getting used to. Worst case, imho, it may spread like Delta has providing another opportunity for unvaccinated individuals to get sick and/or die while the vaccinated and previously vaccinated have substantially better outcomes irrespective of vaccination or previous infections. It could have slightly different clinical characteristics potentially impacting different sub-populations (age?) but overall, just another wave on the sea of Covid gradually getting smaller and smaller like any ripples on a pond over time where inputs decline and in the case of Covid the reservoir becomes less naive from many standpoints.  
  
As I stated in February 2020 on Reddit. When the first General Epi data came out from China on Covid I breathed a sigh of relief. Up until then I too was wondering if this was the Zombie Apocolypse. Those data (I was the first to post) made me realize and I stated it then, nope, it's going to be the flu from hell. And I was right. https://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/2020/03/28/montana-zombie-apocalypse-flu-hell/2932917001/  
  
Oh and the best evidence of the long term outcomes of Covid at a population level? (long term meaning centuries and millenia...) Well, here are the other Coronaviruses humanity deals with. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/general-information.html In the present day, they are primarily a pain in the ass and not viral killing machines. What were they when first introduced into the human species? Your guess is as good as mine, but I bet the similarities to Covid are much more similar than not.",e5f8b06d82a64a0b16aa8f742d446748283cd3b0,True,False,,,,,0,1638193692,,0,{},hmj3q20,True,t3_r2sk5m,False,True,t1_hm7gs3t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r2sk5m/how_viruses_mutate_and_create_new_variants/hmj3q20/,1638193703,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

I know you're getting downvoted to hell, but that's a reasonable inference to draw. Luckily for us, this particular variant gives us an insanely easy way to track it, and we can use that method to disprove your theory.  

When someone takes a PCR Covid test, the test looks for 3 specific genes in the sample.  With all the currently circulating variants, all 3 of those genes are detected.  With Omicron, only 2 of them are.  The third one comes up a blank.  Of course we still need to send it out for genetic testing to be absolutely 100% sure, but this makes it ridiculously easy to tell at a glance which cases are very likely to be Omicron, and which are very unlikely to be so.

Given that information, assorted governments and scientific communities have searched through their recent positive PCR tests, looking for signs of Omicron.  If your theory was correct and the new variant was driving the current surge, they'd be finding tests with 2 out of 3 genes showing EVERYWHERE.  They aren't.  They're finding one or two tests with that sign, all within the last few days, and almost all in people who recently traveled from southern Africa.

So yes, it is a reasonable assumption and was absolutely worth checking into, but the evidence doesn't bear it out.  Omicron is not driving the recent surge in central and eastern Europe.",5f08f551cbaa8cc2e09c6a0d43c0bb5972ffee85,True,False,,,,,0,1638192912,,0,{},hmj2azh,False,t3_r4uuh7,False,True,t1_hmiyt4t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r4uuh7/dutch_police_arrest_couple_trying_to_flee/hmj2azh/,1638192929,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

Yes they can. Those masks are usually used at work places, if you go grocery shopping for 20 minutes its reasonably understandable that this doesnt equal a shift of 8 hours. Of course you shouldnt wear them anymore once they show physical damages, different color/stains or get moist (let it dry). Look at them properly each time before putting them on.

the nk95s can be reused aswell, up to 5 times. how? hang them between each use for 7 days, at the 7th day they can be used again OR treat them with heat. how? put them in a plasticbag, get rid of the air inside, close it properly. put enough water in a cooking pot so the bag doesnt touch the ground. when it boils put the bag inside, close with a lid, wait 10 minutes. then get it out and hang it again (dont leave it in the bag). you can do this maximum of 3 times. alternatively you can put the mask in oven for 60 minutes at 80°C=175F. this can be done 5 times. this is based on a study of a german university, source in german https://www.fh-muenster.de/gesundheit/downloads/forschung/ffp2/02_ffp2_info25022021_doppelseiten.pdf Masks with filters or such ones that cant be folded flat shouldnt be treated in these heating processes.",18dd22b770fd0bf55af59d72ba4a8d2d99c02c6b,True,False,,,,,0,1638174615,,0,{},hmidyqn,False,t3_r4qv73,False,True,t1_hmid4s9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r4qv73/daily_discussion_thread_november_29_2021/hmidyqn/,1638174631,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

Ontop of that you can rewear them for that timeframe up to 3-5 times. Theres a guide from a german university i follow, copy pasting my old comment:

Yes they can. Those masks are usually used at work places, if you go grocery shopping for 20 minutes its reasonably understandable that this doesnt equal a shift of 8 hours. Of course you shouldnt wear them anymore once they show physical damages, different color/stains or get moist (let it dry). Look at them properly each time before putting them on. Avoid touching the surfaces of the mask.

the nk95s can be reused aswell, up to 5 times. how? hang them between each use for 7 days, at the 7th day they can be used again OR treat them with heat. how? put them in a plasticbag, get rid of the air inside, close it properly. put enough water in a cooking pot so the bag doesnt touch the ground. when it boils put the bag inside, close with a lid, wait 10 minutes. then get it out and hang it again (dont leave it in the bag). you can do this maximum of 3 times. alternatively you can put the mask in oven for 60 minutes at 80°C=175F. this can be done 5 times. this is based on a study of a german university, source in german https://www.fh-muenster.de/gesundheit/downloads/forschung/ffp2/02_ffp2_info25022021_doppelseiten.pdf Masks with filters or such ones that cant be folded flat shouldnt be treated in these heating processes.",18dd22b770fd0bf55af59d72ba4a8d2d99c02c6b,True,False,,,,,0,1638174242,,0,{},hmidi94,False,t3_r3z84f,False,True,t1_hmi98so,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r3z84f/daily_discussion_thread_november_28_2021/hmidi94/,1638174259,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

Higher transmissibility then delta is going to impact hospitals and access to medical care. An R0 over 10 is gonna hurt even if this ends up being less deadly like if it were to have a  mortality rate similar to the flu and it hypothetically only severely effected the unvaccinated.

That instantly adds 5% unemployment and the services that are ancillary also take a big hit - restaurants, bars, mechanics for safari vehicles, etc. A million+ people now dealt another blow on top of what they’ve already faced. And “postponing meetings or doing them on zoom” is a possibility, but the mere uncertainty caused by the ban is often enough to spoil a deal or cancel a project.

Additionally, there is little evidence that the travel ban even *works*. The WHO recommends *against* them as an effective measure of curbing spread.

I mean, either way we’re stuck with covid and exposure to a milder form of the virus is pretty much like traditional vaccines. The mortality rate is likely higher than a vaccine, but it’d do the job of “vaccinating” the antivaxxers, with a lower risk profile for those that are high risk.  
  
Idk, I’m no doctor or epidemiologist or whatever, so I’m quite prepared for this to be wrong on any number of fundamental levels, that are more obvious to someone that works in the field (so go easy on me). It was just a thought and a contagious “vaccine” would appear to circumvent the whole problem with vaccinations. Though I’m guessing that the vaccine manufacturers wouldn’t be too happy with that.  
  
Oh and perhaps omicron isn’t the right strain, but the same could be applied to a future strain with an even lower risk profile.  
  
Lastly, everyone who wants to, could still get vaccinated. Governments just wouldn’t have to push the issue so hard.

This is a problem unique to market capitalism and a lack of centralized planning in a time of crisis. Production in a country such as Germany or the United States could easily be redirected toward this critical end of creating enough highly-specialized filters. If the production facilities don’t exist, they could be built. If the specialized employees don’t exist, they can be reallocated from other less critical industries and trained up to speed.

Nothing even remotely resembling this sort of effort has happened in the United States because, well, that’s big government socialism. But **the market does not have the capacity to respond to an international humanitarian crisis**, and the domestic and international capacity to address the crisis is hamstrung by the extent to which market priorities (namely profit) are privileged at the expense of making vaccines and saving lives. 

The United States will have 800,000 people dead from this virus and a stock market at all-time highs. That is a reflection of the priority of profit over human life at the typical American extreme. The patent is not being lifted for profit reasons, like most medical patents within a profit-first system, and lives will be lost at the maximum until and unless this dissonance is at least somewhat addressed. The issue with vaccines in Africa is merely a reflection of the fact that, under a market capitalist system, minimal resources will be mobilized toward unprofitable ends such as saving the lives of poor African residents.",2c938d0984cc1beb95343921b14370092bbced79,True,False,,,,,0,1638205480,,0,{},hmjtway,False,t3_r4btdp,False,True,t1_hmh3f3n,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r4btdp/gottlieb_says_omicron_variant_of_covid19_almost/hmjtway/,1638205495,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

In Taiwan, the people don't always ""trust"" the government either. Only a short few (6?) years ago, massive number of protestors occupied congress and forced the then-ruling KMT party to withdraw from opening up certain Taiwanese industries to Chinese investments. I mention this because, a few short years later, most Taiwanese people very much approve and support the current government's response to the pandemic, which is a hard closure of the border and mandatory 14-day entry quarantine (in designated hotels) with cell phone tracking.

Personally I think that's a healthier attitude towards government than the kind of animosity towards it in the US. Criticize where appropriate, but just assuming that anything government touches turns to shit is unhelpful and counterproductive.

I think I already made this point in another comment in this thread, but the issue with SARS-NCoV-2 is that it targets the ACE-2 receptor to gain entry and infect cells. Since the ACE-2 receptor is so morphologically similar across most Mammal species as well as reptiles, amphibians, and birds, it's able to spill over into a wide range of other species easily and jump between them just as easily.

The issue here isn't with what's known- the SARS-2 virus itself and it's capabilities to infect a wide range of animals, but with what is yet unknown- what other coronaviruses all those other species have spreading within them that might interact with the SARS-2 virus when one individual animal is infected by both Covid and a yet unknown animal coronavirus and the two viruses swap genes while replicating in a coinfected cell. 

There's potential that a viable and yet unknown coronavirus that only infects certain birds in lets say... Utah, picks up genes from SARS-2 that give it the potential to spill-over into humans just like SARS-2 did sometime in 2019. That animal coronavirus might not cause much visible symptoms in those Utah birds, but could become a severe and highly infectious virus when it spills over into humans.",a77b1eda06f686a80b43f59dd35b8f7e0c1f2ebb,True,False,,,,,0,1638205074,,0,{},hmjsvxb,False,t3_r4rnzc,False,True,t1_hmjneox,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r4rnzc/omicron_poses_very_high_global_risk_countries/hmjsvxb/,1638205094,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

[Here is the data from my state](https://imgur.com/a/HnLjjMh) showing how the risk of dying of COVID-19 compares to each previous age bracket.  So for example, the COVID-19 death rate of people aged 70-74 is 3.8%, while the COVID-19 death rate of people aged 65-69 is 2.0%, so moving from the 65-69 age group to the 70-74 age group increases your risk of dying from COVID-19 by 1.8%.  So during ages 65-69, your risk of dying of COVID-19 goes up by roughly .36% each year.  Obviously how much your risk goes up each year depends on your current age but to say that's not how the statistics work is clearly wrong.  I took the data from the Minnesota Department of Health.

The WHO is against travel bans as a solution because it gives a false sense of security. People can travel via other countries to circumvent a travel ban. 

But it's not just a travel ban for direct flights. Anyone that has been in the region in the last 2 weeks is banned. So there are no easy ways around this time.

The looking question is whether existing immune cells recognize Omicron, and if so, to what degree. Also, scientists should explore whether a measurable difference exists between prior infection versus vaccination for people infected with Omicron. 

Personally, what would be helpful to know as soon as possible is whether at-home tests detect Omicron. Current advice for a testing window is only several days, based on the relatively short incubation for Delta. Omicron seems thus far to incubate for closer to 10 or 11 days rather that 4 to 5.

Tbh, the level of polarisation in society is a symptom of something much worse than covid. We’ve lived amongst viruses for the entirety of human existence, they’re as much a part of nature as we are.  
  
If you put too much evolutionary pressure on them, you might win the battle, but you’ll far much worse in the long term war. It’s kind of similar to what we’re seeing with bacteria that are resistant to drugs.  
  
It’s silly to fight so hard against the inevitable. It’s too late to wipe out covid, so the next best scenario is basically to breed it into something as harmless as the common cold. Necessity is the mother of all invention. We’re creating the necessity for covid to mutate for survival and rather than putting pressure on it to mutate into something less harmful, we’re pushing it to just become more resistant to treatment.

[],False,,jdorje,,,[],,,,text,t2_ii7rl,False,False,"This is the very calculation I want to try to make.  Certainly Omicron cases are growing 5x weekly so Omicron hospitalizations will grow 5x weekly, on top of Delta and non-Covid hospitalizations.  The question is what that ratio is.  And this is incredibly hard to calculate I think, because there are multiple variables each with significant uncertainty and that uncertainty all combines.

Say Omicron is growing 5x [3-7x] per week (17-32% per day).  There are currently 1,800 positive tests in Gauteng a day as of today for the 7-day average (we have to use 7-day averages since that's how the hospitalizations are done), or 12,600 over the last week.  Test undercounting is 4x-20x (based on 60% seropositivity before the Delta wave South Africa's testing hit rate is abysmal; this is obviously a tremendous variable).  And lastly a 10 (7-14) day gap between positive tests and hospitalizations.  Lets call it 300 Omicron infections from week 48, which I think ended yesterday.

Then the upper bound is with 32% daily growth, 4x test undercounting, and 14 day gap: those 300 hospitalizations correspond to the running case average of 15 days ago.  This gives 300 / ( 12600 / 1.32 ^ 15 * 4 ) = 38% hospitalization rate.

Now the lower bound: 17% daily growth, 20x test undercounting, 7 day gap.  Now those 300 hospitlaizations correspond to the running case average of 8 days ago.  This gives 300 / ( 12600 / 1.17 ^ 8 * 20 ) = 0.4% hospitalization rate.

That's a factor of 100 margin of error, but I think even 0.4% is not great when we're talking about 5x weekly case growth.

Abstract
Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug being investigated for repurposing against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Ivermectin showed in vitro activity against SARS-COV-2, but only at high concentrations. This meta-analysis investigated ivermectin in 23 randomized clinical trials (3349 patients) identified through systematic searches of PUBMED, EMBASE, MedRxiv, and trial registries. The primary meta-analysis was carried out by excluding studies at a high risk of bias. Ivermectin did not show a statistically significant effect on survival (risk ratio [RR], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.42; P = .66) or hospitalizations (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.36 to 1.11; P = .11). Ivermectin displayed a borderline significant effect on duration of hospitalization in comparison with standard of care (mean difference, –1.14 days; 95% CI, –2.27 to –0.00; P = .05). There was no significant effect of ivermectin on time to clinical recovery (mean difference, –0.57 days; 95% CI, –1.31 to 0.17; P = .13) or binary clinical recovery (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.50; P = .15). Currently, the World Health Organization recommends the use of ivermectin only inside clinical trials. A network of large clinical trials is in progress to validate the results seen to date.",967fefb9207fc1075407ae3849d26b6ab193699a,True,False,,,,,0,1638218109,,0,{},hmkpdhn,False,t3_r54m16,False,False,t1_hmkocwh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r54m16/u_of_minn_medical_school_receives_15m_to_launch/hmkpdhn/,1638218124,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

We already had a flexible work/life plan where many people worked from home 1 or 2 days a week. And everyone was equipped with a laptop so that we could take the laptops home if snow were forecast for the following day, so everyone who could, worked from home on bad weather days. 

After a year of the pandemic and working from home, the company decided to sell our campus and rent a much, much smaller space, which will house those employees who can't work from home, desk space for those who might want to work in the office a few days a month, plus conference rooms and meeting spaces. There will be 20-25 people working in the office, out of a workforce of around 450-500 people. 

I will admit I was surprised, as the CEO is a major micro-manager and I never thought he'd agree to this. 

Mostly everyone I know is happy with the change. Quite a few had long commutes of 45 minutes to an hour and a half, one way, so not having to drive in snow and ice is a big deal, as well as gaining back commuting time. 

I was one of the few who actually lived in the same town as the office, so I don't gain that much time, but not having to wear shoes all day is a bonus. 

The only thing I mind is that for some projects, we hire temps, and when that is happening, because I supervise the temps and we require some of them to be on Zoom all day long, I have to be on Zoom all day long, to make sure they are working and to answer questions, etc. Those days get long.",23f8ed6d65497779330ef30f97ddfec26fa33fca,True,False,,,,,0,1638218012,,0,{},hmkp53u,False,t3_r512sk,False,True,t3_r512sk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r512sk/the_fight_over_the_hybrid_future_of_work_people/hmkp53u/,1638218027,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

Maybe. Maybe not. You're asking the million-dollar question, and we won't know the answer for at least the next few years.

&gt; I just can't imagine china having a better vaccine.

The numbers for coronavac (Sinovac) indicate 90%+ efficiency against severe and worrying symptoms. [Source](https://www.istoedinheiro.com.br/eficacia-x-eficiencia-compare-as-vacinas-contra-covid-disponiveis-no-brasil/) in Portuguese, because here in Brazil we can choose to take sinovac or any other western vaccine and there's a lot of data available on Coronavac (also called Sinovac in the US and Europe)

&gt; – Prevenção de casos de Covid-19: 65,9%
&gt; – Prevenção de hospitalizações: 87,5%
&gt; – Prevenção de internações em UTI: 90,3%
&gt; – Prevenção de mortes: 86,3%

In case you don't want to skim through it, this the data you're looking for for the Chinese vaccine

86.3% efficiency for preventing death

90.3% efficiency for preventing getting you into an ICU

87.5% efficiency for preventing getting you into a hospital

65.9% efficiency for preventing getting contaminated

Holy shit. I've heard that before, but for some reason your example landed with me especially hard.

I will never understand why people want to gamble with this virus when there are vaccines which usually dramatically reduce the severity of it. The anti-vax crowd always go on about a 1% mortality rate (or 0.01% when their failure in math 101 shows). But why would you want to take the chance of having to be put on a ventilator or intubated, or get long covid, or put your loved ones through such stress, or add to the burden of healthcare workers, or any of the other bad things contracting the virus can bring!

People are willing to take more risks and accept more challenges, but they’re not willing to accept more restrictions.”",1aae9ce2ccb05b0ace8b3eec756cb58e4a7ba066,True,False,,,,,0,1638223915,,0,{},hml3ulf,True,t3_r573va,False,True,t3_r573va,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r573va/as_omicron_emerges_a_tired_public_has_little/hml3ulf/,1638223928,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

I was able to reach out to my own care team (I'm a long-term survivor so my oncology team no longer sees me as a patient) and inform them and it turned out they had no idea of the risk.

Number of cases are hardly the only factor in this. Even ignoring the potential for the new variant to reduce the efficacy of the vaccines, cases in SA have gone up 400% in a week whereas prior to the EU's statement about the UK cases had gone up by 11%. So yes you could definitely say the situations aren't similar and the one in SA is far worse. 

However, my point was that when a serious new variant has been found countries have implemented travel bans, it has nothing to do with Africa, racism or any other thing you want to claim. Trying to claim that case numbers makes the situation different when the EU's statement says it's due to the rapid spread of a new variant that travel should be restricted similar to the situation in SA.

Well as the UK was the centre of the spread for alpha variant I'm not sure what banning travel to the EU would have done.

There does not exist, on this planet, enough of the highly specialized filters for Pfizer and Moderna to max out their production capabilities.

There’s a market for them right now, so generate them first, then start producing the nanolipids, then people will start going “Oh yea, you can probably help manufacture in your country.”

But it’s still a difficult to run bioreactor (Replicating the plasmids in a bacteria), a bog standard step to break the plasmids into a template, another time spent in a sterile bioreactor (creating the mRNA from the templates), then an incredibly intricate and specialized chemical manufacturing step (safely blowing the mRNA through the above mentioned filters that envelops them in the Lipid nanoparticle), then a standard fill and finish operation.

Personally, I welcome explicit caution like this because when they make these statements, it suggests that we're learning something new (or working on learning something about a new potential threat), and it's better to be safe than sorry, especially when ""being safe"" is literally just the same piece of paper or cloth over your face you should have been wearing for the past 20 months.

For folks that aren't masking or getting vaccinated, an advisory isn't going to do anything.

That's background on it all.  There's a discussion in there on how the avirulence hypothesis has fell out of favor.  There's also a bunch of criticism now of the trade-off hypothesis since that has been around for decades, but mostly the trade-off hypothesis is just incomplete.

So there are first, second and third order effects:

First order:  the tradeoff in how increasing transmission increases virulence all other things being equal (Delta).

Second order:  host immune evolution (vaccination lowers the hospitalization and death rates 10x-50x compared to naive immune systems)

Third order:  immune escape and benefits of avoiding the host immune system vs. costs of those mutations against fitness.

I can interpret what you were saying instead as that third effect, but it should be clear that the virus is actually getting worse at transmission in a hypothetical immune naive population (because the immune naive population doesn't exist any more so the pathogen is being forced to adapt).  Stating it as a law is also a restatement of the avirulence hypotheisis.  That third order effect may or may not happen.

Ebola is probably an example, Rabies is another, those are viruses which mostly have animal reservoirs where they don't cause high virulence though.  There's other examples in that paper of the history of criticism of the avirulence hypothesis.  It does seem like influenza on the whole has gotten less virulent since 1918 and there's other human pathogens which have tended towards less virulence, although our treatments have gotten much better at the same time, so its difficult to tease those effects apart.  Maybe that indicates some hopefulness towards long term evolution towards less virulence of this coronavirus as well.

The virus could have the freedom to mutate and retain Delta's level of transmission and virulence even in the face of the need to achieve immune escape.  There's pangolin sarbecovirus spike proteins out there which have higher binding than SARS-CoV-2 to human ACE2 which might indicate there's still a lot of room for the virus to get even worse, or to achieve immune escape while still being as bad.  But T-cells are likely to remain effective and persist.",7204d038456b47b29cb615be4303f7669c102c82,True,False,,,,,0,1638139760,,0,{},hmgivra,False,t3_r42hz6,False,True,t1_hmeoyjp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r42hz6/no_severe_covid_cases_among_vaccinated_patients/hmgivra/,1638139773,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

This one has extremely mild symptoms yet they close borders and want to stop it at all cost.

In a country with only 25 percent vaccinations that would mean vaccinated get infected twice as much.

""elective"" would normally be something that the kasse probably wouldn't even pay for - it's that voluntary and you could live quite normally if the surgery were not performed.  Might also apply to a style of surgery to solve a real problem but which is somehow unusual and not covered by the kasse (ie the style of surgery would be elective as a more common approach would solve the problem).    

this sounds more like ""necessary treatment"", but as you say, not immediately life threatening so they are ok with putting it off?  

I dunno - if the surgeries were scheduled months ago anyway? I can't think of any type of cancer where you could comfortably wait for months, even in normal times.

I mean, yeah, but the particular danger here just like with the Influenza family of viruses is that they both can infect other host species and acquire new genes and traits from other animal coronaviruses and influenza viruses, and then transfer back into people with new genes and potential for causing a pandemic. That's why we still monitor influenza in bird populations as well as other mammals- particularly livestock, and why there were major efforts to monitor animal coronaviruses after the 2003 SARS outbreak warned us that they can also spit out pandemic potential viruses from time to time, 2019-2020 turned out to be that time when SARS-2 popped up.

What's particularly concerning about SARS-2 is that it targets the ACE-2 receptors to gain entry into cells to start replicating. All mammals, many reptiles, amphibians, birds, and even some fish have morphologically similar ACE-2 receptors, giving it the ability to infect a massive amount of hosts throughout the animal kingdom. With those hosts having endemic coronaviruses of their own, there's always a chance that SARS-2 coinfects an animal who's also carrying one of the hundreds of known and unknown animal coronaviruses, if two viable viruses coinfect the same cell, they an swap genes in replication and produce a hybridized virus with traits from the animal virus that might cause severe complications in humans or is different enough from what our immune systems are used to that it defeats any natural immunity. 

This process called antigenic shift and Influenza A does this all the time. The most recent ""close-call"" was the 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu pandemic, where that particular virus had genes from Swine Influenza, Avian Influenza, as well as Human influenza, and had the ability to spread easily between humans. Luckily that proved to be no more severe than other seasonal Influenza A strains, but that was a warning shot. We're going to need to invest a lot more into surveillance of animal coronaviruses so we can prepare for and be ready for the inevitability of SARS-2 doing something similar.",836b06d4e2e1f3cce70139660e25209fe051c494,True,False,,,,,0,1638204349,,0,{},hmjr379,False,t3_r4rnzc,False,True,t1_hmjbqp7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r4rnzc/omicron_poses_very_high_global_risk_countries/hmjr379/,1638204366,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

Rather than simply continuing with ""wear a mask"" as a blanket statement in areas with 85%+ vaccination rates, I'd argue that we need to answer two key questions:

1) What is the supplementary estimated benefit of mask usage on top of the protection from infection, lower rates of symptomatic illness and faster viral clearance in vaccinated individuals?

2) Is that increase large enough to justify policies that mandate mask usage?

In an unvaccinated population, it's obvious to require mask usage indoors. In an incredibly highly vaccinated population, this becomes much trickier to assess.

There are some caveats to this study. This was a convenience sample of 108 people who showed up to a post-covid clinic. The results might reflect a bias that women might be more likely to follow up in a clinic than men. There was no comparator group, like a non-COVID post ICU clinic, but [other](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3104816/) [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10718692/) suggest that women are more likely to seek medical care than men.

Additionally, the study assigned phenotypes to the patients by clinical gestalt. I've done phenotyping work, and their approach lacks rigor. It's possible that the clinicians who assigned phenotypes might have subconsciously been biased to assign women to having fatigue.

Additionally, the inflammatory markers were not assessed systematically, meaning clinician bias could have driven the decision to test for inflammatory markers, leading to an ascertainment bias.

Another limitation of the study is that it doesn't account for censorship by death. Men are [more likely to die](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34242273/) from COVID than women. It's possible that men who might have become ""long haulers"" died before they had the chance to manifest those symptoms.

I don't think the study itself is misleading, the authors acknowledge most of the limitations, and an educated reader can infer the rest.

This is another problem of science journalists taking a small study out of context. This study, by itself, doesn't provide sufficient evidence that women are more susceptible to COVID long term symptoms.",32fa13380aa6b8a1000808b46729f4556531c3af,True,False,,,,,0,1638203981,,0,{},hmjq6q9,False,t3_r4xr19,False,True,t3_r4xr19,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r4xr19/new_mayo_clinic_study_finds_more_women_are_covid/hmjq6q9/,1638203996,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

Background: We aimed to establish an acute treatment protocol to increase serum vitamin D, evaluate the effectiveness of vitamin D3 supplementation, and reveal the potential mechanisms in COVID-19.  
  
Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 867 COVID-19 cases. Then, a prospective study was conducted, including 23 healthy individuals and 210 cases. A total of 163 cases had vitamin D supplementation, and 95 were followed for 14 days. Clinical outcomes, routine blood biomarkers, serum levels of vitamin D metabolism, and action mechanism-related parameters were evaluated.  
  
Results: Our treatment protocol increased the serum 25OHD levels significantly to above 30 ng/mL within two weeks. COVID-19 cases (no comorbidities, no vitamin D treatment, 25OHD &lt;30 ng/mL) had 1.9-fold increased risk of having hospitalization longer than 8 days compared with the cases with comorbidities and vitamin D treatment. Having vitamin D treatment decreased the mortality rate by 2.14 times. The correlation analysis of specific serum biomarkers with 25OHD indicated that the vitamin D action in COVID-19 might involve regulation of INOS1, IL1B, IFNg, cathelicidin-LL37, and ICAM1.  
  
Conclusions: Vitamin D treatment shortened hospital stay and decreased mortality in COVID-19 cases, even in the existence of comorbidities. Vitamin D supplementation is effective on various target parameters; therefore, it is essential for COVID-19 treatment.

* BAD mutations that we've seen in other VoCs
* Novel mutations that lab data suggests are bad
* Novel mutations that probably mean something because of where they are, but we don't know what they do
* Novel mutations that we simply have no idea what they might do (if anything)
* Non-novel mutations that we know have no impact And Omicron has a bunch in the first two categories, which suggests that it'll be bad, even more in the third and fourth category, which we just need more data on, and the ones in the fifth category can be safely discounted. Unfortunately, there's also a gap between ""these look bad"" and ""these ARE bad"", in that the latter needs time and real-world data to state with confidence.

&gt;We found only a handful of modeling studies on Ebola and SARS, and nothing that evaluated the impact of an actual ban after it was implemented.  
  
Some of the evidence suggests that a travel ban may delay the arrival of an infectious disease in a country by days or weeks. However, there is very little evidence to suggest that a travel ban eliminates the risk of the disease crossing borders in the long term.  
  
Our ability to draw conclusions across the different studies we reviewed was limited by the small number of relevant studies. We urgently need more research in this area to understand whether travel bans and other control measures are truly effective.

And then the first article is relevant, but the concern isn't that the bans don't work-- rather it's that it stigmatizes countries that report honestly.

&gt; Just because they claim the number of people claiming unemployment is at its lowest since the pandemic, that’s just because benefits have ended, 

While they do measure people claiming unemployment benefits, thats not the numbers they're measuring when talking about how low unemployment is.  Look up ""U3 unemployment"" for the common measurement used in newscasts, and ""U6 unemployment"" for the more realistic measurement.

\&gt;  In addition to worse COVID-19 outcomes for people with HIV, there are growing concerns that SARS-CoV-2 viral evolution in immunocompromised people could hinder the global coronavirus response. In September, in the New England Journal of Medicine, Corey and colleagues summarised the growing evidence that immunocompromise is associated with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection and mutations that might increase virus transmissibility or enable escape from vaccine protection. Additionally, in a preprint published in medRxiv in June, Karim and colleagues **describe a case of a South African woman with uncontrolled HIV who had persistent SARS-CoV-2 virus shedding for 210 days, during which time the virus mutated 30 times,** with changes including mutations associated with vaccine escape and those found in variants of concern. ...

Earlier this month my family all got sick with some kind of nasty respiratory virus, we were all sick to varying degree for like 1-3 weeks straight. My youngest (he had the worst symptoms), and my husband both got the rapid test, since that's all that was available in our area without a 10 day wait. We figured whatever one family member had, we all had it (We have 6 young kids so there's plenty of germ spreading happening, despite our best efforts). Both tested negative for COVID on the rapid test, and then I went and got tested a few days later, all negative, so we assumed it was just a seasonal cold, stayed home, and limped through it. Sent the kids back to school when they started feeling better.  

Cue the following week: One by one I start getting letters from each of my kids teachers notifying us of close contact/exposure to confirmed COVID-19, and that we need to quarantine. Then on Thanksgiving we get a notice that there's a large outbreak at school, in grades 4K-6th grade (every classroom my kids were in), and they're shutting down the school for a few weeks to contain it.  

Now I'm wondering...did we have COVID? Were we the source of the school outbreak?? I would be beside myself.

A virus is more likely to become endemic if it's becomes less virulent and more contagious, because it doesn't kill its host population, so it can keep spreading.

But that doesn't mean it's the only possible outcome. There's a chance it could turn into a super deadly and contagious version, that would wipe out a big part of humanity.

It would just disappear after a few years, because everyone would be dead, while a less lethal version could stay around for centuries, like the flu.

The biggest tensions on this kind of policy decisions here are at the federal vs. provincial level; in the absence of such a recommendation or directive from Health Canada, each of the provinces is charting its own path to a certain extent. My understanding is that third doses are already cleared for anyone 18 or older in Manitoba who wants one, while Ontario seems likely to make them more widely available in January.

Choosing a different path on this is not new for Quebec, though. For example, back at the start of the vaccination rollout, the province broke with the others (and with federal, international, and manufacturer-provided guidance) to prioritize first doses only and impose a three-month interval before recipients were eligible for the second rather than the three weeks or whatever that had been standardized by Pfizer and the US.

Yes, most people can wait a couple weeks to travel. But that doesn't mean it's not a hardship. And if you have a death or illness in the family then it most definitely is a hardship. It's hard not to be able to grieve with those you love.

In areas with high Covid rates, anyone with raspatory diseases is going to take up a lot more resources than they would in a normal year due to COVID precautions and an already stretched thin health care system. However, even a mild cough, if spread, can have really devastating effect to families that have kids in day care or schools. Most schools will not allow a kid in school with even a mild fever or cough. Suddenly, what would be a day at home with chicken noodle soup is a parent needing to take 2-3 days off while paying for a doctor's visit AND a Covid test + waiting for the results and all the symptoms to clear. 

So, wear a mask.

I did my part, as did everyone I'm in constant close contact with. I'm in a mostly vaxx'd area. Everyone 12 and up has had months to get their vaccine and now everyone 5 and up can get it. For the longest time I was at the forefront of ""its just a mask, get over it"" and now even I dont give a shit anymore. For months I quietly complied solely because there was still a large portion of the population that could not be vaccinated and thus I was willing to go with the extra restrictions to keep those safe. Now I'm just done. Now the unvaxx'd are almost exclusively hurting themselves at this point. There still are 0-4 and those who medically cannot get it but for well over 90% of the population, you have had the chance for months to protect yourself, significantly decrease your chances of contracting COVID, and damn near eliminate any possibility of death/hospitalization because of it. 

At this point,  whether a fully vaxx'd+boosted person wears a cheap cloth mask over his face for 15 minutes at the grocery store is not what will make the difference. Its the millions who are willingly not getting vaccinated and who never cared about masking+distancing to begin with. Obviously masking still helps (and I'm still doing it at least until 5-11 have a decent amount of time to get it) but theres only so much a mask can do when millions are foregoing the most important element of ending the pandemic (vaccination). They were obviously needed when there was no vaccine but now, they're largely security theater. How long are those who have been compliant the whole time going to bear the burden of those who never gave a shit in the first place?

Thing is, that's not what broke me. It was tragic, but I could rationalize it. The public's reaction (screw that applause nonsense during shift change while not wearing masks), the management's reaction (here's a granola bar), and the family's reactions (let's trach and peg my 98 year old grand dad with a history of COPD, CAD, three heart attacks, CKD II, and no local support network since I live on the other side of the country but it just isn't their time yet) is what eventually got me to quit. I'll put myself in front of quite a bit to help others, but I refuse to risk my family's safety any more for people that blatantly disregard any care or notion for others health and safety (or their own for that matter) until it has directly affected them. I used to be a humanist at heart who believed everyone had the capacity for goodness and empathy; now, I'm not so sure. And that has shaken me.

I'm working 100% from home as a case manager now and while it's not perfect, I don't have to put my family at risk any more or risk my own physical safety flipping and proning 400 lb. patients with two flat sheets instead of a proper proning/lift system. One day maybe I'll go back and finish my NP program that I've already spent thousands on, or maybe I'll just suck it up and learn how to be a decent programmer and learn python or something.

And once antibody treatments are update for the new variant and the Pfizer pills are approved (if they haven't already been), we'll be even better off in terms of severe disease. 

If it is as scary as it seems, we'll likely have variant specific boosters rolling out by March (at least in places like the US). At that point, we'll be back to being ahead even in terms of risk of infection.

Now Chinese researchers are offering data to support the government’s decision to maintain its extreme “zero Covid” strategy.

A recent study published on the country’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention website found that China could face more than 630,000 coronavirus cases a day if it dropped its zero-tolerance prevention measures and lifted curbs on travel, in the way that some Western countries have.

That would be more than five times as many as the total number of cases reported in China, which has a population of 1.4 billion, in the years since the virus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, according to a New York Times database. Such an outbreak would put a huge strain on the country’s resources, including its hospital system, said the report, which was published before the World Health Organization labeled Omicron a “variant of concern.”

The authors of the report, who are scholars at Peking University in Beijing, wrote that the findings “raised a clear warning” that the country was not ready to open up.

“More efficient vaccinations or more specific treatment, preferably the combination of both, are needed before entry-exit quarantine measures and other Covid-19 response strategies in China can be safely lifted,” they wrote.

While China has vaccinated more than 75 percent of its population, questions have been raised about the efficacy of the country’s homegrown vaccines.

The Beijing government has staked much of its political legitimacy on controlling the virus better than other countries. The strategy, so far, has worked: China has reported fewer than 5,000 deaths since the pandemic began and has managed to quickly tame sporadic outbreaks through severe, and sometimes impractical, measures. On Monday, China reported just 21 locally transmitted cases, most of which were reported in the northern region of Inner Mongolia.",29c88dfd4ba7e4e529b6abe2304fcf0c2b8d8cbc,True,False,,,,,0,1638223318,,0,{},hml2ela,True,t3_r56vvp,False,True,t3_r56vvp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r56vvp/china_defends_its_zerotolerance_approach_to_the/hml2ela/,1638223330,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,

Breyer turned away an emergency application on Monday from workers at a hospital chain in Massachusetts who objected to its requirement that they be vaccinated against the coronavirus.

&gt;Justice Breyer did not ask for a response to the application or refer it to the full Supreme Court, and he gave no reasons for his ruling. Those were all signs that he viewed the legal question in the case as insubstantial.

&gt;The plaintiffs, employees of Mass General Brigham, objected to the hospital chain’s decision not to grant them religious or medical exemptions to the vaccine mandate, saying that the decision violated federal anti-discrimination laws. They sought an injunction that would allow them to continue to work.

&gt;A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, unanimously rejected the workers’ request, saying that an injunction was not the proper remedy. If the workers were right, the court said, they would receive compensation at the conclusion of their lawsuit.

&gt;”Money damages would adequately resolve all of the alleged harms,” Judge Sandra L. Lynch wrote for the panel. “Moreover, as the deadline for being vaccinated has passed, the appellants cannot point to an ‘impossible choice’ as a special factor here; they have already made their choices.”

&gt;The Supreme Court has previously rejected challenges to vaccination requirements from health care workers in Maine, students at Indiana University and personnel in New York City’s school system. Two challenges from health care workers in New York are pending.

My booster was more gentle on me than my earlier shots but it did make me more tired. That was kind of nice because I had been very hard on myself in the weeks prior and I needed to rest and had not given myself permission. Offering myself that rest and comfort food was a gift, just like doing something good for my health is a gift. I have PTSD from a chronic illness and reframing it as a gift and focusing on what I can control are things that really help. Maybe you'll feel a little bad this time. What can you do to prepare? Maybe plan a good delivery meal or order comfort foods to have on hand ahead of this. My worst side effects from the 2nd shot were some muscle aches and a fever so I made sure to have hot and cold packs ready just in case. I didn't really need them but it was nice to have them to feel better. Also remember any vaccine symptoms have an end time.

Even without vaccines, your risk for death is very low unless you are like 70+ yo or already have life threatening disease. Many people care about more than just severe disease for themselves. For many, things like not spreading it to the elderly or immunocompromised in their family and concerns of long-covid are significant factors that played into decisions to do things like get booster shots despite themselves being at extremely low risk of severe outcomes with just 2 shots.

The city’s positive test rate rose to a two-month high as hospitals admitted more than 100 new virus patients on Friday, contributing to a 25% jump in hospitalizations in just two weeks.  
  
The city has 463 people in the hospital for Covid-19, up from 370 on Nov. 12. The seven-day average of residents testing positive for the virus -- the lowest in the state of New York -- has climbed above 2% for the first time since the end of September. That metric doesn’t include rapid antigen test results.  
  
Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency late Friday just as countries including the U.S. began imposing travel restrictions from southern Africa to stem the spread of the new variant. While the variant known as omicron hasn’t been found in the U.S., Hochul warned, “it’s coming.”

On Saturday, she also ordered nursing homes and adult-care facilities to make boosters available to all residents as hospitalizations across the state spiked.   
  
The governor on Saturday reported 2,696 people in hospitals because of the virus, up from 2,249 a week earlier.  
  
Several parts of the state are reporting higher positivity rates: 10.2% in western New York; 9.4% in the Finger Lakes; and 9.3% in the Mohawk Valley. 

“With the emergence of the omicron variant abroad and warning signs of spikes in cases this winter, the need for basic Covid safety procedures here in New York is more important than ever,” Hochul said in a statement.  
  
Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, said Sunday that the new variant appears to be more transmissible and will “inevitably” arrive in the U.S.   
  
Biden last week restricted U.S. travel links with South Africa and seven other countries in the region starting Monday. The president is returning to the White House later Sunday from a long holiday weekend as U.S. health officials gauge the risks of the new variant.
