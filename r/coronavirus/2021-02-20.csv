And the variant isn't at 100% yet, it still needs about half of those 8 weeks just to get up to full speed.

Restaurants have many rules they have to follow. Rules like party sizes limited to 4 people, distance between tables and no alcohol after 20.00. Restaurants failing to comply can and have been closed.

Yes it does, and the fact that you deny this proves you are an authoritarian science-denier. 

&gt; Do i need to review the scientific method?

Yes you do, you need to review it for yourself. For instance:

&gt; Are you implying that in this demonized authoritarian countries, they do not believe in testing hypotheses 

Because they don't. The point is that authoritarians inflict violence on scientists who end up giving results which threaten the authoritarian regime. Which is to say that they don't like the testing hypothesis, they like to ""testing hypothesis so long as it doesn't make us look bad."" These aren't the same.

To go back to my Christianity analogy, what you are attempting to do is to argue that ""Christianity except you don't think Jesus is the Messiah"" is Christianity. Absolute nonsense, it is not. It is a completely different religion. Similarly, a ""Scientific Method"" which must always carry with it the proviso that it not in some way anger the regime isn't the Scientific Method, it is something else entirely.

Yes, idiots think that.

No, and this proves my point. Anti-free speech would be people (and in particular, the government) committing acts of violence against others simply for views expressed.

Now the virus can rip free and will infect a much larger group of younger people. The problem? Even though younger people are less risky to get hospitalized if you dial up the numbers high enough you still fill up the hospitals. There is also a group that has pre existing condition and is not aware of it. It really depends how fast you can vaccinate. Not saying this is going to happen but there is a chance it will.

I don't think the false positive rate can be that high. For example in Australia over the last 7 days there have been 430,000 tests and only 0.2% \[1\] of them have come back positive. That said because we have such a low positivity rate there is likely a higher degree of care being taken.

&gt; We are currently faced with the question of how the severity of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may change in the years ahead. Our analysis of immunological and epidemiological data on endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) shows that infection-blocking immunity wanes rapidly but that disease-reducing immunity is long-lived. Our model, incorporating these components of immunity, recapitulates both the current severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the benign nature of HCoVs, suggesting that once the endemic phase is reached and primary exposure is in childhood, SARS-CoV-2 may be no more virulent than the common cold. We predict a different outcome for an emergent coronavirus that causes severe disease in children. These results reinforce the importance of behavioral containment during pandemic vaccine rollout, while prompting us to evaluate scenarios for continuing vaccination in the endemic phase.

https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6530/741

The 1918 H1N1 pandemic never had a vaccine, after herd immunity was reached it mutated and came back every year after that as just seasonal influenza.

The 1889 Russian ""flu"" epidemic was either influenza or the OC43 human coronavirus.  Either way it just caused seasonal colds or flu after it became endemic.

When the virus mutates to achieve immune escape it will not reset the clock back to zero and ""COVID-22"" or whatever will have the same lethality and people who have either recovered successfully from COVID or vaccinated will not have the same level of side effects due to [original antigenic sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_antigenic_sin).  The virus will also eventually be forced to mutate in ways that increase its transmission but make it less lethal.  Once the spike has to change so much to achieve immune escape that its ACE2 binding goes down it'll become less virulent and less transmissible.",,,1613895124,{},go7ivvm,False,t3_lomcuz,False,True,t1_go70wdu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lomcuz/the_virus_is_under_increasing_selection_pressure/go7ivvm/,1613895136,1,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The fact that you swung back around to that is kinda weird to be honest, like your just looking to poke holes where you think you can, or an attempt to shake my confidence in a person I trust or my own ability to delegate because you had nothing left of merit to add.

&gt;A really important aspect of the clinical trial system is informed consent - the people who are affected by the risk of adopting a new therapy in a trial are going into it fully aware of the decision they are making and the risks they take by accepting it.

This is not a clinical trial but the idea of informed consent is still important. Everyone who is offered the vaccine can refuse it and safety information is published by the [UK's independent medicines regulator](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/latest-monitoring-data-confirms-safety-of-covid-19-vaccines).

&gt;I think they [members of the public] should have the option of electing a vaccination regimen that is tested and known to be efficacious. 

I respectfully disagree with your opinion. Someone who wants their second dose in three weeks rather than twelve will be delaying the first dose for someone else. Everyone has the right to refuse the treatment: that doesn't mean they have, or should have, the right to dictate how they want a treatment administered.

&gt;But they skipped steps in the process that's put in place to save lives, and they didn't have the evidence in place to justify it until this latest Israeli study arrived. 

Again, they made a rational decision based on the available evidence. Had a twelve week gap been, against the evidence, ineffective then those receiving that dose regimen would need an additional vaccination. Saying they didn't have the evidence to justify it is just repeating the fundamental point of disagreement between us - I agree that evidence from a well-designed RCT is the gold standard for evidence here, but I reject the idea that this is the only type of evidence that can be used in making a rational choice. If using a 12 week gap does indeed save lives then keeping to a 3 week gap would be the tragedy - there are no policies here where people don't die.",,,1613904176,{},go7s59z,False,t3_lndwjs,False,True,t1_go7qgjc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lndwjs/study_in_israel_shows_pfizer_vaccine_85_effective/go7s59z/,1613904187,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The ""group"" includes those who have been engaging in risky behavior during the pandemic - this includes front-line workers and their families as well as those who don't take many precautions, eat in restaurants, hang with friends and so forth.

However, that leaves the other half of the population, who have been carefully wearing masks, avoiding unnecessary social contact and adhering to safety protocols. This group is nowhere near group immunity. In fact, it would be catastrophic if this group was led to believe that ""all was well"" and we could return to life as usual prior to universal vaccination.

Unfortunately, headlines like this are undermining the public's adherence to Covid safety.

The Palestinian authority has said it would procure its own vaccines and Israel first and foremost has the responsibility to look after its own people.

I mean the contract they made with Pfizer probably wouldn’t allow it anyway, since Pfizer relies on Israeli data. 

Your news headline on Gaza is just lazy journalism. Gaza is a very difficult and delicate situation, it’s basically a terrorist group held enclave and history has shown that a large chunk of the goods sent there from the West Bank have been destined for bombs or rockets. Israel has procedures to check that all goods aren’t going to be used fir terrorist purposes, which has been the case for years. They haven’t blocked any vaccine to Gaza, they’re merely holding it for safety checks atm which they’re doing with any other goods going into Gaza from Israel.

To a certain extent, the decisionmaking process here is a continuum;  it's not a boolean yes-or-no decision by any means.

Your viewpoint taken to the extreme would have had us injecting people with vaccines last July when Phase 2 trials showed they were safe and triggered an immune response, but before we had efficacy data - because it would theoretically have saved hundreds of thousands of lives.  

My viewpoint taken to the extreme would withhold approval on the AZ vaccine until they gather more data to resolve the confusion caused by the low-regular vs regular-regular dosage mistake, despite the fact that both show some sort of efficacy.

Neither of those are right.  We all recognize that even the best scientific studies just provide evidence, not answers, and that eventually we need to make a judgment call based on what that data is telling us.  

This is not a new problem.  My core argument, though, is that we have regulatory processes in place that require evidence based decision-making to save us from ourselves.  Wanting to be aggressive about deploying a new therapy is well-intentioned, and it's not a new problem by any means - and historically, time and time again the best intentions have led to tragedy when shortcuts were taken.  

We put the clinical trial processes in place because they force us to stop, gather data, and be certain the new therapy we are deploying actually does what we think it does with no ill effects.   We've already accelerated those processes by years due to the pandemic - further guessing and gut feeling-based decisions really do undermine the safety processes that are in place, even if well intentioned.

A really important aspect of the clinical trial system is informed consent - the people who are affected by the risk of adopting a new therapy in a trial are going into it fully aware of the decision they are making and the risks they take by accepting it.

I'd feel very differently about the UK's plan if they were offering people the _choice_ to delay their second vaccine dose to help out by letting others be vaccinated first.  I'd support that wholeheartedly, and I'd probably even opt for it myself.

But some people in the community are at dramatically higher risk, like medical workers, and I think they should have the option of electing a vaccination regimen that is tested and known to be efficacious.  The UK unilaterally made that decision for people, not giving them the ability to consent to an untested dosage regimen - and given that decision wasn't supported by scientific data, I think it was a bridge too far.   They're effectively running a no-consent clinical trial with the entire population.

I'm sure the people who made the decision meant no ill will and legitimately believed they were saving lives.  I'm not even arguing it is the wrong vaccination strategy in the long run - it may _actually_ be saving lives.  

But they skipped steps in the process that's put in place _to save lives_, and they didn't have the evidence in place to justify it until this latest Israeli study arrived.  You think that's okay, and I don't.  This time, it worked out, and I'm happy for everyone involved that it did.  Next time, it could be the next tragedy, though - and it could have been incredibly damaging to the whole world's vaccination efforts, causing far more lives to be lost than the marginal few that were saved by aggressively shaving a couple weeks off the timeline.",,,1613902467,{},go7qgjc,False,t3_lndwjs,False,True,t1_go7fjoa,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lndwjs/study_in_israel_shows_pfizer_vaccine_85_effective/go7qgjc/,1613902477,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

2. Politicians learned the hard way that it's safer for them to show caution until they are sure they can open more up.

4. Restrictions *are* loosening slowly, and I doubt they will be (except maybe places like Florida) all gone at once. NYC opened indoor dining last week, Philly increased indoor dining to 50% in some cases a couple weeks ago. 

My guess is Spring will see the biggest lifting of them from a combination of enough people vaccinated that case numbers are going to be materially down and being able to have enough outdoor activities that increased indoor activities don't cause a new wave (e.g. if they go back to 100% capacity indoor dining today in Philly, everyone who has cabin fever will rush to dine inside, packing restaurants when less than 10% of the city has received the first dose more than 10 days ago.

[],,notinterestedreally,,,[],,,,text,t2_gj84h,False,False,[],"&gt; If Oxford was so concerned about the safety of the elderly, why would they largely exclude them from the phase 3 clinical trial

They weren't largely excluded, they were included just later in the trial in significant numbers so by the time the interim results came out few cases in the older age groups had occurred. Getting lots of cases in the placebo arm of a vaccine trial amongst an age group that has a high chance of hospitalisation and death is certainly a moral and ethical dilemma.

&gt; Wouldn’t they hold back a request for approval for that age group, until they’ve done a separate trial (which is exactly what they did with adolescents)?

Because Oxford and the UK MHRA accept immunogenetic data (which shows similar responses in older age groups than younger ones) so they could still get approval with the largely younger age groups efficacy results only. Adolescents are different because none of them were tested on in phase 1 and 2, you'll note both Moderna and Pfizer are also taking their time testing on this group as well.

&gt; Why would they exclude the elderly from some trials but include them in the US arm?

US trial was run by Astrazeneca not Oxford but it also started later so they had a better idea about the safety in the elderly as this had been explored in the earlier phase 3 trials run by Oxford.

&gt; Why would Oxford still include some elderly, in the first place? If you don’t want to test it on old folks, then you would exclude them ALL.

Because it's not about not testing it on old people it's about scaling up to old people slowly. First you inject 2-3, if they are all fine then you do 5-10 ect. that way if you spot something off you have injected the least amount of people with vaccine that could potentially be harmful. As I said there are plenty of old people in the trials who have had the vaccine now but because they had the vaccine a bit later than the younger groups the data in terms of efficacy isn't there yet in the public data (although certainly will be in the US trial).

&gt; They had old people in the phase 3 trial, just not enough to have a statistical significant outcome. What a waste of the elderly’s time and effort, who volunteered in the trial.

Again 2 outcomes, primarily safety but also efficacy. The phase 3 trials also aren't finished yet, as more cases accrue confidence intervals will tighten.

&gt; These are not the actions of folks who are concerned about safety of the elderly

Suppose you have 100 people who are vaccinated, and 100 who are not, behaving the same way with the same protocols.  Place these groups in an 90% susceptible population.

If on average, a typical member of the unvaccinated group infects 2 people , per person, an average member the vaccinated group would infect 0.2 people per person.  

This really affects the 'odds' that you are an infected person.  But per person, your ability to shed and spread might become a yes or no proposition.  Or it might not.  Two scenarios are numerically possible.

Example.  Suppose 100 vaccinated people all have shedding, but at small rates.  you can get a basic reproductive number of 0.2, because they shed so little on average each, it is difficult for a new infection to take hold.

Now, consider the  same 100 vaccinated people, but different shedding pattern.  If  90 % don't shed, and 10 shed 'a lot more', then those 10 people might infect 2 people on average, but for the overall group, this would still yield an R0, basic reproductive number, of 0.2

We appear to be looking at the latter scenario, based on a cursory meta skimming of research from Pfizer from Israel.   This would also be consistent with the somewhat observed phenomenon of 'super spreaders', that amongst our population, people do not shed at consistent rates.  Same pattern appears to be happening with vaccination, but everyone's shedding is attenuated from a baseline that varies person to person.  

It might seem like nuance, but from a public policy standpoint, the distinction is actually important.  With scenario one, removing mask policy's might have a different outcome than scenario two.  I could whip up a math model to prove this, but I am sure someone already has.  Good thing Pfizer will be studying Israel perpetually, so we can get good data en masse in a real world scenario, and this picture should clarify, and quickly allow us all to update public policy.",,,1613930048,{},go8wc3y,False,t3_lox3ga,False,True,t1_go8bwdg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lox3ga/pfizerbiontech_shot_stops_covids_spread_israeli/go8wc3y/,1613930123,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Today we average about 1.5 million tests per day (with the capacity to go up to about 2 million, we just don't need that many at the moment) and are probably only missing 2 infections for every one that we catch.

AZ 65+ the issue was from the 600+ people only 2 tested positive.  The number of antibodies was high and showed a similar reaction to people under 65. No a stretch to say it would work.

Pfizer 3 week extension.  It wasn't exactly a stretch to imagine that it would still be effective, the vast majority of other vaccines also have better results with a gap between initial and jab.

RISK.  So say increasing the time to booster had an awful impact, how bad would have it have been death?  No.  So let's say it stopped working and the booster would have zero impact.  There are other vaccines on the market people could of had those, also people are in hard lockdown. What it did do was double (if not more) the lives saved.

While there is obviously a much higher caseload than the confirmed numbers one thing we know is that the attack rate is not 100% even within many households.   For instance my friend was the epicenter of an early super spreader event in NY which they did some hardcore tracing on.   He had huge levels of viral shedding (he infected 8 out of 15 people he was with at a group meeting for 3 hours).  Yet in his household of 6, 2 were determined to have never gotten it through coupling no symptoms with extensive antibody tests.   Same with 4 different friends they got it were careful and seem to have only infected one (or no other members of their households).  

When you consider that only 25%(ish) of the US population live alone and the attack rate of Covid within a household doesn’t seem to be above 80% (I remember them discussing that on a twiv last summer).  I understand that there are other things the military congregate care and other random populations come into play.   But I think that that roughly speaking for us to have over 55% of the population to have had Covid that would mean that way over 50% of the households in America would have had Covid.  I find that highly unlikely.   

I think if you mostly associate with people not being careful it might seem like that but I think of my family scattered across multiple states the only cases in any of us were in congregate care.  We all live in areas that have had huge waves but we have been taking this serious from the beginning.  While there are some areas where there are huge incidences of infection.

I wasn’t suggesting you said anything about benefit, I was explaining that the CHO doesn’t weigh in my decision because I have a doctor who I trust 100% and why.

I don’t know what the benefits will truly be, no one does, and no vaccine was expected to eradicate the disease either, only one vaccine in history has been credited with that, the best anyone has hoped for was similar to all our other vaccines, to reduce risk and make the disease more manageable to control on multiple fronts so we can start mapping out our new normal.

Maybe I’m not understanding you.

What is it you don’t trust exactly?
The plan was not developed by the CHO, it’s a plan that’s been tweaked from country to country based on specific risks but predominantly follow a similar model so he really can’t take credit for much accept selling the idea of it, which has little to do with his outdated opinion on aerosols.

And him taking the jab to improve public confidence has little to do with his opinion on aerosols either. He’s gonna react to the vaccine the same way no matter his opinion. 
This only addresses vaccine hesitancy based on fear of the unkown, that’s the point of the demonstration.
If someone you trust takes the jab does it change how you perceive the results if your vaccine hesitant and just want to see how it affects others first and know that prominent people arnt avoiding it because that would raise suspicion?

I honestly don’t understand your point, I’m not having a dig, I just want to understand.

I don’t trust anyone, not even myself because I’m not medically or scientifically trained.

With such a decision looming I needed to consider who I trust to help me decide, it’s not the CHO, I don’t know him, he’s proven nothing to me except that he is willing to step forward and take a shot.

I’m fortunate that I do have a practitioner who is highly regarded and has 38 years of proven care for me under his belt. I don’t think most people have that.

Yeah, it’s gonna be a little colder for one winter and the energy bills will be higher, but it’s one of the easiest ways to make indoor spaces safer during a pandemic.

So first of all, I agree that good ventilation is crucial for decreasing the SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in the air.

I just want to add that *not in all cases* opening windows improves ventilation. It is useful in scenarios where you get *cross-draught* (opposite sides of the room have a route to outdoor air).

If you do not get cross-draught, then you actually can make the ventilation worse by opening a window. You see, what happens is that you then lose the underpressure of the room. That in turn leads the air to short-circuiting to the output vents. You get these pipes of air flowing from outside straight to output vents, while the rest of the air in the room remains stagnant. However, if you retain underpressure, then the air circulates through every nook and cranny in the room.

&gt;In their announcement of the results, Pfizer and BioNTech revealed a surprise. The companies said they had decided not to conduct the 32-case analysis “after a discussion with the FDA.” Instead, they planned to conduct the analysis after 62 cases. But by the time the plan had been formalized, there had been 94 cases of Covid-19 in the study. It’s not known how many were in the vaccine arm, but it would have to be nine or fewer.

&gt;Gruber said that Pfizer and BioNTech had decided in late October that they wanted to drop the 32-case interim analysis. At that time, the companies decided to stop having their lab confirm cases of Covid-19 in the study, instead leaving samples in storage. The FDA was aware of this decision. Discussions between the agency and the companies concluded, and testing began this past Wednesday. When the samples were tested, there were 94 cases of Covid in the trial. The DSMB met on Sunday.

&gt;This means that the statistical strength of the result is likely far stronger than was initially expected. It also means that if Pfizer had held to the original plan, the data would likely have been available in October, as its CEO, Albert Bourla, had initially predicted.

All logic and evidence suggests they will help reduce transmission.  (Via lower viral loads, shorter duration of infection and reducing coughing.) We do not know exactly how much they help.   

It won’t be perfect.   There will be a risk a vaccinated individual could still transit it.  But if you’re talking about herd immunity, all you really need is for it to work the majority of the time.

If it prevents 75% of onward transmission, it still works in the end (assuming high uptake and eventual vaccination of kids).  It just takes more time.  But if it’s at that kind of level, while it works for the population as a whole, vaccinated individuals should still be careful until case counts drop locally.  Because it’s a different risk calculation when it’s personal.   Herd immunity just means any outbreaks eventually die down before spreading too far.

&gt;Side effects from unauthorized medicines may not be compensated for by the government, the health ministry warned.

&gt;A woman in her 40s in Shizuoka Prefecture is among those who have imported such drugs. She took ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug produced by an Indian company that is not approved for treating COVID-19 in Japan.

&gt;She ordered the drug through an import agent after doing her own research, including by reading papers available from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

&gt;“I bought it as I thought that I had to take it, at my own risk, to prevent infection,” she said.

&gt;Japan’s Kitasato Institute has been conducting a clinical trial to determine the efficacy of ivermectin in treating COVID-19.

&gt;There are several unauthorized medicines, including ivermectin, that have been ordered by people in Japan to protect against the coronavirus, an import agent said.

&gt;This is apparently because the use of remdesivir and dexamethasone, drugs approved by Japanese regulators to treat COVID-19, requires a prescription.

&gt;“Many clients ordering medicine to treat COVID-19 are those in their 50s and 60s, who are at higher risk of developing severe symptoms,” the agent said.

&gt;Hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug once touted by former U.S. President Donald Trump as a treatment for COVID-19, and the HIV treatment lopinavir were previously popular among people looking for treatment. But the World Health Organization did not find any evidence that they can be used to treat COVID-19.

&gt;There are some foreign-based import agents touting unauthorized medicines as COVID-19 treatments in violation of the pharmaceutical and medical device law, which bans advertising of such drugs.

&gt;“Generally speaking, no one guarantees what’s inside imported medicines. It’s extremely dangerous to take them on one’s own judgment,” said an official of the ministry’s Tuberculosis and Infectious Diseases Control Division.",,,1613907199,{},go7v4uy,False,t3_lor7mg,False,True,t1_go7nbbb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lor7mg/japan_warns_against_use_of_unauthorized_covid19/go7v4uy/,1613907210,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Speed of infections underline the devastating potential of the British mutation and raise questions as to how vulnerable children might be to contracting this particular variant**
https://cphpost.dk/?p=122479

February 19th, 2021 9:13 am| by Ben Hamilton
Two schools and eight daycare institutions in the central Jutland city of Kolding will remain closed until Friday 26 following coronavirus outbreaks that experts claim underline the devastating potential of the British variant of COVID-19.

At the last count the two schools had a total of 69 infections among staff and students, while up to 20 have been infected at the daycare institutions. 

Something weird with the kids
Speaking to DR, Viggo Andreasen, an associate professor at Roskilde University who is swiftly becoming the nation’s favourite mathematical epidemiologist, questions whether there is “something going on with the infection of [the British variant] B117 among children that we have not seen with the old coronavirus”. 

“If we see more examples like this, then we must ask ourselves whether it is too risky to open the schools to the little ones,” he continued.

“This means there is a good risk that infection chains will run for quite some time before we discover them. There are probably also some parents who have become infected.”

Another wave in April?
Professor Allan Randrup Thomsen, a virologist connected to the University of Copenhagen who advises the government, questions whether there can be a partial reopening of society on March 1.

“Based on what has happened in Kolding, we can see that there is a great potential for infection with the British variant – even under the restrictions we have now. 

“When the British variant takes over, there will be a marked increase in the number of infected and hospitalised in April.”",,,1613868223,{},go6cv6g,True,t3_lokcox,False,True,t1_go68zws,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lokcox/regeringen_lukker_alle_skoler_og_daginstitutioner/go6cv6g/,1613868233,1,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,tomistruth,,,[],,,,text,t2_648vbo14,False,False,[],"I was there. saw the whole ordeal firsthand. So here are some insights.

Germany is no model, never was. 

They failed miserably in understanding covid19 just like all Western nations. 
The data was there. 
The studies were out. 
The government ignored them. 

So when China sent tanks, troops and quarantained 20 million people, Germany believed the virus could be contained easily. They believed China only wanted to demonstrate its military prowess and the Chinese casualties resulted from China's outdated equipment and poor health care system. They believed the virus was no problem. Having just lived through the rêcnt Ebola scare and manufactured millions unused Ebola vaccines, the German government thought this virus would just go away. They were wrong.

But to understand why Germany failed so miserably, let's first take a look who was heading the health ministry. The German health minister Jens Spahn, educated in banking (true) was brought in by industry lobbyists to weaken the national healthcare system. Every single pre-covid interview with Spahn is about him trying to profile himself while absolutely doing nothing but ridiculing doctors and healthcare personel. His only redeeming feature is his short term, that should hopefully end with Merkel's term.

It just so happened that when covid19 hit Europe, Germany employed one of the most incompetent health minister in history. Jens Spahn is the John Snow of health. He knows nothing. He called covid19 a mild flu on television. He did not warn the nation about the virus or prepared supply and logistics to prepare for an influx of patients, for 4 months he did absolutely nothing, but ridiculed the virus. He even issued a nation wide media campaign calling people warning about the virus conspiracy theorists and nutters. This backfired greatly when 2 months later he went full back throttle and half of the population refused to quarataine.

He wasted 4 months doing nothing but media campaigns and giving interviews. When Covid hit Germany, he refused to cancel the German Carneval festival with over 100,000 people attending. When asked why he did not cancel, he responded he didn't want to appear alarmists. A day later he called the media and police to find all Carneval attendees and get tested. A week later he refused to cancel a Bundesliga game with tens of thousands viewers 10km from the covid outbreak. Guess town developed into a covid clusterfuck? Yep!

It was chancelor Merkel who got frustrated with Spahn's performance that she called up leading Chinese doctors to hear about their experiences herself first hand. After the video conference Germany immediately issued preparations to go into a full lockdown. Sadly, half the population were told for months to doubt the virus even existed. And doubting they did. It took a massive media campaign and daily briefings for months to deprogram the population and to make them care again about this disease.


Bonus story: Germany's mask fiasco

Not only did Jens Spahn fail to understand the danger of disease. He fucked up by sending almost all n95 masks and oxygen equipment as humanitarian aid to China 2 weeks prior to thr large covid outbreak in Germany. Doctors, nurses, nobody had masks or any form of protective gear. A doctor friend of mine literally worked in the epi center during the outbreak. He said the only thing they were given were the green surgery masks. It took 3 months and 11 billion Euro to finally get some n95 into German hospitals. Scalpers and had bought all masks so the German governmrnt bought them for 18 dollar a piece,  a  whopping 2000% markup. Luckily Germany is rich. But that's not all. The German Bundeswehr was ordered to secure strategic ppe stocks only to be scammed by an African salesman. They got swindled for over 200 million euro (? Can't remember exact figure). After seeing the absolute incompetence of the German federal government, the local Bavarian government organized their own task force to secure millions of masks in China, only for them to be stolen by bandits because they were stored in unlocked(!) storage rooms.",,,1613868117,{},go6coa0,False,t3_loa1nh,False,True,t3_loa1nh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/loa1nh/germany_once_a_model_is_swamped_like_everyone/go6coa0/,1613868128,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The kids are pretty good about masks, and I do think they work (although I wish we required quality masks - some kids wear one layer gaiters). At my school, one of the teachers’ big concerns is lunch. You can’t tell kids not to eat all day, and we don’t have enough space to keep them six feet apart while eating. At least one school in my state has already had a confirmed cluster of cases tied to lunchtime. We try to encourage them to eat quickly and put masks back on, but you also don’t want to stress them out and have them rush and end up sick to their stomachs, or decide to skip eating.

I agree we shouldn’t keep schools closed forever because of one group of parents, but I also think disadvantaged kids are being used a lot as an example of kids who are being hurt by closures, and people need to realize that just opening schools ASAP with no safety precautions will not help those kids. Improvements to ventilation, spacing, and other safety measures would reassure more parents and make them feel more safe about their kids returning in addition to reassuring teachers.

I would be a hundred percent in favor of getting rid of standardized measures, or at the very least doing them to flag areas we can help a kid, but not using them in a punitive way.

That’s the failure on the federal level. 

When it comes to the vaccines we DO have, the distribution is an absolute shitshow. 

While the money comes from the feds, healthcare is a provincial (state) responsibility. Especially in Ontario, it’s been a debacle. Constant lockdowns and reopenings, no real structure or organization for the vaccine rollout, fudging of numbers… the list goes on.

[],,agnikaix,,,[],,,,text,t2_6ox8kavw,False,False,[],"I'm a native CA resident and I see conservatives such as yourself always railing on CA like it's the *worst* place in the world. It's not perfect but it's not as terrible as conservatives believe. 

1. CA's poverty rates are in the middle. the highest poverty rates are in states like Mississippi, West Virginia, Arkansas, Alabama, etc
2. Taxes have actually been suppressed thanks to Prop 13. I do not mind paying higher taxes if it means better schools, people don't work under poverty wages, roads get fixed etc. But this comes down more to political values about taxes than objective measures of what is ""bad"" and ""good."" I'd rather live in CA with higher taxes than Alabama with lower taxes but that is personal preference.
3. Corrupt politicians exist in every state. I worked for the City of LA and SF for several years, including for some major politicians. Some are corrupt, but many truly worked hard for their constituents. I think that is true whether you're in CA or TX. 
4. I will concede on unemployment right now but pre-pandemic it was at 3%. I think it's fair to criticize Gavin for his strict tier system of shutting down businesses. But it's not like this place is garbage. SF Bay Area's economy still is one of the strongest in the world.  T**he SF metropolitan area** alone has more economic power/GDP than some of richest ***countries*** in the world. 
5. **Declining population is a good thing for CA actually.** Too many people moved into CA during the 2010s. As soon as some tech companies left in 2020 (with still plenty here including this website Reddit) and people worked remotely, rent has become actually more affordable! It's better for CA that jobs are not concentrated all in one place. It's great to see tech is now also in cities like Austin, Denver, etc.
6. Homelessness is a fair criticism. CA has a huge number of high paying jobs concentrated in one place but also a strong culture of NIMBYs who don't wan't new housing built, this results in a supply and demand problem.

In all honesty - it's controversial. Traditional thought has been that chemotherapies will lower immune responses - due to impacts on white blood cells. I do know there are a few chemotherapies that are being developed in order to work with immunotherapies, but I haven't seen any that are currently in use for human trials (those are known as combination therapies - combining different therapies at once). Those are in mice models atm, but they have had promising results.

The current immunotherapies I see being tested are usually being used either on their own or as a very last-ditch effort. For example - either they may be used straight off the bat in an experimental cohort, or if all other standards of care treatments have failed. For a more personal example of a patient I saw, they first went through radiation treatment, then chemotherapy, and after all that failed, were then put under experimental immunotherapy. The alternative would have been to start off the bat with experimental immunotherapy, but many patients are reluctant as it's not the standard of care (which is completely understandable). 

Generally - it also comes down to IRB requirements (Institutional review boards). Human studies are VERY highly regulated - and immunotherapies are extremely recent (around the last 10-20 years). We want to study the effect of immunotherapies on their own first before we proceed to attempt combination therapies. As a result, we currently aren't combining chemotherapy with immunotherapy - we're generally trying to see if immunotherapy is effective on its own first before we proceed to the next step of combination with chemotherapy.

This is consistent with real-world data (countries / states which had lockdowns didn't really seem to do any better than countries and states which didn't). 

It also makes sense intuitively. Social contact is a basic human need. Any effort to ban it is bound to fail for the same reason that prohibition and ""abstinence-only"" sex education failed.

&gt;The delays brought the city’s “entire vaccination effort” to a “standstill,” Avery Cohen, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, wrote on Twitter.

&gt;Vicious winter weather has snarled vaccine deliveries nationwide. The White House estimated that the weather had created a backlog of six million doses, and pleaded with local officials to extend hours at vaccination site and schedule additional appointments. The bad weather has slowed two vaccine shipping hubs — a FedEx center in Memphis and a UPS site in Louisville. And the Federal Emergency Management Agency said this week that more than 2,000 vaccine sites were in areas with power outages.

&gt;In Texas, where millions of residents lost power during this week’s powerful storm, a delivery of more than 400,000 first doses and 330,000 second doses was delayed in anticipation of the bad weather. In Houston, Harris County Public Health began vaccinating people again on Friday, but it warned that the department had a limited number of doses because of shipment delays from the winter storm.

&gt;Mr. de Blasio said on Friday that New York City had delayed scheduling up to 35,000 first dose appointments because of the shortage. As New Yorkers faced another snowstorm at the end of the week, messages on social media reported that some people who had trekked to city hospitals for their appointments had been turned away because of low supplies.

&gt;Despite the delays, New York State is still scheduling appointments for new mass vaccination sites opening in Brooklyn and Queens on Feb. 24, in partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

&gt;State officials said that they had received 40 percent of their vaccine allocation for the week, and that they expected the remainder would be distributed on Sunday.

&gt;The new sites, at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn and York College in Queens, are open to residents of only select ZIP codes and are intended to increase low vaccination rates in communities of color. ZIP code data released on Tuesday showed drastic disparities between vaccination rates in whiter areas of New York City as compared with predominantly Black neighborhoods.


&gt;Mr. Cuomo said in a statement on Friday that he expected the FEMA sites would have “a dramatic impact on some of our hardest hit communities.”

&gt;Eligible New Yorkers who meet residency requirements for the new vaccination sites can schedule appointments through the state’s website, or by calling 1-833-NYS-4-VAX (1-833-697-4829.)",,,1613863571,{},go64cfp,True,t3_lojfid,False,True,t3_lojfid,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lojfid/covid19_live_news_new_york_city_is_down_to_1000/go64cfp/,1613863583,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Here's my thinking of why ""herd immunity"" and vaccines can't really explain the current drop:

1. It's dropping like crazy even in places where smaller percentages of the population have previously been infected (San Francisco, Canada) than other places;
2. we STILL see some of the previously harder-hit places with higher rates than less-hard hit places. Like, down to the zip code where some of the poorer zip codes in New York City that have previously been hit the hardest are STILL getting more cases per capita than rich zip codes where far fewer people had previously been infected. There are clearly other factors besides percentage of the population that is immune that is swamping immunity effects.
3. vaccination isn't even close to high enough to explain 1&amp;2.

[],,among_apes,,,[],,,,text,t2_1a2axxm4,False,False,[],"Herd immunity is a fluid term that can and is impacted greatly not just by population but by the actions of individuals within that population.  

When there is an outbreak of Ebola in an area they often find piles of dead gorillas and basically end up having entire groups of them die.  Once they start getting sick they don’t know any better and they cluster and all die.   Yet humans have learned that taking care of people with Ebola is very dangerous and could easily wipe out many many family members.   Which has birthed macabre sayings like “leave them food and water and once their dead burn the hut”.  Situational awareness impacts decisions and actions which in a sense will give you your actual circulating population.   This In turn will determine the % of infection needed from that population to see dips and peaks of infection waves.  

Right now 25-30% of America is subsidizing and thus lowering the threshold for a pseudo herd immunity for the rest by not mingling.  

I see no reason to jettison the estimated you see coming from the CDC and others that put us at or near 30%.   Another interesting thought is that the most “out and about” people once eliminated as a vector through natural infection are probably worth more being taken out of the equation than the ones being mildly cautious.  

Also think about a partially infected household like I mentioned above.  If 4/6 members have had Covid they serve as a vector shield to the remaining 2.  

My point overall is there are ways to explain a precipitous drop in infections without having to say that easily 55% of the population has had it.  I think that the estimate of 30-35% is about right and can easily be seen to fit what we are experiencing.   Remember we still are seeing 65k confirmed  (obviously a crap ton more that aren’t caught) infections a day.

When I have someone come into the ER with chest pain that I suspect is in the context of anxiety/panic, I don't say ""it's all in your head, go home"". Instead I gather a history, I explain that there are many causes of chest pain and in the ER we are best suited to diagnose or rule out a small number of major or life threatening causes, but once we've ruled those out we can talk more about what else it could be. Then I come back post testing to reassure them it's not something dangerous, and explore other causes. Unless there is a clear alternative cause I try to leave things very open ended, I discuss how pain can worsen anxiety and anxiety can worsen pain - I'm not suggesting anxiety is causing your pain, but I've seen many patients where it can make them more aware of their pain or less able to cope with it etc etc. I then finish by suggesting a follow up plan if it persists or recurs, and tell them what to watch out for.

It might be faster to say ""it's not your heart, it's in your head, go home"", but that ignores their suffering and doesn't provide them with any tools to understand or address their symptoms... Makes them feel ignored/misunderstood etc etc.

What is the alternative though? As much as I'd love for us to drop the mask and distance measures, the virus doesn't care what's convenient for us, it isn't political, and it'll do its thing regardless of what we want.

The responsible thing for him to say right now is to continue the masking and distancing throughout 2021, because the alternative is worse:

If you tell people ""Hey, get vaccinated, then you don't have to wear masks or stay indoors anymore!"" you're going to have people who go out and get sick before the vaccine fully kicks in, or people who still contract the virus because it's not 100% effective, or people who will go out and pretend they've been vaccinated when they haven't been, or people who incorrectly assume everyone who's out and about is safe to be around (not realizing they are contributing to the very problem they assume is gone).

The legislation extends unemployment assistance not only for employees but also for independent contractors and other self-employed individuals for 11 weeks.

It was all a bit amusing to watch for the handful of veteran AIDS activists who have a long history with Fauci, one that went from frustrated and adversarial to friendly and collaborative in the space of only a few short years in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

In that time, Fauci, simultaneously sitting down amiably with some ACT UP activists while parrying more belligerent public protests from their comrades, opened himself up to activist recommendations. Most notably, he dramatically loosened HIV-drug clinical trial requirements so that a far greater number of desperate patients could try new compounds (an approach called “parallel tracking”), expanded research on HIV/AIDS and its treatment in underrepresented women and/or people of color, and gave activists and people living with HIV seats at the table of the planning committee of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG).

Fauci also played a key role in getting the federal research apparatus to incorporate those recommendations, in what amounted to perhaps the first time that federal health bureaucrats acceded almost fully to community and activist demands.

“He’s the man for this moment,” says Peter Staley, an ACT UP and Treatment Action Group (TAG) veteran who grew so close to Fauci that they would often have dinner together at the Washington, D.C., home of Fauci’s assistant, James Hill, Ph.D. “He’s always had skills that are matched for epidemics. He’s one of the best scientists on epidemic control, but he can translate the complexities of epidemics into lay terms in a way that engenders trust to almost any audience he speaks to.”

Says Jim Eigo, also an ACT UP treatment activist veteran, “Fauci was a sparring partner with us, and then a friend.” He recalls the letter of recommendation for parallel tracking that he and other ACT UPers sent to Fauci.",,,1613933592,{},go94kiv,False,t3_lp040d,False,True,t1_go93ynb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lp040d/fauci_possible_americans_will_be_wearing_masks_in/go94kiv/,1613934016,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

States were stashing vaccine allotments for second doses because they did not trust the federal government to supply them with a steady stream of vaccine, and the local government would then have to answer to their citizens if they could not get a second dose on time. 

The biden Administration is working hard to give more information to local governments about projected supply with 3-week lead, so to comfort states with trust about future supply and organization so they can feel OK to give their stored doses immediately to people. 

This is likely resulted in an already increased vaccination rate in the last few weeks.

Also, and i don't know this. but i would suspect the contract would be along the lines of; if you can ensure you can meet the UK supplies on the deadlines given, then AstraZeneca are freely allowed to supply other contracts. (otherwise why would AstraZeneca sign the agreement as it limits supply).

the difference is with a contract its a fair playing feild as either the EU or the UK could have put this stipulation in.

&gt;Next time I say “they made sure they supply to UK only” 
i mean you can say what you want, but i suspect this is also factually incorrect. as i say above i suspect the UK in their contact said to AstraZeneca that AstraZeneca was to try their best efforts to supply the UK requirements first. any above can go to other customers.

I understand you're getting down votes, not by me, on this topic as its quite an emotive one. I personally want to have a discussion about it, and if i'm wrong corrected. 

&gt;EU blocking exports while they are the ones actually sharing their limited supply with New Zealand, Australia and Canada and other commonwealth nations.

this is very nobel of them. I think [source](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56117120), that once the UK has vaccinated everyone they can they will donate the vaccines to other countries. I know this has large support with the populace (again i'm getting a source). 

&gt;while they make sure to prioritise themselves and blame the EU.

I cant blame them for prioritising themselves. and im not sure about blamining the EU. i thought the early comments were from the EU and Ursula von der Leyen. although the timing etc, is very complicated, and i could be very wrong on this. there ofcourse have been very many discussions about brexit, although in this case it wasn't an export legislation issue. so not sure how brexit comes into play.",,,1613937793,{},go9elm8,False,t3_lokdw6,False,True,t1_go9abqp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lokdw6/twothirds_of_65to69yearolds_have_had_covid_vaccine/go9elm8/,1613938748,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;About 145 million doses are set for delivery in the next 5 1/2 weeks, with an additional 200 million expected by the end of May and a further 200 million by the end of July.

An extra 145,000,000 doses by April. Assuming a perfect two doses per person, that's enough to give a majority of adults their first dose by early April. I honestly think the goal, whether it's a publicly announced goal or something internal, should be seventy percent of adults getting their first shot by the end of May. I believe that would be around 120,000,000 people over the next few months, which I feel is pretty reasonable with Pfizer doubling production and the likely scenario that Johnson and Johnson's vaccine gets approved. With how many people have been infected, that would effectively mean herd immunity.

If Biden does this right, I think we'll be more than safe enough for a normal summer. Maybe it's a high expectation, but that's really gonna be what would make me say he did a good job.

This question was not studied as part of the clinical trials. Until there's certainty, the whole point is to continue wearing masks until everyone/a greater proportion of your personal network (family/friends/coworkers) is vaccinated. 

&gt;Will the COVID vaccine prevent me from infecting others?

&gt;The answer is, we don't know. Clinical trials of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines found that both do a good job preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease, including severe COVID-19. However, the trials did not measure whether a person who is vaccinated is less likely to spread the virus to someone else.

&gt;It's possible that the vaccines protect against COVID-19 disease by preventing a person from becoming infected in the first place. However, it's also possible that the vaccine protects a person from COVID-19 illness, but does not prevent a person from becoming infected. In other words, a vaccinated person may have replicating virus in their nose and throat even if they are protected from becoming sick.

&gt;But does that mean that you have enough virus in your nose and throat to infect someone else? Not necessarily. It's possible that the immune response triggered by the vaccine, which protects you from becoming sick, also reduces the amount of virus in your nose and throat to a point where you are unlikely to spread it to someone else. But we need more research to know for sure.

&gt;The bottom line? If you're among the first groups of people to get vaccinated, it's best to continue wearing masks and maintaining physical distance in order to protect others who haven't yet gotten the vaccine.

But failure to eradicate the virus does not mean that death, illness  or social isolation will continue on the scales seen so far. The future  will depend heavily on the type of immunity people acquire through  infection or vaccination and how the virus evolves. Influenza and the  four human coronaviruses that cause common colds are also endemic: but a  combination of annual vaccines and acquired immunity means that  societies tolerate the seasonal deaths and illnesses they bring without  requiring lockdowns, masks and social distancing.

More than one-third of the respondents to *Nature*’s  survey thought that it would be possible to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 from  some regions while it continued to circulate in others. In zero-COVID  regions there would be a continual risk of disease outbreaks, but they  could be quenched quickly by herd immunity if most people had been  vaccinated. “I guess COVID will be eliminated from some countries, but  with a continuing (and maybe seasonal) risk of reintroduction from  places where vaccine coverage and public-health measures have not been  good enough,” says Christopher Dye, an epidemiologist at the University  of Oxford, UK.

The virus becoming endemic is likely, but the pattern that it will take  is hard to predict,” says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist from  Georgetown University, who is based in Seattle, Washington. This will  determine the societal costs of SARS-CoV-2 for 5, 10 or even 50 years in  the future (see ‘Coronavirus: here to stay?’).""

We have a population of roughly 330 million.  Half of that is 165 million.  We currently have had about 28 million confirmed cases, let’s be super generous and say they all have antibodies that are robust enough to fight off the virus.  That leaves us with 137 million more to go.  Currently we have vaccinated about 11.5% of the population, about 40 million people, that’s everyone that has had at least one shot.  Now we are at 97 million more people needing either getting the virus or the shot.  That would be about 1.4 million people per day.  We are maxing out at 1.6 million shots given per day but you can logically cut that number in half as everyone is getting two shots.

There’s my down and dirty math.  Lots and lots of things have to be perfect, including about a 40% increase in daily vaccinations and herd immunity has to be reached with only 50% of the population having antibodies.  What’s not possible is herd immunity by April.

If your ancestors underwent natural selection during the Black Death (Bubonic Plague) you are likely more resistant to COVID.

An *incredible* percentage of the population of Western Europe died. On the whole, the people that survived had greater resistance to the disease. 

The Bubonic Plague did not spread to the America’s (North, Central or South), Iceland, or Southern Africa. If your ancestors are from there, they didn’t get any genetic benefit from the plague (but also didn’t suffer horribly).

The coronavirus vaccine rollout is in full flight in the UK, and Vaccine Minister, Nadhim Zahawi, has revealed that the Government's target to vaccinate the 15m most vulnerable people in the UK with their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine was met on Feb 14.

As of Feb 19, 17,247,442 million people in the UK have had at least one Covid vaccine since the programme was launched - amounting to approximately one in five adults - while 604,885 of those have received a second dose.

Almost 90 per cent of people aged 80 and over have been vaccinated in England. Vaccinations have now begun in priority groups three and four, which includes those in their 70s - some 5.6 million people - and people listed as clinically extremely vulnerable.

On Feb 5, it emerged that England and Wales are hoping to have vaccinated all over-50s by early May. 

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine are the two jabs currently in rotation in the UK, with doses developed by Moderna, which was approved on Jan 8, expected to arrive by spring. New results on Feb 2 showed that a single dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine prevents two-thirds of Covid transmissions, raising hopes for the easing of restrictions by Easter.

Sixty million doses of the Novavax jab have been secured by the UK, which Mr Zahawi was himself injected with as part of the trial, which was shown to be 89.3 per cent effective in preventing coronavirus in participants.

How does the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine work?
The vaccine – called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 – uses a harmless, weakened version of a common virus that causes colds in chimpanzees.

Researchers have already used this technology to produce vaccines against a number of pathogens including flu, Zika and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers). The virus is genetically modified so it is impossible for it to grow in humans.

Scientists have transferred the genetic instructions for coronavirus's specific ""spike protein"" – which it needs to invade cells – to the vaccine.

When the vaccine enters cells inside the body, it uses this genetic code to produce the surface spike protein of the coronavirus. This induces an immune response, priming the immune system to attack coronavirus if it infects the body.

How effective is it?
Oxford University and AstraZeneca – a British-Swedish multinational pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Cambridge – announced that their jab was effective in preventing many people getting ill and it has been shown to work in different age groups, including the elderly.

Partial immunity against Sars-Cov-2 is then detected approximately 22 days after administration of the first dose, the MHRA reported.

Data published in The Lancet in early December showed the vaccine was 62 per cent effective in preventing Covid-19 among a group of 4,440 people given two standard doses of the vaccine, when compared with 4,455 people given a placebo drug. The overall Lancet data, which was peer-reviewed, set out full results from clinical trials of more than 20,000 people.

Among the people given the placebo drug, 10 were admitted to hospital with coronavirus, including two with severe Covid-19 which resulted in one death. However, among those receiving the vaccine, there were no hospital admissions or severe cases. The combined analysis from both dosing regimens resulted in an average efficacy of 70.4 per cent.

According to new results, a single dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine prevents two-thirds of Covid transmissions, raising hopes for the easing of restrictions by Easter.

The data, released on Feb 2, also revealed that the first jab prevents 100 per cent of hospitalisations after 22 days once an immune response has had time to develop. 

The study found a single dose was 76 per cent effective in fending off infection between 22 days and 90 days post-injection, rising to 82.4 per cent after a second dose at that stage. 

In a major vindication of government policy, the study also found that the vaccine is more effective overall if the second dose is delayed from 28 days until 90 days. 

Is it effective against the new variants?
Data on the highly contagious Covid-19 variant identified in England do not suggest that the AstraZeneca / Oxford vaccines will be less effective against it.

“We have the most data on the UK variant. That doesn’t suggest that it will be any less well protected against by the vaccine,” said Wei Shen Lim, chair of Covid-19 Immunisation on Britain’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, on Jan 13.

The Oxford University researchers who developed the jab say it has a similar efficacy against the variant compared to the original Covid-19 strain it was tested against.

Professor Andrew Pollard, a chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, said new data suggests ""the vaccine not only protects against the original pandemic virus, but also protects against the novel variant, B.1.1.7"".

But research has revealed that the Oxford vaccine ""provides minimal protection"" against mild disease caused by the variant of Covid-19 first discovered in South Africa, according to early data from a small trial.

A study suggested the Oxford vaccine was only 10 per cent effective against the variant.

The study, from South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand and Oxford University, analysed the E484K mutation in some 2,000 people, most of whom were young and healthy. 

The team found that the vaccine had ""substantially reduced"" efficacy against the South African variant compared to the original strain of Sars-Cov-2. 

South African authorities suspended the country's vaccination programme on Monday 8 Feb following this discovery, stating more research is needed. 

Professor Salim Abdool Karim, leader of South Africa's Covid response, said: “We don’t want to end up with a situation where we vaccinate a million people or two million people with a vaccine that may not be effective at preventing hospitalisation and severe disease.""

However, scientists advising the World Health Organization warned against jumping to conclusions and actually awarded emergency-use licenses to two versions of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab on Monday 15 February.

Many experts have pointed out that the study on the South African variant was small. While it looked into whether the vaccine prevents mild and moderate disease in a group of mostly young people, it did not look at whether the vaccine prevents severe disease, hospitalisation and deaths.

Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxford, told the BBC she was confident the vaccine would prevent severe illness.

However, a tweaked Oxford vaccine which can cope with the new coronavirus variants circulating in Britain will be trialled in the coming months before being rolled out in the the autumn, scientists have said. And the World Health Organization looks set to approve the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for use in developing countries.

Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech both said their vaccines were effective against new variants of the coronavirus discovered in Britain and South Africa, but they are slightly less protective against the variant in South Africa, which may be more adept at dodging antibodies in the bloodstream.

As a precaution, Moderna has begun developing a new form of its vaccine that could be used as a booster shot against the variant in South Africa.

It was also announced on Feb 5 that the UK Government has struck a deal with the German drugs firm CureVac for 50million doses of vaccine designed to beat future variants.

How is the rollout going?
The Oxford vaccine rollout began on Jan 4 at the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust's Churchill Hospital.

The government has met its goal to offer the vaccine to everyone in the top four priority groups by Feb 15. In light of this success, the government hopes to offer the coronavirus vaccine to all over-50s by early May.

As of Feb 19, 17,247,442 people in the UK have had at least one dose of the vaccine with 604,885 having received two doses. 

Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi announced on Feb 4 the opening of  39 new vaccine sites and 62 more pharmacy-led sites to make ""vaccinating the most vulnerable even quicker and even simpler"".

There are now 89 large vaccination centres and 194 sites run by high street pharmacies, along with 1,000 GP-led surgeries and more than 250 hospital hubs across the country administering vaccines.


What has Germany said about the vaccine?
The vaccine was approved for adults in the EU on Jan 29.

This news follows a draft recommendation from Germany’s vaccine authorities called for its use to be restricted to those aged between 18 and 64.

“There is currently insufficient data to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine from 65 years of age,” the Standing Vaccine Commission (Stiko) at the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s main centre for disease control, said.

The German recommendation was issued by an independent panel of doctors and scientists, who released detailed figures to back their findings.

They did not conclude the vaccine is ineffective in older people, but only that clinical trials had simply not included enough test subjects aged over 65 to provide any reliable data.",,,1613882026,{},go716h2,True,t3_lom9lt,False,True,t1_go6xewm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lom9lt/oxford_covid19_vaccine_qa_how_effective_is_it_and/go716h2/,1613882037,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I wasn’t suggesting that you said there was no benefit to the vaccination, u directed mis trust towards the plan and one of the people backing the planned rollout because he’s a bit behind in the subject of aerosols right?

My point about my doctor is that I don’t need to trust the CHO or the plan because I have so much faith in my doctor, and explained why I do, that wasn’t a measure of benefit at all, it was a measure of who I do trust to help me decide.

I may not have understood you either, I don’t quite understand what it is you don’t trust?

The CHOs opinions don’t really factor into my own decision to vaccinate, nor will his opinions change how he reacts or doesn’t react to the vaccine.
The fact that he and the PM, likely other prominent politicians and health advisors in the near future, are taking the jab publicly serves one purpose only, to improve confidence that it’s safe, not how much it will change the course of the pandemic cause we rely on hindsight for that.

Look, I have a lot of trust issues too, so please don’t take any of this as a dig, I’m trying to understand where your coming from.

I didn’t trust anyone would take this seriously enough to take the risks associated with preventative action, and it terrified me, not gonna lie.
Then they did take preventative action, despite initial announcements that we won’t, and here we are, one of the few countries that havnt been engulfed by continuing large scale outbreaks and daily deaths into the thousands.
They made mistakes, fixed them, made more mistakes, fixed them.

I can’t find it in me to trust anyone about this, not even myself because I’m not medically or scientifically trained. So I had to work out who I did trust and I quickly realised the one person who has proven without a doubt that I can trust, understanding that there is still risk but getting help to determine what the biggest risk is, and the CHO doesn’t factor in there at all. I don’t know him, he hasn’t spent near 40 years proving my best interest are his priority.
To me, he’s just a pretty embellishment of a demonstration that could help others who don’t have a doctor they trust as strongly as I do, to decide when they see ge doesn’t develop a severe reaction, same as PM and whoever else gets wheeled out for a demonstration. It’s not about if you trust them, it’s just about seeing the live results for safety.

The virus enters through the nose and the mucosal surfaces in the nose would need neutralizing antibodies to immediately kill the virus.  Instead you have antibodies circulating in the blood and you have systemically primed your immune system with T-cells and all that to corner it in your upper respiratory tract and easily deal with it.  But if you're exposed to it its likely that you'll be infected and some viral replication and shedding will happen before it stops.

See for example this paper on an intranasal vaccine candidate that claims to produce sterilizing immunity:

&gt; The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for effective preventive vaccination to reduce burden and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in humans. Intranasal vaccination is an attractive strategy to prevent COVID-19 as the nasal mucosa represents the first-line barrier to SARS-CoV-2 entry before viral spread to the lung. Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development is rapidly progressing, the current intramuscular vaccines are designed to elicit systemic immunity without conferring mucosal immunity. Here, we show that AdCOVID, an intranasal adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-vectored vaccine encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, elicits a strong and focused immune response against RBD through the induction of mucosal IgA, serum neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a Th1-like cytokine expression profile. Therefore, AdCOVID, which promotes concomitant systemic and local mucosal immunity, represents a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.10.331348v1.full

The thing is that the systemic reaction from the IM injection is still very good.  The neutralizing antibodies in the blood from the IM injection are also just not going to allow the virus to ""go"" anywhere and block its access to the lungs, kidneys, heart, etc.  It'll be cornered in the upper respiratory tract and the systemic immune response will be able to deal with it.

But technically all of the IM injections do not prevent infection, but they mitigate it to such an extent that most infections will be asymptomatic and short and will most likely not transmit at all (and we know the household attack rate of asymptomatic infections is less than 10% of the asymptomatic rate, so blocking symptoms should greatly reduce transmission).

The vaccine isn't a hoax, but it also isn't perfect.  It probably doesn't block initial infection at all, but it reduces severity by 95% and transmission by 90% or more and that's enough to end the pandemic.",,,1613881502,{},go70bf9,False,t3_loelz5,False,False,t1_go6ekpt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/loelz5/dr_fauci_its_very_likely_safe_for_vaccinated/go70bf9/,1613881512,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Looking at excess deaths. Sweden isn't even in the top in Europe, in fact it's in the bottom third  in Europe.

Its time for you to take abord some new facts and go to bed with the Sweden-bashing.

&gt;There are myths circulating that Sweden would be among the worst affected by covid-19 in Europe.  That was true to some extent at the end of the first wave in May, and it seems to be the image that has stuck to the retina of many.  But now you see that Sweden is one of the more lightly affected countries in Europe, says Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist, historian at Stockholm University and author of the book ""Corona - the pandemic of our time in a historical perspective"".

So Chemotherapy is essentially what you said - it’s essentially like taking a potato that you know has germs - and baking the entire thing. You’re essentially cooking the entire thing, in the hopes you get rid of bad germs. So that’s right on the dime! (For a more in-depth insight - cancer cells reproduce. What chemotherapy does, is it poisons the entire body and stops cell reproduction - ALL cells. This is why people tend to have lower white blood cells - it hits immune system reproduction too).

Surgery/radiation is much more targeted - it’s essentially if you know where the bad germs are - like if you dropped your lovely potato on the ground on a specific area. If you know the bottom of your potato is unclean, you can always chop off the bottom - aka surgery/radiation. (For more in-depth - this is often what radiation oncologists do - they target specific locations of the body with radiation, in the hopes of “burning out” the bad cells).

With immunotherapy, you want to turn the natural defenses on. It’s exactly as you said (can’t say exact words otherwise automod deletes), the only thing I’d say is that instead of going quietly, you’re actually screaming to the S.A. Most immunotherapies work in this fashion - for my first example, it would be like telling the S.A that the cell is wearing a red and green cap (showing how the cell is hiding as a normal cell and telling the immune system to go after those hiding cells). For the second example, it would be like pointing out to the S.A. where the specific cell is (when you target a bio marker, you’re telling the immune system which cells are the bad cells). For my final example of increased immune system activity, it would be like telling all the S.A. to look for bad cells - increased vigilance by the Immune system in general.

So your immune system is always on against cancer cells - while you’re not aware of it, your body is always on the hunt against cancer cells. If these cells are detected, your body will try to eliminate the cancer detected. Cancers will try to avoid detection by creating proteins that mimic your normal body - so when your immune cells see these “disguised cancer” cells, they pass it over and ignore it.

Immunotherapy (antibody based therapies) is a upcoming field of therapy within the field of oncology. There are a ton of ways where you can target cancers - the first of which, is you can target those systems protecting the cancer cell. An example would be this research by Dr. Patz at Duke med, where they target CFH, a protein which protects cancer cells:

https://dukecancerinstitute.org/news/homegrown-immunotherapy-trialed-lung-cancer

Another option, is you can create specific antibodies against the type of cancer. For example, one type of upcoming treatment I saw, was the creation of targeted vaccines. The lab would take cells from a cancer patient, find specific bio markers, and then create an vaccine against those bio markers for that cancer patient. With mRNA vaccines, this speeds up the process dramatically for creating the vaccine.

So in conclusion - there’s a ton of ways to stimulate the immune system against cancer! One would be to help the immune system target “cell mimics”. Another is to target specific biomarkers. I’ve even seen research that activates the immune system more. In the case of your specific questions - you can use mRNA to introduce the cancer cell proteins to the immune system, which can then create targeted antibodies.",,,1613866863,{},go6aeq3,False,t3_lodwi8,False,True,t1_go68fa2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lodwi8/covid_infections_dropped_958_after_both_pfizer/go6aeq3/,1613866874,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; While 12% of Americans have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, far more people — approximately 35% of the nation’s population — have already been infected with the coronavirus, Offit estimated. Studies have found that people who survive COVID-19 have immunity for several months, though it likely lasts even longer.

&gt; UC San Francisco epidemiologist Dr. George Rutherford said one of the reasons why cases are dropping so fast in California “is because of naturally acquired immunity, mostly in Southern California.” He estimated that 50% of Los Angeles County residents have been infected with the virus at some point.

&gt; “We’re really talking something starting to sound and look like herd immunity — although that true herd immunity is a ways off in the future,” Rutherford said recently.

&gt; Herd immunity is reached when so many people have immunity that a virus cannot find new hosts and stops spreading, resulting in community-wide protection. Scientists believe that in the case of the coronavirus, the threshold could be as high as 90%. The United States has not met this threshold but each step toward it slows transmission, experts say.

&gt; . 

&gt; But experts caution that the battle is not yet won.

&gt; New coronavirus variants could undermine these projections, either by proving more resistant to existing vaccines or by finding a way to spread more easily. Shifts in behavior could also render this good news moot, as it holds only if people stick to the precautions they have been taking thus far, experts say.

&gt; “I don’t want to provide a false sense of assurance here,” said L.A. County chief science officer Dr. Paul Simon, who pointed out that 60% of Angelenos would remain vulnerable even if more than a third have already been infected with the coronavirus. “Unless they’ve had vaccination, they continue to be susceptible. I think we need to continue to be vigilant.”

&gt; .

&gt; The large number of infections has come at a high cost. The nation’s death toll is approaching 500,000, far greater than any country in the world, and even more have survived but continue to suffer lingering effects of their illnesses, some of them severe. Allowing COVID-19 to run rampant to quickly achieve herd immunity, as some had promoted early in the pandemic, would have led to even more deaths and chronic health problems, experts say.

&gt; It remains unclear exactly what the threshold for herd immunity is with this virus with some scientists estimating that herd immunity may be achieved when 50% of people are immune, while others believe the threshold is closer to 90%, said L.A. County’s Simon. The uneven geographical distribution of infections may also leave some pockets of the county more vulnerable than others, he said.

&gt; .

&gt; Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cautioned against viewing the downward case trends as a reason to let up on masking and other safety precautions.

&gt; In an interview with the Journal of the American Medical Assn., Walensky said she hoped for the best, but also warned of a worst-case scenario — that people will stop wearing masks and physically distancing too early and that many will prematurely declare they’ve had enough of the pandemic and won’t get vaccinated.",,,1613866250,{},go69ack,True,t3_loi962,False,True,t3_loi962,/r/Coronavirus/comments/loi962/new_optimism_that_covid19_is_finally_dwindling_as/go69ack/,1613866261,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Mothers from Kolding react to being encouraged to have their children tested

Kolding closes two schools and eight day institutions

Minister on new million-dollar package: Deal embraces wide

by Christoffer Løvstrup Bagge
More than a third of those infected in Kolding are children under ten years of age.

All schools in Kolding will close from Monday. The government has decided this on the recommendation of the Danish Patient Safety Agency and on the recommendation of the task force. The closure concerns 28 day care centres and 15 schools in postcode 6000.

The closure is valid until February 28, the Ministry of Health said in a press release on Friday afternoon.

At the same time, everyone over the age of 12 in Kolding is encouraged to be tested.

On Friday, Kolding Municipality took first place in municipalities with the most infected people per 100,000 inhabitants.

234 have been found infected in the last week in Kolding, where 11,872 citizens have been tested - this gives a positive percentage of 1.97.

By comparison, the positive percentage nationwide is 0.40.

High infection among children
A large part of the infection in the municipality comes from schools and day care centres, where the British variant has got a good grip on the children, and therefore schools and day care centers that must now close, health minister Magnus Heunicke (Social Democratic Party) said in the press release.

- The situation in Kolding is serious, and the high infection must be reduced as soon as possible. As the infection focuses mainly on a number of schools and day-care centres, it is therefore necessary to send the smallest students back home and to close day care centers in the city, says Magnus Heunicke.

The Danish Patient Safety Agency tells TV 2 that more than a third of those who have been infected in the municipality are children under ten years of age.

- This is a very worrying increase, as we have seen in Kolding. To try to contain the infection, we have recommended this measure, says Charlotte Hjort, Head of Unit at the Danish Patient Safety Agency.

At the same time, the Danish Patient Safety Agency has assessed that there is a risk of further spread of infection in connection with the return of schoolchildren and a number of children in day care from winter holidays.

- We can't know if this has already spread. If people have been to family gatherings with people outside the municipality, Charlotte Hjort tells TV 2.

Just because one group of parents doesn’t want to bring their kids back to school shouldn’t mean that everyone has to suffer.  I agree that districts should still keep a distance learning program in place until children are vaccinated.  At the same time, there’s really no reason to keep schools closed anymore once teachers are vaccinated.

Why is it that masks help stop the spread of Covid everywhere except schools?  That makes no sense to me.  I’ve heard the argument that, “Children can’t be expected to keep their masks on!”  My response to that is, “Make that an expectation for all children to follow.”  Fighting is not tolerated in schools.  Drugs are not tolerated either.  When children are in a moving vehicle the expectation is that they wear seatbelts.  If children are unwilling to wear their mask in school they get sent home, no exceptions.  How hard is that?

If school districts set strict mask usage as the standard, schools can re-open safety and teachers in general would be held in as high of a regard as all other essential workers.

I’m not too concerned about the vaccination plan at this stage though, mostly because it’s not set in stone yet, and there’s been so many backflips!
One day ‘we are not going to lock down’ the next week we start locking down, as a prevention rather than a reaction no less! 
One day ‘masks shouldn’t be worn by healthy people’ the next week ‘fines will be issued if you don’t wear a mask’
One day ‘we will make a vaccine as mandatory as we can make it’ the very next day, due to public pressure ‘vaccines will be your choice’
Today ‘AstraZeneca will be rolled out as our primary vaccine’ who knows what the next phase will really be.
The truth is, if we don’t roll out AstraZeneca there’s going to be a delay in herd immunity anyway because we are going to have to source new doses.
I’m not entirely sure of why they plan to roll out AstraZeneca, because it’s developed here? Because it’s easier to store and deliver than Pfizer (though that’s another new development that could change the course) because our next available Pfizer dose is too long away?
I’m sure there is multiple facets that contribute to the strategy here.
Maybe AstraZeneca is still our best option because we’re on a 2 year wait list for any more Pfizer, we maybe limited in our actual options here.
Truth is, we all want to be able to choose which vaccine we have, and while I don’t know what the logistics actually are for us to do that, u can bet that if studies continue to develop on AstraZeneca not meeting the standards against mutations, if the government doesn’t doesn’t act accordingly then there will be pressure, and high rates of hesitancy which will prompt on overview because the plan right now is to keep our borders closed until we reach herd immunity.
And even then no promises have been made other than we might have to wait for other factors to become clear before we do.
In the mean time, our state premiers appear to be taking no chances. Steps are being taken to move quarantine hotels outside of heavily populated areas because it’s become clear these mutations are too slippery, ventilation is a huge factor in deciding on where quarantine will be relocated.
Our states are relying on state based health advise over his advise, they’re taking aerosols seriously now.
Hence, I don’t bother with his announcements because A) he lost my respect early on and B) no one in charge of final decisions appears to be taking him seriously anyway and are following stricter precautions than he’s advising.

&gt;  
&gt;The  reports present the first substantial evidence that Covid could be the  cause of significant long term ill-health, with the virus attacking the  body’s organs and causing diseases of the liver, heart, lungs and  kidneys.  
&gt;  
&gt;Papers released by the governments Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies  (Sage) also revealed half of patients in hospital with the virus  suffered complications, with one in four struggling when they got back  home.  
&gt;  
&gt;Younger patients under the age of 50 were more likely to suffer complications.  
&gt;  
&gt;One study looking at 47,780 coronavirus  patients who were discharged alive by the end of August last year found  30 per cent of patients, 14,000, were readmitted to hospital within 140  days while 12 per cent, 5,875, died.  
&gt;  
&gt;These  results were substantially higher than a control group of similar  patients which saw deaths in under 2 per cent of patients and less than  10 per cent needing to be readmitted.  
&gt;  
&gt;The paper said Covid patients suffered  multi-organ problems including elevated rates of diabetes, kidney and  liver disease as well as major cardiac disease events such as heart  attacks or strokes.

That's 9 months later. While Italy, France and others were hitting huge amount of cases and deaths, Germany was practically unscathed. Germany began a huge amount of testing while other countries were being hit and was able to completely delay it. 

The reason why I suggested Western is because other countries simply *don't* have the same epidemiological challenges. Not to mention, data accuracy and integrity. 22.30% of Germany is obese. 4.70% of South Korea. Germany has 21.4% older than 65. South Korea 15.1%. Iceland, Japan, and New Zealand can easily close and control their borders. Germany is surrounded by infected Countries that had huge infection rates. Not that it matters anyway, it's talking about waves. And when you talk about waves, the context is adjacent countries.

Western countries have very transparent data and integrity built into the law, which increases accuracy with reporting, not to mention they are democratic resulting in accountability. Countries like Russia have admitted to lying and their case/death rate is almost 6 times worse than they reported. Some countries simply don't have the resources to test or have the infrastructure to monitor and accurately report. So then you have Countries like Peru and Bolivia that look like fine on paper, but their excess deaths are through the roof and obviously are way off. And I'm not even getting into the dynamics and logistics of the economic network.

&gt; At the start of the pandemic, Germany showed itself to be a global leader in dealing with a once-in-a-century public heath crisis. Chancellor Angela Merkel forged a consensus on a lockdown. Her government’s testing and tracing tools were the envy of European neighbors. The country’s death and infection rates were among the lowest in the European Union. Its health care was stellar.

We're clearly not going to agree here, but I'm still open to changing my point of view if you can show me clear clinical trial evidence that supported the decision.  In the absence of a citation - and taking into light manufacturer objections - it's pretty clear the UK applied an off-label, untested dosage regimen to an entire population, which I believe was unethical and a decision clearly made on political pressure and gut intuition rather than hard evidence.

I think the best evidence for my point of view is that _no other major country_ chose to follow the UK approach of delaying second doses.

J&amp;J is 66% effective iirc, single dose and very easy to store. How is that iffy? Its also really effective at preventing hospitalization and death from COVID. That should be the key objective with any COVID vaccine even if its overall efficacy is slightly lower than its competitors keeping people from dying from the disease and out of hospital should be the end goal. Not COVID vaccine will likely ever be 100% effective and stop you from getting the disease at all. But if it can prevent serious symptoms (which it does) and keep you out of hospital that's a win.

Just based on that alone. There is no way it doesn't get approved. Warp speed were willing to approve any vaccine over 50% effectiveness. That's how desperate they were.

We have to wait how the vaccines work long term because evolution does not stop and many RNA viruses are known to often mutate into different kinds of quasispecies that might find a way of immune evasion because of antiviral selection pressure from increasing immunity.

However covid vaccination should at least be able to make it significantly better because it should be an advantage for our immune system to already know at least any variant of covid to fight the other variants.

But don't sell the fur before you shot the bear. Because we can't know. Many scientists actually think covid become an endemic virus. I think so too by the way.

""In January, *Nature* asked more than 100 immunologists,  infectious-disease researchers and virologists working on the  coronavirus whether it could be eradicated. Almost 90% of respondents  think that the coronavirus will become endemic — meaning that it will  continue to circulate in pockets of the global population for years to  come (see 'Endemic future').""

“Eradicating this virus right now from the world is a lot like trying  to plan the construction of a stepping-stone pathway to the Moon. It’s  unrealistic,” says Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the  University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.

But failure to eradicate  the virus does not mean that death, illness or social isolation will  continue on the scales seen so far. The future will depend heavily on  the type of immunity people acquire through infection or vaccination and  how the virus evolves. Influenza and the four human coronaviruses that  cause common colds are also endemic: but a combination of annual  vaccines and acquired immunity means that societies tolerate the  seasonal deaths and illnesses they bring without requiring lockdowns,  masks and social distancing.

The US is coming up on half a million COVID deaths, and that's with our rigorous mitigation efforts. Could you imagine the death toll we would be seeing if we hadn't taken action? Yes, we tanked our economy, but would you rather have had tens of millions of deaths? I spent 7 months last year unemployed due to COVID, and I would never think to trade that loss of income for the deaths of my countrymen. The thing is, over time, our economy will come back to life. But the people who died from this pandemic never will.

But the harder pill to swallow here is that if every American had been 100% on board with our COVID mitigation efforts from the start, we would've been able to effectively flatten the curve and even possible could've enjoyed months on end with practically no cases as we've seen in places such as Australia and South Korea. That could've been our reality. But no, unfortunately our society is just too selfish.

And sure, our government did a poor job of helping offset the loss of income, but that's a separate argument that doesn't at all negate the merits of lockdowns on their own. Your frustration at our leadership on this issue itself is completely justified.

My point with the FDR comparison is that just because a lot of people would've disagreed with it and many were negatively affected, going to war was the right decision because the alternative is worse. I don't think it's controversial at all to say that not having done any lockdowns and letting the bodies stack up on the streets would've been worse than the temporary economic distress we're currently seeing.

In the US, according the CDC, 81% of deaths come those over 65. As of Feb 20th, 35% of ""prioritized people"" (source: WaPo) have gotten at least one shot. 

A study from Stanford found 10% of people have natural covid antibodies. That was from September 2020, which was really entirely before the fall and winter surge, with much higher case counts than before. 

Therefore it's safe to assume a min of 15% to a max of 25% of Americans now (Feb 2021) have some natural antibodies. Of those people, more are likely to be in the over 65 group. That means we could already be at 50% to as high as 75% of the most at risk people with at least some covid antibodies.

I just feel like once the world's leading economies collectively reach 80% - 95% of at risk people with some level of antibodies (vaccine or natural) case counts and deaths will plummet, barring more deadly variants.

What could that be? 

This probably represents an expected massive speed up of delivery of dose: Pfizer after its short delay, must be rapidly increasing dose delivery, but we're also due Moderna arriving and if I had to guess they have just confirmed their doses are arriving. AZ have been steadily increasing their doses too and there should also be novavax at some point but MHRA haven't approved it yet - maybe they're just about to drop? (There's also movement on relaxing the -70°C freezer requirements for Pfizer so that could be about to become a whole lot easier to give.)

This was published one day ago. People need to chill and do their own research.


Findings
Between April 23 and Dec 6, 2020, 24 422 participants were recruited and vaccinated across the four studies, of whom 17 178 were included in the primary analysis (8597 receiving ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 8581 receiving control vaccine). The data cutoff for these analyses was Dec 7, 2020. 332 NAAT-positive infections met the primary endpoint of symptomatic infection more than 14 days after the second dose. Overall vaccine efficacy more than 14 days after the second dose was 66·7% (95% CI 57·4–74·0), with 84 (1·0%) cases in the 8597 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 248 (2·9%) in the 8581 participants in the control group. There were no hospital admissions for COVID-19 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group after the initial 21-day exclusion period, and 15 in the control group. 108 (0·9%) of 12 282 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 127 (1·1%) of 11 962 participants in the control group had serious adverse events. There were seven deaths considered unrelated to vaccination (two in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group and five in the control group), including one COVID-19-related death in one participant in the control group. Exploratory analyses showed that vaccine efficacy after a single standard dose of vaccine from day 22 to day 90 after vaccination was 76·0% (59·3–85·9). Our modelling analysis indicated that protection did not wane during this initial 3-month period. Similarly, antibody levels were maintained during this period with minimal waning by day 90 (geometric mean ratio [GMR] 0·66 [95% CI 0·59–0·74]). In the participants who received two standard doses, after the second dose, efficacy was higher in those with a longer prime-boost interval (vaccine efficacy 81·3% [95% CI 60·3–91·2] at ≥12 weeks) than in those with a short interval (vaccine efficacy 55·1% [33·0–69·9] at &lt;6 weeks). These observations are supported by immunogenicity data that showed binding antibody responses more than two-fold higher after an interval of 12 or more weeks compared with an interval of less than 6 weeks in those who were aged 18–55 years (GMR 2·32 [2·01–2·68]).",,,1613918161,{},go89doc,False,t3_lowa2b,False,True,t1_go80g9s,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lowa2b/astrazeneca_the_coronavirus_vaccine_that_nobody/go89doc/,1613918172,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Here's my thinking of why natural immunity and vaccines can't really explain the current drop:

1. It's dropping like crazy even in places where smaller percentages of the population have previously been infected (San Francisco, Canada);
2. we STILL see some of the previously harder-hit places with higher rates than less-hard hit places. Like, down to the zip code where some of the poorer zip codes in New York City that have previously been hit the hardest are STILL getting more cases per capita than rich zip codes where far fewer people had previously been infected. There are clearly other factors besides percentage of the population that is immune that is swamping immunity effects.
3. vaccination isn't even close to high enough to explain 1&amp;2.

&gt;How should fruit and vegetables be washed?  
&gt;  
&gt;Washing will help remove bacteria, including E.coli, from the surface of fruit and vegetables.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most of the bacteria will be in the soil attached to the produce. Washing to remove any soil is, therefore, particularly important.  
&gt;  
&gt;When you wash vegetables, wash them under a running tap and rub them under water, for example in a bowl of fresh water. Start with the least soiled items first and give each of them a final rinse.  
&gt;  
&gt;Washing loose produce is particularly important as it tends to have more soil attached to it than pre-packaged fruit and vegetables.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is always advisable to wash all fruit and vegetables before you eat them to ensure they are clean and to help remove bacteria from the outside.  
&gt;  
&gt;Peeling or cooking fruit and vegetables can also remove bacteria.",,,1613919417,{},go8bdz3,False,t3_lopumc,False,True,t1_go89p2m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lopumc/still_no_evidence_of_covid19_transmission_from/go8bdz3/,1613919427,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In the US there have been 3 humps or peaks in cases in April, July and January at approximately 35k, 70k, and 280k new cases per day respectively.

The graph of fatalities also has 3 peaks at about the same times, at about 2700, 1800 and 4300 fatalities per day respectively.

The fatalities have not grown anywhere near as much in fact decreased from the first peak to the 2nd. When I mentioned this in the past people have told me that the deaths would catch up. But they never did.

In other words the fatality rate has been steadily declining and has declined a lot. I think the explanation is exactly what you say, early on a ""case"" was a sick person showing up at the hospital, and today it is likely a positive test. And there are more cases found among the young and healthy who don't get sick.

After 9/11 the War on Terror went into overdrive. We spent trillions of dollars waging a war we didn't need, costing hundreds of thousands of lives and making the world absolutely no safer than before.

Covid is exactly the same scenario, only this time magnified even more by social media complicit in magnifying the threat. This is what politicians and media do, work opportunistically with public enemy #1.

I don't think that is what happened (direct quotes from Fauci):

“As we get into March and April, the number of available doses will allow for much more of a mass vaccination approach,” he said Thursday on the Today show.

“I would imagine **by the time we get to April**, that will be what I would call, for better wording, ‘**open season**,’” he said. “Namely, **virtually everybody and anybody in any category could start to get vaccinated**.”

But that **doesn’t mean everybody will get vaccinated in April, said Fauci**, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and an adviser to President Joe Biden. Because of the logistics of getting the vaccine into arms, it will be mid- to late summer before most Americans are vaccinated, he said.

The vaccine will be more available because of mobile clinics and more pharmacies that will be enlisted to inoculate people, he said.

Also on Thursday, Biden said the government has signed contracts for 100 million more doses of the Moderna vaccine and 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Dates for vaccine delivery are also being moved up, he said.

There has been confusion about my posts, thinking that I'm anti-restrictions or whatever. Actually, I've been getting it from both sides.

The virus is serious business.  It kills people.  It makes people sick for a long time. Some people lose their sense of smell/taste. Some people don't get sick at all, but we have *no idea* who or why. Yes, I'm ignoring the age distribution stuff here, but we know that people of every age *can* get really sick.  I really don't want a loss of smell or taste to happen to me.  That's what keeps me motivated to mask up and distance.  I don't think you should ignore the danger of the virus, *at all*. 

Just because you've decided not to distance or follow the rules, doesn't mean that you get to make that decision for other people too.  Respect their choices, even if they're *terrible* choices.  You can be *so ignorant, on purpose, just to spite me* and there's nothing I can do about it. Some people have chosen to stop distancing once they're vaccinated, and that's fine, so long as they respect other people's choices.

The virus wasn't made in a lab.  That's conspiracy theory garbage, and you know it.  Even if it was made in a lab, so what? Who cares? What does that do for you?  What does that do for humanity, or our ability to fight the virus, or the people who've lost a loved one? Nothing but spread hate. Give it up.  

If you think this is me ""defending"" China, you're beyond help.

About me - I'm not ""anti-lockdown"" or ""pro-lockdown"".  In the US, I don't think we've had a ""lockdown"", we've just had restrictions, and minimal ones at that. If we had had a lockdown like in NZ or China, I do think we'd be in a better place (fewer deaths). On the other hand I'm not *totally* convinced that they are as effective as some people think. I encourage people to ""follow the rules"" or guidelines or whatever.  Masking up is so easy, and yeah, it can suck, but just do it until you don't have to anymore.  I'm ""pro-mask"" but only to a point. They do seem to work, for a myriad of reasons. Double masking is dumb, but the idea comes from good intentions. Experts are [trying their hardest, heck, trying EVERYTHING they can](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/llsmnp/singledomain_sarscov2_s1_and_rbd_antibodies/) to protect people from a deadly virus.

Any answer you get that is either ""yes"" or ""no"" is wrong, for now. We have only ""maybe, probably not"", and it's going to be that way for a long time.

In order to answer the question scientifically, it would require a ""challenge study"" where both vaccinated and unvaccinated people are deliberately exposed to the virus to see if transmission occurs.

The ethical concerns of deliberate exposure prevent us from performing these studies in humans.  It's the same reason that the vaccine trials took so long, we can't deliberately infect people to see if they need hospitalization or die. 

(EDIT: Well, now it looks like I [spoke too soon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/llw5cu/worlds_first_coronavirus_human_challenge_study/))

However, we did these studies in hamsters, and the results looked pretty bad. They were able to spread it. But hamsters greet each other by touching noses like all the time. Humans don't really do that (do you?). So we did similar studies with monkeys and the results look really good.

Also, you'll notice that any reputable person talking about this subject always says ""may be able to spread"", or ""maybe"", or ""we don't know if"". And that's because there is a small chance that vaccinated people will be able to spread the virus. But it's not a big chance. Doctors, scientists, and regulators are being very careful with their language on this subject, some would argue they're being too careful. That said, if they were to say that ""vaccinated people cannot spread the virus"", and then we find out that in some situations that vaccinated people have spread the virus, that would end up worse for them than if they hedge for a while. So at least to me, the way they're framing it seems pretty reasonable, you just have to put yourself in their shoes.

That said, they seem to be [saying what I've been saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s). Said saying. Saying Said?

[Yay!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmqfk4q/)

Just because [mRNA vaccines aren't 100% effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/)  against the SA variant, *doesn't* [mean that we'll definitely need boosters](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gmu581s/).

**Spike mutation analogy:**

The spike protein is coded by 3,831 base pairs.  What does that mean?

Well, it's like a lego sculpture where you have 3,831 words in the instructions for how to build it, and the writer had to be super-detailed when explaining each motion and piece.    

In this analogy, your immune system makes lego pieces (antibodies) that can attach to any pair of exposed bumps on the lego sculpture.  We'll say there are 40 pairs exposed in this example.

A variant is when the instructions change by just one or more words.  Sometimes the photocopier for the instructions page gets a tiny smudge.  This could be really bad sometimes, especially if it's a critical word or phrase, like ""left"" or ""repeat six times"" or a description of a particularly detailed lego piece. Color might not always matter, but size would.

Out of those 3,831 words, how many have to change so much that every one of those 40 spots is no longer there?  It's probably a lot.

But wait, how many words have to change to make the whole sculpture really different, so that it doesn't work as a sculpture anymore?  Really not that many if they're in the right spots, right?  This is why most variants suck at being viruses; it's rare that a mistake would make the instructions *better*.

**Which vaccine should I get?**

When someone asks me what my favorite beer is, the answer is always the same.

It's the one in front of me.

So get the first vaccine you can, the differences are pretty minor.

**Booster questions to think about, I don't have answers**

(note: there's a difference between ""boost"" and ""booster"" here that needs to be understood.)

(also, what's the term for a mixture of sequences, heterogenous? Is my doubt about this term just from overthinking?)

(also also, I'm not convinced we're definitely going to need boosters, this is just fun to think about.)

Could a booster shot replace the second dose of a prime/boost regimen?

Should a booster shot use only one sequence of mRNA (or have all identical spike proteins), or should it have both/multiple?

For future vaccines, should the sequence/spike be the same for prime/boost or different?  If you have four spikes/sequences, would it make more sense to do two in each, or all four in each?

How much should we trust mutation modeling here? Should we anticipate future mutations and include them?  Are we good enough at that yet?

Do we need to give any non-booster doses to people who have recovered from infection?

Could we ""stretch"" doses of an mRNA booster by priming with a vaccine that's easier to manufacture, but maybe less effective (like ChAdOx1), and boost with the mRNA booster?  Could it be better or faster to prime with a current mRNA sequence and boost with an updated ChAdOx1?  Could we maybe do [this in the US?]( https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-first-covid-19-alternating-dose-vaccine-study-launches-in-uk) 

[**Conclusions**](https://gfycat.com/cleantalkativedassie)

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms.  This currently seems to also be true with post vaccination infection with any of the known variants. We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well. 

In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections and symptoms in those who do get infected. Therefore, vaccines should reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing an infection, each subsequent variant they are exposed to will just broaden their immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). So they'll have good and broad immunity to a variety of variants, which seems likely to be an indication that they won't catch or spread the virus as well in the future. Same thing happens when someone who is vaccinated is exposed to a new variant. Their immunity is broadened and strengthened by each subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. But remember, so many people will be less likely to spread the virus, so it's pretty unlikely that this reduced level of spread will be sufficient to sustain the virus in the way we have seen over the past year. So if a variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. If they don't become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing to have my mind changed on this with new information though, so don't take this as gospel.

[Seriously,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4pnde/mrna1273_vaccine_induces_neutralizing_antibodies/) it's [very probably](https://reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l6vs1t/in_vitro_studies_demonstrate_pfizer_and/), like, [not going to be a problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l0yqe6/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gjwov3s?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) Yes, even the SA variant, [which might not be a concern at all.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kxkrb9/endemic_sarscov2_will_maintain_postpandemic/) The more vaccines we test, the more we find that they still [work against the variants](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lax5wa/neutralization_of_sarscov2_voc_501yv2_by_human/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), at least enough to be totally worthwhile. 

ChAdOx1 (Oxford/Astrazeneca) may not be so great against the SA variant, and we have a lot to learn here.  Novavax's vaccine also may have issues with the SA strain, though it doesn't seem that they're as big as with ChAdOx1. 

Pfizer [seems fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lf7uph/neutralization_of_viruses_with_european_south/) against the troubling variants, at least in the lab. At the very least, the mRNA vaccines [*still* work](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfp89k/neutralization_of_sarscov2_spike_6970_deletion/) on the three most worrying variants.

Still worried about variants? Check [this out!](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/27/vaccination-against-the-new-variants-real-world-data) *

Most variants aren't great at being viruses.  [Some, including that one mink variant have already gone extinct](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/19/danish-covid-mink-variant-very-likely-extinct-but-controversial-cull-continues). I think there are other Mink variants that have made it into wild Mink populations.

Vaccine induced immunity is [comparable to](https://www.verywellhealth.com/antibodies-from-vaccines-and-from-natural-infection-5092564), or [better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l5whhu/increased_resistance_of_sarscov2_variants_b1351/) immunity from a previous infection. Especially [variants of concern.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgxpre/vaccineinduced_immunity_provides_more_robust/)

Post infection immunity lasts [*at least 8 months*](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/koxkm1/sarscov2_infection_induces_longlived_bone_marrow/), though [probably a lot longer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/klpvp7/sarscov2specific_t_cell_memory_is_longlasting_in/)  Again, [*at least* 8 months, though you may not even really need very many antibodies,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ldj06f/immunological_memory_to_sarscov2_assessed_for_up/) since other types of immunity seem to be more important.  It's too soon to say ""lifelong"" but [that is a possibility.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4nkco/the_immune_system_mounts_a_lasting_defense_after/) Also, it looks like those who have recovered *may* only need [one dose of an mRNA vaccine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/labst4/robust_spike_antibody_responses_and_increased/). There are some people (~7%) who don't develop lasting immunity from infections. 

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l9nfu8/stable_neutralizing_antibody_levels_six_months/) probably a lot,[ lot longer,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/)  probably many years. 

The OG SARS virus from 2003 gave detectable immunity [both 6](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/12/7264) and [12 years later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kvbz9y/weekly_question_thread/gizs32j/)   

Covid19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, OG SARS was caused by SARS-CoV. Looks like both came from bats.  [They’re 79% the same.](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930251-8) (PDF)

&gt;  89.4% effective at preventing laboratory-confirmed infections

As far as I know other studies of actual transmission was inconclusive:

The latest studies basically indicated that while it can reduce viral load, they said the variation in viral load from person to person is too large to say its reduction is very effective. Like if one person has a significant reduction after having the vaccine, their viral load may still be more than someone without a vaccine.

https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-pfizer-vaccine-may-reduce-transmission

&gt; Though vaccinated people appear to be less likely to transmit the virus, **it remains unclear just how much transmission could still happen**. That’s because people’s viral load can vary widely in general; **the reported decrease in viral loads in vaccinated people is small compared with the range of viral levels experts have seen in COVID-19 patients**, Kilpatrick says.

&gt; It’s also important to note that **the studies show “a snapshot of viral loads,” representing how much virus a person carried at a single point in time**, he says. 

So my take from this article, data was taken during one snapshot in time. There's some evidence of reduced load, but broadly, it's insignificant because the viral load range is large between all individuals. I read that as it may reduce it by 20-30% (just as example, I didn't see any numbers put to the amount reduced), but someone with a high viral load with 20-30% reduction is still more than some people fully infected and unvaccinated.

The only way to truly tell is in a controlled experiment, to put a bunch of vaccinated people in close proximity with those that have not been vaccinated in a human challenge trial. Otherwise results are fairly circumstantial.

The anger should be at the Canadian government for not using the past year to increase domestic manufacturing capabilities.

Canada isn't part of the United States. There isn't an option to put any Canadian resident at a higher priority than any American resident. I don't understand how it makes sense to act like that shouldn't be the case. The Canadian government spent a large portion of the pandemic being incredibly dismissive and frankly insulting of the condition of the United States' public health, and there really wasn't much effort at helping in material terms during that entire period. Why should the United States feel obligated to react differently than Canada did now that we're the ones in a better position?

It comes across as a double standard to me.

Hell I still remember posting videos of Wuhan on my Facebook back in February of 2020 and having people call me a fear monger, a guy who straight up lost his mom to covid a few weeks ago even commented on one of my posts saying that it would never leave China, and if it gets to the states will be like ebola and only three or four people will get it.

I have looked into it and read a couple of articles and studies, and the situation in Manaus definitely is something to keep a close look on and slightly worrying.

The amount of people with antibodies is probably severely overestimated though. From blood samples in spring, 44% showed antibodies iirc (read it  a couple of days ago). They increased it to a maximum of 75%. It's very unlikely that's a correct estimate. Still, 44% is not nothing. The way these kinds of trials and tests are communicated to the public also can influence the total number. If they advertise it as a study to discover whether people have antibodies for Covid, more people that have a suspicion they have antibodies in their system will participate than vice versa. I'm not entirely sure how that went down. 

Actual confirmed cases of reinfection are not very well documented, and still rare, but steady increase of active cases over such a short period of time is worrying and definitely needs further investigation. Up until now, natural infection to previous strains has proven to provide immunity to new strains, but this looks an exception. If this is true, this could potentially be very dangerous.

My argument was never that authoritarian regimes simply fail to fund all forms of scientific research or education.

Again, from the beginning. Fundamental to the Scientific Method is free inquiry. To deny free inquiry (and I mean *deny*, through violence) is to repudiate the Scientific Method, and that by definition is anti-science. This isn't academic, you ignore how science progresses. Let's say a regime funds rocket science, but arrests marine biologists. What if a type of sea algae can be used to produce cheap rocket fuel? To stifle some science through violence is to hinder all of science. This is why you can't even say the Nazis were pro-rocket science (in particular, Nazis murdered some scientists who could have helped them build rockets). The scientific advancements in authoritarian regimes are *in spite* of their anti-science policies.

Your previous attempt to use religion as an analogy was ham-fisted. My point is made by fixing it. Suppose a regime claimed to be pro-Christianity. However, it outlawed the belief that Jesus is the one true son of God, and enforced this through heavy violence. But this belief is *the* central tenet of Christianity. You cannot be a Christian and violently deny the divinity of Christ.

I think this is the big takeaway. Charlie Baker made it clear that more details would be here when the vaccine was here. The vaccine's been here for two months, and a million people in our state have gotten it.

I don't think it would make much sense to set a date, but we need an accountable metric.

Gaza is run by a terrorist organisation (recognised as a terrorist organisation by the EU, the US, and many more) that have fired countless of rockets into Israel. Exports into Gaza from Israel are tightly monitored to make sure Hamas doesn’t use whatever it gets its hands on through Israel to make bombs or rockets. 

These security checks on exports to Gaza have been in place for over a decade and obviously the vaccine shipments from to Gaza are held to the same standards, Israel will check they’re proper vaccines and not some other substances to make bombs and then clear them for export - the scaremongering, click bait article from the Guardian however makes it sound like Israel is just being mean and stoping vaccines from reaching the poor Palestinians. 

Also, as I mentioned before, if the world cares so much about Palestinians, go ahead and send them vaccines through Egypt.

Is it much better than nothing? Yes.

Is it second-rate? Yes. No matter what rethorical efforts articles like this or politicians make to hide it, the fact is that Pfizer/BioNTech reduces risk by ~95%, i.e. 20 times, and this one by ~66%, i.e. 3 times. The difference of individual risk is huge. If that's not ""second-rate"" by definition, I don't know what it is.

If there weren't any alternative vaccines, we would all be happy to receive this one? Sure. Still, there *are* clearly better alternatives, making this one second-rate. If a crappy noname-brand $100 smartphone was the best technology we got, we all would love to get it as well, which doesn't mean it's not second-rate in the actual current mobile market.

Is it good for society as a whole that people accepts this vaccine? Probably. We don't have enough mRNA vaccines and we want to have people vaccinated as fast as possible.

Is it good for an individual to accept this vaccine? Except for selflessness/collective responsibility, this is dubious. For a rational individual, dividing risk by 20 basically means being able to get to reasonably normal life, as getting covid would become a vanishingly rare event. Dividing risk by 3 means reducing risk, but no normal life - risk just goes from very high to high. It would surely not convince me to get back to a plane or a restaurant. And if this means not being able to get mRNA vaccines any time soon (because ""protocol says you have already been vaccinated, non-vaccinated people have the priority)... personally I have no doubt that it's better to get a chance of the life-changing vaccine two months down the line, be very careful two more months and then live a better life; than get a risk-reducing vaccine now and keep having no social life and no travel until 2022.

Mind you, I'll probably get AZ. I believe in collectivism, I believe in being united to fight the pandemic, and if that means taking that second-rate vaccine, reducing the risk but being masked and not enjoying many pleasures of life until around 2022, so be it. But I hate all the sugar-coating, all the ""all vaccines are equally great"", and all that drivel. If we had enough mRNA vaccines, there would be no chance in hell that this one would even be authorized, because there would be no point on using an inferior vaccine. The US will probably not inject any single one of them, because there's no point either. It's clearly worse than what they have.

I would be more sympathetic to the messages from authorities if they just asked us to make a sacrifice, take this vaccine because it's what we have, and gave us some guarantees that at least we will be able to upgrade to an mRNA one when everyone has had the chance to get a vaccine; than this constant massaging of the facts and taking us for idiots.",,,1613912885,{},go81m8k,False,t3_lowa2b,False,True,t1_go80g9s,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lowa2b/astrazeneca_the_coronavirus_vaccine_that_nobody/go81m8k/,1613912896,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Even if you don't have a high enough titer or the right 'flavors' of neutralizing antibodies to prevent infection in the first place, chances are you have regular antibodies and T cells that will help prevent disease. 

One way to definitively say that the vaccine prevents transmission is to expose vaccinees to the virus- but there are ethical considerations to doing so, so they didn't. Instead the study authors are looking to develop ""correlates of protection""- ie, saying that if you develop x level of y flavor of neutralizing antibodies for z period of time, then you are likely protected from infection in the first place. The Moderna study authors specifically said they couldn't determine correlates of protection YET because of too many cases in the vaccine group. It's a big statement to make, with many implications, so they're being cautious. 

The encouraging thing is that in earlier studies, vaccinated chimpanzees did develop neutralizing antibodies and were protected against viral challenge.

Now if you have solid evidence as to why these sources are all lying to us concerning why we should be guarding ourselves against surface transmissions, then I'm willing to listen.  Otherwise, it isn't a debate I feel the need to have in any great depth.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Hand Washing**  
&gt;  
&gt;One of the best things you can do to prevent infection is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last updated: January 21, 2021  
&gt;  
&gt;Washing your hands often and practicing good hand hygiene will reduce the chances of getting or spreading germs like COVID-19. Washing your hands with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds is most effective. This is because soap actively destroys the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19 and really reduces how much of the virus is left on your skin. Alcohol-based hand rubs can be used to disinfect your hands when soap and water are not available.  
&gt;  
&gt;**When to wash your hands**  
&gt;  
&gt;COVID-19 is transmitted by liquid droplets when a person coughs, sneezes or spits. Touching surfaces contaminated with droplets containing COVID-19 and then touching your face particularly your eyes, nose or mouth can make you sick.  
&gt;  
&gt;That is why we recommend washing your hands often, especially when you are likely to get or spread germs:   
&gt;  
&gt;Before touching your eyes, nose, mouth or face  
&gt;  
&gt;After you have been in a public space or touched a surface frequently touched by other people like doors, payment machines, gas pumps, etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;After using the toilet or helping a child use the toilet  
&gt;  
&gt;After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing  
&gt;  
&gt;Before and after preparing food  
&gt;  
&gt;Before eating food  
&gt;  
&gt;Before smoking  
&gt;  
&gt;Before inserting or removing contact lenses  
&gt;  
&gt;Before and after flossing  
&gt;  
&gt;Before and after sex  
&gt;  
&gt;Before and after caring for someone at home who is sick  
&gt;  
&gt;Before and after changing diapers   
&gt;  
&gt;After touching an animal or pet or handling animal waste   
&gt;  
&gt;After touching waste or garbage  
&gt;  
&gt;After handling shared objects

Now looking at the positive cases in the two groups (19,965 who got the vaccine, and 20,172 who got the placebo) you have 9 cases in the vaccine group and 169 cases in the placebo group. They report 94.6% efficacy, which comes from 1-(9/169). 

There's kinda a complicated discussion of how long they followed patients since not all trial participants were vaccinated on the same day, but the vaccine/placebo designation was evenly split during the entire vaccination time of the trial, and usually they just wait to write their report until enough people have gotten sick that they either 1) have the statistical power to say the vaccine works, or 2) they have the statistical power to say the vaccine has no effect.

a few years ago we had a conservative government. that government sold off our production facilities to private companies that are not doing much of anything in terms of the pandemic.

Canada asked every company it has vaccine contracts with to produce it here. they all refused as it's more financially lucrative to invest in the states.

The contracts Canada had originally signed had set a delivery timeline. The current problem is that unless Canada suddenly receives a large number of doses, that timeline may not be met, and as such there'd be a breach of contract. 

These delays are due to the states not allowing the export of any vaccines, and the European production facilities highly prioritizing europe despite telling Canada that they wouldn't place any country over another, and would instead follow the contracts that have been signed.

Tl;dr Canada's conservative government of the past ruined our ability to produce the vaccines ourselves.

The U.S is huge. When we look at the data we are looking at combined data from all 50 states. In Europe, we spend more time looking at individual countries instead of Europe as a whole. 

The U.S is experiencing local outbreaks all the time. Iowa had 4239 infections this week as opposed to only 676 last week. However with overall trends going down I think that those outbreaks are being masked by the general national decrease.

https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-why-were-not-doing-better-on-covid-vaccines

**Why is Canada not able to acquire more vaccine early?**

&gt; Is it because the Liberal government has virtually no relationship other than as a buyer and regulator with the only organizations that could possibly produce a vaccine quickly and in sufficient quantities, the global innovative pharmaceutical industry?

&gt; Successive Liberal governments, including this one, have created an unfavourable environment for investment and commercial success for innovative pharmaceutical companies in Canada. They have made it very difficult for Canadian CEOs to attract investment to Canada despite many attempts by the industry to work with governments to do so. They have made no effort to work with the innovative industry to encourage a partnership that could deliver tremendous value to the health-care system and the economy and give Canadians early access to new medicines and vaccines.

&gt; Not surprisingly, the industry has gone elsewhere to invest — to places like the U.K., the U.S. and the EU where that positive environment does exist. They are all performing better than Canada on early vaccine acquisition. A senior public health official in Israel recently stated that one of the reasons that country was able to acquire large quantities of doses was its good relationship with the pharmaceutical industry.

&gt; This unfavourable environment has its roots in the Trudeau government of 1968 and the effective elimination of pharmaceutical patents. That lead to the hollowing-out of the innovative industry and the emergence of a generic-company oligopoly that was supported by successive Liberal governments.

&gt; The Mulroney and Harper governments supported the innovative industry by improving the patent landscape but Canada only partially recovered and to this day does not have globally competitive patent protection. The negative trend continues even now with the imminent implementation of a punitive pricing regime through new federal (Patented Medicine Price Review Board) regulations. One now has to ask: where are the generic companies when we badly need innovation? Liberal government pharmaceutical policy has failed Canadians at our time of greatest need.",,,1613936608,{},go9bt9r,False,t3_loxr88,False,True,t3_loxr88,/r/Coronavirus/comments/loxr88/usa_now_vaccinating_more_people_against_covid19/go9bt9r/,1613937407,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That age group makes up too big a portion of our population.  So we'll probably never reach a high enough immunity threshold to totally eliminate community spread.  In other words, he believes COVID-19 will never be fully eradicated like Smallpox, and he also believes it won't be reduced to very low levels like Polio.

What this means is that we would have to ""return to normal"" somehow, without ever truly eliminating COVID-19 from our lives.  Or in other words, COVID would remain part of our lives forever.

I'm just not sure what that looks like in the long term perspective.  We've only just learned how to live with COVID-19 in our world, and many people very heatedly disagree with how to live with it.  Obviously we are still reacting to it in an extreme way, as schools and businesses remain closed all over the world to varying degrees.  Some entire countries have shut down, some states in the US have shut down, others have done less so, and it's a pretty huge debate.

It's difficult to wrap my mind around the different possibilities of how this will all play out.  What will our life look like a year from today, five years?  

I know I've fought tooth and nail arguing with people on here about when/how we would get back to normal, but one thing I will acknowledge is that we cannot ""do this forever.""  We just can't.  Even I will admit that.

My question is, what will that ""normal"" truly look like?  If COVID is always around, will it be relegated to a particularly nasty flu with mass vaccinations?  Will we have to continue getting vaccine shots for different COVID strains every year?

They would absolutely do that if there weren't enough microchips for themselves. Global trade only works when a country produces a surplus of supply. In the case of vaccines we don't have a surplus.

So basically American manufacturers have to decided whether to give an American a vaccine or a Canadian. That's a pretty easy choice. With microchips the choice is to throw them away or trade them to America. Also an easy choice.

The actual numbers were -67% after the first dose and -54% overall, but I wouldn’t read anything into that difference, because the confidence intervals for those two measurements completely overlap. So it looks like everything is shifted: hospitalized cases end up being able to stay at home with more moderate symptoms, people who would have had moderate symptoms end up asymptomatic, and people who would have been asymptomatic end up not testing positive at all. Oh, and people who would have died stayed alive. There’s that, too.

It’s kind of intuitive but it also follows that it’s similar to most other vaccines. It shifts the spectrum. 

It appears everyone that was ‘presymptomatic’ (aka, most contagious) gets shifted towards ‘asymptomatic’ and asymptomatic cases shift towards no illness and thus doesn’t ever transmit the virus.

Such as what? Every single thing I look up suggests a very consistent message: ""We honestly don't know anything concrete - it depends heavily on rollout.""

For example: https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/12/anthony-fauci-offers-a-timeline-for-ending-covid-19-pandemic/

&gt;“Let’s say we get 75 percent, 80 percent of the population vaccinated,” Fauci said. “If we do that, if we do it efficiently enough over the second quarter of 2021, by the time we get to the end of the summer, i.e., the third quarter, we may actually have enough herd immunity protecting our society that as we get to the end of 2021, we can approach very much some degree of normality that is close to where we were before.”

The problem, I think, is that people want something concrete when no one can definitely give such a thing. Then if he's forced to make _some_ kind of call, people get upset if things end up worse than predicted. It depends on how many people actually practice safe distancing and continue to wear masks, it depends on how many people get vaccinated, and so on. Fauci has been very consistent in that people should continue to wear masks, wash hands, distance, and get vaccinated, to the point where he is clearly tired of repeating himself.

&gt;However what he's been doing lately is disingenuous and dangerous

First, they’re taking the highest possible estimate for infections. If you assume an IFR of .4 to .5%, given 9590 deaths, that puts you at between ~39% and ~49% of the population infected. It’s reasonable to split the difference to 44%, although it would also be safe to assume Alabama’s IFR is higher because of the obesity and other health issues in the state. 

Secondly, they’re assuming zero overlap between people who contracted covid and people who have gotten vaccinated, which is definitely not true.

Also, assuming immunity begins 2 weeks from second dose, only around ~2% of Alabama’s population had been vaccinated twice as of 2 weeks ago.

To be specific / add more. I don't think we ever had the facility to make an mRNA vaccine.  These are the first ones ever made and I believe require a different manufacturing facility.  The National Research Council has been making a facility but even that I don't believe is intended to make mRNA vaccines. 

Our industry for vaccines isn't the greatest.  When we signed deals with pharma companies we tried to get them to manufacture in Canada as well.  They all refused.  I assume in part because we don't have enough of the support industry.  As in it would be silly to setup a facility in Canada if you also then have to ship in every single part to make the vaccine.  

Side note: 

I say this, while a Canadian company's technology was used in the Pfizer vaccine.  The envelope, the lipid nano particle which is used to deliver the vaccine is Canadian. I'm not sure if we are manufacturing all of the LNPs or if it's just our technology and manufactured in the pfizer facilities.

&gt; The vaccine, which was rolled out in a national immunization program that began Dec. 20, was 89.4% effective at preventing laboratory-confirmed infections, **according to a copy of a draft publication that was posted on Twitter and confirmed by a person familiar with the work.** The companies and Israel’s Health Ministry worked together on the preliminary observational analysis, which has not yet been peer-reviewed.

The article is written in a way that makes it sound like testing was *pro*active (everyone in the studied population received regular testing based on a timeline). If the study was *re*active (people seeking out tests when they think they're sick) then it doesn't really do much to analyze the issue of asymptomatic spread.

I hope this is as good as it sounds, but we need to be careful to be optimistic, not euphoric. Pessimism is fine just like optimism, but neither one should fuel abandoning prudence. 

With all this recent good news it seems like people are starting to act like the pandemic is basically over. It might be, but only if we do the work to actually end it. Having preemptive celebration get togethers is a good way to make sure the pandemic enters a new phase.

I wish that was the case, but that does not seem to have been true in decades.   Since the turn of the century I haven't seen any economic stances except selective trade protectionism and aggressive bottomless deficit spending during otherwise good economic times.   

In the last 4 years it also seems to have taken on a particular stance on democracy that I never would have imagined in years past.    From where I'm sitting, the term and those working under its banner have literally no relationship whatsoever to the 20th century use of it.  Almost contrary, really.

you, however, are moving this conversation farther and farther away from its nexus by claiming my statement of ""hurting more"" is a call for sympathy.  we both know most countries' governments are run with stone cold apathy, not from an ethical/moral standpoint. this is what history teaches us. especially in a pandemic. especially in a recession.

40% of fatalities occur in nursing homes, and the average period of time between being admitted to a nursing home and dying is 5 to 13 months depending on your source and how you calculate it (i.e. mean vs. median).  So the average years of life lost for these fatalities is probably less than 1.

If the average ""YLL"" for a victim is 16 years as this study suggests, this would mean that the other 60% of victims would have to lose 26 years of life, which would suggest they are in their 60's which is not the case. The average age of a covid fatality is around 78 to 82 in different parts of the country.

I’m an actual scientist (my PhD is in viral immunology). I’m afraid that you’re the one doesn’t understand immunology very well. 

It’s not unusual at all for a vaccine candidate to not prevent spread of a virus (especially if you read about vaccine candidates in the very early stages of development- the ones that never make it out of animal models). It’s very naive to assume that a brand-new-to-humans type of vaccine against a brand-new-to-humans virus would prevent transmission. 

The reason for that is that the immune response in your mucosal tissues are largely separate from the systemic immune response (I.e. your blood). Most vaccines are given as an intramuscular injection, which do a great job of generating a systematic response (which is what will keep you from getting sick), but they do a piss poor job of generating a mucosal job immune response. So you can easily have a situation where a virus replicates just fine in your oral and nasal mucosa (making you contagious) without being able to make you sick because of your systemic immune response.",,,1613924091,{},go8k5gh,False,t3_lox3ga,False,False,t1_go86rsk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lox3ga/pfizerbiontech_shot_stops_covids_spread_israeli/go8k5gh/,1613924112,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

What's odd to me is the overlap in flu season and the surge.

This is my armchair hypothesis here, but- what if it's actually some kind of wombo-combo of influenza and COVID?

[https://www.jabfm.org/sites/default/files/COVID\_20-0528.pdf](https://www.jabfm.org/sites/default/files/COVID_20-0528.pdf)

&gt;The suggestion that the flu vaccine might decrease the severity of COVID-19 prompted researchers from the University of Florida to conduct a retrospective study of 2,500 patients who tested positive for COVID-19. They examined comorbidities and influenza vaccination status in order to determine the severity of disease based on hospitalization and ICU admission. They determined that COVID-19 patients who did not receive the flu vaccine within the previous 12 months had 2.44 greater odds of hospitalization and 3.29 greater odds of ICU admission when compared to COVID-19 patients who had received the flu vaccine.

Some kind of symbiosis makes sense there. The numbers have just been so much lower outside of flu season. I could see a scenario in which either the cough induced by influenza leads to greater spread of comorbid COVID, or perhaps getting whacked with both at once is much more dangerous and we just aren't detecting comorbid influenza.",,,1613934166,{},go95w6t,False,t3_los8r9,False,True,t3_los8r9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/los8r9/daily_discussion_thread_february_21_2021/go95w6t/,1613934645,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
