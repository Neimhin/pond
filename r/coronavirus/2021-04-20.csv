For walk-ins, they are everywhere and I can get head to one in the morning and Be in and out in an hour when my kids get a bug.   Ers have been great for the kids which cuts/head bashes and all sorts of emergencies.    We stayed overnight last summer as they thought my daughter would need surgery after a fall but didn’t.  


If you need non emergency surgery it can take a few months.     I had a. Limpoma I wanted removed in my shoulder.    It’s took 2 months to get in to see the surgeon, and then 4 months to get it done.     Cost me 12$ in parking for multiple visits and a physical by my DR.   

None of my friend seems to have issues getting into a walk-in or to see their family dr.   Our happened to be across the city so we will hit a walk-in in for an ear infection or whatever.   All the visits, and treatments are all electronically sent back to their dr.   

If you want non-merge my surgery fast the us system is going to be better.    If you have a very rare conditions the us is going to be better as their population means there are Probally more cases and a specialized dr to treat it.   If that’s the case Canada health pays for those visits from what I understand.  


But no matter what happens to you or how many times you have to go to ther dr (me and my kids are on adhd meds and have doses being dialed each month) , it costs us nothing each time we go.  

Wait times are and issue for non emergency stuff, but emergency services are done quickly at the time.  

Canada really needs better vaccine manufacturing and with novavax coming that is a step in the right direction.  But the us is big business for pharma and healthcare.  It’s just the citizens paying a lot for it.

All of those vaccines have the same DNA core (basically) and should be expected to all do about the same.

That said I think your point is basically right, and could be extended even further maybe.  We'd ""expect"" two different vaccine doses to do better than two of the same vaccine doses.  But we also can't be sure of safety, or rule out some weird cross-reaction, since it hasn't been trialed.  The UK is doing (sadly smallish) trials of pfizer/AZ as the first dose and AZ/pfizer/novavax as the second, which should be extremely interesting to see the results of.

That's assuming it's a binary choice between the AZ vaccine and catching covid, which isn't how it works at all. Catching covid, especially here in the UK right now, is overwhelming unlikely and the chances of dying from it when you're young even less so. And even if it wasn't, its all moot because alternative and superior vaccines exist.

I'm also quite angry with how hard doctors are pushing people here in the UK to get it. I received another call today from my doctor saying my appointment to get vaccinated is available and he acted shocked when I told him I would prefer to wait for Pfizer or Moderna instead of getting the AZ vaccine. They always try to guilt trip you into accepting them, dismissing your concerns with excuses like ""you'll be back of the queue"". Fair enough. I'd rather wait a few more weeks/months than take something that has now been proven to have serious risks of death, while the MRNA vaccines don't. But people are obviously rejecting this vaccine in number because I'm late 30s (officially, only those 45+ can get the jab here) so they're going down the list, desperately trying to use their existing supplies. 

The UK is being effectively bullied into getting it and it's not on. If people want to roll the dice with it, then best of luck.

&gt;“Problem is, 25% of Texas is under 18, and they’re not going to be able to get the vaccine yet because it’s not approved,” Neuman said. “That means we would need literally everybody over 18 to get there, and that is an uphill battle.”

&gt;Neuman says it’s tough to tell from the data alone how large a factor vaccine hesitancy is playing in the county’s disparities. He hopes it’s more of a problem with access because he says it’s easier to tell people where to go and what to do as opposed to calming their fears.

&gt;“I know on some occasions there have been some available doses in the area where there were basically more doses than there was demand,” Neuman said. “There’s a chance we could be getting this to more people, and I hope it’s not reluctance or lack of trust that’s behind it. Those are tough problems to solve.”

&gt;The only way out of the pandemic, Neuman says, is through vaccination. That means it’s critical to get everyone on board to receive their shot.

All of this also helps to explain why the US spends an absurd percentage of GDP on healthcare.

If a person has been in a higher exposure environment, and immediately takes off that dirty mask and shoves it into their pocket the second they get outside, or takes it on and off as they encounter others nearby, they are more likely to touch their face and the “dirty” side of the mask.

It can degrade mask efficacy by degrading fit seals—especially if the user is taking on higher risks because they believe they are wearing a better-than-cloth mask that largely depends on seal and integrity for those increases.

It could speak to understanding how they work, or choosing a higher safety mask than the minimally required one, some of which are very poor fitting or worn improperly (nose exposed)—in part by not understanding how they work or only wearing them because they are forced, even if their pattern of use provides little or no protection to themselves or others.",,,1618997290,{},gvb0eau,False,t3_mv5loe,False,True,t1_gvaerv0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mv5loe/states_may_soon_drop_outdoor_mask_mandates/gvb0eau/,1619004727,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Notes:

* The raw data can be downloaded exact totals for every age group can be downloaded from the [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) as a CSV.  The CDC indicates the data is by ""Date Administered"", but it actually appears to be by ""Date Reported"".
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC demographic data, so the tables do not match national totals.
* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group. The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, assuming that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17.

Benefit is that if you do this early enough it might dissolve the clot, restore blood flow, and minimize damage from stroke. There are cases where someone with dense stroke symptoms like garbled speech and weakness affecting an entire side of the body gets the tPA and within minutes function is restored.

BUT, this is no ordinary medication. It functions by dissolving clots, but that also means it may cause you to bleed. That's why they do that urgent CT first to make sure you are not already bleeding. Now if you are having a stroke, the benefits of dissolving the clot far outweighs the smaller risk of bleeding.

That assumption isn't implicit in the latter claim, which is true. you've a higher chance of dying on a 20 mile car journey than you have taking the AZ vaccine, but people generally think nothing of those risks. You presumably wouldn't, for example, insist a nurse come to your house and give you a Pfizer jab, rather than make that 20 mile journey yourself to get it.

*pp are* [*percentage points*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point)*, the arithmetic difference between today's percentage and a prior date.  For example, if a group was 55.0% today and 50.0% before, this is a 5.0 pp difference.*

Notes:

* The raw data can be downloaded exact totals for every age group can be downloaded from the [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) as a CSV.  The CDC indicates the data is by ""Date Administered"", but it actually appears to be by ""Date Reported"".
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC demographic data, so the tables do not match national totals.
* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group. The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, assuming that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17.",,,1618962909,{},gv9lood,False,t3_mv3lcd,False,False,t3_mv3lcd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mv3lcd/us_administers_2134_mln_doses_of_covid19_vaccines/gv9lood/,1618977188,17,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

By that metric the US and China also produced 0 vaccines, but private companies. And private companies are not countries. It is the one or the other. 

The EU does not have a flashy project called operation warp speeds, but it has invested billions into vaccine research and development. This is both for the EU and individual member states. So it is difficult to exactly point to number. It is just that we know it is a lot. [This site states](https://euobserver.com/coronavirus/150747) that the EU has invested 2.7 billion euros. [This EU Commission document](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/research_and_innovation/research_by_area/documents/ec_rtd_cc-vaccine-development_factsheet.pdf) shows where some of the investments were spend. Separately, individual member states have also invested a lot in to vaccine development. For Germany we are already talking about [over a billion](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/germany-boosts-investment-in-covid-19-vaccine-research-11600172209) [on vaccine development](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-to-spend-750-million-on-coronavirus-vaccine/a-53396167). [Most of the funding](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/pfizer-vaccine-s-funding-came-from-berlin-not-washington) for the German BioNTech vaccine also came from Germany and the EU, not from the US. The same goes for CureVac. To make it even less clear, a small country as the Netherlands (pop. 17 million) [has budgeted hundreds of millions of euros](https://www.rekenkamer.nl/onderwerpen/corona/coronarekening) for coronavirus vaccine development for 2020 and 2021. Something you would probably never hear about, because you have to dig deep into unclear government websites. Also, the EU contracts also include investment into production capacity next to the payment of doses (but these are not investments into development, so these are excluded) and the EU [has invested 12 billion euros](https://global-response.europa.eu/index_en) into funding to help develop and ensure equitable access to coronavirus vaccines.

Next to funding, the EU has also supplied a lot in terms of manufacturing. They are on track to be either the largest or second largest of corona vaccines producers in the world, with dozens of factories all over the EU. Also, it has also contributed a lot in terms of directly developing and researching vaccines. For example it are European labs and researchers that developed the Janssen vaccine (Netherlands), BioNTech vaccine (Germany), CureVac vaccine (Germany), Sanofi vaccine (France) and Valneva vaccine (France). On top of that, some of the pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies behind other vaccines are partly from the EU. Examples are NovaVax (Swedish/US) and AstraZeneca (Swedish/British).

Not a clear answer. But that is the point. We know the EU contribution was a lot, but I cannot give a clear estimate on how much it exactly was, as it was done by multiple governing bodies under different programs under different levels of publicity. This is not good and probably a result of the complexity and bureaucracy of things within the EU.

I'm a 23M who works as a poker dealer. I received my first vaccine two weeks ago and I thought I was nearly invincible after living covid-free for a year. Two of my coworkers tested positive and I started experiencing very mild symptoms (mostly a cough and tiredness.) I took an antigen test and that came back negative, but I was still very slightly symptomatic.

I stayed home from work that night because I thought there was a chance of a false negative, but the room desperately needed another dealer (because of the two who were home sick.) I felt pressure from my manager to come in but I didn't. The next day I took a PCR test and I just got the result: Positive.

I wanted to share for all the young people who may think they don't have the disease because:  


* Their symptoms were far milder than what they've seen in the news
* They had already gotten their first dose of the vaccine
* They took an antigen test very shortly after exposure or symptoms that returned negative
* They're young and their immune system will somehow deal with it

It's worth getting a PCR test! It only takes a minute, it's free, and it's not too uncomfortable. Especially as cases rise, it's important to get tested as soon as you feel symptoms. Not too many other illnesses going around rn with the masks and such so if you feel sick there's a good chance it's corona.

Finally there seems to be some noticable improvement but we are a long ways off.  We might be nearing (globally) a billion shots per Bloomberg, which in my estimate to vaccinate everybody against this thing is about 1/14th of the way there.  I don't even know if we are there yet, but last I checked it was over 600 million shots.  It will probably be less than that as there are one shot vaccines, so that's just an estimate.  I think our world in data says we have over 2% of the world fully vaccinated.  And there are countries that haven't really started.  Plus countries and areas within countries have certain hot spots right now and they are always changing.

In the US people say it's our state vs others, but that's not true.  Aside from Hawaii and Alaska, it's hard to keep people from traveling.  The US is pretty restrictive to foreign travel, but still foreigners have been coming in and others leaving this country during this last year plus.  And people are and have been going from state to state throughout the entire pandemic, for various reasons.  And they'll bring it with them.

The reason why Alaska and Hawaii are different, is because you can only get to Hawaii by boat or plane and Alaska those two plus car, but you have to drive through Canada which might be difficult to do.   Despite certain states with more stringent border checks at times many people are going places.

the tl;dr: Vaccinated. In the US. Friend sent out a save the date last year for a wedding in Poland. Yesterday, 2 MONTHS before he's getting married, I received the invite. For the wedding in Poland. During a global pandemic. I'm terrified of losing a friend over all this... but I ain't going to Poland

The longer story:

So my buddy's fiancee changed him a bit. She can be very difficult and stubborn, which works well because he could be very difficult and stubborn. They're the type to hold it against you for not going to their international wedding. 

So last July we got the Save the Date for the wedding in Poland. I thought ""you know what? This should all be done by Christmas! (lol) I'll owe it to myself - I'll do a trip to Europe, swing by Poland for a few days... it'll be great!"" 

Obviously that didn't go as planned and we hadn't heard a thing for a while. My one friend finally pushed him in a group chat about a month ago and asked what was going on. He said they were still planning stuff out, that it *was* happening, but they were figuring out the guidelines and all. 

DIdn't hear a thing since then. Yesterday I got the invite. Now, I'm vaccinated, but I also understand that while the US is doing very well, the rest of the world is not, and that makes me uncomfortable. Second, my job is asking us to return to the office on July 1st — I know... the Thursday before July 4th. Unreal. But I think it'd be very bad optics to go back to the office after all this, then a week later turn around and be like ""going to Europe! See ya in 2 weeks!"" 

I think I'm just going to explain that I have to return to the office, it'd be bad optics to travel internationally right now, and that I'm not gonna be able to swing it. Simple as that. I'm more than happy to celebrate them when they get back.

I am optimistic that we finally truly had our final ""mini-peak"" (which was barely a peak - thanks to vaccinations) and we should have a pretty solid national downward trend from here on out. But cases are still uncomfortably high in most states (especially ones like Michigan, albeit it looks like they have peaked as well). 

The issue is that public health messaging is hard. People want a ""when is this over?"" date. I do think the message should be ""when X% of population is vaccinated and there are less than Y cases per 100K per week"" as a standard threshold for all clears (well, probably multiple thresholds: masks will probably be the last to go given the low economic and personal cost of wearing them). 

Unfortunately that data is abstract and so I'm not sure how much it helps. People won't understand what it means or why it is relevant. 

The issue is that a simple message of ""oh you're vaccinated, you're fully protected!"" is misleading as well. Case load matters. The vaccines are highly personally protective, but not completely. At 90-95% efficacy from symptoms and 87-99% efficacy from hospitalizations (depending on what data you're looking at), the mRNA vaccines are great. But to put things into perspective: as of last week, it was about as safe to eat in a New Mexico restaurant unvaccinated (50 cases per 100K per week) as it was to eat in a Michigan restaurant vaccinated (500 cases per 100K per week). There is no better protection than low case loads. A 90% reduction in exposure risk is roughly just as ""effective"" as the vaccines (of course, the vaccines are also what enable us to reduce exposure - which is why are vaccines - and getting them in as many arms as possible - is so important). 

I think once you get below 25 or 50 cases per 100K per week and a high enough vaccination percentage, it's a no brainer to fully open everything up and party like it's 1999.

They OMT is against opening up now, but suggest to wait for now. Also, these projection have been wrong multiple times, both for being too optimistic and pessimistic. This is just how models are, they are not certain. So this could be a completely wrong decision, it is just a guess the government is taking.

I understand, no clue what the curfew is still doing. 10 pm curfew does not really stop a lot. Understandable that compliance is so high, because basically almost no one currently has the urge to go out at these times while clubs and pubs are closed anyway.

Also, that opening up outdoor parts of pubs and restaurants will decrease the amount of people in parks meetings what is that even based on? The only thing this will probably do is ensure the same amount of people will be in parks and more people are in the terrasjes. So more people out and about. Not specifically a bad thing (being outside), but then people should meet indoors less and keep following the measures outside and while going to such places. We will see if this happens, for now it is just a gamble.

And for higher education I understand it as well. Even though primary schools and high schools have proven to be huge corona factories this wave, the same could happen in higher education. It is only one day per week with measures, mandatory distancing and voluntary mass testing (low compliance anyways), so maybe they can keep it out but I highly doubt it, as high schools have basically the same set of measures and they have not been successful.

Look, the let go of measures separately I completely understand them. And each measure can be let go of without significant consequences. But this is assuming each measure is sperate and that people follow the rules. However, this is not the case, people do not always follow the measures and you cannot see the measures separately.

Florida's response followed some ""fringe"" epidemiologists that advised every location needs to reach herd immunity and the main job of society should be to protect the vulnerable and otherwise just let people do what they are going to do. If you can't lock down until vaccination places like California proved the danger of locking down for too long and then opening up with zero natural immunity. 

Side note is that lockdowns seem to disproportionately affect POC. States with longer and harder lockdowns had a higher number of minority deaths as a percentage of population (Michigan I'm looking at you..). I think herd immunity plays into this as well.

My question is that if that's how it's been in India for a year, then why now? How come the disease didn't spread through the population already last year like it did in Europe and in Americas? India's covid deaths peaked at 1k level in September and then went down (and are now rising rapidly). 1k is of course a big absolute number, but for 1.4 billion people it's tiny. The UK with it's 1/20 population had higher daily number of deaths in January than that. ([source](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries))

So, something doesn't add up. Either the Indians were far more careful last year than what you're implying or there is some hidden factor present in India that had a much bigger effect on the virus spread than the restrictions set by the government. (Ok, the age of the population is a factor. Indian's on average are much younger than Europeans, but even that can't explain alone the low death numbers).",,,1618994500,{},gvaxjd7,False,t3_mupfyu,False,False,t1_gv7q932,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mupfyu/indias_health_care_system_is_collapsing_under_the/gvaxjd7/,1619003095,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

B.1.617 has been identified from genome data submitted by 21 countries as of 19 April 2021.

Take a look at [this presentation](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/976877/CovidStats_07-04-21-final.pdf) from the UK's Winston Center for Risk and Evidence Communication. For folks in the age 20-29 bracket, the risk calculus between getting the AZ vaccine and waiting for a different vaccine is not at all clear cut. If you're low-risk, or you expect the wait to be significantly less than 16 weeks, waiting might even be the safer option.

You can make an argument that this level of risk isn't worth fretting about, but I think that argument is still a little murky. The risk of dying from the AZ vaccine seems to be on the order of 3 micromorts or so. Possibly 2-3x that if the risk is concentrated in certain age groups. In England, the average person's risk of dying of ""non-natural causes"" is [a bit under 1 micromort per day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromort), or about 300 in a year. So, in the year you get your AZ shot, you've increase your total yearly risk of death by ""non-natural causes"" by around 1-3%. That's small, but it's not negligible - it's the sort of risk you'd take because there's a good reason to take it. If you're in a country where case rates are high and vaccinations are low, I think that's a good reason to take it.

* The raw data can be downloaded exact totals for every age group can be downloaded from the [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) as a CSV.  The CDC indicates the data is by ""Date Administered"", but it actually appears to be by ""Date Reported"".
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC demographic data, so the tables do not match national totals.
* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group. The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, assuming that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17.

Add to that 750 million deliveries to the EU on Q3 and over 600 million deliveries in Q4. That's around 1.35 billion deliveries to the EU in the second half of 2021.

It is like this: you buy something from someone and expect to receive it tomorrow. But you will not receive it, the person you were buying it from decided to keep it for themselves and decides to give you the things later than agreed upon. Theft basically. The US is the buyers the EU is the buyer. There is a bit of nuance here, as it is the US government deciding to steal bought supplies, and not the suppliers directly. 

And something else, this implies that the EU is not capable of producing these things themselves. This is probably not true. There is a lot of vaccine and critical supply production in the EU. It is probably just that CureVac decided to buy from the US, as it made more sense business wise (e.g. cheaper). Now they are not getting it, so it must be sourced from the EU instead.

This also implies the US does not need any supplies from China/Europe. We do not know if this is not the case, as Europe and China just let private companies produce and deliver to whoever bought from them, instead of taking over production as c mmu nists. So US companies do not have to complain about supply from Europe and China, because they are just getting it.

Everyone is preferably dependent on each other, it makes things cheaper. But this can only happen with trust. This is a two way street. The US has broken the trust and made it a one way street (critical supplies in, nothing out). Now everyone knows never ever to get anything important/critical from the US as they cannot be trusted. This is bad for all. We are already seeing this in the EU. Previously they did not mind getting critical supplies from the US in the vaccine contracts they made, as they trusted the US even though there is domestic production. 

The trust is now completely gone, and thus the EU wants all critical materials for vaccine production to be sourced from within the EU with all future contracts. Some of this you can already see with Janssen, which was supposed to be filled and finished in the US. This has now been moved to the EU. And even more so in the new BioNTech contract for 1.8 billion doses all critical supplies must be sourced from within the EU now. Previously the first step for the BioNTech vaccine happened in the US (DNA plasmid production) while it could be done in the EU as well.

Two of the three variants in the triple mutation have been seen to have immune escape responses, meaning they are more resistant to antibodies.

From my own circle I've seen it's like 50% of people that were counting down the days until they could be vaccinated, some traveled an hour to get a vaccine apt on the first day it opened it to them.. 

Then there's maybe 20% who are vaccine hesitant, but more like ""I'll wait and see.."" 

But easily 30-40% of my circle is just like ""Yeah I'll probably get it next week or something"" and aren't really that pumped about doing it for a lot of the reasons you mentioned.  Side effects, time off work, etc. 

This is why losing the J&amp;J and losing trust it it's going to hurt.  I wonder how many people are going to get Shot #1 of Moderna/Pfizer and never get shot #2 - which offers unsure protection.

7 day rolling avg is now 45,598. 47,681 yesterday. 

3,443,826 MA residents have first doses - 49.96% (3,399,207 - 49.32% yesterday)

The UK is currently close to herd immunity, saving many thousands of lives, thanks in large part to the AZ vaccine. The desperation with which some people are trying to rubbish this and occasionally J&amp;J's vaccine suggests they're using it as consolation for the iniquity of their own vaccine programs. It's pretty transparent projection.

&gt;Why else would most of the developed world restrict this vaccine with age groups?

Viruses store their genetic information in different ways, and actually we classify them based on what their genomes look like: it's called the [Baltimare classification scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_classification), and there are 7 different groups. The details are always complicated, but yes, one of these groups stores its genomic information as something that is pretty much a mRNA. 

'mRNA' is a very specific way of storing genetic information. In our (human) cells is is used only temporarily to carry the genetic information from our genome (DNA) to the parts of the cell that produce the proteins. It carries a 'message', hence 'messenger RNA' or short 'mRNA'. 

Some viruses contain DNA (that would be group I), and when they get into a cell it behaves like our genome - the DNA is read, mRNA is produced and sent off to carry the information about which protein to make. Other viruses bypass that step, and already contain genetic information looks pretty much like mRNA. That would be the 'Group IV: positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses' from the link above. Funnily enough, this includes the coronaviruses. And yes, once the cell was hijacked and made more viruses, they leave the cell and spread around. 

One last addition: the vaccine mRNA only contains a small part of the coronavirus genome (the information on how to make the spike protein), and not the whole thing. So it's absolutely impossible for the mRNA vaccination to lead to virus production.

But this is an important point, one of the things to note is that California's COVID cases have ticked lower than TX or FL. In none of the 3 states has there been a *spike* like in winter. But CA has settled at about 6 cases per 100K, compared to 10 for TX and 29 for FL. Positivity rates are 1.0, 6.7, and 10.5 respectively per some random website I found.

Now there's always some randomness involved (you couldn't have predicted that Michigan and not, say, Ohio would have the worst surge in January), so it's possible CA is doing better and FL is doing worse just out of pure randomness. But I think this does suggest that reopening probably *does* have an effect, as common sense would imply.

But if vaccines and natural immunity mean only 50% of the population is susceptible to the virus, then the odds of exponential growth are just much lower (though, low probability does not mean impossible as Michigan revealed).

Some humans will die and most will survive.  And individuals behave with self-interest.  Most animal behavior studies show little evidence for collective survival instincts.

In other words, I'm not going to behave in a way that maximizes your fitness.  I'm out for myself.  I'm actually a pretty responsible person...so if I really think I'm going to make a difference I'm not going to actively fuck others over...you know...the social contract and all that shit.

The New York Health and Essential Rights Act, or NY HERO Act, sponsored by state Sen. Michael Gianaris (D-Queens) and Assemblywoman Karines Reyes (D-Bronx), calls for fines against businesses that fail to adopt and enact new standards to protect workers and stem the spread of coronavirus or other airborne diseases.

“Too many workers have already sacrificed their health for our community’s benefit,” Gianaris said after the Senate passed the measure on Tuesday. “The New York HERO Act honors their efforts by giving workers the tools to protect themselves while on the job.”

The union-backed bill directs the Department of Labor to issue airborne infectious disease standards for businesses that’ll include protocols on testing, face masks, personal protective equipment, social distancing and other measures.

The standards will be crafted by industry-specific worker committees, and the bill also includes strong anti-retaliation provisions that allow workers to call out employers without fear of reprisal.

New York State Senate Deputy Majority Leader, Michael Gianaris (D-Queens) (Hans Pennink/AP)

“The devastating infection rate and death toll that continues to ravage New Yorkers, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, shows that the status quo is broken— workers must have meaningful workplace health and safety protections, with real enforcement,” said Dennis Trainor, the vice president of CWA District 1. “This legislation is a long-overdue step to ensure all workers are protected on the job, and we call on Gov.

Also, opening the schools had been a mistake. With schools closed a little longer, I know it would have been hard, we would have been in a much better position by now and could have reopened more weeks ago. We are trying to do the same as the UK, but at a much higher number of infections and significantly lower vaccination grade.

The hospitals are currently just in an extremely fragile position. They have been over their max regular capacity since October last year (including COVID and non-COVID patients and mandatory BOSS beds). Currently around 1,400 beds are needed on the ICU for everything. This means so we are currently 28% over the regular capacity of our ICU. And occupancy is only increasing currently.  

They have ""expanded"" capacity, but this is just a farce, the amount of ICU nurses and physician are not increasing. We are just putting an even bigger workload on them, and calling it ""extra beds"". They just have to accept that they have been extremely busy the last 6 months and that that will not change any time soon. 

And what do you think about other care? All that care is being postponed for now, and the more people get in ICU, the more it has to be postponed. The last week's they have constantly decreased other care to make sure they could handle the increase of COVID patients. Now this decrease of regular care will take even long and the postponed care will stack up even more. All this postponed care has to be done after this wave as well, which means full ICU's after this wave for even longer. 

All in all just a terrible situation in the ICU's. Currently there are as many COVID patients in ICU as mid-May last year and because we do more regular now, as many ICU patients in total since end-April.

So chance of death from a bloodclot from birth control is 3-10 per million.

The figures here from Germany put the death toll from blood clots due to the AZ jab at 3 per million and the UK figures put it at 1 per million

So even though the type of bloodclot is more dangerous for AZ it occurs so much less that you are still less likely to die of it than dying of a bloodclot from birth control.

Nationwide the number of vaccinated people is staggering, ESPECIALLY since it’s those most at risk.  And the results are pretty good.

The ones remaining are younger and therefore probably healthier.  Some may feel it’s not worth getting it since their risk is much lower.  Some may just not care.  Some may be put off by the initial roll out.  These people even if they get it probably won’t be admitted to a hospital or tie up resources.

So, they just are vectors.  Hopefully, HOPEFULLY, the at risk majority is vaccinated and safe despite the younger unvaccinated ones acting as vectors.

If that happens, then we should see hospitalizations and deaths continue to trend down.  Incidence and case numbers then become less meaningful, at that point.

So, all in all, a plateau is expected, unfortunately unavoidable, but not necessarily a roadblock to progress.",,,1619025155,{},gvcf18s,False,t3_mvfadi,False,False,t1_gvcc8p7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mvfadi/us_vaccination_pace_holds_above_3_million_shots/gvcf18s/,1619036871,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

**Nucleic acid vaccines** 

These are where messenger RNA type vaccines like Moderna, Pfizer, and the phase 3 Curevac fall. These use genetic material (like RNA, but others in the pipeline are using DNA) to hijack cells into producing antigens... and these antigens produce an immune response. It’s completely new technology and rather costly at times but it appears to be working the best.

**Viral Vector Vaccines** 

These are what AZ, J&amp;J, and Sputnik V are. They work the same way that the nucleic acid vaccines work (hijacking cells to produce antigens) but they use harmless, altered viruses to do it rather than RNA/DNA. These don’t seem to work as well as their mRNA counter types but are generally cheaper to produce.

**Whole virus vaccines**

This is the group that contains the inactivated virus vaccine group (Like Covaxin and CoronaVac) but also contains the weakened live virus with no replication group. This is a tried and true method, and often has little side effects, although production and storage are a pain.

**Protein subunit vaccines**

If you do, you could end up spreading the COVID-19 variants. “I mean, if we learned one thing in this MMWR (that’s the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report) from Minnesota, the experience with the B117 variant, several of them came from California. Their only travel was from California. We really, really would advocate for not traveling right now.”

IIRC these were statements within the past month.  No one is going to be scouring the CDC website my dude.  No one is going to be attempting to reconcile the CDC website language against something that will hit the headline from Fauci or Walensky.  The messaging has been very confusing and disjointed.

[],,SandyDelights,,,[],,,,text,t2_z5d6w,False,False,[],"So, we have to be careful using the word “live” with “virus”. “Live” with reference to a virus means that it’s capable of replicating, like your electrical socket is “live”. Virus are not, themselves *alive* or *dead*, they are *live* or *inactivate*. We also use the term “killed” to distinguish from “attenuated” viruses, which *are* live but can no longer infect you (but might still infect something else), or can no longer reproduce effectively.

Types of vaccines I can think of off-hand are:
* mRNA
   * Messenger RNA that codes for spike protein riding on fatty acids get delivered to cells at the injection site, they produce this protein so your immune system freaks out and starts attacking it; this means it will attack those *specific* spike proteins in the future, including on viruses
* Vector viruses
   * Adenoviruses are the ones we use; they deliver DNA to cells to make them produce the spike protein, similar net result to mRNA
* Attenuated organism
   * These are viruses that are not “killed”, but have been deliberately mutated or denatured to become largely harmless, unable to infect you, etc.; the equivalent of tying up a hostile enemy and using them for target practice
* “Killed” vaccine
   * These are viruses that were once “live” (active) but deactivated, so they can no longer infect cells; if attenuated vaccines are tying up an enemy combatant and using them for target practice, then this is rounding up dead enemy combatants and using their *corpses* for target practice
* Conjugate vaccines
   * These Are vaccines that don’t contain viruses/bacteria, but instead use something they use – following the enemy combatant simile, this would be like dressing up a dummy with actual clothes/armor/whatever from enemy combatants and using it for target practice
* Toxoid vaccines
   * Contains the dangerous toxins produced of the organism, allowing your body’s immune system to target that, so that if you get infected, it renders the organism itself harmless; think Princess Bride and the poisoned goblets, or someone who has survived many poisonous bites not being harmed (or as harmed) by those bites as time goes on

Currently, Pfizer and Moderna are type 1, J&amp;J and AZ are type 2, Covaxin is type 4.

Attenuated organisms have usually been the most effective vaccines, IIRC, but it’s looking like mRNA might take the cake. It will take a lot of different trials, applications, types, and diseases to see how well vector vaccines stack up outside of COVID.

As far as these vaccines go, only Covaxin is “old school”. AZ and J&amp;J use vector vaccines, which have been studied for a while (particularly vs. HIV), but only actually approved for use once before (vs. Ebola).

Really glad to see mRNA working well, and hope we’ll see more applications of this biotech in the future.

Some general information on the distinction re: live/alive:

A virus falls in about two categories:
* Genetic material surrounded by a protein coat (capsid)
* Genetic material surrounded by a protein coat (capsid) and a partial or complete layer of lipids/fatty acids (envelope)

Genetic material can be DNA or RNA, depends on the virus.

That’s it. There’s no “life” to them, they aren’t actually alive – there’s no activity until they bang up against a cell that they can infect, and then they inject their genetic material into the cell, which then overrides cell function (immediately or at some future point in time, e.g. HIV reservoir cells) and makes it begin producing new viruses.

Honestly, the best comparison IMHO is that they’re basically little robots, built out of DNA/RNA and proteins – occasionally wearing the skins of their victims, too, since that’s what the lipid envelope is from (cell membrane when the host cell ruptures to release the virus).",,,1619020087,{},gvc2wtn,False,t3_mvdesn,False,False,t1_gvbvhx9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mvdesn/covaxin_shows_78_overall_interim_efficacy_100/gvc2wtn/,1619028157,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;Dr Mishra said this was not a population study, so if someone’s antibodies were put in cell culture and the virus was unable to infect it, it would mean the vaccine had worked. This exercise was particularly significant as India opens vaccination to all aged 18 and above from May 1.

&gt;According to a report from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Tuesday, from 20,000 cases reported on January 1, the country has reported almost 10 times the number of cases (over two lakh) daily since April 15.

&gt;Dr Mishra said whichever variant was there in any state, the spread depended on lack of Covid-appropriate behaviour. But if there were multiple variants in a location, the one which spread more would become more dominant and, so among existing variants in Maharashtra, the double mutation — E484Q and L452R — was more efficient, he said.

&gt;“We are monitoring how much this variant is spreading and are in the process of collecting 5 per cent samples from each state to see which is doing worse or better in any of these places. It may or may not be dangerous, but if it is spreading fast then that itself is a bad sign; so it needs to be urgently contained as we do not want a dangerous version of the virus,” he said.

&gt;Dr Mishra further said scientists were also monitoring hospital deaths due to a particular variant and, hence, it was important to culture these variants. “Testing vaccinated people’s sera and those who have had the infection will help us understand if it prevents the growth of the virus,” he added.",,,1618990290,{},gvat7pc,True,t3_mvaj22,False,True,t3_mvaj22,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mvaj22/ccmb_scientists_to_culture_double_mutant_other/gvat7pc/,1619000635,1,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

**One:** Yes, I agree, *but* I always find this kind of argument somewhat short-sighted, insofar that it views it in a vacuum. The “problem” with “reducing SEVERE COVID down to a mild/asymptomatic infection” is that it **definitely** saves lives right now, it *may* reduce spread, but it also creates an environment where dangerous mutations are selected for – it doesn’t take very many people who are vaccinated, get infected, **AND** develop a mutated strain that evades the current immune defense built by current vaccines to reboot this entire pandemic back to day one.

Note, I emphasize “and” there because all three need to occur together, and by reducing spread via any percentage of the population having immunity we mitigate (but not remove) the risk of this, but yeah: the more people who are vaccinated (who also have an immune response) and still get infected *does* create an environment that selects for strains that can evade the immune system’s current antibodies. Meaning, if someone has COVID and in their body it randomly mutates on the spike protein that most (all?) of these vaccines target – and does so in such a way that it is largely ignored by the antibodies the vaccines produce – we’re back at square one. Well, square one and a half or so, since we know Pfizer and Moderna are highly effective and it just becomes a matter of swapping out the mRNA for another that codes for this new protein.

Mind, 70% total immunity and 100% protection vs. severe immunity is a metric **fuck ton** better than nothing, but the better vaccines are at preventing *any* infection, the more effective they are at mitigating the risk of strains that evade the immune defenses.

**Two:** And therein lies the rub, one hinted at in your claim, too (emphasis mine): “if you catch COVID *but don’t have a chance to transmit it* AND you don’t die we’re going to lower overall ... transmission, ... mortality rate, etc.”

That requires a lot more self-control than most people have. Nobody is going to know if they have a mild cold or a mild case of COVID, and while we don’t know if someone who has a mild case and is vaccinated (with immune response) can *definitely* spread it (or that they *cannot* spread it), it seems likely they can (infection implies the virus is replicating in their system).

After the horrific social experiment we’ve seen play out over the last year and change, dollars to donuts, **many** people aren’t going to stay home over mild sniffles and a cough – a lesson we learned *without* a vaccine, never mind the belief that they have immunity *with* a vaccine.

And that’s the shit that scares me still. I’ve definitely been fucked up by all the isolation and stress from the last year, and I’ll be dealing with that for a while, but I can’t escape this impending dread that the combination of: vaccines which are less effective at preventing any COVID infection, and people giving up entirely on being cautious when they have symptoms, will put us back months to a year in dealing with this.",,,1619018599,{},gvbzfjq,False,t3_mvdesn,False,True,t1_gvblmrt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mvdesn/covaxin_shows_78_overall_interim_efficacy_100/gvbzfjq/,1619025802,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; Pfizer Inc. says it has identified in Mexico and Poland the first confirmed instances of counterfeit versions of the Covid-19 vaccine it developed with BioNTech SE, the latest attempt by criminals trying to exploit the world-wide vaccination campaign.

&gt; Vials seized by authorities in separate investigations were tested by the company and confirmed to contain bogus vaccine. The vials recovered in Mexico also had fraudulent labeling, while a substance inside vials in Poland was likely an anti-wrinkle treatment, Pfizer said.

&gt; About 80 people at a clinic in Mexico received a fake vaccine going for about $1,000 a dose, though they don’t appear to have been physically harmed. The vials, found in beach-style beer coolers, had different lot numbers than those sent to the state, and a wrong expiration date, said Dr. Manuel de la O, the health secretary of Nuevo León state.

&gt; Polish authorities said no one there had received the counterfeit vaccine, which was seized at a man’s apartment.

&gt; The findings are the latest in an effort between law enforcement and drugmakers such as Pfizer, Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson to stem criminal activity related to the Covid-19 vaccines. The global rollout of shots has provided criminals a fresh opportunity to take advantage of unsuspecting people.

&gt; “Everybody on the planet needs it. Many are desperate for it,” said Lev Kubiak, Pfizer’s world head of security. “We have a very limited supply, a supply that will increase as we ramp up and other companies enter the vaccine space. In the interim, there is a perfect opportunity for criminals.”

&gt; The U.S., Mexico and other countries have seized and taken down dozens of websites fraudulently claiming to sell shots or an affiliation with vaccine makers such as Moderna and Pfizer, according to government officials and records. The fake, company look-alike websites appeared to be seeking consumers’ personal information to be used in identity-fraud schemes, government and industry officials say.

&gt; Police in China and South Africa last month seized thousands of doses of counterfeit Covid-19 vaccines in warehouses and manufacturing plants, arresting dozens of people, according to the international police agency Interpol. Mexico also is investigating a shipment of some 6,000 doses of purported Sputnik vaccine from Russia, which were seized from a private plane headed to Honduras. Authorities haven’t determined whether the vaccines are genuine.

&gt; For months, agents from the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, an investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, have been investigating fraud related to the Covid-19 pandemic globally, recovering $48 million worth of phony masks, personal protective equipment and other products. Last fall, investigators shifted their focus to include Covid-19 vaccines that were nearing potential clearance by regulators, beginning with online scams. They have removed 30 websites and seized 74 web domains, according to IPR officials.

&gt; So far, no counterfeit vaccines have been discovered in the U.S., according to the DHS. But limited supply of Covid-19 shots and their high demand can steer people to seek vaccinations outside official channels, particularly in countries such as Mexico and Brazil, where Covid-19 cases are high and there is a history of counterfeiting prescription drugs, industry and security experts said.

&gt; “Whenever you see this mismatch between demand and supply in certain areas, there are people who are willing to fill that difference with counterfeits,” said Tony Pelli, a consultant with BSI Group who focuses on drug security. “For new drugs, it’s usually just a matter of time before you see people trying to counterfeit them.”

&gt; Counterfeiting prescription drugs has grown more lucrative in the past decade, industry and security officials say. The counterfeit prescription drug market is valued at more than $200 billion annually, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.

&gt; Distributing fake Covid-19 vaccines also is easier than stealing and selling legitimate shots because of extreme security measures taken by countries and drugmakers during the pandemic, said Mr. Pelli. “With counterfeits, you kind of can just show up, and say, ‘Here’s Covid vaccines, we’ve got some, don’t ask how,’ and start distributing them,” Mr. Pelli said.

&gt; Big drugmakers such as Pfizer employ security teams consisting of former law-enforcement officials who help train government agencies and help with investigations related to counterfeit prescription drugs. Pfizer in recent years worked with law enforcement to find sellers of fake doses of erectile dysfunction treatment Viagra and antianxiety drug Xanax.

&gt; One tactic used by IPR Center agents is searching the clear and dark web with keywords related to vaccines provided by their manufacturers.

&gt; “We’ve never seen so much fraud and misinformation and schemes,” said Steve Francis, director of the IPR Center, which has opened more than 35 cases related to Covid-19 vaccine scams.

&gt; Mr. Francis’s agents and Pfizer began meeting weekly last fall to prepare for scams and counterfeiting. During one presentation, company officials said they didn’t initially release images of the vial’s authentic labels partly as a means of staying ahead of criminals.

&gt; Pfizer is also working with local law enforcement on counterfeit-vaccine cases like those recently uncovered in Mexico and Poland.

&gt; Polish police in January seized a number of vials filled with a liquid and labeled as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine from a man’s apartment, according to Pfizer and Polish authorities. No one is believed to have received a fake shot, according to Polish prosecutors leading the investigation. Polish police arrested the man, who has been charged with fraud, Polish authorities said.

&gt; Pfizer suspected the vaccines were fake because they weren’t in the vials the company uses for its Covid-19 shot, Mr. Kubiak said. They were identical to containers police recovered in the man’s apartment that had a label for another company’s anti-wrinkle treatment.

&gt; Pfizer tested the liquid in the vials purported to be its Covid-19 vaccine at its laboratory in Groton, Conn., finding it lacked key ingredients and instead contained hyaluronic acid, which is used in skin products.

&gt; In early February, Mexican police raided a clinic in the northern state of Nuevo León, where alleged fake vaccines were administered to people. Mexican police detained six people.

&gt; “People were injected with distilled water,” said Dr. de la O in a telephone interview. A spokesman for Mexico’s attorney general’s office, which is carrying out the investigation, declined to comment.

&gt; Pfizer, which is working with DHS officials to support Mexican authorities on the case, confirmed the vaccine was fake after using special light and microscopic analysis to find the adhesive label on the vial wasn’t authentic. Mr. Kubiak declined to provide additional details but said Pfizer may conduct more tests on the liquid.

&gt; Mr. Kubiak said he expects counterfeiting to worsen as the rollout continues. “Right now, consumers are easily fooled,” he said. “They are desperate for the vaccine.”",,,1619018354,{},gvbyuql,True,t3_mvhtj7,False,False,t3_mvhtj7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mvhtj7/pfizer_identifies_fake_covid19_shots_abroad_as/gvbyuql/,1619025441,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The government needs to start addressing apathy directly with something better than ""Do as you're told."" We have the doses. They're free. They're in pharmacies.

If the vaccines are 90% effective, but the exposure risk is 10X higher (e.g., New Mexico versus Michigan), then the relative risk is the same. That's exactly what I said, and is exactly what the article you linked says.  

It is completely incorrect to say that ""your chance of getting COVID is .04%"". First, the data you're citing is very incomplete. The CDC's breakthrough data is very incomplete because it requires voluntary reporting. It is only starting to be industrialized at testing centers and testing data. Secondly, this is a timebound risk (which efficacy *is not*). Every day that passes (while case load exists) will increase the number of people infected. 

An individual's chance of getting infected is still dependent upon exposure risk. If my non-vaccinated exposure risk for the month was 10% (i.e. I had a 10% chance of catching COVID before), then the vaccines lower your absolute risk of experiencing symptoms to .5-1%. 

It is *safer* to be in a highly vaccinated, low case load population unvaccinated than to be vaccinated in a high exposure risk area. For example, if you are vaccinated in measles but are in a low measles vaccination community, you are more likely to get measles than an unvaccinated person who lives in an area with high vaccination. Exposure risk is mitigated by efficacy, but if your exposure risk is 100X higher, then even 95% effectiveness means your risk is still 5X higher.",,,1619018122,{},gvbybpg,False,t3_mvddk8,False,True,t1_gvbucy9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mvddk8/vaccines_are_working_the_charts_that_show_the/gvbybpg/,1619025122,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

At least 22 people died from loss of oxygen in a hospital accident. Infections hit a daily record. And the government faced criticism for allowing an enormous Hindu festival to continue.

NEW DELHI — India’s health care system shows signs of buckling under the strain of a second wave of coronavirus infections, as the authorities reported nearly 300,000 new cases on Wednesday and an accident at a Covid-19 hospital killed more than 20 people.

The accident happened at a hospital in the western state of Maharashtra after a leak in the hospital’s main oxygen tank stopped the flow of oxygen to dozens of critically ill people. Televised images showed family members wailing in the wards and nurses frantically pounding on the chests of some patients.

All week, hospitals across India have been warning about an acute oxygen shortage. Many hospital officials said they were just a few hours away from running out.

“Nobody imagined this would happen,” said Subhash Salunke, a medical adviser to the Maharashtra government.

India is now home to the world’s fastest-growing Covid-19 crisis, reporting 294,000 new infections on Wednesday and more than 2,000 deaths. As supplies of hospital beds, oxygen and vaccines run low, criticism of the government is building.

In a televised address on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged people to be more careful but said that lockdowns were a last resort. States and cities are increasingly going into lockdown on their own, and critics say the government’s mixed messages are making matters worse.

As examples, they point to recent political rallies held by Mr. Modi that have drawn thousands, as well as the government’s decision to allow an enormous Hindu festival to continue despite signs that it has become a superspreader event. A few days ago, Mr. Modi indicated that he wanted Hindu worshipers to stay away from this year’s festival, called the Kumbh Mela, which is held on the banks of the Ganges river considered sacred by many Hindus.

But the worshipers keep coming — 70,000 showed up on Wednesday for a holy dip, bringing the total to more than 10 million since the festival began in January — and government officials on the ground are doing little to stop them.

Event organizers said that worshipers were required to produce a negative coronavirus test result or be tested on the spot, but they also acknowledged that with such huge crowds, some participants could have slipped in without being tested. Photographs show a sea of worshipers packed together in the gray waters of the river, many without masks. More than 1,000 tested positive at the site in just 48 hours, according to reports by the Indian news media.

Leaders of India’s political opposition and religious minorities say that Mr. Modi’s government, which is firmly rooted in a Hindu-first worldview, is giving preferential treatment to Hindus.

“It is a clear example of double standards,” said Khalid Rasheed, chairman of the Islamic Center of India, a nonprofit religious organization.

He compared the government’s apparent endorsement of the Kumbh to the way it handled a much smaller gathering of a few thousand Islamic preachers in New Delhi last March. Not only was the seminary that hosted it shut down, but hundreds of people were also detained. Officials from Mr. Modi’s party blamed the seminary for spreading the virus.

That spurred an anti-Muslim campaign across India in which Muslims were attacked with cricket bats and run out of their neighborhoods. Many of the Muslims arrested at the seminary a year ago are still awaiting trial.

Government officials have defended the Kumbh festival as safe even as the virus infects some of its most high-profile attendees, including the former king of Nepal and his wife.

Another visitor who was infected is Tirath Singh Rawat, the chief minister of Uttarakhand, which as the state hosting this year’s festival stands to make millions in revenue from the pilgrims and vendors. Mr. Rawat mingled freely in the crowds without a mask, and told those who questioned him that “faith in God will overcome the fear of the virus.”

Shailesh Bagauli, a state official, said the timing of the festival had been determined by “optimal astrological conditions” and that the government had implemented measures like mask wearing and social distancing.",,,1619017713,{},gvbxehr,True,t3_mvhoww,False,False,t3_mvhoww,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mvhoww/indias_health_system_cracks_under_the_strain_as/gvbxehr/,1619024547,1,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

For this reason, zero COVID is not a realistic goal, in my opinion.  Instead, we should shoot for high vaccination rates which prevents large outbreaks.  The high vaccination rates will also lower severity of the disease for most, and it will fall into the background of other common respiratory viruses that are out there.

The vaccines released their six month update and it looks great. It’s not that the vaccine only works for six month, it’s that that’s what we know so far. Trial participants signed up for several years. These updates will come out regularly every few months as we continue to test the trial participants. 

For what it’s worth, natural immunity studies found a decent amount of immunity was long-lasting as well, though not as effective as the vaccines. Most of those have probably ended due to vaccine availability, but what they saw was promising. 

There’s no reason to think you’ll need a booster every six months, though you might need a booster sometime this year. That’s not because the vaccine is wearing off, it’s because they’re looking to improve it to account for more possible mutations. 

Anecdotal, but many people who had covid experienced vaccine side effects after the first shot only. Personally, the only side effect I had the second time around was arm pain and minor fatigue. It was nothing like my first time (which was nowhere near as bad as actually having covid). The general thought process is that the body recognizes the vaccine the second time it encounters it.

[],,itsdr00,,,[],,,,text,t2_4aujy,False,False,[],"You can't really explain it without talking about politics at least a little, because the virus is spreading fastest in a lot of previously-missed conservative communities. The thumb and parts of Northern Michigan are experiencing their worst-ever outbreaks, and those are heavily conservative areas. Basically, a more-contagious covid variant found a bunch of virgin territory in communities that decided that, with the arrival of the vaccine and the end of winter, they were done being careful and were eager to return to normal. That turned into such a major outbreak that cases rose pretty much every where but the Upper Peninsula, which already had a sustained outbreak last year.

You can read about their attitudes [here](https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2021/04/many-of-michigans-thumb-residents-are-done-with-covid-19-pandemic-even-as-virus-rages-like-wildfire.html). In case it's behind a paywall, here are some good bits:

&gt;“Just so you know, you don’t have to wear that if you don’t want to,” owner Mark Heberling says as a masked visitor walks through door.

&gt;...

&gt;“I didn’t sign up to be the mask police,” says restaurant owner Troy Tank, as a handful of maskless employees clean up after the lunch rush. Tank casually mentions one worker is home quarantining after a positive COVID test.

&gt;...

&gt;Compared to the rest of Michigan, the Thumb was less impacted by previous surges, which meant fewer people had natural immunity coming into the spring. The area appears to be hard-hit by the new B.1.1.7. variant which is much more contagious and also more lethal. Restrictions implemented in November have been eased, increasing social interactions.
&gt;
&gt;And fanning the flames is widespread resistance among local residents to coronavirus mitigation strategies such as masking and avoiding indoor gatherings, said Bryant Wilke, Sanilac County public health director.
&gt;
&gt;“There’s been a defiance towards masks,” Wilke said, “and I think it was because it got so political at the beginning of the pandemic. People said, ‘We don’t trust this. We never had to do it before,’ even through its been proven that it is a protective factor. People haven’t gotten over the hump to say, ‘We need to do this,’ and now we’re seeing the causation of not doing it and that’s the skyrocketing numbers in cases.
&gt;
&gt;“I compare us to a potential wildfire,” Wilke said. “You’ve got fuel out there and the virus hadn’t hit us that bad yet. Now it’s hitting us and we’re dealing with the U.K. variant, and it’s just moving through the population rapidly.”

&gt;...

&gt;At the same time, Thumb residents -- like many in Michigan -- are thoroughly sick of more than a year of various coronavirus restrictions. They are ready to move on, whether the pandemic is over or not.
&gt;
&gt;“We’re just f----- done with it,” Heberling said.

&gt;...

&gt;Hamed has long worried that the Thumb is vulnerable because of residents’ disdain for coronavirus restrictions.
&gt;
&gt;Still, good luck and geographic isolation meant the Thumb wasn’t hit as hard as other parts of Michigan in 2020.
&gt;
&gt;“I think that allowed people to discount how serious this is,” Hamed said.

Michigan: 6.5% confirmed, 26% had Covid

*relies on CDC’s estimate that there are three unconfirmed cases per confirmed 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html

With poor testing, SD is likely closer to 60% while MI is closer to 20% back in March, but that is speculation without enough available fine-grain data. 

Anyway, a vast majority of people in S Dakota who did not socially distance came down with Covid and no longer spread the virus. A significant fraction of people in Michigan can spread the disease and many gave up their social isolation this Spring before the vaccine was widely available to the high-transmitters. Hence the MI spike when the more infectious variants came to the United States.

If you fuck something up you should absolutely fix the issue through whatever means necessary if you have the ability to. Especially when you have the worst outbreak in the world in nominal terms.

&gt;The lipids for the mRNA vaccines come from the EU, UK, and Canada.

You're confusing where the companies that produce the lipids are headquartered with where the production is. There are several facilities producing lipids in the US. CordenPharma for example has a plant in Colorado. Croda has one in Alabama from a US company it acquired last year in anticipation of need. You also confuse me for someone being a hypocrite on this issue: I'm also a German dual citizen and wouldn't complain about an EU, Indian, or UK export ban.

&gt;It's also interesting to see how thrilled Americans are that their country imposed an export ban on private companies. I guess people suddenly like Communism when it's convenient.

I'm the last person who would call government intervention or export bans Communism. National emergencies call for the marshaling of all resources available in the country and this is the worst one our country has faced since World War 2.

They're not always the same sources. The 2021 thing is more of my friends and social media criticizing the media, while the permanent restrictions thing is the media itself.

Unfortunately, the issue we have is it's 3-4 weeks between most shots for 'full protection' for the first dose (which is still pretty good actually) and for 'full protection' two weeks later, so it's six weeks.  We are likely two weeks behind the state and CDC data.  But there's real hope this is over sooner rather than later and that these vaccines may be starting to show that they are seriously working (in my view).  Likely it's about 20% country-wide in the US, which is why largely cases are starting to go slowly down (we can hope).",,,1619034809,{},gvd1rd6,False,t3_mva5tz,False,True,t1_gvcxl11,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mva5tz/daily_discussion_thread_april_21_2021/gvd1rd6/,1619050295,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I totally agree and I'm very concerned about this considering the issue with people refusing to take the vaccine too.

However, the mutations we've seen so far seem to be spike protein efficiency mutations and not mutations that increase mortality.  Hopefully I'm not wrong here but if so please correct me if I'm wrong.  

&gt; AND develop a mutated strain that evades the current immune defense built by current vaccines to reboot this entire pandemic back to day one.

I suspect that won't happen just due to the fact that covid isn't very prone to mutations being a coronavirus.  The mutations themselves we've seen tend to be focused around the spike and increase efficiency.  

We also haven't seen any mutations that completely evade current vaccines.  I haven't seen updated R numbers yet though but if we can keep it around 1-1.5 like the flu we're out of the pandemic. 

&gt; Mind, 70% total immunity and 100% protection vs. severe immunity is a metric fuck ton better than nothing, but the better vaccines are at preventing any infection, the more effective they are at mitigating the risk of strains that evade the immune defenses.

I think we're on the same page here as the endemic mutation scenario does frighten me but the history is that viruses eventually domesticate themselves after a species jump and I don't see why it wouldn't do this again.  

We're just freaked out about covid because it's novel.  

I'd strongly prefer us to kill it though by having everyone get with the program and get vaccinated.  

&gt; Two: And therein lies the rub, one hinted at in your claim, too (emphasis mine): “if you catch COVID but don’t have a chance to transmit it AND you don’t die we’re going to lower overall ... transmission, ... mortality rate, etc.”

I don't think I clarified my point here.  Sorry.

If you lower the mortality rate, and total impact on infection, you're almost certainly going to reduce the infection transmission duration.  I think right now it's 10 days on average from onset of symptoms. 

So if you lower this to 5 because the immune system can mount a stronger and faster response you're going to lower R too.

&gt; And that’s the shit that scares me still. I’ve definitely been fucked up by all the isolation and stress from the last year

I have to admit that I seriously underestimated the impact it would have on my family.  

I have a few family members that are in therapy after long term isolation and I myself had severe anxiety due to covid.  I think what bothered me most is when I was out and OTHER people weren't being responsible.

They proposed that anti-mask sentiment forms a network of related attitudes that influence each other in different ways. To explore this web of attitudes, they used network analyses — a method of analyzing data that looks for patterns of relationships between interrelated variables or “nodes”.

&gt;The researchers collected survey data from a sample of over 2,000 Americans and Canadians with an average age of 54. The survey asked participants a range of questions designed to assess negative attitudes toward face masks. The surveys also asked respondents whether or not they wear a face mask because of COVID-19.

&gt;First, the vast majority (84%) of respondents said that they did wear a face mask, while only 16% did not. Unsurprisingly, those who said they did not wear a mask endorsed more negative attitudes toward masks.

&gt;A series of analyses were then used to determine the relative importance of each variable or node within this network of attitudes. The researchers found that certain negative attitudes were strongly clustered — the belief that masks are ineffective, the belief that wearing a mask is a tough habit to acquire, the belief that masks make you look untrustworthy, the beliefs that masks look ugly or silly, and the beliefs that masks cause overheating or difficulty breathing. All of these negative attitudes — with the exception of beliefs about overheating and difficulty breathing — were significantly more endorsed by people who did not wear face masks.

&gt;Moreover, at the center of the network of attitudes was an aversion to wearing face masks, assessed with the item, “I do not like feeling forced to wear a facemask.” This attitude, which the researchers refer to as mask-related psychological reactance, was the node that scored highest in “closeness” and “betweenness” — two measures that denote how important a node is in connecting other nodes to each other. The belief that masks are ineffective scored the highest in “strength” — meaning that it made the most direct connections to other nodes.",,,1619019641,{},gvc1uvn,False,t3_mvhawl,False,False,t1_gvc1qk0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mvhawl/a_phenomenon_called_psychological_reactance_might/gvc1uvn/,1619027429,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The changes to the Infection Protection Act could be a watershed moment in Germany's fight against the third wave of COVID-19.

Up until now, the federal government was technically in charge of restriction measures — but in the country's decentralized federal structure, the 16 states were free to implement those guidelines as they saw fit.

Increasingly, the states have diverged in how to implement the guidelines they agreed on, leading to huge disparities across state borders on what rules were in place. Some states were opening up, despite exponential infection growth, while others remained closed. Although this may have won state premiers popularity among voters, it has also seen infection numbers soar.

Faced with such inconsistency, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government introduced this legislation to legally obligate — rather than cajole — states into specific action in certain circumstances.

It has been described in German media as a move to centralize power to Berlin, however, but such a move would require a change in the constitution.

What happens next?
The 16 federal states could still block it on Thursday in the Bundesrat, Germany's upper house of parliament. However, this is not expected. 

If passed by both houses, affected districts will be immediately required to implement the new rules.

At some point, the law could be challenged in Germany's Constitutional Court.",,,1619019439,{},gvc1dql,False,t3_mvgdnw,False,True,t3_mvgdnw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mvgdnw/germany_bundestag_approves_national_coronavirus/gvc1dql/,1619027110,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,KinnerNevada,,,[],,,,text,t2_m76zflk,False,False,[],"New York City health officials estimate that nearly a quarter of adult New Yorkers were infected with the coronavirus during the catastrophic wave of last spring, and that the toll was even higher among Black and Hispanic residents.

The estimates, based on antibody test results for more than 45,000 city residents last year, suggest that Black and Hispanic New Yorkers were twice as likely as white New Yorkers to have had antibodies to the coronavirus — evidence of prior infection.

Hispanic New Yorkers had the highest rate, with about 35 percent testing positive for antibodies, according to the study, whose authors include officials and researchers at the city Health Department and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Among Black New Yorkers, 33.5 percent had antibodies. Among Asian New Yorkers, the rate was about 20 percent. For white New Yorkers, the rate was 16 percent.

Antibody surveys of segments of the population have become a useful way to gauge what percentage of people were infected and what groups were most at risk, especially since there was limited testing for the virus during the first wave.

The new paper, which has been accepted by the Journal of Infectious Diseases, has substantial limitations: Of the 45,000 New Yorkers in the study, fewer than 3,500 were Black, a major underrepresentation. And the participants were recruited partly through advertisements online, which the study’s authors acknowledge may have attracted people who believed they had been exposed to Covid-19.

But the study adds to experts’ understanding of the disproportionate toll that the pandemic has taken on Black and Latino people.

Its findings also come amid a push to vaccinate more people in the United States. A recent survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the number of Americans, particularly Black adults, who want to get vaccinated has continued to increase. According to an analysis last month by The New York Times, Black people were still being inoculated at half the rate of white people. The disparities are especially alarming as Black and Latino people and Native Americans have been dying at twice the rate of white people.

In New York City, about 44 percent of white adults have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 26 percent of Black adults and 31 percent of Latino adults have, according to city data.

Experts and community leaders across the country say that over all, the lower vaccination rates are linked to technological and linguistic barriers and disparities in access to vaccination sites. Other factors include social media misinformation and a hesitancy to be vaccinated. Hesitancy among African-Americans, experts say, can be tied to a longstanding mistrust of medical institutions that have long mistreated Black people.

The recent data from New York “show how frontline workers bore the brunt of the first wave of the pandemic,” said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. She noted that many jobs with higher levels of exposure — like grocery store employees, child-care providers and transit workers — have comparatively fewer white workers.

“These were the people who did not have the luxury of being able to work virtually,” she said.

Dr. Kitaw Demissie, who is dean of the School of Public Health at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn and was not involved in the study, noted that household crowding may have also contributed to differing infection rates. Some predominately Latino neighborhoods which were particularly hard hit in the first wave had high rates of household crowding.",,,1619017329,{},gvbwiu7,True,t3_mvhk07,False,False,t3_mvhk07,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mvhk07/antibody_rates_among_black_and_hispanic_new/gvbwiu7/,1619024007,7,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;So if you'd take birth control you should take the AZ jab. I honestly think the average human is just shit at comprehending tiny risks.

That's not how this works though. To determine whether or not to take a risk, you want to weigh the benefits against the risk, not compare it to an unrelated risk. We give people lots of drugs more dangerous than the AZ jab, but that's because the benefits outweigh the risks. 

To determine if the AZ jab is worth the risk, you want to compare the odds developing and suffering serious complications from VIPIT, to the odds that you would catch COVID and develop serious complications before you could get an MRNA vaccine. 

This risk is totally different from person to person. How long would you need to delay to get an MRNA ? What's you're life style ? Do you have pre-existing conditions ? What's the prevalence of COVID where you life ? How old are you ? 

For a lot of people, it makes sense to get an AZ jab. It's safer than waiting. For a lot of other people, its safer to wait for an MRNA vaccine. Just because that person may also take birth control isn't relevant. To them, the benefits of using birth control (ability to have a safe and active sex life and other hormonal benefits) outweigh the small risk of blood clots and other side effects.

What we want to be doing is either A) zeroing in on the level of restrictions that people will have to live with, no more no less, or B) reducing those restrictions in general. It's like, if self-driving cars became so ubiquitous and so simple to operate that you just put in your destination and then you didn't have to touch it, then there would be no need to license drivers. There wouldn't have to be traffic laws. A seven-year-old, a blind person, or a drunk person could all operate the vehicle. That would be a good thing, because it would give people more personal power. 

The problem is that there's an alternate mentality that says, no, it's *not* a good thing to give people more personal power. It's better to have them working for others. By that mentality, self-driving cars would have a drawback in that people would be more likely to get drunk and not worry about how to get home. 

We need to get rid of that second mentality with regard to masks. We need to make clear that it's, ""We don't want to force you to do it, we're begging you to so that we can get to the point where it doesn't matter. Once it's safe enough, you'll be free to tell public health officials to go screw themselves. Your anecdotal view will outweigh the science. Your choice will matter more than the consequences."" 

If you do that, you're more likely to get compliance and understanding. If you don't, then people are going to suspect that your goal is less about safety and more about control.

I think mask guidance should be loosened for the summer with a recommendation that people wear something in enclosed air conditioned environments with many other people. It should be reassessed in the fall when kids return to school and mask wearing would not create heat stress with the potential to be brought back of covid risk remains high but otherwise just being recommended for those who feel comfortable wearing them for the rest of the pandemic.

We should also maybe reassess our timeline for trials in kids, if the biggest concern while vaccinating kids is really the antibodies they produce when given a vaccine (honestly 100% the #1 reason for a vaccine to be immediately killed off in trials or pulled from the market historically), the risk of auto-antibodies is far lower when exposed to the spike alone rather than the whole virus.
