Now sage's model said: **IF** the variant is 40% (or more) more transmissible then it is likely that .....

So not only does it mean that is our worst case scenario but also it is ""likely"" which to me says a 50 to 75% probability event. Otherwise it should be ""very likely"" or ""extremely likely.""

In conclusion:

* We will **definitely** not see a resurgence of hospitalisations equal or exceeding previous peaks. That's simply not happening, it's their worst case modelling and they seriously haven't accounted for the latest data that shows vaccine efficacy remains.
* I don't think we actually disagree on much except that you are terrified of a new mutation. This virus mutates once per case transmission (approximately and on average) - if need be I can dig up the source.
* Unless something comes along and completely side-steps both Pfizer and AZ vaccines, the UK will never be in a bad a position as it was before.

Up to 12 May 2021, the MHRA had received Yellow Card reports of 309 cases of major thromboembolic events (blood clots) with concurrent thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) in the UK following vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca. These events occurred in 169 women and 138 men aged from 18 to 93 years and the overall case fatality rate was 18% with 56 deaths. **Fifteen cases have been reported after a second dose.**  
  
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis was reported in 116 cases (average age 46 years) and 193 had other major thromboembolic events (average age 55 years) with concurrent thrombocytopenia. The estimated number of first doses of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca administered in the UK by 12 May was 23.9 million and **the estimated number of second doses was 9.0 million**. the data shows that there is a higher reported incidence rate in the younger adult age groups compared to the older groups. MHRA advises that this evolving evidence should be taken into account when considering the use of the vaccine. There is now some evidence that the reported incidence rate is higher in females compared to men although this is not seen across all age groups and the difference remains small.   
  
The overall incidence after first or unknown doses was 12.3 per million doses",,,1621571645,,{},gywqqb0,True,t3_nhk0cz,False,False,t3_nhk0cz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nhk0cz/risks_of_rare_blood_clot_even_lower_with_second/gywqqb0/,1621663882,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

It seems possible that one more spike might occur in the next month or two instead, related to new strains spreading faster among people who aren't vaccinated.  

Given the number of people already vaccinated maybe this tapering off actually already represents a spike, it just doesn't look like one, since it would be a higher proportion of a smaller subset.  I hate to be a pessimist but I expect one more real uptick in the US instead, which at least could be resolved by consistent additional vaccinations.

This perspective is partly based on living in Thailand where roughly the same protections that eliminated the virus last year, and saw it decline in a January spike, are now barely keeping it at an even level.

I cared at first, but now I think everyone is in agreement when we say....fuck these people, who cares. You don't like science, well then good luck to you. The virus has more side effects than the vaccine. Survival of the fittest and it's obvious over the past year we need to clean up the gene pool. So yes please, lick door knobs and don't get vaccinated. Do the world a favor. 

I think it makes perfect sense. Why wouldn't you want your body to get a head start creating antibodies? Unlike the flu, my body has never been exposed to this disease before. 

I have known 7 people that have had it. 
4 are dead
1 lost a toe

I recently read an article on how Costco, Target, and Walmart have relaxed their mask-mandates with those who are ""fully vaccinated,"" but question here: if and when there's no more mask mandate...how will these companies **know** who is and who **isn't** vaccinated? And for the Target one, the article mentioned how they said the fully vaccinated employees don't have to wear them.  


For the above stores (that may be true in other states, but def. not mine); are they really going to ask over 1 million people for their vaccination card? I doubt that because I **highly doubt** anyone would want to spend their time like that. Another thing: No company should ever **force** their employees to get the vaccine. Apart from the stimulus checks that **most** people receive (which I unfortunately never got any at all), there is the mask factor and if retail companies **force** their employees to get vaccinated--all of these are reasons **why** people aren't going back to work let alone wanting to work in retail. Thankfully, I'm self-employed at the moment, but I ain't going back to retail until the mask-mandate ends. I still wear them in stores b/c they're required, but I can't breathe in them and they make me **super** dehydrated. And today the mask I was using, it ended up making my mouth sore which literally **almost never** happens to me (doesn't matter the mask type or material).

Additionally, COVID and the spread of COVID effects more than just the child in these cases. Sure the 12yr old might have 0 short and long term impacts, but what if they give it to a parent, who gives it to a coworker, who then passes it onto their grandma they live/care for.

Masks are not 100% effective but they do reduce spread significantly. Further, prior to some of the new more transmissible variants, we did not see significant transmission in elementary age kids. Even Osterholm said that in retrospect, we could have safely opened most elementary and junior highs.

We also know that many of the teachers that got sick did not get it in schools but instead, from other high risk environments outside school where they were unmasked. This was highly evident after so many teachers came back sick after winter break--at a rate MUCH higher than they did during the normal school calendar.

You get a text message/email once you're eligible to book, and it's also reported in the news. The current cutoff is age 34.

- 2) Through your GP themselves: more ad-hoc, people get contacted directly by their GP's office and offered an appointment. Often slightly sooner than the national system opens to them.

- 3) Through a local vaccine site that isn't using the national booking system. These follow the same criteria for eligibility, but are handling their own bookings (via phone or their own website). Some are walk-in centres.

It was also targeted broadly at a problem as opposed to a specific picture of what would obviously have been safe... such as a single household by themselves distanced on the beach.  The actual reality is that many beaches during peak use have lots of people taking public transport or car-pooling, people interacting in close proximity not just outside, but bathrooms, concessions, etc...

The state beach closures were also part of the state park closures (again opened early) and all of this gave officials the time to implement safeguards specific to each location.  Again, it may seem simple when you think of the single household isolated on the beach or park field, but the reality is that our state park systems are fairly complex in how they differ and what was needed to put safeguards in place.

&gt; Oregon‚Äôs Enchanted Forest amusement park announced Monday that it would delay its reopening plans after some people responded with threats and angry comments to its decision to continue to require masks.

No need to even involve the medical facility, which again is the only party legally bound to HIPAA.

Hospitals do not hide behind HIPAA; they face severe punishment for not abiding by it.   
I am not surprised that hospital staff refused to talk to you about ANYTHING related to a patient under their care.  
It would have meant their immediate dismissal from their job, and potentially even ruined their chances to ever work in the medical field again.  
I know someone who was fired for a very small slip up where they shared to another unrelated employee some super obscure piece of information tied to a patient under the care of the person who was fired.

I hope it works to encourage those who are reluctant, as you believe it will.

However, I would ask you to reflect on the opening of your reply:

&gt;You're saying that you know 38 people who were infected after their vaccination? Make sure the CDC knows about that group! The number of breakthrough infections after vaccination that are severe enough to cause hospitalization is tiny.

It comes across as condescending and sarcastic, and I am not really sure what you hoped to achieve by saying it. It's not constructive or helpful to the discussion, and it is rather insensitive, given that six of the people I mentioned would still be alive were it not for COVID-19. My friend lost his dad, with whom he shared a birthday. Another who was my age leaves behind a widow and two children. He died shortly before his group was eligible for vaccination. 

I won't respond further, but I hope that you'll consider the human behind the keyboard in the future. It's healthy to discuss and compare different opinions, but I've found I have a better chance of achieving mutual understanding by remaining kind during such conversations.

It says that healthy children are at higher risk from the flu than from covid. However, they also say that there are a lot of other factors that mitigate the flu but don't mitigate covid.

So I think the better way to look at it is:
Magnitude of the Problem = Severity x Risk

So with covid the severity is lower for kids, but the risk is much higher.

Specifically they mention that covid spreads more easily, that people are sick for a longer period, that they're infectious for a longer period, that there's a greater risk of super spreading, that there are vaccines for the flu (while there isn't for children right now), that those vaccines typically cover 3 or 4 types of influenza, and that there are treatments for the flu that don't yet exist for covid.",,,1621567207,,{},gywjlap,False,t3_nhfs2n,False,True,t1_gywd9z9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nhfs2n/commentary_new_yorkers_are_defying_advice_and/gywjlap/,1621659996,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

**Strongly disagree we'll be that low.**  

1.  We'll see states gamify and incentivize getting the vaccine like Ohio did with the $1 million lottery drawings.  This caused a spike in vaccinations there, and other states and perhaps the Federal Government might do the same.
2. We'll see the EUA be upgraded to a full biologic license which will in turn cause more schools, the US military and businesses to mandate the vaccine, and some of the vaccine hesitant who worry about this being experimental changing their tune.
3. With full approval, we'll see more advertising for the vaccine touting its safety and effectiveness
4. We'll likely see a vaccine EUA for children under 12 before the end of the year.

Keeping mask mandate in place: strengthens the social pressure on unvaccinated individuals to continue wearing masks.

Getting rid of the mask mandate: gives them an excuse to not only avoid vaccination but now they also aren't pressured into at least wearing a mask when out and about. Anyone who sees them without a mask is forced to trust that they're vaccinated.

Who, say at a grocery store, is going to make sure unmasked individuals are vaccinated? The already underpaid employees? There's no way to enforce that.

What about places like Texas that are making local mandates illegal? Places like schools, where kids famously trade illnesses, won't be made to mask up.

These places will literally be perpetual breeding grounds. You seriously don't see the problem with that?

Why tf aren't we tying relaxing restrictions to vaccination rates? Not only would it encourage people to get vaccinated but it would only increase the pressure on the unvaccinated.

Unfortunately, this is thinking in terms of a real society. All this will do is increase the spread amongst the unvaccinated just so the vaccinated can avoid a mild inconvenience.

Several have tested positive for the B.1.617 variant first detected in India, which the World Health Organization has said might be more contagious than most versions of the coronavirus.e on Friday.

Co-workers who then became infected later visited an airport food court, where they transmitted the virus to other customers, officials said.

We've had a solution to this from the beginning and that was to give money to schools to make sure they get the equipment they need and make the necessary modifications to classrooms so that classes can be held safely.

Schools funding was largely tied in many states to re-opening. All of our schools depended on ""self-screening"" where parents would report any symptoms to the school, but no mandatory testing was provided. My personal school only recently started providing optional testing once per month. When there was a positive case, the school would receive an email, but staff wouldn't be told which classroom or student tested positive. Only that you would have been notified if it was a ""sustained close contact"".

The short story being that even though covid is airborne, you were not considered a close contact to a positive case unless you stood or sat within exactly 6ft for 15 minutes. If you stepped out of that boundary and stepped in again, your timer reset. Multiple family members knew that students in their small classroom had tested positive, but were not allowed to quarantine because they hadn't remained next to the student for a full 15 minutes (but were in the classroom for 8 hours with them).

This was exacerbated when the government guidelines switched to ""essential workers no longer need to quarantine"". Some school districts used this to attempt to force teachers to come in, even if they tested positive.

My honest opinion is that the governments federal/state/local didn't want to know if schools were spreading covid. Without schools being open, the rest of the community couldn't get back to work. It was deemed that teachers were disposable for the sake of re-opening the businesses, and the schools re-opened.

Mask-wearing is just one of those variables, which is why scientists also recommended social distancing and gathering in well-ventilated areas; they‚Äôre all factors in transmission. Because of that, there are likely a number of reasons for states to have similar deaths per capita numbers (if that is indeed the case):

Try case reporting. Are states all using the same operational definition of deaths due to COVID-19? If so, are they actually reporting them, or are we seeing that they have an uncharacteristically large spike in their deaths due to ‚Äúpneumonia‚Äù?

You could look also at some other relationships. Voters from densely populated areas tend to vote for democrats, and voters in sparsely populated areas tend to vote for republicans. Because mask-wearing and mandates have become politically polarized topics, we have a situation where (in general) democratic state governments are more likely to impose mask mandates than republican state governments.

So we‚Äôre comparing the deaths from COVID-19 between a crowded population that is more likely to wear masks, and a spaced-out population that is less likely to wear masks. The crowded populations are, by the nature of their environment, subject to more interactions that risk COVID-19 transmission than the spaced-out ones. Even if mask-wearing limits their risk, their population density increases it. Comparing these two groups doesn‚Äôt isolate one variable, so it doesn‚Äôt really tell us much about mask effectiveness.

All this to say, please don‚Äôt develop your opinions from one statistic. Data help us identify areas that need to be studied more than they actually ‚Äúprove‚Äù anything.

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

[],,BustingCognitiveBias,,,[],,,,text,t2_3qeig6ih,False,False,[],"There was a promoted ad for an AMA on this subreddit scheduled for noon, however perhaps I misread who was hosting. My question was how has MedDRA coding or lumping techniques been strengthened as they're being utilized to collect data from VAERS following covid-19 vaccination in the US in a manner that considers and mitigates the limitations previous research has found with MedDRA. (How is string code being utilized to improve the validity of safety findings?) The specifics were not discussed in the covid vaccine design publications available, and the CDC website does not discuss how lump or string coding was strengthened as it pulls injury data from VAERS, yet I have read multiple research publications that examined and discussed the limitations of MedDRA and other lump coding measures. The CDC states that millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines under the most intense safety monitoring in U.S. history, so I figured that your team would be in the know so to speak as it's likely been looked at before implementing any UK trials. I even asked another vaccine safety public health educator this question, but the doctor only validated that MedDRA has limitations and she recommended I ask someone with VAERS or the authors in the design publications. That stunned me as I assumed as part of her peer review she already would have rigorously analyzed the strengths and limitations, and learned of the improvements made to the monitoring measures.

I also ask this because I found it worrisome that the pdf available through the CDC website for patients to mail back to VAERS with event information just has open text boxes rather than a form to mitigate the risk of linguistic errors. I looked at the FORM FDA VAERS 2.0 (03/21) on CDC website. In fact the form has no instruction on recognizable terminology for patients or parents to include if they're reporting an event, which I assume means that VAERS has coders to transcribe data from the PDFs to the database, or that VSAFE researchers have a method to improve reliability of transcription, and yet I could not find any information that discussed how inter-rater reliability was strengthened. Inter-rater reliability is the extent to which two or more raters (or observers, coders, examiners) agree. It addresses the issue of consistency of the implementation of a rating system.

 
As it is I compared the CDC policy for providers to report to VAERS on the covid vaccines vs other vaccines, since the CDC has said that historical vigorous monitoring is occuring, but I noticed that providers are ""encouraged"" to report to VAERS any additional clinically significant adverse events following vaccination, even if they are not sure if vaccination caused the event, but are not required to. It worried me because the same policy on required reportable events vs encouraged  events isn't historically any more vigorous than previous policies.

In addition, the required adverse events with covid-19 vaccination that providers must report to VAERs look pretty much the same as those recommended for other vaccines, and don't appear to be historically more intense... Because they're defined as:
Death;
A life-threatening Adverse Event;
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions;
A congenital anomaly/birth defect;
An important medical event that based on appropriate medical judgement may jeopardize the individual and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
Cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome
Cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death

Since thrombotic events were found in mrna animal studies, I assumed symptoms of thrombotic events would error on the side of caution or that this data would be intensely captured and monitored, and I wondered how many thrombotic events that don't immediately result in hospitalization... like a transient ischemic attack could potentially be overlooked if the methodology or measures to monitor for any risk of thrombotic events wasn't strengthened to consider. For instance if the patient writes in the VAERS adverse event form's open text box ""I felt weak and dizzy, and was experiencing mental confusion, my arm was tingling where I received the covid-19 vaccination and I lost my sense of smell, so I worried I was having a stroke but when I called my Doctor's office they said these symptoms are normal with covid vaccines, and I'm just worried my doctor wasn't very thorough, because even though I feel better now, I have never experienced something like that before"". These symptoms could indicate a missed thrombotic event like a transient ischemic attack, or normal Covid vaccination symptoms, or perhaps anxiety if her loss of smell was chalked up as psychosomatic. If a coder with VAERS, or researcher with VSAFE connects with the patient to clarify whether they were hospitalized, learns they weren't, and perhaps goes the extra mile to gathers information from the doctor, who affirms that the patient wasn't admitted with the rational ""she was young with no family history of stroke, and stated she was anxious when she made her vaccination appointment""... then isn't there a risk a thrombotic event can be skewed as anxiety by coders transcribing terminology into the VAERS database, introducing a risk of malleability that weakens the quality of safety data? I also wondered if perhaps VSAFE staff learned this woman was within her first trimester of pregnancy, do they have a policy to error on the side of caution where data is lacking and promote participant safety by recommending that she get appropriately assessed in her doctor's office (get a second opinion), or are they relying heavily on providers to perform this monitoring, because again the CDC has stated that vaccinated individuals are receiving ongoing safety monitoring with VSAFE. While the CDC warns that acceptance of a VAERS report by CDC and FDA does not constitute admission that the vaccine or healthcare personnel caused or contributed to the reported event, they don't provide a lot of specifics to the methodology of what constitutes an admission. So I figured that with so many scientific eyes reviewing the designs available, as well as US's ongoing monitoring methods you might be able to provide information on how MedDRA or lump/string coding limitations were strengthened for the covid-19 vaccines, or perhaps even how VAERS or VSAFE inter-rater reliability was improved as this likely informed how your team strengthened UK design methodology.",,,1621614426,,{},gyyjcrd,False,t3_nhvhjj,False,True,t3_nhvhjj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nhvhjj/i_am_dr_amalina_bakri_clinical_research_fellow_at/gyyjcrd/,1621700677,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

Coca Cola doesn't put out ads for the 0.0001% of people who've never heard of Coke, they put out ads so that Coke will be on people's minds next time they go to the store.

At this point, the goal is the same for the vaccine.

I keep seeing this false narrative that everybody who wants the vaccine already has it, therefore fuck it, and...no. That's not true.

Roll out has been extremely uneven and weirdly tiered in some areas. 

My spouse and I jumped on the vaccine like it was the last brownie at the buffet, but guess what? Because of when the vaccines were made available to which segments of the population and the fact that there were initially long waiting lists in our area, we're still not fully vaccinated and/or through the waiting period to achieve full coverage. 

And that's not even counting kids who became eligible what, a week and a half ago? 

So, no, not everybody who wants/intends/intended to be vaccinated is covered yet, and it's frustrating to see new cases in my area just as high as they were in November and yet have local officials basically hanging out a Mission Accomplished, It's All Fine Now! banner and rolling back mask mandates willy nilly.

Well they should be required in my opinion for school. But they are not approved yet. But that's not a reason to keep school shut down.

&gt;Why is it such a leap that, while it may not be deadly for kids, it can be deadly for multitudes of others and vaccinating kids can greatly reduce that risk?

So COVID19 is really not more deadly for a vaccinated person than many other things in life.

A vaccinated person is far more likely to die from choking on their food this year than COVID19. A vaccinated person under 65 is more likely to die from an injury involving a ladder this year than COVID19. An unvaccinated kid is more likely to die from influenza than COVID19, yet we never go in online learning for the flu.

Waiting until kids are vaccinated is unnecessary at this point as vulnerable people have had the time to be vaccinated. We're at 32 days since national eligibility and given how robust immunity is from even one shot there's just no reason to keep kids out of school.

___________
Gov. Phil Murphy will announce Monday that New Jersey will lift its indoor mask mandate for fully vaccinated people and follow recent federal guidance in time for Memorial Day weekend as COVID-19 numbers keep declining while vaccinations continue, NJ Advance Media has learned.

The new rules, which follow updated advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will go into effect a week from today, May 28, meaning vaccinated people are permitted to enter restaurants and stores in the Garden State without face coverings for the first time in 14 months, multiple sources with knowledge of the plan told NJ Advance Media.

The move is a reversal for Murphy, who for days stood firm that New Jersey would not ease its indoor mask mandate ‚Äî at least not immediately ‚Äî despite the CDC abruptly announcing last week that fully vaccinated Americans can now safely go without wearing masks in most cases.

The CDC still calls for fully vaccinated Americans to wear masks in crowded indoor settings, such as buses, planes, hospitals, prisons, and homeless shelters. Plus, people who are immune-compromised are encouraged to speak with doctors before dropping masks. Officials also noted that some business settings may still require masks, especially since some workers may remain unvaccinated.

A growing number of major retail and restaurant chains, however, have announced they would stop requiring patrons to wear masks following the CDC announcement unless more strict state or local restrictions are in place.

New Jersey was one of the first states to enforce a mask mandate and one of the last to announce it would lift it for vaccinated people.

Unvaccinated people should still wear masks indoors in public, according to the CDC. You are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving a second Pfizer or Moderna vaccine dose or two weeks after receiving the one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.

In addition, the CDC has recommended all schools should continue to use the agency‚Äôs K-12 schools COVID-19 prevention strategies for at least the rest of this school year That includes masks and social distancing. Children under the age of 12 are still not eligible for vaccinations.

Murphy‚Äôs decision comes as tourists and residents prepare to flock to the Jersey Shore and other destinations over Memorial Day weekend, traditionally considered the unofficial start of the summer season.

The Democratic governor had hinted in recent days it was likely only a matter of weeks before his administration would adopt the CDC guidance on masks. In the meantime, he insisted the state was ‚Äúnot out of the woods‚Äù yet when it came to fighting back the pandemic and needed more time to drive numbers down. He also said it would be unfair to businesses to be the arbiter of checking who was vaccinated and who was not.

New Jersey, an early coronavirus hotspot, has required people wear a mask indoor in public places since April 2020 as the outbreak peaked in the state.

But as the number of new cases and hospitalizations have dropped in New Jersey, so have spot positivity rates and other metrics the administration uses for tracking the spread of the virus. The positive trends is what is promoting Murphy to make the announcement, people with knowledge of his plans told NJ Advance Media.

Murphy‚Äôs decision not to relax the mandate in the wake of the CDC‚Äôs abrupt guidance change last week sparked blowback as governors from neighboring states quickly adopted the standards. New Jersey has been one of only a handful of states to not comply, even though Murphy had frequently followed or cited CDC guidance before when making decisions.



Pressed recently on why he stuck with the mandate, Murphy said: ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt want to get burned. I don‚Äôt want to go back. ‚Ä¶ If we can save one more life by leaving more time on the clock, it will have been worth it.‚Äù

Murphy did, however, drop the state‚Äôs outdoor mask mandate in the wake of the CDC news. People had been required to wear masks outside in the state only when social distancing isn‚Äôt possible since July.

Outdoor mask requirements also will still be in place at child care centers and facilities; youth summer camps; public, private, and parochial preschool program premises; elementary and secondary schools; healthcare facilities; long-term care facilities; and state correctional facilities.

More than 3.9 million people who live, work, or study in the state have now been fully vaccinated at New Jersey sites. About a million more people have already received their first dose as of Friday morning.

The state has set a goal of having 70% of New Jersey‚Äôs adults vaccinated by the end of June. A little more than 55% of the state‚Äôs 6.9 million adults have now been fully vaccinated.",,,1621623219,,{},gyz2xxz,True,t3_nhzxbt,False,False,t3_nhzxbt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nhzxbt/nj_to_drop_indoor_mask_rules_follow_cdc_guidance/gyz2xxz/,1621712447,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

Covid is much more severe than many other viruses. Even an immunocompromised person is unlikely to end up in the ICU or dead from the common cold, even if it takes them longer to clear it.

Many immunocompromised people weren't born that way. That means they do have acquired immunity to many things already from earlier life, but they can't fight off a new infection.

There are treatments for other viruses.  Tamiflu, for example.

There is IVIG and there are antibody infusions for other viruses to help prevent infection post-exposure.

Please provide a source for this. All  of the studies I've seen is that you have like a 95% chance of not getting COVID-19 if exposed (for Moderna and Pfizer), and then you have a 97% chance of not getting hospitalized if you do get COVID-19. Some studies even have these vaccines at like 95% effective at preventing hospitalizations in even the most at risk categories:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/health/pfizer-moderna-vaccine-hospitalization.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/health/pfizer-moderna-vaccine-hospitalization.html)

Your risk is basically insignificant to get hospitalized with COVID-19 if you are vaccinated.

&gt;If a study says 90% protection from symptomatic covid. That means if there were 1000 symptomatic cases in a community and half the people were vaccinated then 100 of the symptomatic cases would be vaccinated people.

That is fundamentally not what it means. A 90% efficacy against COVID means you have a 90% chance of not getting COVID-19 if you are exposed to COVID-19. That doesn't mean that 90% of people who get COVID-19 are unvaccinated.

&gt;Also you have to remember that the trials were being done with mostly mask mandates and social distancing.

Do you seriously think those trials didn't correct for controls when it comes to that? Seriously?

&gt;Not sure why this is hard to understand.

Because you're spouting bullshit and your entire justification is ""it's no big deal"".

A lot of the variants are more contagious, yes. So I believe that part. But nothing there really shows that the new COVID-19 mutations are more deadly/more difficult for children to deal with. In the Brazil article you mentioned, this was the explained justification:

&gt;Experts say the sheer number of Covid cases in the country - the second-highest number in the world - have increased the likelihood that Brazil's babies and young children are affected.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Of course, the more cases we have and, as a result, the more hospitalisations, the greater the number of deaths in all age groups, including children. But if the pandemic were controlled, this scenario could evidently be minimised,"" says Renato Kfouri, president of the Scientific Department of Immunisations of the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics.  
&gt;  
&gt;Such a high infection rate has overwhelmed Brazil's entire health care system. Across the country, oxygen supplies are dwindling, there is a shortage of basic medicines and in many ICUs across the country there are simply no more beds.

That's not really ""new forms are more deadly for children"". Not to mention that this source from the last week says that the mortality rate is very low, at least in the US:

We're still giving out 1.8 million daily doses. Demand has trended lower, but not by much.

Better or worse policy decisions and public compliance could easily have either halved or doubled that number. It's not a question of whether ""someone"" died; but whether the 800 people this study suggests died were a worthwhile sacrifice for 5.5 million students to get a few extra weeks 100% in the classroom. 

And we could have made different sacrifices if we wanted schools open safely. We could have locked down HARD for a few weeks and then implemented rigorous contact tracing to get case numbers low and low them there. We could have kept bars and restaurants closed to reduce spread. What is interesting to me is that this study seems to suggest that little of the uptick was due to contagion happening at school. It was due to adult behavior that was a ripple effect of schools being open. You can imagine public health messaging that told people they needed to double down on precautions with schools opening. But leaders in Texas were sending the opposite message.

One approach would be to not open up appointments not too far ahead. Since vaccine shipments aren't 100% set in stone and especially since Pfizer/BioNTech shipments have a tendency to be larger than originally expected, you don't want to program slots too far in advance. And this way people aren't signing up for September slots when 2 weeks later a whole lot more doses are available and all those people have to shift their appointment to an earlier time.

But it's not an ideal system.

I'm getting my vaccine in Switzerland, where every canton (~province) has its own system. That part is dumb, but the specific system used by the canton I'm in (Geneva) works quite well IMO. People have been able to register all year and when you're eligible, you get a text with your appointment details (time, location). If you can't make it, you can reschedule using a website (or call center).

- Work-from-home and stay-at-home orders have greatly increased demand for PC-related things (desktops, laptops, but also gaming consoles).

- Supply chains have been disrupted due to the pandemic.

- In some industries, the demand was underestimated and production was scaled down too much. An important example is the car industry. Manufacturers cancelled orders for various car electronics components expecting greatly reduced sales. But when the demand ended up much better than feared, they struggled to get manufacturing time in semiconductor factories, because time slots were mostly filled by others.

- The drought in Taiwan is threatening TSMC production. TSMC is massive and produces large amounts of chips for Apple, AMD (CPU and GPU) as well as Xbox and Playstation (which both use AMD chips), as well as serving tons of other customers.

- And in the midst of all the major factors, smaller issues like having a ship jammed across the Suez Canal aren't helping either.

Unfortunately, large parts of the semiconductor industry is located in south east Asia, where the vaccination campaigns generally aren't as far along as they are in the US and in Europe.

Rheumatic disorder = autoimmune disorder.  You do have a rheumatic disease and you probably are or should be seeing a rheumatologist.

There is no counter to the general advice that autoimmune patients should receive COVID-19 vaccines.  It would be a radical exception for a doctor to advise otherwise.  It could be warranted but again, it would be a radical exception.

In short, if you were a tribe in eras past (going back to 200,000 BC!), it was advantageous to always have a certain small number of dedicated night-owls in the tribe, to stay awake, and help watch over the tribe in the dark hours. 

Those people likely would have gotten sleepy beginning around 4:00 am, and then eventually only woke up around noon to 1:00 pm, give or take. 

Thus coronavirus has perhaps allowed these defending-night-owls to re-assert what might be their own genetically programmed sleep schedule.

That assumes the choice was kids staying at home and learning remote, with a WFH parent,  versus going into school. But that is not what always happened.

Sometimes, kids went to relatives for the day as their parents worked. Often times it was with a retired older relative, exposing them to risk as parents come home, possibly spread it to their kids who spread it to grandma. How is this worse than kids going to school and possibly spreading it to teachers? Kids hug their grandmas. Schools could, and should have, set up social distancing protocols with masks.

Sometimes kids went to a childcare facility, which is usually staffed by women who have lower income, and didn't have the ability to advocate for better work spaces. And the kids co-mingle a lot more in those settings. It is easier to keep kids in a ""pod"" in a school.

That doesn't count the kids who went hungry or were abused when they actually were able to stay home. Or those who were neglected, and had to take care of themselves as their parents left them alone to go to work. Or became depressed and killed themselves.

So yeah, people did die. And perhaps more would have died if schools had been more open than with the remote learning options- you really cannot tell with the data we have.

1955: some batches of polio vaccine were contaminated with live polio, causing 250 cases.    The vaccine was solid when manufactured correctly, but this incident has effectively discouraged the development of inactivated virus vaccines ever since, and none of the US-licensed COVID vaccines are of this type.

1976: the swine flu vaccine had a risk of Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome of 1 per 100,000 doses.  If swine flu was raging through the US it would have been considered an acceptable side effect much like the blood clotting issues from Astrazeneca.  But for whatever reason it never really got here, making the whole exercise unnecessary, so we stopped administering it.

1998: a gastroenteritis vaccine caused bowel obstruction in infants.  The effect was extremely rare and something that just happens to infants sometimes making it hard to detect, but the effect was still quickly found and the vaccine was off the market after 9 months.

Not at all. Vaccines develop an immune response. They have been tested very widely. Covid triggers a similar immune response in addition to the effects of the virus itself on blood, lungs, etc. Now you tell me which one carries more risk.

&gt; This ""what about long term issues that have never been identified?"" is literally anti-vaxxer logic.

That's total hogwash and you know it. We have no idea what long term implications people face from covid. The ""long Covid"" studies already indicate that there are problems with some people including children.

There are plenty of viruses that cause long term effects. For example:

* RSV in the first 3 years can lead to a higher risk of asthma and decreased lung function
* HIV often results in AIDS 5-10 years after the initial infection
* Chicken Pox can cause Shingles
* Adenoviruses have been known to cause long term cardiac issues

None of this is new. This isn't ""anti-vaxxer logic"". This is documented science.

All I am saying is that we should be cautious. Make sure that there is sufficient ventilation in schools etc. If there are cases in the area then it would probably also make sense to include masks.

 ""We are working with the Ministry (of Health) to obtain additional doses in order to launch this early vaccination without conditions"" as soon as possible, he said, the idea then being to extend it ""to the city and  to the metropolis ‚Äù.

 ""This is a variant already identified at the national level but very rare so far,"" he said.  This is a Variant of concern (VoC), or worrying, as were for example the English and Indian variants.

None of these positive cases have been vaccinated and ""none have been hospitalized, they have the usual symptoms or no symptoms,"" according to the ARS medical director.

 ""We have no reason to believe that these cases will be more severe and that this variant is resistant to messenger RNA vaccines"" like Pfizer or Moderna, he commented.

BUT, not enough people are getting vaccinated. With the original virus strain from early 2020 we calculated that 60-70% of people immune should protect everybody. But with the british variant this number went to like over 80%, and now we have the indian variant that may need even more people immune to prevent exponential spread. So if we take into account that vaccines are not as effective against the indian variant and 10% of vaccinated people still gets sick, plus we cant vaccinate young children that are like 10-15% of total population, the math says that basically almost everybody who is eligible has to be vaccinated before the fall, and it might still not be enough. But right now we see like only 50-60% of people getting the vaccine... this is far from enough, we will definitely return to high number of daily cases without any restrictions, is it means there will have to be some soft lockdown, like mandatory mask wearing, closed public events like sports matches ( at least for unvaccinated)... guys I dont know, this seems far from over, yes it wont be ad bad as 2020 fall, but this virus is now so contagious and so many people refuse to get vaccinated that we just cant get back to life before 2020, there will be restrictions to prevent mass spread from few to too many, we are not out of this yet by far, the winter is coming....",,,1621629547,,{},gyzga8x,False,t3_nhqai1,False,False,t3_nhqai1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nhqai1/unvaccinated_americans_are_less_worried_about/gyzga8x/,1621720296,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

Finally to directly answer your question regarding vaccinations, while certain vaccines are required for schools, there's not a state in the country that requires influenza vaccine for kids to attend, which as aforementioned is actually deadlier *for children* compared to COVID19.",,,1621609415,,{},gyy84le,False,t3_nhj8cw,False,True,t1_gyy7ch2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nhj8cw/rapid_school_reopenings_may_have_led_to_thousands/gyy84le/,1621693800,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

[The most recent publication](https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1088) (accepted April 27th, published May 13th) shows that, where appropriate, they are accounting for the underlying risk of the recipients by measuring vaccine effectiveness relative to the baseline infection rate for that population before the vaccine kicked in. 

&gt; Participants aged 80 years and older vaccinated with BNT162b2 before 4 January 2021 had a higher odds of testing positive for covid-19 in the first nine days after vaccination (odds ratio up to 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.77), indicating that those initially targeted had a higher underlying risk of infection. Vaccine effectiveness was therefore compared with the baseline post-vaccination period. 

The way they compared the two vaccines was by restricting to those vaccinated in the same time period (only after AZ administration started) and in the same age group (70+). They found similar effects for both vaccines during this period.

&gt; Participants aged 70 years and older vaccinated from 4 January (when ChAdOx1-S delivery commenced) had a similar underlying risk of covid-19 to unvaccinated individuals. With BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness reached 61% (51% to 69%) from 28 to 34 days after vaccination, then plateaued. With ChAdOx1-S, effects were seen from 14 to 20 days after vaccination, reaching an effectiveness of 60% (41% to 73%) from 28 to 34 days, increasing to 73% (27% to 90%) from day 35 onwards. 

Confidence intervals are not particularly narrow yet, but they look pretty similar at the moment. [South Korea has also found](https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2021/05/05/astrazeneca-and-pfizer-covid-19-vaccines-more-than-86-effective-after-first-dose-south-korean-authorities-say/?sh=437eb87d14f3) similar real-world effects against symptomatic infection for both vaccines after one dose (89% Pfizer vs 86% AZ).

What is clear is that the testing regime matters for what kind of efficacy against symptomatic infection you are likely to observe - one of the reasons why many caution against directly comparing efficacy numbers between trials.

Interestingly though, last weekend my boyfriend and I went to church with his parents (we are not religious, but it keeps his parents happy when we attend every so often. His dad also preaches) and out of maybe 20-30 people in attendance, only 2 wore masks, and one lady removed hers halfway through. 

One or two people were coughing quite a bit. It definitely made me feel a bit uncomfortable. I know older folks especially can have coughs for various reasons, and I'm not sure of anyone's vaccination status, but it just seemed like an inconsiderate thing to be in a tight indoor space (small town church) with no mask and coughing through the service. No one seemed concerned at all though. I really wasn't sure how to feel. 

There were always a few rebellious people in any businesses that wouldn't wear a mask (and it was a toss up between whether or not the employees would enforce it and say something) but I'm really surprised more Ohioans haven't ditched the masks. I'm excited to lose them, but they really aren't that much of a bother to me, and arguing with people who feel so strongly about masks on either side is exhausting. At this point it's habitual for me to just throw my mask on when walking inside, but the first time I enter a place where there are a noticeable number of people not wearing them, I'm going to gladly take mine right off :) I think that will be June 2nd.",,,1621608564,,{},gyy67ro,False,t3_nhmaa9,False,False,t1_gyxsg10,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nhmaa9/daily_discussion_thread_may_21_2021/gyy67ro/,1621692611,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

Population level studies show no evidence of any increase in cancer incidence as a result of exposure,[15] though SV40 has been extensively studied.[16]**A thirty-five year followup found no excess of the cancers putatively associated with SV40.[17]**

Rotarix and Rototeq porcine cicovirus contamination:

Still waiting on citations. By the way, the great thing about mRNA vaccines is they don't rely on complex and messy virus production. The mRNA is sequenced in a bioreactor, isolated, and coated in lipids.

&gt;Japan‚Äôs daily cases and deaths are small by global standards, and the country has one of the world‚Äôs largest per-capita numbers of hospital beds.

&gt;So why the struggles?

&gt;It is partly because unprofitable COVID-19 treatment is largely limited to public-run hospitals, which account for only about one-fifth of Japan‚Äôs 8,000 hospitals. Private hospitals, many of them small, are hesitant or unprepared to deal with coronavirus cases.

&gt;The government has also significantly reduced local health centers, which are key to infectious disease prevention, from about 850 in the 1990s to 469 in 2020, causing bottlenecks because of staff shortages and overwork.

&gt;Less than 5% of about 1.5 million hospital beds in Japan are set aside for COVID-19 treatment, an increase from less than 1,000 in April of last year, according to Health Ministry data, but still not enough.

The good thing is that we already have a lot of natural immunity and vaccine immunity however there are still a large portion of people not vaccinated. 
People who are anti mask still wore their mask inside stores that mandated them. Not sure why this is hard to understand. There are areas without mask mandates but certain businesses still elected to enforce mask mandates and people complied. 
We may not be at a point where hospitals will overwhelm anymore however why not save more lives with a simple mask mandate indoors. You could still live your life just add another piece of clothing. There are still plenty of recorded daily deaths. We have become numb to the numbers but it is still happening at a preventable rate. 
Lastly, it is selfish to tell people who are concerned to hide because a simple thing like wearing a mask can‚Äôt be mandated. There are at risk people that work and relied on a mask mandate to stay safe at work. Now they have to go to work scared. It is unfair to these people.

So you build these bomb ass facilities on ""Olympic Island"" and they'll basically go unused for all but 14 days every 4 years.

They might show up at Olympic Island every once in awhile, for say, the FINA World Championships or the FINA World Cup, but they won't be hosting every event there.

Olympic Island will be just as expensive as how they are currently because you'd have to keep these places maintained and pristine.  Maybe not gold plated everything, but it can't be 30 year old everything that hasn't been updated since the initial build.

If you want to do it right, you start going to places that have sound plans on how to use the infrastructure.  You look at LA's plan and it's unlikely to run up the costs that Rio or Tokyo did.  They aren't going to have the decaying buildings that Greece has.

And turn down the luxury a bit.  We don't need Gucci, we just need not Wal-Mart.

It can be done, you just need to clean up the process so they aren't picking whoever throws the most

&gt;Public Health England said on Thursday there had been 1,313 cases in England of B.1.617.2 in a week, more than double the previous week‚Äôs figure, with four confirmed deaths.  
Whitty said so far there had not been a significant increase in hospitalisations from the variant, which may be because more people had been vaccinated.  
But both Johnson and Whitty said ***it was still early days, and scientists would need to scrutinise data over the next two or three weeks to truly see the effects of the variant.***

&gt;Vaccine efficacy/effectiveness (VE) is measured by calculating the risk of disease among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons and determining the percentage reduction in risk of disease among vaccinated persons relative to unvaccinated persons. The greater the percentage reduction of illness in the vaccinated group, the greater the vaccine efficacy/effectiveness. The basic formula is written as:

No, you're just wrong. Vaccine effectiveness/efficacy (which is used interchangeably in this CDC article) is calculated as a risk reduction for vaccinated people vs unvaccinated people. It is exactly what I said it was:

&gt;Vaccine efficacy/effectiveness is interpreted as the proportionate reduction in disease among the vaccinated group. So a VE of 90% indicates a 90% reduction in disease occurrence among the vaccinated group, or a 90% reduction from the number of cases you would expect if they have not been vaccinated.

That doesn't mean ""10% of cases were vaccinated people"".

Let us think this through for a second. The pfizer/moderna trials had about 95% efficacy to prevent symptomatic infection. This was from their trial which occurred at a time when there was SD and mask wearing and relatively low covid rates because there trial occurred before the winter surge. I can‚Äôt remember what their efficacy was for seniors I believe the had it slightly below 90. The CDC study you showed from the NYtimes said 94% reduction of among hospitalizations. So this means that symptomatic infection was much higher because for the age group they studied I believe less than 20% are hospitalized (though I don‚Äôt have data on that). Therefore in real world among seniors the vaccine efficacy was much lower than 95% at preventing symptomatic infection. Also keep in mind these vaccines are new. Once we have long term data there will be much more opportunity for breakthrough cases especially if people live normally without precautions. It is important for everyone (who at least has not been infected) to be vaccinated which will lower the chance for the virus to spread because it would be rare to get an outbreak in a vaccinated community but it is more likely if that community has only half vaccinated. This is why it is important to keep mask mandates. 
Let me add one last example to help you understand vaccine effectiveness. If one contagious covid pt were to cause an outbreak at a setting with 100 people where 50% were vaccinated and there were ten total infections and one of these was vaccinated this would mean there is 90% efficacy. However if ten contagious covid people went to the same setting and they infect 75/100 people and 25/75 were vaccinated, then the efficacy drops to 50%.

That doesn't stick around long either, since your immune system attacks it, and without the rest of the pathogen, it can't do diddly squat.

Do we know the long term effects with 100% certainty? No. But we do know that its very unlikely there will be any, based on our understanding of the way the vaccine works.

From the start it was explained by the experts that the wearing of a mask for the COVID-19,  was more about stopping some amount of virus from being exhaled from the mouth and nose (i.e. protecting those around you) and not as much about protecting the wearer.  Early on it was explained that I wear one for you and you wear one for me.

That is unless one wears a real NIOSH N95 which as the name describes stops 95% of particulate from being inhaled by the wearer. 

Now, most folks are not wearing N95s and instead are wearing paper or cloth masks and those it is my understanding are more about protecting those around you and not yourself. 

So I ask, because maybe I am missing something, why if you are vaccinated are you (or anyone) going to continue to do something that doesn't protect yourself (assuming you aren't wearing an NIOSH N95), but does protect others who are potentially endangering you (even if the potential is low being vaccinated)?

The question of whether alcohol can be consumed before and after vaccination is one of the most frequently asked questions by patients worldwide. Recently, they have been asking them to celebrate the first dose of the Covid vaccine, and in countries where marijuana use is legal, patients also ask about smoking before and after vaccination. - The answer is not easy. As a rule, scientific reports say that alcohol ingested in small amounts has no effect on the effect of vaccines. Most experts believe that one drink, a glass of wine or two, is safe. The situation is different in the case of addicted patients, who consume large amounts of alcohol, and whose immune system is damaged - says Micha≈Ç Byliniak, vice president of the NRA,  
Alcohol is essentially a poison, and besides the action that causes it to be consumed, it has a lot of side effects. One of its main side effects is the effect on blood clotting. At one point there was discussion about the effects of vectored vaccines and in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), possible cases of thrombosis appeared in the 'side effects' field. Since alcohol affects your blood clotting by reducing or increasing it, it is better to avoid consuming it before or after vaccination. The clotting mechanism is very complicated. It should be emphasized that alcohol is a factor contributing to the possibility of thrombosis. If you take alcohol before or after having the vaccine, you may cause a thrombosis. which will not necessarily be associated with the receipt of the vaccine - warns Micha≈Ç Byliniak.

Data from surface survival studies indicate that a 99% reduction in infectious SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses can be expected under typical indoor environmental conditions within 3 days (72 hours) on common non-porous surfaces like stainless steel, plastic, and glass 10, 11, 12, 13, 15. However, experimental conditions on both porous and non-porous surfaces do not necessarily reflect real-world conditions, such as initial virus amount (e.g., viral load in respiratory droplets) and factors that can remove or degrade the virus, such as ventilation and changing environmental conditions 8, 9. They also do not account for inefficiencies in transfer of the virus between surfaces to hands and from hands to mouth, nose, and eyes 8, 9. In fact, laboratory studies try to optimize the recovery of viruses from surfaces (e.g., purposefully swabbing the surface multiple times or soaking the contaminated surface in viral transport medium before swabbing). When accounting for both surface survival data and real-world transmission factors, the risk of fomite transmission after a person with COVID-19 has been in an indoor space is minor after 3 days (72 hours), regardless of when it was last cleaned",,,1621611343,,{},gyycgsg,False,t3_nhmaa9,False,False,t1_gyyb7q2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nhmaa9/daily_discussion_thread_may_21_2021/gyycgsg/,1621696470,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

Vaccination willingness has not been this high before, but does vary by corona vaccine, the behavioral survey by the RIVM and the GGDs showed Friday. 90 percent of those surveyed said they would be vaccinated. According to the survey, the willingness to take the Pfizer vaccine is the highest and AstraZeneca's vaccine is the least sought after.  
Most of the nearly 55,500 survey participants say they will take a Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine if invited to do so. 81 percent of them let it be known that they would be willing to take the Pfizer vaccine, compared to 74 percent with that of Moderna.  
AstraZeneca's corona vaccine would be the least sought after: 53 percent of participants said they would get a shot if they received an invitation in the mail. For Janssen pharmaceutical's corona vaccine, the percentage is 66 percent.  
However, this does not mean that the rest of the people would not get vaccinated with the vaccine in question. Some participants said they were still in doubt. The percentage saying they would not be vaccinated with a specific vaccine was highest at AstraZeneca (28 percent) and lowest at Pfizer (11 percent).  
Pfizer and Moderna vaccine are most effective according to participants  
Those surveyed believe that Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines are the most effective and have the fewest side effects. ""In reality, the protection against serious illness after COVID-19 infection is about the same from all vaccines (above 85 percent effectiveness),"" the RIVM said.  
Respondents were least concerned about possible side effects from Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. 23 percent and 25 percent, respectively, are afraid of them. More participants say they fear possible side effects from AstraZeneca (45 percent) and Janssen (34 percent).  
AstraZeneca's and Janssen's vaccines have been linked to the very rare side effect in which vaccinated people developed platelet deficiency combined with a severe form of thrombosis. Because of this rare side effect, AstraZeneca's vaccine is only used in people over sixty in the Netherlands.  
What is the risk of severe thrombosis after vaccination with AstraZencea?  
By May 9, about one and a half million AstraZeneca shots had been administered in the Netherlands.  
In total, the Lareb side effects center received fifteen reports of the serious side effect: that's 1 in 100,000.  
To compare: if everyone (from young to old) in the city of Venlo were to be vaccinated, an average of one person would be affected by this side effect.  
Twelve women and three men were reported, nine of whom were under sixty years old and six of whom were over sixty.  
Since only people over sixty are given the vaccine, the side effects center has received three reports (out of a million vaccines given).  
Do you have questions about this very rare side effect? If so, ask them below in the comments.  
Janssen reduces risk of rare side effects  
That risk is even smaller with Janssen, medicine authority EMA ruled earlier. In the United States, more than 9.6 million doses of the Janssen vaccine have been administered and the side effect has been detected in 30 vaccinated persons. That small number, according to the EMA, is no reason to halt the administration of the Janssen vaccine or to restrict it to certain age groups.  
The Janssen vaccine has not yet been administered very often in the Netherlands (about 70,000 times) and Lareb was not aware of any reports of the serious side effect last week.  
Compliance with measures after vaccination down  
Compared to the previous round of measurements at the end of March, willingness to be vaccinated has risen by 4 percentage points, the RIVM noted. Never before during the study have so many people indicated that they would like to be vaccinated. The difference in willingness to be vaccinated is especially noticeable when compared to the November survey: at that time only 33 percent wanted to be vaccinated, the lowest willingness so far.  
It does appear, however, that vaccinated people are increasingly unwilling to comply with corona measures. ""This is particularly true of the socially restrictive measures, such as keeping your distance or limiting the number of people you get together with,"" the RIVM said.  
Although the agencies emphasize that vaccinated persons must also abide by the rules, 34 percent do not expect to keep a distance from others after vaccination and 40 percent no longer expect to abide by the maximum number of visitors.",,,1621602847,moderator,{},gyxuese,True,t3_nhs638,False,False,t3_nhs638,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nhs638/90_of_dutch_people_want_to_get_vaccinated/gyxuese/,1621685658,1,True,True,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

According to the cumulative incidence curve, most (far more than 50%) protection against symptom onset starts around day 11, implying protection against infection starting at about a week.  There is no protection before that (and most countries have seen increases in the rate of infection within that period as people relax too soon).

Covid statistically is a much less deadly disease for people 20-30 than the flu. You can cite long term effects all you want but there's been more than a few studies showing that mild cases are not really at risk for long term effects, and also the same things happen with serious cases of the flu, which again, is more deadly to 20-30 year olds than Covid.

So when all the evidence is there for 20-30 year olds that Covid is less dangerous to them than the flu, why would they get two Covid shots that are likely to put them on their ass for a day, when they don't even normally get flu shots?

(And this isn't even getting into government issues like the head of the CDC saying she wouldn't send her vaccinated kid to camp because of the danger and the very next day saying masks are unnecessary for vaccinated people)

First: Science doesn't actually say anything about what to do. What it can do is inform of relative risks. Those risks are not infinite, I am still shocked at the number of twenty somethings that say ""I don't want to get covid and die"" and then say we should ""follow the science"". It is just not that lethal in younger people. Note that's not the same as ""never lethal"" which leads me nicely to the next point.

Second: There are tradeoffs with everything. If we didn't have to make hard decisions we could just decide to get rid of the disease in the first place and that would be grand. But we accept risks every day we get in a car and don't bat an eye about it. Now I'm not saying that should be an acceptable level since driving is probably the riskiest thing most people do, but understanding that zero covid may be desirable, but not at infinite cost. It's a very harsh assessment but at some point sacrificing the future of the youngest generation isn't worth saving the oldest. Obviously there's a balance here and that's a sort of ad absurdum argument, but I don't think communication has been very good of just how steep the age curve for the disease is.

Third: Nobody seems to be willing to give uncertain answers. So we've been dealing with this for awhile and have some more knowledge now but the idea of what ""knowing something"" means has become an issue in and of itself. There's been a tendency in all of this that X isn't out with a proven study therefore it must be the opposite of X when that's just not how things work. A good example was transmission among vaccinated people. It was obviously going to take some time to prove that vaccinated people don't transmit the disease, but seems like we should be careful, but also assume it's like every other disease until proven otherwise rather than think it must be the one disease where you can transmit asymptomatically while vaccinated.

If you have any food that you bought last year for Covid lockdown/emergencies/etc., now is the time to eat it or donate it to a food pantry. If it's expired, eat it or toss it instead of donating it please.  If you want to be prepared for future emergencies, go ahead and buy more to replace it, I guess.

If you're an American and you've been waiting for your turn to get vaccinated, it's your turn.

If you are vaccinated, it's your turn to help other people get vaccinated. 

If you have a strategy to get older Americans vaccinated, please spread the word. 

I think we need to get to the point where we can get hospitals back to normal operation and get family doctors/GP's doses to give out like they do with the flu vaccine. And like tons of extra doses. Novavax should help here.

The vaccines are FREE in the US.  FREE FREE, not like ""Copay free"", like fuckin FREE.  Go get one. Now.  Is there something stopping you from going to get one today? Talk to me about it, we'll get it worked out.

Mixing Vaccines: [ICYMI](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mrg3x4/mixing_vaccines_could_mean_booster_jab_is_not/)

[Dose intervals might increase efficacy if extended past 3 or 4 weeks,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/mudvjd/questin_about_vaccine_intervals/gv58byt/) CDC says you have up to 42 days between doses (but that may be extended at some point).

Okay, more good news:

The J&amp;J ""Pause"" shows that [the CDC is doing a good job](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mpx0sk/daily_discussion_thread_april_13_2021/gufofqg/?sort=confidence) at being a watchdog over the vaccines.

**More variant stuff:**

There [might not be much room left for SARS-CoV-2 to mutate](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/mpcc5k/weekly_question_thread_april_12_2021/gui5xn3/) into.

CDC [doesn't think](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n94zxm/no_evidence_that_pfizer_vaccine_needs_updating/) we'll need boosters/updates/etc for the mRNA vaccines.

Pfizer/Moderna work on the [Double/Triple/Indian Variant](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/n9q3q8/infection_and_vaccineinduced_neutralizing/).

Pfizer (and Moderna, probably) [works on B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 Variants](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/n5r2ry/effectiveness_of_the_bnt162b2_covid19_vaccine/)

REMINDER: Every time we do a neutralization assay on a variant vs Pfizer/Moderna, we get the same result. [The vaccine wins.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mwpijo/daily_discussion_thread_april_23_2021/gvkm64h/)

T-Cells are really important.  Probably [more important than antibodies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/n5015i/highly_functional_cellular_immunity_in_sarscov2/)



**The vaccine is better than the disease:**

[Penis issues from Covid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nbh3ez/covid19_endothelial_dysfunction_can_cause/) (but [not the vaccine\).](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/narbhn/researchers_report_covid19_found_in_penile_tissue/)

[Neurological problems](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/na1eri/82_of_people_hospitalized_with_covid19_develop/) from Covid Infection (but not the vaccine).

[Loss of smell](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n88qwv/daily_discussion_thread_may_09_2021/gxiiusd/) is both [common](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6sj6g/daily_discussion_thread_may_07_2021/gxb6wah/) and way [more devastating](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n1efrf/joe_rogan_walks_back_antivaccination_comments/gwcvd0m/) than you'd think.  This does not occur with the vaccines.

[Fewer symptoms = less spread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6sj6g/daily_discussion_thread_may_07_2021/gxbfbt1/)  Vaccines make you have fewer symptoms (*if* you get an infection after vaccination).

From the [NYT:](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/health/cdc-masks-vaccines-variants.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article) 
&gt;Introducing the new recommendations on Thursday, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, cited two recent scientific findings as significant factors: Few vaccinated people become infected with the virus, and transmission seems rarer still; and the vaccines appear to be effective against all known variants of the coronavirus. 

Remember, if you got infected, recovered, and then got at least one dose of Pfizer, you have immunity not only to multiple variants, but also SARS-CoV-1, the virus for which we named SARS in 2003.  Turns out much of [the ""breadth"" of that immunity is from the vaccine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/net65c/sarscov2_mrna_vaccines_induce_a_greater_array_of/)

Today's thinking:

US : 

Children don't seem spread the virus as effectively as adults. 

We have okay vaccination numbers and lots of natural immunity.

Adults spread the virus much more effectively than children. But that's good news. About half of the people above 11 are vaccinated, and many have natural immunity. 

So yes, children are vulnerable to infection, but they don't tend to be superspreaders. Most people who were going to get infected and cause spread have already done so, or have been vaccinated. Now, there are still tons of people who could be infected left. So, I need help with some math :

What is the additional value of vaccinating one additional older person vs a younger person? If you vaccinate a young person, you are only protecting that person. If you vaccinate an old person, you are probably preventing spread.",,,1621617592,,{},gyyqhtn,False,t3_nhmaa9,False,False,t3_nhmaa9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nhmaa9/daily_discussion_thread_may_21_2021/gyyqhtn/,1621705022,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

How relaxed can I be at work about wearing a mask and taking the mask off for getting something to drink or taking a break?

There's a few exemptions to the travel ban, and some visa types have been given blanket National Interest Exemptions through lawsuits, but generally most non-immigrants are subject to the travel bans. 

The only way to get around the travel ban is to personally apply for a National Interest Exemption at your local embassy, or to travel to a country not subject to the travel ban, stay there 14 days, and then enter the US from there. Unfortunately most people on non-immigrant visas won't have the ability to take that much time off, so it's pretty prohibitive to leaving the country.",,,1621626452,,{},gyz9ufx,True,t3_ni0ldv,False,False,t1_gyz8vi5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ni0ldv/american_tourists_are_making_europe_summer_travel/gyz9ufx/,1621716511,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

Its about the fact that the more people get ill, the more chance there is the virus will mutate and the more it mutates, the more chance that a mutation that is not stopped by the vaccines, or is more deadly or more infectious is produced.

You KNOW it mutates, all viruses do. You must have seen the concerns re the Indian variant for example.

What we definitely don't want is a new NY variant that kills one in 10 and is unaffected by the vaccines.
