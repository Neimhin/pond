Pennsylvania Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine will today announce “targeted efforts” at containing the coronavirus.

A news release about the 1 p.m. announcement does not specify what the efforts will be. 
On Monday, however, Levine said the state had no plans for shutdowns or other dramatic measures instituted during the first wave of the pandemic in the spring.

Other states have been reverting to earlier restrictions or tweaking existing ones at the fall surge in cases breaks daily infection records. Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey, for example, ordered that limits on private indoor gatherings be reduced from 25 to 10 people, and limits on outdoor gatherings be reduced from 500 to 150 people.
And Philadelphia officials on Monday announced a ban on indoor dining at restaurants and indoor gatherings of any size, public or private, as the city battles a resurgence of the coronavirus, the Associated Press reported.
 
The city also plans to shutter gyms, museums and libraries, prohibit in-person instruction at colleges and high schools, and reduce occupancy at stores and religious institutions, city Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley said at a news conference Monday.

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf held an online meeting over the weekend with Murphy and other regional governors to discuss mitigation efforts.

In recent briefings, Levine has been encouraging residents to avoid gatherings over the holidays and limit celebrations to household members. But she has also said the state would continue to urge compliance with existing restrictions and adherence to masking and other prevention measures, rather than impose new rules.

I have *never* seen nor hope to see again a study of the effectiveness of a drug that dropped subjects from the 'analysis' because they died. Never ! This 'study' is unique in my experience. If you are investigating a drug used to 'treat' a disease that often results in death you can prove (sic) that not just every drug but everything else under the Sun is effective if you strike out the dead. Here's a link to [a preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037135v1.full-text) of the research. Here's a quotation from the 'Results' (sic) section:

&gt;A total of 26 patients received hydroxychloroquine and 16 were control patients. Six hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were lost in follow-up during the survey because of early cessation of treatment. Reasons are as follows: three patients were transferred to intensive care unit, including one transferred on day2 post-inclusion who was PCR-positive on day1, one transferred on day3 post-inclusion who was PCR-positive on days1-2 and one transferred on day4 post-inclusion who was PCR-positive on day1 and day3; one patient died on day3 post inclusion and was PCR-negative on day2; one patient decided to leave the hospital on day3 post-inclusion and was PCR-negative on days1-2; finally, one patient stopped the treatment on day3 post-inclusion because of nausea and was PCR-positive on days1-2-3. The results presented here are therefore those of 36 patients (20 hydroxychloroquine-treated patients and 16 control patients).

Let's see here. Start with 26 subjects. Stroke out three who got sicker , went to ICU, and whose eventual fate was unknown. Stroke out another who died even before being transferred to ICU. Stroke out another who seems to have been misdiagnosed (PCR - negative) and - WISELY - left the hospital where he was very likely to catch the disease. Finally stroke out one person in which the drug produced uncontrollable nausea, once more fate unknown. That leaves 20 patients. Even the 26 originally enrolled would be totally insufficient to gauge the effectiveness of the treatment. 

Remarkable. Truly remarkable. It takes a politician grasping at propaganda straws to put any credit in such 'results'. My only regret about the proposed investigation is that it seems to be focused solely on the researcher in question, and does not include the many others who paved the way for him.

[],,BioLogicSpecimen,,,[],,,,text,t2_5fffk0sj,False,False,[],"There are a few possibilities that would explain why your brother tested negative. 

Let's break it down:

First of all. Our immune system is something absolutely incredible. We are constantly attacked by pathogens that want to make a home of our bodies. The reason why we are not sick all the time, is because of our innate immune system which rapidly attacks and neutralizes threats in a non-specific way. (in contrast to our adaptive immune system, which is slow but very specific by means of antibodies and T-cells.) I used to work on tsetse flies and a person would only become sick if a bite infects a person with about 60.000 trypanosomes (the pathogen that causes sleeping sickness and which is well equipped to evade the immune system). Otherwise your body can cope with this threat, which is an amazing feat. Enveloped viruses, such as SARS-CoV2 are pretty unstable in a human body and I expect the amount of viruses you need to get sick is pretty high for a healthy person. That's why we don't get sick while just walking passed an infected person, unless he sneezes or coughs on or near you. That being said:

Assuming your brother took every precaution with his co-worker and your uncle (wearing masks, avoid taking too much, air circulation), there is a good chance of not being exposed to a high enough viral load to make him sick.

Assuming your brother and his wife don't socially distance (as in a normal marital relationship) and his wife tested positive, your brother with 99% certainty is infected with the virus. It takes about one to two weeks for a sufficient viral load to appear to be measured by PCR with the current swab technique. If your brother tested negative even after that two week period, I expect he already had the virus before and is therefore immune. An antibody test could shed light on this, but is not 100% reliable.

Other, but less likely possibilities are that 1) he already had antibodies in his body from another pathogen which cross-react with SARS-CoV2. This can happen even though chances are low. Or 2) it could be a human error: the swabs taken for his test were not taken properly; RNA was not extracted efficiently from his sample. While the staff performing these test are properly trained and rarely make mistakes, human errors do happen. Sometimes the staff isn't even aware of this themselves and your sample will just turn up negative.",,,1605609712,{},gclkh9g,False,t3_jv72l6,False,True,t1_gclf1t8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jv72l6/daily_discussion_post_november_16_questions/gclkh9g/,1605668147,-5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

## Abstract

The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 humoral response in infected individuals remains poorly characterized. Here, we performed a longitudinal study of sera from 308 RT-qPCR+ individuals with mild disease, collected at two time-points, up to 6 months post-onset of symptoms (POS). We performed two anti-S and one anti-N serology assays and quantified neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). At month 1 (M1), males, individuals &gt; 50 years of age or with a body mass index (BMI) &gt; 25 exhibited higher levels of antibodies. Antibody levels decreased over time. At M3-6, anti-S antibodies persisted in 99% of individuals while anti-N IgG were measurable in only 59% of individuals. The decline in anti-S and NAbs was faster in males than in females, independently of age and BMI. Our results show that some serology tests are less reliable overtime and suggest that the duration of protection after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination will be different in women and men.",,,1605618374,{},gcltwyv,True,t3_jvsnax,False,True,t3_jvsnax,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvsnax/sex_differences_in_the_decline_of_neutralizing/gcltwyv/,1605673574,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The difference here is that the information is being used for public good and access to that information is restricted to contact tracing purposes.

A system like this could easily be implemented that does not personally identify people, while still allowing for proper contact tracing.

Imagine a system where everyday your phone generates a unique ID. Every couple of minutes your phone broadcast that ID over Bluetooth. Your phone will keep track of those IDs and all of the IDs that it observes for a one month period. If you test positive you push a button on your phone app. your phone will then take all of your recently used IDs and insert them into a database online.

everyday your phone downloads all of the recent IDs from that database and cross-checks them against the IDS that it has seen. If it sees any IDs in the database that it has seen in Bluetooth, you know you have potentially been within 50 ft of somebody who has tested positive. You can also know how long ago that exposure was, how long you were within their vicinity, and potentially how close you were to them based on signal strength. This wouldn't catch passing somebody on a sidewalk most likely but it would catch if you happen to be standing in line at a checkout at a grocery store, or on a train.

the app could even tell you your GPS coordinates where you discovered that Bluetooth ID so that you could make your own judgment call. for example if it showed you driving down the road when you saw that ID there's a pretty good chance you were in your own car and not exposed. if it showed the location was your work office then you know you probably were exposed. You could then go get your own covid test done, and if you tested positive you would push your button which would upload your IDs to the database. And so on.

At no point would your personal information ever be associated with an ID, and you could never know who had any given idea at any one time.

Why somebody hasn't implemented something like this is beyond me.",,,1605652660,{},gcnrdkj,False,t3_jvu15y,False,True,t1_gcnjmj3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvu15y/is_contact_tracing_doomed_in_the_us/gcnrdkj/,1605710166,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I called a clinic in my area that was doing the Janssen trial, and they scheduled me for a screening about a month in advanced. A couple days before they sent me documentation.

The day of screening I showed up, filled out a consent form, gave identification, gave medical history, filled out a W9 for payment, etc. The documentation made it very clear you can exit the study at any time for any reason. The payment structure was unexpected, totaling $1575 if you stay in the trial to the end. Essentially, every in-person visit or phone checkup resulted in a payment. Even exiting the study early results in a payment.

I was given a physical (height/weight, heart, breathing, reflexes, eyes checked).

Then I was asked if I wanted to proceed immediately to the ""second visit"" which included the injection. I agreed, so they took a blood sample and a nasal swab PCR test. They signed me up for an app they referred to as the ""diary"". They gave me a kit that included various forms of measurement to track redness and swelling (a ruler with a target on it that measured diameter). There was a thermometer with a box of thermometer sleeves, two take-home PCR kits (one nasal swab and one cheek swab) in case I think I get infected, and a fingertip oximeter. They showed me how to use all of it.

Next was the injection. Quick and mostly painless. I was moved to a room where I was placed in observation for 30 minutes. After that I was sent home.

The ongoing instructions were to fill out my diary twice a day for 8 days. This included a symptom questionnaire, redness/swelling measurements at the injection site, and a temperature check. I reported some mild redness which they called about, but I told them it was the only way I could even spot the injection site. Nothing serious, and no symptoms (pretty sure I got the placebo).

After the 8 days of two diary entries per day, it switches to two diary entries per week. The app notifies me when, but it just asks me for symptom checks now.

In total there are 6 in-person visits, 2 of which I technically did the same day. The followup visits get less frequent, from a 1-month checkup, 3-month checkup, 6-month checkup, 1-year checkup, and then 2 long term over-the-phone checkups in 2022. My 1-month checkup is next for me.",,,1605644326,{},gcn9swr,False,t3_jvvjoo,False,False,t3_jvvjoo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvvjoo/what_its_like_to_be_part_of_a_covid19_vaccine/gcn9swr/,1605700624,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

\- Now I do not say more about it, I get different information from different lawyers and we collect information and get back.

\--- there are multiple variations of this questions and the answer seems the same. This is a bit connected with a confusion that followed yesterday when Tegnell commented that the regulation doesn't affect cinemas, but then that turned out to be wrong. So basically the government is going to make clarification which situations are affected by the law that governs public gatherings and which not. 

**The local restrictions are extended in Skåne and Uppsala until 13 December.** **DN asks what happens to the remaining regions?**

\- Our ambition is for all local general councils to end by 13 December. Instead, we will then try to come up with national advice before the Christmas weekend.

I’m “safe”. I only go to the grocery store. I make no unnecessary trips. Yet there are still people who take their masks off at the store or have their noses hanging out.

On the other hand, COVID fatigue is real. As an example, there are many with fatigue (or just deniers including yourself it seems) that think “well my state/county/town allows me to eat in a restaurant so that must be safe.” Now if you just ask someone if they’ve been safe, they will say yes. Yet their “safe” is not your “safe.” 

I’ve seen this with my own relatively reasonable family. We had ground rules for the two weeks leading up to thanksgiving with 6 other immediate family members. Yet two of them thought it was “safe” to go out to dinner for a birthday and didn’t think to tell us or recuse themselves from the holiday. We had to uninvite them after seeing social media posts.

## Hospital capacity in question

Colorado state and county officials are in talks to add a new level to the [state COVID-19 dial](https://covid19.colorado.gov/data/covid-19-dial-dashboard) — just below the highest, stay-at-home level — as new numbers released Monday showed cases and hospitalizations continue to climb.

An announcement is expected Tuesday.

It’s unclear what, exactly, the new level would require, though a half-dozen sources who confirmed the plan told The Denver Post that the designation won’t be as restrictive the stay-at-home order Gov. Jared Polis issued in March. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the details haven’t been finalized.

At least six Denver-area counties — Denver, Boulder, Broomfield, Adams, Jefferson and Arapahoe — have been involved in the talks, sources say.",,,1605592199,{},gcl28se,True,t3_jvnnbc,False,True,t3_jvnnbc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvnnbc/colorado_to_add_new_level_to_covid_dial_as_more/gcl28se/,1605657830,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; Tegnell himself has been fetishised by large chunks of the Swedish population. A few weeks ago at a dinner party in Stockholm I witnessed a debate rage over whether Tegnell, or his 46-year-old deputy — also called Anders — was hotter (almost everyone said Tegnell). On his birthday there were toasts to him around the country.

Yikes.

&gt; Even so, for Tegnell and his colleagues, the stakes are appallingly high: should they fail, thousands more could die and one of the cornerstones of the national character could be destroyed. “Trust is something that’s very easy to lose and very, very difficult to rebuild, so it’s important for me and our agency to keep that,” he says. “But you need to do it by being incredibly transparent, admitting your mistakes and admitting when you have made the wrong choices very quickly and openly, and move on.”

When all is said and done, I really hope people who are working in the health-services get a fat bonus or a permanent wage-increase.

3M only manufacture equipments rated to a certain standards and advertise only up to the claimed rated efficiency. Will having a tiny filter media slapped on the valve reduces the exhaled particulates? Perhaps; but also remember that in tests, valved N95 are better than surgical masks.

Moderna's CEO is saying it likely won't be until June, which is actually more optimistic than the timeline that experts had been estimating:

The vaccine likely won't be approved before December, and then there's still mass production and distribution. counting the fact that the first doses will be reserved for essential personnel, then for vulnerable populations, it's pretty unlikely before spring...

Also, the level of immunity required from natural spread is likely less than the level required from vaccine, as natural spread is heterogenous whereas vaccination is homogenous. Natural immunity is more effective because the largest spreaders are also those who likely get infected first (those who meet the most people).

With that said, letting the virus run wild in an attempt to achieve natural immunity is a stupid idea, as it would result in way too many deaths.

In Sweden's case, herd immunity by spread was never the strategy. Different strategies and their outcomes were discussed by officials and scientists, and herd immunity was one of them. The level of immunity in society was discussed (and honestly the mathematical models were flawed in that case). But this is not the same as actually letting the virus run wild.

Recommendations and restrictions were enacted to limit the spread, just as in pretty much every other country. The main difference is just that those recommendations were mostly voluntary, for a variety of reasons (such as relatively high compliance anyway and constitutional limitations).

The idea that Sweden was letting the virus run wild is dangerous, as it has lead to people pointing of us as an example of why we shouldn't do anything (or reversely, why strict lockdowns are necessary) - completely disregarding the fact that Sweden actually had several policies in place to limit the spread.",,,1605617568,{},gclsuf2,False,t3_juywv4,False,True,t1_gcgrh0r,/r/Coronavirus/comments/juywv4/sweden_got_it_wrong_on_herd_immunity/gclsuf2/,1605672977,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Why? Because of the biology of the virus.

Chickenpox, herpes, and HIV can never be fully cleared from your body because they insert pieces of DNA into your chromosomes that can re-emerge as an active viral infection if your immune system ever loses the ability to keep them in check or you stop taking your anti-HIV drugs. 

But in order to insert DNA into a human chromosome you have to be able to make DNA. Chickenpox and herpes are able to do this because they are made of DNA, while HIV is an RNA virus that is able to do this because it has an enzyme called reverse transcriptase that can convert its RNA into DNA (for those of you who remember biology, this enzyme gets its name because transcription is a common process in all organisms that converts DNA into RNA).

But we know from looking at COVID-19’s sequence that it is made of RNA and does not contain an enzyme like reverse transcriptase. So it cannot hide inside your chromosomes for decades and if you recover your immune system will eventually fully clear the virus from your body.",,,1605617342,{},gclsjtj,False,t3_jvl295,False,False,t1_gckum8e,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvl295/over_1_million_children_tested_positive_for/gclsjtj/,1605672809,38,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Wisconsin is on track to become the first US region to see a dramatic slowdown in covid due to partial herd immunity. This is not a compliment, or something to be proud of.

Wisconsin, a state of 5.8 million. Has seen 335,000 documented cases. Research varies but there is consensus that testing, particularly in a state where large portions of the population appear to be ambivalent about the disease, misses the true number of cases by multiples.

Assuming Wisconsin has had 6x as many cases as they've tested, that's around 2 million total or almost 35% of the state population. Covid is presumed to have an R0 of around 2.5. This suggests that R0 will get below 1 once over 60% of the population is immune or resistant.

60% of 5.8M is around 3.5M. If there are an average of 6500 new cases per day (which is what Wisconsin is averaging over the last couple weeks, x6 is around 40,000. If Wisconsin has already seen 2M infected, at 40,000 new cases each day, it will hit 60% infected just 37 days from now.

Given that recovery lags by about 30 days behind, Wisconsin should expect to see a distinct down turn in cases as January comes to an end with far more deaths than they should have.

Merkel reiterated that the seven-day incidence of the virus must fall below 50 per 100,000 residents before serious re-opening can be contemplated.

It's people who for instance cannot find an elevator even though it is right in front of them, who show up at 2 in the night with their two children so they're travelling with children and don't think about ""where will we sleep"" before the middle of the night, people that don't know what their own e-mail adress is and so on.

Always thought those people would be a big fraction of covid patients, as they are unable to understand and follow any guidelines, even when they are best served themselves by following it. 

I've had to boot people out in a rainy night, because they weren't able to follow rules they'd been told multiple times, and also after being told it would suck for them to get booted out in the rain so it would be best for them to comply. But some people just can't do it. They simply can't remember much 5 minutes after being explained and don't understand what masks are for and so on.

So I guess there will be a lot of covid patients from this group of people that maybe have low key ADHD or whatever it is that is wrong with them. 

And as such low key mental problems should be overrepresented in covid patients.

I guess ADHD people would find it very hard to remember to social distance for months for instance.

A big role is the belgian attitude. BElgium historically has been the playball of bigger nations. So a big part of the population tries to find backdoors; or breaks rules in case there is no big chance to get caught. We can see this in amount of undeclared work done in european countries. Belgium scores terrible compared to the other nations.  


With a pandemic this attitude is terrible. While belgian rules are much strict than the dutch rules, a group large enough to get the disease spreading breaks the rules. They meet more people than allowed. So indoor spread remains a big factor.

We have an old population with a lot of underlying diseases, more than the surrounding nations.  


We have many governements passing different laws; sometimes contradicting each other.  It causes more spread, cause people move from one region to the other region to visit a bar (now closed by federal governement).

Something super weird has been going on in Japan since essentially the start of the pandemic.  They don't do any testing or anything special to stop the virus, yet it doesn't spread.  There are a few things Japan has going for it: a culture of mask wearing, and a law that people with contagious diseases have to be treated in the hospital (and thus are isolated and have their vitals watched constantly).

I've seen various Japanese scientific papers coming up with explanations as to why.  The predominant theory is that everyone in Japan is immune because of some cross-reactivity that only Japanese people have.  It's quite hard to believe.

The alternative theory is that they just contained it with their normal mask wearing and isolation practices during the summer - essentially what the US would have been able to do if we just started basic mask wearing in February.  But under this theory, they're now going to be in big, big trouble since they have no population-level immunity and no testing.

That appears to be wrong. If true, it would mean that literally every person without detectable levels of IgG memory B cells would not have a functional immune system. [There are also IgM memory B cells which retain immune memory.](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/6/E546#)

I think you are trying to point to markers of an active immune response as also representing immune memory, when the two are completely different things. Immune memory is retained even long after any given immune response has run its course.

&gt;The technology certainly is there and has been for many years now. 

No, not in the manner I described. 

&gt;Memory B cells tend to be circulating and we'd find a certain percentage of them among the PBMCs that are specific for a virus if a person has retained memory.

Not all memory B cells circulate. If someone has no detectable levels of memory B cells, would you call them immunocompromised? If not, why not?

&gt;PBMCs that are specific for a virus

How can you identify which cells are specific to a particular virus? Antibodies are specific. Why would a specific counter remain in your blood forever, long after the infection has passed? That makes no sense. It would mean human blood would become a massive traffic jam of pathogen countermeasures as you aged and fought off one infection after another. Obviously that does not happen. The countermeasures disappear over time after they are no longer needed.

&gt;There's no reason to believe that SARS-CoV-2 acts like any other coronavirus

Since it is a coronavirus, there is every reason to believe that it acts similarly to other coronaviruses. 

&gt;which also don't necessarily retain immunological memory

I reject your assertion. Show me proof that any other coronavirus is somehow immune to human immunological memory. I can tell from your qualification ""don't necessarily"" that you have none, and instead are trying a ploy to shift the burden to me. I reject that as well.

The default case for viruses to which antibodies are produced, is that immune memory is retained. The concept of immunity and vaccination would not exist otherwise. Again, if your assertion is that immunological memory doesn't work with COVID, it would mean that every vaccine would fail, since all vaccines rely on the creation of immunological memory to provide protection.

&gt;and have short lived protective immunity allowing for homologous reinfection.

Again, prove it. My understanding of immune memory is that - as a rule - it is long lasting, if not for life. The only reason you see ""re-infection"" in daily life is that it is not truly re-infection, such as with the flu, it is a new infection from a new and different mutated strain for which the prior immunity doesn't provide protection, but the person remains immune to the prior strain. 

&gt;Additionally, the authors also agree with my interpretation as addressed in the conclusion of the paper. So, there's also that...

I disagree. The study's conclusion points towards immunity for decades, while you claim that a large number of people have no immunity after a very short time. Here is the conclusion:

&gt;Notably, memory B cells specific for spike or RBD were detected in almost all COVID-19 cases, with no apparent half-life at 5+ months post-infection. B cell memory to some other infections has been observed to be long-lived, including 60+ years after smallpox vaccination (58), or 90+ years after infection with influenza (59), another respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2. The memory T cell half-lives observed over 6+ months PSO in this cohort (~166-271d for CD8+ and ~96-174d for CD4+ T cells) were comparable to the 123d t1/2 observed for memory CD8+ T cells soon after yellow fever immunization (55). Notably, the durability of a fraction of the yellow fever virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells possessed an estimated t1/2 of 485d by deuterium labeling (55). Using different approaches, the long-term durability of memory CD4+ T cells to smallpox, over a period of many years, was an estimated t1/2 of ~10 years (58, 60), which is also consistent with recent detection of SARS-CoV T cells 17 years after the initial infection (61). These data suggest that T cell memory might reach a more stable plateau, or slower decay phase, later than the first 6 months post-infection.

Then the study goes on to directly contradict your claim about detectable levels of IgG memory B cells:

&gt;While immune memory is the source of long-term protective immunity, direct conclusions about protective immunity cannot be made on the basis of quantifying SARS-CoV-2 circulating antibodies, memory B cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD4+ T cells, because mechanisms of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 are not defined in humans. 

&gt;Additionally, **circulating memory was assessed here**; it is possible that local URT immune memory is a minimal, moderate, or large component of immune memory after a primary infection with SARS-CoV-2. This remains to be determined. 

So that's you refuted there, and my point about the difficulty in identifying precise immune memory being backed by science.",,,1605652286,{},gcnqmzc,False,t3_jvx614,False,True,t1_gcnlmqy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvx614/immunity_to_the_coronavirus_may_last_years_new/gcnqmzc/,1605709759,1,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Right, and Italy was one of the first nations hit hard and made the wrong call. Instead of instituting widespread testing/isolation/tracing protocols like South Korea, they quarantined whole communities from others,  creating vast reservoirs of the disease that, once restrictions were lifted, continued to spread.

&gt; The UK has 200, France 500. So, by deaths, right now the US is doing better

By deaths per capita. The US leads deaths world-wide, which is important because the US has gotten a much better hold on the disease in the coastal cities. It's now the midwest where it's spreading and in those states the monthly per capita death rate is growing horrifyingly fast, much much faster than you are accounting for!

&gt; the US is not being hit harder than any other nation

When you look at the data, the US growth rate is quickly dwarfing everyone that has a national strategy and compared to nations with an aggressive approach like Germany, we're in dire straights! We're getting hit hard because we're not addressing the issue.

Every nation that is suffering like the US has the same problem: we didn't act early and universally. That's the key issue in any epidemic.

It was stated already a couple of months ago, in very cold terms, that the high numbers of deaths were likely to be caused because they had a very mild flu season for 2019-2020. This led to more people surviving than expected, which in turn led to a higher number of very vulnerable people catching COVID and dying from it.

## Abstract

Background: Up-to-date, there is no recognized effective treatment or vaccine for the treatment of COVID-19 that emphasize urgency around distinctive effective therapies. This study aims to evaluate the anti-parasitic medication efficacy ""Ivermectin"" plus standard care (azithromycin, vitamin C, Zinc, Lactoferrin &amp; Acetylcystein &amp; prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation if D-dimer &gt; 1000) in the treatment of mild/moderate and severely ill cases with COVID 19 infection, as well as prophylaxis of health care and/ or household contacts in comparison to the Hydroxychloroquine plus standard treatment.

Subject and methods: 600 subjects; 400 symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 patients and 200 health care and household contacts distributed over 6 groups; Group I: 100 patients with Mild/Moderate COVID-19 infection received a 4-days course of Ivermectin plus standard of care; Group II: 100 patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 infection received hydroxyxholorquine plus standard of care; Group III: 100 patients with severe COVID-19 infection received Ivermectin plus standard of care; Group IV: 100 patients with Severe COVID-19 infection received hydroxyxholorquine plus standard of care. Routine laboratory investigations and RT-PCR were reported before and after initiation of treatment. Group V stick to personal protective equipment (PPE) plus Ivermectin 400mcg / kg to be repeated after one week, and Group VI stick to PPE only and both groups V&amp;VI were followed for two weeks.

Results: Patients received ivermectin reported substantial recovery of laboratory investigations; and significant reduction in RT-PCR conversion days. A substantial improvement and reduction in mortality rate in Ivermectin treated groups; group I (mild/moderate cases), (99%, and 0.0%, respectively) and group III (severe cases), (94%, and 2.0%, respectively) versus hydroxychloroquine plus standard care treated groups; group II (mild/moderate cases), (74% and 4%, respectively) and group IV (severe cases) (50% and 20%, respectively). Ivermectin had significantly reduced the incidence of infection in health care and household contacts up to 2% compared to 10% in non ivermectin group

Conclusion: Addition of Ivermectin to standard care is very effective drug for treatment of COVID-19 patients with significant reduction in mortality compared to Hydroxychloroquine plus standard treatment only. Early use of Ivermectin is very useful for controlling COVID 19 infections, prophylaxis and improving cytokines storm",,,1605624220,{},gcm371q,True,t3_jvu4az,False,True,t3_jvu4az,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvu4az/efficacy_and_safety_of_ivermectin_for_treatment/gcm371q/,1605678720,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

But while yes, we were told not locking down would lead Sweden to catastrophe. Collapse of the healthcare system. Bodies piling on the streets. Carnage. Nothing of this happened, instead, some surplus death a bit larger than a bad flu season, a period where hospitals got busier and the healthcare under pressure, and that was it. 

Even you take the ""league table"" approach. There are the moment 18 countries with a larger death per million rate than Sweden, with Armenia and Czech Republic due to ""overtake"" us soon. Among those countries are 6 developed countries. 5 Western EU states. 8 other European countries. All of them bar maybe Bolivia and Equador are at least middle income countries. All of them bar Mexico and parts of the US and Brazil locked down and went to a distance never seen in the history of humanity to curb the virus through impeding social contact. 

For each of those countries there will be a different excuse involving culture, wealth, demography, etc, but if lockdown is so important and necessary, shouldn't it supercede everything? That is what I was told, that it was more important than anything else. Sweden, Belarus, Nicaragua should be the firsts in this table and by a mile. Even if they cook up stats, it should be possible to perceive this by going to hospitals and seeing chaos, ambulances all over, bodies flowing as we saw in Ecuador and Peru. 

It is their onus to prove it was worth it. We merely carried on doing more or less what was common sense before February. They (should say us now too, as we tecbically will lockdown soon.

Also a lot more people are hospitalized in other wards, including more people in geriatric wards now than were in spring. 

But numbers aside (looking at the numbers lowers my anxiety overall), what I'd love to see is the trends leveling off or going down. It is still unclear if that is the case - the cases have the lowest lag and fastest dynamics, but are too dependent on the testing capacity which we are close to now, and also the number of new confirmed cases is a bit flat on its own when we don't know the positivity rate of the period when they were taken in, and we find that out only on Thursday the week after..

Being infected does not automatically mean you get sick or even develop detectable viral loads. We see this constantly with our animals studies when we infect them with different doses of pathogen and/or vaccine. They are definitely infected, just as a person will be when they share a room for extended periods of time with an positive person. The confusion may have arrived from the fact that an infected person in society has come to mean contagious. But you are probably right that I did not make it clear enough that I meant not that he was with 99% certainty contagious (even though he should definitely assume so and act accordingly which I'm sure he does), but with 99% certainty infected. The 20% you referred to is perhaps the percentage that got sick after being infected? 

Where I cannot follow you or admit wrongdoing is with the timeline. We test people five days after exposure and (before our system got overwhelmed) again 7 days later. On average it takes about 5-10 days to produce enough virus to be easily measured in nasal swabs. The official incubation period for SARS-CoV2 is I believe 4-14 days, but even then there are always exceptions.

This seems, at first glance, to agree with the numbers posted if we realize that the above commenter was saying it not as a percentage but a decimal representation of a fraction, where 1 is 100%. (Honest choice or sneaky attempt to make it seem way less deadly? You decide.)

Therefore it would be

20-49 years: 0.02%

50-69 years: 0.5%

70+ years: 5.4%

Dealing with this shit in my own life has made me question my own sanity a handful of times and it fuckin sucks that a lot of us are now the position of explaining to another adult person, someone who up until this point has been fairly reasonable but is now doing a massive 180 lapse in judgement, the importance of the sacrifices so many of us have had to make during all of this. 

Just as much as you would normally look to your husband for support and comfort, he more than likely is going to need that same support and comfort from you right now. Heavy lies the crown, especially since neither you or I asked for any of this. 

If it were me in your position, I would sit your husband down, make sure he understands that you discussed this with your therapist, this isn't something you just pulled off the back page of hustler and have decided to throw a wrench his families wedding plans by choosing to stay at home. Explain that what his family does is beyond your control and you have no interest in talking them out of what they are planning on doing. They are adults and you are in no position to educate them or tell them what they can and cannot do. 

I know it's hard to make those kind of statements, because what they are doing is wrong and you and I both know that. But pointing fingers is only going to distract from the point you need to drive home with him: What OUR family does is the only thing we can and should control here. The sense of duty and responsibility we have to OUR family is the only thing that should be guiding us right now.  

I don't mean to preach to you, I just honestly feel what you're going through and I don't want you to think you're in the wrong for putting your foot down. If you need someone to talk to about this, I am here for you. I mean that sincerely. I feel just as alone and conflicted as you do right now, and sis we do not have to go through this alone.

I’m a teacher and I have two kids so I guarantee you that I’ll still be exposed to all kinds of germs, but if I could just have to suffer through ONE less bad virus every March, I don’t think that’s a bad thing. Getting sick every time I fly on a plane ruins my vacations.

The evidence for it is quite lacking, to say the least. One on hand there are emails of public health officials and scientists discussing various strategies and outcomes, with herd immunity being one of them. On the other hand, there have been recommendations and restrictions in place to limit the spread as much as possible, and both the government and FHM have time and again said how we need to keep at it until a vaccine is widely available.

And all this bullshit has had some very dangerous consequences. While some use the country of an example why we need to lock down, others use it as an example of why we should let the virus run wild. And this becomes a problem, as the whole premise is based on false facts.

Sweden did have a softer approach than most other countries, but it was based on the idea that people actually follow the recommendations in place without them needed to be backed by law. The measures have also only been a tad softer than the neighbours the vast majority of the time.

Don't get me wrong, there are a good number of things Sweden did do wrong (e.g. lack of crisis preparedness and acting too slow), but the weird thing is that these are never the focus.

Yes, I linked to the wikipedia page where it says this.  All available info says covid19 has been a much worse pandemic, which highlights that not all pandemics are the same.  I'm not sure what is confusing about that?

Flu, whether ""pandemic"" or not, causes many deaths every year we've all been alive.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_influenza_statistics_by_flu_season

2017-2018 USA flu, estimated 61,000 deaths..  

January 2018 Los Angeles flu was called a ""war zone.""

https://weather.com/health/news/2018-01-17-flu-cases-widespread-states-epidemic-california

https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-01-california-hospitals-war-zone-flu.html

Despite this, LA residents were packing into NBA games, into movie theaters for Jumanji and Star Wars Last Jedi, etc. - which goes along with the ""rugged individualism"" comment mentioned in the chain I replied to.  

&gt;You whiny babies and your sacred holiday gluttony, I swear.

Who or what are you referring to?  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_on_Thanksgiving

""Virtually every level of football, from amateur and high school to college and the NFL (including the CFL on Canadian Thanksgiving), plays football on Thanksgiving Day (Thursday) or the immediately following holiday weekend (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday).""

https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-07-flu-deaths-cities-pro-sports.html

Big crowds spread flu, flu kills, CDC says USA flu season starts in October, yet millions of Americans over all of our lifetimes until 2020 have, for better or worse, year after year packed into Thanksgiving football games and such with little to no concern over germs, even during a 2009 pandemic, or a 2018 flu ""war zone.""  

These are basic facts, easy to verify, that one might assume would be at the forefront of a discussion about attitudes towards viral spread over American history, yet there seems to be an abusive gaslighting effort to rewrite this history in regards to levels of historical concern among average age of 2020 reddit user types, for example, when such age groups were packing into 2020 spring break beaches, into Post Malone March 2020 concerts, etc.",,,1605639533,{},gcmzdli,False,t3_jv9tdo,False,True,t1_gcjcnxh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jv9tdo/its_not_too_late_to_cancel_thanksgiving_heres/gcmzdli/,1605695346,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The study notes that further research is now needed to assess whether this immune response is maintained over the longer term and to better understand how the strength of the cellular immune response corresponds to the likelihood of reinfection.

Professor Paul Moss, the U.K. Coronavirus Immunology Consortium lead from the University of Birmingham, said that further work was needed to find out if people who were symptomatic with Covid-19 were safer from future reinfection.

“Interestingly, we found that cellular immunity is stronger at this time point in those people who had symptomatic infection compared with asymptomatic cases. We now need more research to find out if symptomatic individuals are better protected against reinfection in the future.”

Since I’m in healthcare I look more to medical journals and studies and have been following the data there vs general media sources. Its been exhausting trying to keep up. I’m consider myself somewhat smart but no where near the level of smart of the people that are at the forefront of science.  It’s going to be a while before we really know one way or the other and everything in between.

There were 95 instances of COVID-19 illness among the study participants; only five of those cases were in the vaccinated group. Ninety were in the group receiving the placebo. Of these, there were 11 cases of severe disease. The results indicate the vaccine was inducing the kind of immune response that protects people if they were exposed to the coronavirus.

I should also mention a couple of interesting things that come out of the data in your source....

You'll notice that the CFR for Yemen is 29.2%, Mexico is 9.8%, and Egypt is 5.8%, compared to 2.2% in the US. It could be possible that people with COVID in those countries are somewhat more likely to die than in the US. But it is also very possible that those numbers are so high because they're not finding as many positive cases where people don't die. It'd be like in my previous example but only about 3 (Yemen) or 10 (Mexico) or 20 (Egypt) of the 100 went to the doctor and got a diagnosis. (Yemen's health system has been destroyed by their ongoing civil war, so they're probably doing less diagnosis *and* more people are dying due to lack of doctors.)

The deaths per 100,000 population is a pretty useful metric to use in place of the IFR to see how each country is doing. Tiny countries (San Marino, Andorra) are going to be weird statistical outliers. It's disturbing to see the high numbers for Belgium, Peru, and Spain from your source.

But I mean seriously this would be a lot harder without all the tech and social media we have these days but it's not like we're Abe Lincoln in a cabin in the middle of nowhere with maybe a library book to read.
Miss my friends and I do things like send them silly photos of me and my dogs or toy dinosaurs half buried in ice cubes and saying 'twas the ice age which killed the dinosaurs.
Make an extra effort when I know they're having a bad day at work.

My point is just don't focus so much on the part that sucks, do that impromise, adapt and overcome thing.

Moderna's CEO is saying it likely won't be until June, which is actually more optimistic than the timeline that experts had been estimating:

The vaccine likely won't be approved before December, and then there's still mass production and distribution. counting the fact that the first doses will be reserved for essential personnel, then for vulnerable populations, it's pretty unlikely before spring...

You all are suffering from basic human ignorance of probability. Don't worry, it doesn't mean your stupid - very smart people do, and even those educated in statistics can struggle, if they don't focus very closely.

In this case, your brain is basically going okay, this is a very infectious disease, that surely means 100% or at least close must get infected? But actually, spousal infection rates are around 20%, car sharing is like 5%, and so forth. Think about it - if people were actually infecting anything above 50% of their contacts when infectious, we wouldn't be talking about some tens of millions of cases, it would have spread to billions already. If you do the math, the amounts of estimated cases are quite consistent with &lt;20% probabilities of infection from a contact. The R0, or how many people each infected person infects, is estimated to be maybe around 2 in most populations now (with current behaviours). If everyone infected everyone they meet, R0 would be maybe 7 or 10 or something. The only way to get the current spreading speed is that on average, people only infect a few of their contacts. This is somewhat obscured by superspreading, as it's not always &lt;20%, but sometimes 0%, sometimes, 5%, and sometimes 50%, but still, it's not at all rare to have four close contacts get it, spend a fair amount of time with them, and not get it. There will be tons of people in that situation.

I did a quick search and it seems as though nearly all traceable issues show within 48 hours, most of the rest up to 42 days, and some up to 6 months or a year. So it looks like we would know by now if there were significant problems with the vaccines we have. So if you haven't had issues with other vaccines, the COVID vaccines will likely also be fine. The vaccine injury table for compensation at the link below was what I found, but I'm sure there are plenty more resources that explain things more thoroughly. https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/data/index.html

For me, I'm 27, athletic build, healthy, no comorbidities, etc. So I have excellent chances against COVID. *But there's still a much higher chance for death or permanent damage if I get COVID than if I get the vaccine,* so you can bet your ass I'll be getting the vaccine as soon as I can. I also would prefer to not get it and unknowingly pass it along to someone more vulnerable at the grocery store if I'm asymptomatic. It's up to you to make the choice for whether you'll be first in line, and skepticism is healthy, but you had better not be eating at indoor restaurants, having indoor gatherings with friends/family, or other risky behaviors in the meantime, because there will be people who can't get the vaccine or are lower on the priority list (or even can't afford it, if you're in the US) and it's our job to keep them safe.

The point of the mRNA is to force the cells in and around the injection site to start producing (In the case of Moderna's vaccine) the spike protein that's found on the surface of Covid. 

Those spike proteins (which are harmless on their own) will then eventually make their way into the bloodstream,  where the immune system will detect them and mount an immune response. Once the immune system has defeated the intruder (harmless spike proteins in this case), it will keep a memory of how to defeat those proteins. 

That's when you're considered immunised because if Covid ever enters your bloodstream, the immune system can recognise its spike proteins and defeat the virus extremely quickly. 

However that doesn't mean that immunity will be lifelong either, depending on certain factors (like the type and strength of the immune response generated) it could be a yearly or a lifelong immunity.

## Abstract

Understanding immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for improving diagnostics and vaccines, and for assessing the likely future course of the pandemic. We analyzed multiple compartments of circulating immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 in 185 COVID-19 cases, including 41 cases at &gt; 6 months post-infection. Spike IgG was relatively stable over 6+ months. Spike-specific memory B cells were more abundant at 6 months than at 1 month. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells declined with a half-life of 3-5 months. By studying antibody, memory B cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell memory to SARS-CoV-2 in an integrated manner, we observed that each component of SARS-CoV-2 immune memory exhibited distinct kinetics.",,,1605615529,{},gclqbx8,True,t3_jvs0s3,False,True,t3_jvs0s3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvs0s3/immunological_memory_to_sarscov2_assessed_for/gclqbx8/,1605671533,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That's precisely what an international team of researchers attempted to find out, as described in a paper published today.

I watched those early videos out of Wuhan in Jan on WeChat and knew we are in trouble. That lead me to searching around and finding this sub before the change and China flu sub.

I loaded up in early Feb as well. Got involved in several things, built a network of contacts at many hospitals, doctors, joined groups of researchers and epidemiologists as a fly on the wall, read everything I could find on pandemics and the history of them, etc. I easily spent 10+ hours a day learning for months and months. No doubt countless days of 20+ hours reading, researching, learning.

I was asked as recent as Sunday why I’ve spent so much time and energy learning all I could about the virus, pandemics, etc. (I backed off in summer and fall, kept up with headlines, now back all-in.) I couldn’t answer his question. No idea. I just feel the need to be well educated about this.

Around March I felt like I was living in an alternate universe. (I still do.) I knew what was coming like I knew my name. Yet, everyone continued living like nothing was happening. It drove me crazy. I had a hard time with it because no one would listen to me. Lost several friendships. Lost interest in the vast majority of people I was hanging out with prior to this because they are on the other side, those who either don’t care or think it’s nothing to worry about. 

And I feel it all... and have since the beginning. That’s been the toughest - especially knowing all year what was coming this winter. I feel for all those who just couldn’t wrap their minds around the magnitude of all of this and fell for all the BS by the Gov and media. And yes, so much of it was BS. Lies. Smoke and mirrors. Psychological warfare. Manufactured campaigns to spread confusion. It was maddening to see through all of it. Ugh. I’m sure you can relate.

Because of the virus, I’m also not sure many quite understand what the economic impacts could be in 2021 and beyond. If serious restrictions in states and serious stimulus are not put in place very soon, well, that’s a whole different topic.

Anyway, I can write many books on all this. Sorry.

My aunt is an elementary school teacher, and while they don't allow students, she still goes in ~3 days per week for whatever, but all the teachers in the building are masked up/ apparently pretty cautious. 

And my uncle just works from home. 


Just based on this information, would you feel safe going over to their house for Thanksgiving, possibly staying a couple of days, if you were me? They're not gonna be wearing masks, because we're gonna be inside the whole time/eating/drinking etc. 

I don't know if it's a safe idea. My aunt and uncle are pretty immunocompromised, so they're being as careful as they can (thanksgiving not included), but I'm still sort of concerned, for all of us. Does that sound generally low-risk? High risk?

(I’m 26 now) But I’m living proof that it gets better. And I know that you’ve probably heard that a million times and it’s pretty cliche and sometimes makes you want to pull your hair out, but it does get better. You keep going and you find new things that bring light in your life. For me, it’s stories, live music, and my relationships. I don’t know what it is for you, but you’ll find it if you haven’t already. 

And I also know what you mean in the sense like you don’t want to go back to that dark place where you were, because you don’t know if you’ll be able to get out of it again. I had one of the best years of my life in 2019 because I really took my mental health seriously and I started to go to therapy and take meds (for ADHD and and anxiety). It all came crashing down with lockdowns and the pandemic. I thought all that progress I made was gone forever, and it made me feel even more hopeless than I was. Like, at one of the worst points it’s been in years. But it turned out that I knew how to get back out of it. It’s like riding a bike or any other skill. If you do it once you can do it again. And if you’re able to pull through the darkest of times, it gives you a new perspective on the good times. It makes them even better and more precious.

For me, I really miss live music. I didn’t realize how important it was for me until I couldn’t experience it anymore. And I’m like you, zoom calls aren’t gonna cut it with reuniting with people. So live streams of old music festivals isn’t good enough either. But that’s okay. I just imagine the first time after the pandemic when I’ll get to experience it again. Hopefully it’s outside, and I’m standing there with my boyfriend and our friends, no masks, no worry about catching covid, were drinking and laughing, and then the artist were waiting for comes on stage. It’s going to be a magical moment, and I wouldn’t miss it for anything. I know you probably have something like that too that you can’t wait to do again. You don’t want to miss it because you might cry at how beautiful it will be. 

And for the record, if you ever have a therapist that tries to talk you out of your feelings, they’re not doing a good job. My therapist has taught me to lean into my feelings and to actually feel them rather than run away. It doesn’t mean that you have to be destructive.

I’m sorry but this was not how the virus spread in Sweden. The returning travelers from the alps were contact traced and the spread contained. The outbreak was instead seeded by travelers returning from the UK, Netherlands and USA, which during those crucial few weeks did not have any known cases so it spread completely undetected until week 11 when community spread was starting to pop up. At that point it was to late to stop.

&gt;	During March, there was a great focus on Italy and the Swedish sports holidaymakers who went to the Alps to ski.  So also from the side of infection control.

&gt;	- In our analyzes, we clearly see the enormous imports from Italy, says Karin Tegmark Wisell.

&gt;	But from the samples and analyzes made in April, a different pattern can be seen. The Italian infection was much less common and instead it was other countries that stood out.  From this it can now be established that the infection entered Sweden from several different countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands and the United States.

&gt;	The conclusion the authority draws from this is that infection control in the regions through isolation and infection tracing to a large extent prevented the infection from Italy from gaining a foothold in Sweden. Instead, the infection entered the country from a number of different countries because the pandemic was already a fact.

&gt;	- It was important that we were aware of those who came from Italy and had the infection with them. It has been important for the effect.

Heat, stirring constantly until it thickens up, then add a few ounces of grated parmesan. Add canned or fresh boiled green beans, taste for salt and pepper and season to taste.

The priority is chipping through decades of propaganda that these students have endured and informing the students of the well censored human rights violations of their own country, where they can have an immediate impact on. They’re not gonna waste much time going over the violations on a non-existent government like the USSR, or places like the Middle East and China where everyone already knows about the atrocities and can very easily find information on. 

They focused on the Middle East and Latin America because the US is the country that went in, invaded those countries, destabilized them, and implemented the very regimes that committed the human rights violations. They want students to be aware of them so they are less likely to fall for the same shit as our previous voters.

The only way to increase pressure is to contract the muscles that dilate your lungs even more, which will require work, and thus energy.

it sucks because i know if we could id just move the date back, but so much money and time have gone into it already, so we still wanna have this ""smallerish"" wedding if possible and trying to be as safe as we can

is there any advice yall could give? i know the best answer despite it being the bitter truth is to just move the date if we could.

It seems that the precipitating factor in a virus becoming a human threat, is often it jumping from one species to another, causing a mutation in the process. 

SARS and MERS were civet cats and dromedaries, respectively, as intermediate hosts. 

Covid seems most likely to be a fur bearing animal like minks or civet cats. 

Humans have caught viruses from bats directly before, but those viruses haven’t spread, and so don’t seem to have the pandemic potential of viruses that have passed through an intermediate host then to humans. 

If we want to decrease the possibility of future pandemics, part of our efforts should be in better separating domesticated and farmed animals from wild animals (especially good virus sources like bats), and separating humans from wild animals. 

The outcry is usually that “pandemics are going to happen as we encroach on wild areas” when really all it would seem to theoretically take is bats roosting on a mink farm, domesticated cats catching bats, or any number of other likely scenarios to potentially cause another one.",,,1605619573,{},gclvlzq,False,t3_jvrw7v,False,True,t3_jvrw7v,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvrw7v/where_did_covid_come_from_who_investigation/gclvlzq/,1605674526,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

#### Abstract

In March 2020, an expert panel called the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC) was created and led by Professor Paul E. Marik, with the goal of continuously reviewing the rapidly emerging basic science, translational, and clinical data in order to gain insight into and to develop a treatment protocol for COVID-19. At the same time, many centers and groups employed a multitude of novel therapeutic agents empirically, and within clinical trials, often during inappropriate time points during this now well-described multi-phase disease. Either as a result of these frequent trial design failures, or due to the lack of their insufficient anti-viral or anti-inflammatory properties, nearly all trialed agents have proven ineffective in treating COVID-19 as of November 11, 2020. Based on a recent series of negative published therapeutic study results, in particular the SOLIDARITY trial, they now virtually eliminate any treatment role for remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon, convalescent plasma, tocilizumab, and monoclonal antibody therapy. Despite this growing list of failed therapeutics in COVID-19, the FLCCC recently discovered that ivermectin, an anti-parasitic medicine, has highly potent real-world, anti-viral, and anti-inflammatory properties against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. This conclusion is based on the increasing numbers of study results reporting effectiveness, not only within vitro and animal models, but also in numerous randomized and observational controlled clinical trials. Repeated, large magnitude improvements in clinical outcomes have now been recorded when ivermectin is used not only as a prophylactic agent but also in mild, moderate, and even severe disease states. The review that follows of the existing evidence for ivermectin relies on “emerging” data in that, although compelling, only a minority of studies have been published in peer-reviewed publications with the majority of results compiled from manuscripts uploaded to medicine pre-print servers or posted on clinicaltrials.gov.",,,1605619092,{},gcluwww,True,t3_jvst4w,False,True,t3_jvst4w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvst4w/review_of_the_emerging_evidence_supporting_the/gcluwww/,1605674133,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Also nobody knows (not even the ones administering the vaccine/placebo) who has been vaccinated and who has received the placebo since it's done entirely randomly, and you can only look up after the fact who has and hasn't received the vaccine. Since it's done randomly on a large enough sample size where the subjects do not know if they got the vaccine or not, there should be no average behavioural differences between the two groups.

What I can imagine is that some people who got certain side effects from the vaccine (such as a fever) might logically conclude that it's likely they weren't in the placebo group, and consequently could behave differently. But these are the kinds of things scientists are very much aware of, and they take it into account.

All this comes down to the results you see: scientists are confident that these 2 vaccines are highly effective. And once the data gets peer reviewed it will pretty much be certain. Things are looking good.

Disclaimer: I'm not an expert.

FWIW North Dakota (estimated at 39% ever infected) has been flat for a week now. Too early to say if South Dakota (37%) and Iowa (31%) will follow. Haven't followed international as closely but Belgium does seem on steady decline with similar saturation as those states mentioned.

If 40-50% is the magic number that's obviously good news as it wouldn't require a ton of vaccinations to get us there, especially in hard hit areas. But if the vaccine doesn't become available to the general public until April, I can see a scenario where cases/deaths are already super low at that point (due to combo of seasonality, pop immunity, and early round TUE vaccinations).

This kind of set-up is not uncommon.  Just to lay the groundwork, you can't have the same doctors that usually treat people one day decide to conduct research.  There is a ton of work that needs to go into place before you can do this.  Clinical Trials is a heavily regulated industry (despite what people online like to think).  So, if Moderna just came to a hospital and said 'here you go. test out this drug', the FDA and all other auditing agencies would have a field day going through the terrible conduct at the hospital.

A clinical trial needs to make sure that everyone conducting it is trained, has appropriate credentials, has been put on record to show what they'll be doing on the trial (administering drug?  consenting patient?  taking vitals? etc).  

A good research facility will have the infrastructure in place to make sure everything is being done correctly.  They'll have someone who documents all the regulatory requirements, someone who makes sure the patient is actually doing their part of the study, someone to document every thing that happens in the study, someone to administer the drug...... it goes on. 

Now, Vanderbilt has a good research department.  But anyone who works a facility like this will tell you how thinly they're stretched.  The workload of what anyone can do is very balanced with what they're doing (and, most people will say they're assigned to more than they should be). 

So, all of a sudden you get a request to take part in an experimental drug like a cure to a fucking pandemic.  That is going to 1) get a TON of people who want to take part in the study and 2) paint a giant bullseye on your back for review/auditing. 

What most people who aren't in the research field don't understand is that doctors who do this stuff aren't doing it to get rich.  They're either doing it because they legitimately want to help people, or because they like to figure out answers to problems.  So, they'll take on this new trial, even if it means putting in 100hr weeks. They don't actually care about the $$ the drug will make.  They just want to be part of the system that found a cure. 

So, the money that someone like Dolly Parton donate helps with this.  It allows them to hire more people.  It lets them get more hardware, or software to conduct the trial.  It allows them to expand where their researchers are working, so all the participants in the trial aren't coming to the same location.  It allows them to make sure they have the people involved in the study to ensure the study is being conducted correctly, and the data collected is correct.",,,1605635220,{},gcmpx5i,False,t3_jvrels,False,False,t1_gclrwqk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvrels/saint_dolly_parton_partfunded_modernas_promising/gcmpx5i/,1605690557,172,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

**Nervous System**

Many patients report issues with concentration and memory, sometimes referred to as “brain fog.” Some say they forget what they’re trying to say or do. Neurologists seeing such patients say cognitive problems are among the most common symptoms.

Some neurologists say they are seeing patients with signs of dysautonomia, or dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system regulates involuntary functions such as breathing, digestion and heart rate.

**Taste and Smell**

Patients say it can take weeks or months to regain their senses of smell and taste. They say the loss of these senses affects not just their diet but their mental health.

**Lungs**

Some patients report persistent shortness of breath. Doctors often prescribe asthma inhalers and breathing exercises to help improve lung function. The exact cause is unknown. It could be related to aberrant nervous system function, lung injury or a compromised cardiovascular system.

**Cardiovascular System**

Many patients experience a racing heartbeat, or tachycardia, as well as extreme blood pressure changes. Some physicians think this could be related to an issue with the nervous system, particularly the autonomic arm, which deals with involuntary functions like heart rate and blood pressure.

Some patients have signs of heart-muscle inflammation weeks or months after infection, doctors and researchers say. In some cases, they don’t report any symptoms, while others say they have shortness of breath and chest pain.

**Digestive System**

Patients report issues with abdominal pain and diarrhea weeks or months after coming down with Covid-19. Some physicians are recommending avoiding certain foods, such as dairy and gluten.

**Musculoskeletal System**

Some patients report mild muscle and joint aches. Others have more severe pain.

Many patients also report persistent fatigue weeks or months after coming down with Covid-19, even when they had a mild or moderate course of illness and didn’t require hospitalization. The fatigue can be debilitating and get in the way of regular daily activities, like work and spending time with family.

The virus also might cause changes in gut bacteria, said Brennan Spiegel, a gastroenterologist and director of health services research at Cedars-Sinai Health System, who has had patients come in with abdominal pain and diarrhea weeks or months after coming down with Covid-19.

Ms. Moore, the Indiana lawyer, got Covid-19 in March and initially felt better by the end of April. “I thought I beat this thing. I was ecstatic,” said Ms. Moore, who tested positive for coronavirus antibodies in May.

That month, her health took a sharp turn for the worse. She struggled with tachycardia, or a racing heartbeat, and blood-pressure fluctuations. Those symptoms improved, but she still has gastrointestinal problems. A recent test found stomach-lining inflammation. Pepcid, antihistamines and avoiding dairy products have provided some relief, but other symptoms such as memory deficits persist.

&amp;#x200B;

Nearly a year into the global coronavirus pandemic, scientists, doctors and patients are beginning to unlock a puzzling phenomenon: For many patients, including young ones who never required hospitalization, Covid-19 has a devastating second act.

Many are dealing with symptoms weeks or months after they were expected to recover, often with puzzling new complications that can affect the entire body—severe fatigue, cognitive issues and memory lapses, digestive problems, erratic heart rates, headaches, dizziness, fluctuating blood pressure, even hair loss.

What is surprising to doctors is that many such cases involve people whose original cases weren’t the most serious, [undermining the assumption that patients with mild Covid-19 recover within two weeks](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m3981). Doctors call the condition “post-acute Covid” or “chronic Covid,” and sufferers often refer to themselves as “long haulers” or “long-Covid” patients.

“Usually, the patients with bad disease are most likely to have persistent symptoms, but Covid doesn’t work like that,” said Trisha Greenhalgh, professor of primary care at the University of Oxford and the lead author of [an August BMJ study](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3026) that was among the first to define chronic Covid patients as those with symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks and spanning multiple organ systems.

For many such patients, she said, “the disease itself is not that bad,” but symptoms like memory lapses and rapid heart rate sometimes persist for months.  


In October, the National Institutes of Health added a description of such cases to its Covid-19 treatment guidelines, saying doctors were reporting Covid-19-related long-term symptoms and disabilities in people with milder illness.

“You don’t realize how lucky you are with your health until you don’t have it,” said Elizabeth Moore, a 43-year-old lawyer and mother of three in Valparaiso, Ind. Pre-Covid-19 she was an avid skier and did boot-camp workouts several times a week. Since falling ill in March, she has been struggling with symptoms including memory problems and gastrointestinal issues. She has lost nearly 30 pounds.

Estimates about the percentage of Covid-19 patients who experience long-haul symptoms range widely. [A recent survey of more than 4,000 Covid-19 patients](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20214494v1) found that about 10% of those age 18 to 49 still struggled with symptoms four weeks after becoming sick, that 4.5% of all ages had symptoms for more than eight weeks, and 2.3% had them for more than 12 weeks. The study, which hasn’t yet been peer reviewed, was performed using an app created by the health-science company Zoe in cooperation with King’s College London and Massachusetts General Hospital.

Another [preliminary study looking mostly at nonhospitalized Covid patients](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208702v1) found that about 25% still had at least one symptom after 90 days. [A European study](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/9/2946/htm) found about one-third of 1,837 nonhospitalized patients reported being dependent on a caregiver about three months after symptoms started.

With more than 46 million cases world-wide, even the lower estimates would translate into millions living with long-term, sometimes disabling conditions, increasing the urgency to study this patient population, researchers said. What they find could have implications for how clinicians define recovery and what therapies they prescribe, doctors said.

Doctors say anxiety caused by social isolation and uncertainty surrounding the pandemic may exacerbate symptoms, though that isn’t likely the primary cause.

Other viral outbreaks, including the original SARS, MERS, Ebola, H1N1 and the Spanish flu, have been associated with long-term symptoms. Scientists reported that some patients experienced fatigue, sleep problems and joint and muscle pain long after their bodies cleared a virus, [according to a recent review chronicling the long-term effects of viral infections](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/21641846.2020.1778227).

What differentiates Covid-19 is the far-reaching nature of its effects. While it starts in the lungs, it often affects many other parts of the body, including the heart, kidneys and the digestive and nervous systems, doctors said.

“I haven’t really seen any other illness that affects so many different organ systems in as many different ways as Covid does,” said Zijian Chen, medical director for Mount Sinai Health System’s Center for Post-Covid Care.

&amp;#x200B;

He described colleagues who were energetic, but after getting sick, had trouble getting through the day. He said he has seen up close how Covid-19 still affects their ability to do the things they love.

“We thought it was a virus that, once it does what it does, you recover and you go back to normal,” he said. Sometimes that isn’t the case, and that “is really scary,” he said.

A leading explanation for long-Covid symptoms is that immune-system activity and ensuing inflammation continue to affect organs or the nervous system even after the virus is gone, researchers said.

Some of the most compelling evidence for the inflammation theory comes from Covid-19 patients [with signs of heart inflammation and injury months after illness](https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-covid-19-patients-show-signs-of-heart-damage-months-later-11600866000?mod=article_inline). One study [looking at 100 Covid-19 patients two months after getting sick](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2768916) found that 78 had abnormal findings on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, while 60 had cardiac MRIs indicating heart-muscle inflammation. The study included hospitalized, nonhospitalized and asymptomatic patients.

“Even those who had no symptoms and were young and fit…even in those patients we saw abnormalities,” said Eike Nagel, one of the lead authors and director of the Institute for Experimental and Translational Cardiovascular Imaging at the University Hospital Frankfurt in Germany.

Some patients had scarring on their heart imaging, he said, which worried him. The scarring wasn’t too serious, he said, but “we know from other studies that this is related to worse outcomes.”

Doctors also are reporting cases of long-Covid patients with gastrointestinal issues. Recent work has found the new coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, in fecal matter and intestinal lining of some Covid-19 patients, [suggesting the virus can infect and damage the cells of the gut](https://gut.bmj.com/content/69/6/973.full). The intestines have a high density of ACE2 receptors, a type of protein on the surface of cells, [which SARS-CoV-2 uses to infiltrate cells](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6499/50).",,,1605624964,{},gcm4ke0,True,t3_jvu942,False,True,t3_jvu942,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvu942/doctors_begin_to_crack_covids_mysterious_longterm/gcm4ke0/,1605679454,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

For those with pre-existing mental illness, one of the reasons may be that they have to interact with the medical system much more for the maintenance of mental stability. Having to interact with different doctors and therapists and psychiatrists is going to increase your risk of infection. This is the same concern with having to routinely go to a pharmacy.

Another reason could be that these prolonged periods of stress and uncertainty have a compound effect for people who already have mental illness. Because of the
difficulty of long term coping, their immune systems may be more run down from the stress. If that’s not the case, they may be self-medicating with alcohol or something else that can also damage your physical and mental health, increasing risk of infection.

It’s also important to think of age demographics and mental illness diagnoses and covid infection rates. Young people have been diagnosed at much higher rates because of the ease of spread in high school and college aged populations, as well as those generally in their 20s. They also have some of the highest rates of mental illness diagnoses. It isn’t that mental illness makes it more likely, it’s correlative. Many young people have a mental illness and also happen to get covid. And it’s similar the other way around and important to remember that we are In A Pandemic so of course people are going to report poorer mental health even if they can avoid the virus, and this doesn’t consider any of the stigma or hardship that comes with being infected and coming out of the tunnel with covid, so to speak.

Additionally the  claims of effectiveness are not valid because theparticipants in the  double blind study were not exposed to the coronavirus,  and by not doing so, claims of effectiveness are highly suspect. Yes,  it may be unethical to expose the study participants to coronavirus,  however, it is statistically appropriate,  


Caution  should be the order of the day until the sample size is over 1MM and  there has been at least a 6 month follow up after the second dose. Then you will know the extent of side effects and the vaccine's effectiveness.

If humans actually created a virus in 2015, when 

""scientist Ralph Baric, Ph.D, and a team that included Baric’s Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) colleague, Shi Zhengli, used genetic engineering and synthetic biology to create a “new bat SARS-like virus . . . that can jump directly from its bat hosts to humans"",

Ralph &amp; Shi had 5 years to make a vaccine and didn't?

There is so much more that needs to be talked about with this virus like ""where did it come from?"" So far science cannot find a primary reservoir but only guess that [""a bat living in Italy, that may be a potential primary reservoir of the virus.""](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844020322738).

Before ya'll attack me as a conspiracy theorist please realize that I am *NOT* making up a theory here, I am simply pointing to facts that are readily available on the web, like this:

[Genomic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically related to severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, therefore bats could be the possible primary reservoir.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32257431/0)

We still have not found any bats that have the SARS-CoV-2 virus but we do know that in August 2019 [problems with disposal of dangerous materials led the government to suspend research at the military’s leading biodefense center](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/health/germs-fort-detrick-biohazard.html)

Again, I am posting this for others that may want to do their own search into the origin of this virus. I am only posting where I ended my search. I have stopped caring where it came from because the answer cannot be found on the web.

What is very disturbing to me is that humans actually made a virus just like SARS-CoV-2 four years ago and did not bother to develop a vaccine for it. Now maybe one comes from nature and we are not ready?
