The virus can’t keep spreading from person to person because it hits a wall of vaccinated people. 

Now with all of these people unwilling to vaccinate, those people (who would love to be able to take one but it’s too risky for their health) aren’t protected. The virus keeps jumping through the gaps in the wall, the antivaxxer groups, the people who just don’t want it. That’s why it’s so important that as many people as possible get vaccinated, to the point where they become forced to. I understand why people are wary of a vaccine, but it’s not like it was thrown together this year. It’s been researched for a long time, just not developed and adapted into the product we have now. 

I even agree that if they’re nervous, they should be able to wait a few months to see how it’s affecting their friends and family who get it, just pass their vaccine on to someone who wants it right now. But they do need to take it eventually.

&gt;ImmunityBio, Inc., a privately-held immunotherapy company, today announced it has received authorization from the South Africa Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) to begin a Phase I clinical trial of its hAd5 T-cell vaccine, the company’s novel COVID-19 vaccine candidate, which will be administered subcutaneously. The same vaccine is currently being tested in a similar Phase I trial in the U.S., with no safety concerns identified to date. With the goal of creating longer-term protection from the virus, hAd5-COVID-19 targets both the mutation-prone outer spike protein (S) and the more stable inner nucleocapsid (N) protein, activating antibodies, memory B cells, and T-cells against the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).

India has actually fallen in the World Press Freedom Index. It's currently at 142 out of 180 countries. The UK is at 34. You continue to delude yourself.

&gt;With no murders of journalists in India in 2019, as against six in 2018, the security situation for the country’s media might seem, on the face of it, to have improved. However, there have been constant press freedom violations, including police violence against journalists, ambushes by political activists, and reprisals instigated by criminal groups or corrupt local officials. Ever since the general elections in the spring of 2019, won overwhelmingly by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, pressure on the media to toe the Hindu nationalist government’s line has increased.

And I call bullshit on that. Plenty of news outlets constantly reporting against the government. Over and over again. 

Also another bullshit reminder. The central government and state government are not the same.  A pro Modi outlet in a place like Jharkhand and Rajasthan has absolutely no incentive for not speaking out against the state government under whom state Healthcare is managed. 

One last reminder, the press index ranking has been drastically influenced by the justified security lockdown in Kashmir. 

This is what a person who has no knowledge about India but pretends to be an expert writes. No knowledge about the structure of government. No knowledge about the Media. Yet wants to keep passing judgements from a place thousands of Kms away. Lol. 



&gt;Mr Moneybags in an impoverish country had a good experience in hospital, and was able to convalesce with his maid and cook attending to his needs. Therefore everything is absolutely fine over there and the 70% of people living on a few dollars per day or less are having the time of their lives.

You obviously don't read properly. Again I am asking you, can you please read my previous comments? 

&gt;I have heard plenty of accounts from people about the economic difficulties people faced due to the strict lockdown. I keep talking to people from far off places. And I actually live in India. The economic difficulties far outpace the pain from Covid. 

Reminding you about the no of people I keep talking too. A reminder about how they keep talking about the economic pain and not pain from Covid. Assuming there has been absolute massive underreporting of deaths, somehow these people decided that they should only share economic pains and not covid. 

Also want to remind you that I never said anything about it being perfectly fine.

&gt;Where are the trucks carrying the dead out of the city? Where are the very frequent reports of Hospitals being overrun across India? 

A reminder about what happens there is massive underreporting

&gt;Yeah, plenty of sources detailing stuff happening in one city to prove your generalisation of the entire country. Fantastic. How intelligent. 

A reminder about your sources. 

&gt;Sure there is underreporting but definitely not at the scale a bunch of white people are claiming.


A reminder about me not denying underreporting. Also want to remind you that I am absolutely denying your rhetoric about massive giant underreporting. 


I am constantly repeating so many things. Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V can get very tiring. 

Maybe you can learn to comprehend? Will hold you in good stead. 


&gt;That you can't even get the months correct

Maybe, just maybe I have a life outside and sometimes the months can get muddled up inside my mind. You know, something called an honest mistake. 

&gt;makes me think you haven't read anything

The irony. Practice what you preach. 

&gt;you've just picked an uninformed position for patriotic reasons and won't budge even when presented with evidence to the contrary.

Uff here we go again. 

&gt; Yeah, plenty of sources detailing stuff happening in one city to prove your generalisation of the entire country. Fantastic. How intelligent. 

Should I let you in on a tiny little bit of knowledge? 

Your claims of nationwide massive underreporting isn't backed up by reports from one single city. That's not called evidence for your claims. 


All these conspiracies about India and stories about my life is truly an interesting read.

    Those articles are mostly reports from one city during 2 time periods spanning a couple of days each, one in June and the other around September. More articles from foreign websites than local Indian media. And our media is free to report on whatever they want.

India has actually fallen in the World Press Freedom Index. It's currently at 142 out of 180 countries. The UK is at 34. You continue to delude yourself.

[With no murders of journalists in India in 2019, as against six in 2018, the security situation for the country’s media might seem, on the face of it, to have improved. However, there have been constant press freedom violations, including police violence against journalists, ambushes by political activists, and reprisals instigated by criminal groups or corrupt local officials. Ever since the general elections in the spring of 2019, won overwhelmingly by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, pressure on the media to toe the Hindu nationalist government’s line has increased.](https://rsf.org/en/india)

What a bunch of stupid nonsense. You are really gasping for arguments here.

There is no peer reviewed studio to find out what the best outcome for me personally is. Like at all. The scientific knowledge simply says that one vaccine is above 60% effective while others are way above 90%, so logically you get the one that is more effective and on top of that has less health risks. 

I am sure you could find some recommendation from some scientist on what Germany should recommend its citizens, but that would be based on what is best for the whole population and based on economics just as much as on health concerns.

Also sometime the numbers are reported over a span of time like 25 days after the shot.

What it looks like to me is that there is something driving the spread (and lack of spread) of the virus and it has nothing to do with the holidays, masks, lockdowns, etc.  Like California had severe lockdowns late last year but the virus went on to spread anyway, and then everyone was worried about the holidays making it worse but the cases actually peaked before Christmas and have been declining ever since.

I personally think that the virus is spreading nearly unchecked in most areas because a half-assed lockdown isn't really a lockdown at all.

And the AZ data you cite for a 12-week interval was only in a small subset - less than 3000 people - that was not a randomly selected representative sample of the study participants.  Dosage interval was not tested explicitly - they simply re-sliced the data and reanalyzed in an attempt to back-justify the UK decision because some people’s doses had been delayed due to the study design changing on the fly.

Both were hints that an extended dosage strategy might be possible, and were great reasons to expeditiously launch studies to investigate the possibility.

This mentality pisses me off so much when I see it. Anyone who is going to pretend a fast food diet is cheaper than making your own food is out of their god damn mind, and this is especially true if you're talking about families.

A bell pepper is 57 cents for me, but even if it were a dollar, so what? And you know... you'll probably need several more ingredients to make something. Several of them might be a buck... or maybe even a couple bucks (especially the proteins). 

But what do you get? A large meal to feed a large family, or multiple meals to feed a single person over several days. Spend 12 bucks making your own food to get the equivalent of 30 bucks worth of fast food. You'll get so much more and it will be so much healthier, and once you get decent at it, it will taste better, too.

If someone works at a smaller and lesser known grocery store/pharmacy/take out restaurant/any other essential retail, do they qualify and how do we verify their businesses and employment are real and fit the criteria? 

For people with medical history that suggests we should give them the vaccine earlier, it's actually much easier to manage. Doctors offices can be given vaccine which can be administered to patients who fit the criteria laid out.

The question is how the variants are different. They could spread more, or less, or be more, or less affected by the vaccines.

We still don't have answers to these questions but they are working on it. But the lack of understanding is not slowing down the speculation and worry. Ultimately they will have to large trials to figure out the vaccine effectiveness but until then have only lab tests. 

One lab test shows reduced antibody response against the variant, but that is not the same thing as reduced vaccine effectiveness. And even if vaccine effectiveness were reduced from say 90% to 80%, that could still be plenty enough to protect people. The loss of protection is usually for mild and moderate illness.

Also it takes a while for the variants to spread meanwhile population immunity is rising. If we stay ahead of it, it won't be a problem.

Not really. I mean, if we're talking about which businesses that can be shut down. We don't need ice cream parlours, candy stores or toy stores to remain open, for instance, whereas we really cannot do without grocery stores and pharmacies. Even some clothing stores are kind of essential, especially during the winter. 

I'm a software engineer, and if we all stopped working where I work now, the only consequence would be that the tiny company crashes and goes bankrupt, and the only downside would be that some other companies would lose money because they rely on what we do. Not essential. But at my last job I worked with software that hospitals used, and if everyone there suddenly stopped working, the worst-case scenario would literally have been people dying.

&gt; The study found the vaccine was still able to neutralize the virus and there is not yet evidence from trials in people that the variant reduces vaccine protection, the companies said.

&gt;Because there is no established benchmark yet to determine what level of antibodies are needed to protect against the virus, it is unclear whether that two-thirds reduction will render the vaccine ineffective against the variant spreading around the world.

All viruses mutate frequently. Most mutations either make the virus less effective (so they just die out) or have no effect on the effectiveness of the virus (so they might stick around). There are currently 10's of thousands of different know variants of covid.

There are a few variants of covid which scientists think could be a bit more contagious, or that the vaccine might be a bit less effective on. The media likes to play up the dangers of these variants because it gets people scared and makes them more likely to click articles. 

All of the vaccines being used in the US currently work well against the existing variants, and cases are dropping rapidly in the US despite the presence of the variants.

If you want to talk about vaccine stealing then talk about your own self. Israel has conducted a deal with a company. That's called a market dear communist. Perhaps the failed EU should have made better and earlier deals, perhaps the EU should have not skimped on investing in vaccine manufacturing and production.

Yeah, plenty of sources detailing stuff happening in one city to prove your generalisation of the entire country. Fantastic. How intelligent. 

Do you want me to keep repeating what I say?  Give a proper answer. You keep saying stuff that I have already replied too.



&gt;Those articles are mostly reports from one city during 2 time periods spanning a couple of days each, one in June and the other around September. More articles from foreign websites than local Indian media. And our media is free to report on whatever they want. 

&gt;India isn't one city and generalising one city's situation to the rest of the country is absolutely incorrect. 

&gt;And the situation for the most part had been decent apart from those 2 time periods. How do I know this? Because I actually live in that city and had to get myself treated for a stomach infection in December.

There does not appear to be much difference between the contracts that pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca signed with the United Kingdom and the European Union. That's according to a comparison between the two contracts, which was possible because the British contract is online. Now it appears that the British are subject to the same condition as the EU. Moreover, Europe signed the contract with AstraZeneca a day earlier. This contradicts what the company previously claimed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

The American news channel CNN reported this morning that the coveted contract had been tacitly online for months. For a long time, journalists and EU policymakers have been asking for the UK contract with AstraZeneca to be made public. 

&amp;#x200B;

Indeed, Pascal Soriot, the CEO of AstraZeneca had said in interviews that the contract with the European Union did not include a contractual obligation to supply vaccines, but only a clause to act ""to the best of their ability."" That is, they must make the necessary efforts, but it does not contain any hard obligations to fulfill the promises.

&amp;#x200B;

The vaccine manufacturer announced in late January that it could deliver 60 percent fewer vaccines to the EU than promised. The European Commission was criticized that this reduced delivery was due to this clause. Geert Bourgeois (NV-A) and Guy Verhofstadt (Open VLD) also criticized the mere effort commitment in the EU contract in recent weeks. They blamed Europe for not negotiating hard enough, unlike the British. The same clause now appears to be in the British contract. 

&amp;#x200B;

How exactly does AstraZeneca's corona vaccine and that of the other manufacturers work? And what are the pros and cons? Our science journalist Koen Wauters explains it clearly in this video:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

First come, first served?

The Commission was upset and suspected AstraZeneca of giving the British priority. Soriot responded that the problem lay with the two separate production lines. The British would get the vaccines from their two UK plants and the EU from the two plants in the Netherlands and Belgium. The top executive believed that Europe was unlucky that the latter two factories had production problems ahead of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The newly discovered contract states that the British will receive vaccines from five production sites, although the locations of these plants have been omitted. So there is a good chance that factories located in continental Europe also supplied vaccines to the UK.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Soriot, the UK had contracted with his company much earlier, which would have given it more and faster vaccines. It now appears that Europe had already signed a contract with AstraZeneca a day sooner than the British. Although the manufacturer defends itself in a reaction to the Dutch Public Broadcasting (NOS) with the argument that it had already reached an agreement with the UK in May, which meant that a production chain could be started there earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

The company guaranteed to both players that other contracts would not hinder the execution. It remains unclear why the British received more vaccines than the EU.

Again a westerner who is drawing up my entire life on the basis of one sentence. Sad. Really sad. You can do better.


&gt;I've quoted and sent links to articles from respected publications including broadsheet newspapers and medical journals. You have your gut feeling and your maid and cook's word for it. You're deluded.

Well, you want to call a website which sources the Indian version of English trashy Tabloid reputable? 

I guess, I am actually privileged in terms of intellectuality. Never thought my Indian education would one day help me surpass a person with an European education. 

Doesn't Europe have great education skills? Guess there are exceptions everywhere.
.

&gt;You out of all the people are going to tell me about privilege? A white European talking about privilege? A person who's probably not even visited India is telling an Indian about privilege.  

&gt;You are busy here invalidating my experiences because your condescending sad attitude is telling you that India can't handle well. You have some predetermined stereotypes in your head and are busy assuming what I can and cannot do. 

&gt;Your entire point is quoting foreign press who only concentrate on one or two cities or taking the word of one dude.

&gt;Do you know what happens when there are massive deaths and overflowing hospitals across the country? 

&gt;Big local media coverage. Journalists constantly talking about it. Huge political party storm where each and everyone is blamed. 

&gt;That's what happened in Delhi for a couple of days in June and the latter part of the year. 

&gt;Not a bunch of western newspapers talking about how bad India is with very little local coverage. 

&gt;Where are the trucks carrying the dead out of the city? Where are the very frequent reports of Hospitals being overrun across India? 

Keep reading. You might want to improve your comprehension skills. 


&gt;I have heard plenty of accounts from people about the economic difficulties people faced due to the strict lockdown. I keep talking to people from far off places. And I actually live in India. The economic difficulties far outpace the pain from Covid. 

Please read.

&gt;*The genuinely remarkable thing is that the New York Times, the US’s most prestigious newspaper, has devoted considerable resources to investigating why China didn’t address the pandemic even more quickly and effectively than it did (FAIR.org, 10/14/20,  1/20/21). These exposés of China’s “missteps” generally boil down to Beijing not taking the virus seriously enough before January 23, 2020, when it put the entire city of Wuhan in quarantine—at which point the virus had been implicated in 17 deaths.*

&gt;*The Times‘ specifying “the United States and other democracies” as the group of countries China is comparing itself to is a bit of a red herring. While it’s true that many US allies weathered the pandemic as poorly as the US did, there are several wealthy countries with multi-party political systems that did far better—including New Zealand, South Korea, Australia, Japan, Iceland, Norway and Finland. So the disparity is not so much between “authoritarian” states and “democracies,” as the Times suggests, as between countries that took the coronavirus seriously and those that didn’t.*

&gt;*Too good or not good enough, China’s coronavirus response is an obsession of the New York Times. On January 25, the front page of the Times‘ print edition was dominated by an ominous above-the-fold photo of people in protective gear behind police tape reading “DO NOT CROSS,” with a caption headline “Another Wave of Covid-19 Hits Hong Kong.” This “wave” consisted of residents of Hong Kong (population 7.5 million) coming down with Covid at the rate of 75 a day—whereas in New York City (population 8.4 million), people are catching it at the rate of about 4,000 a day. But the context that Hong Kong’s outbreak was roughly 1/50th as bad as what’s considered business as usual in the Times‘ hometown was entirely missing from the scary photo and caption on the paper’s front page.*

&gt;*Why make a relatively tiny outbreak of the coronavirus on the other side of the world front-page news at the New York Times? Like Donald Trump, the paper is certainly aware of the propaganda value of pointing to China as a scary danger—as illustrated by an ostensibly unrelated story adjacent on the same front page, with the print headline “US Counters Space Threat From China.” In that article, a gaggle of retired generals, now at weapons industry–funded think tanks, used Beijing to make the case that maybe Space Force wasn’t such a wacky idea after all.*

US media don't get to hide behind ""but we didn't lie, we're just reporting other people's lies"" when they act as propaganda multipliers. They don't get to pretend to have journalistic integrity when they manufacture narratives and omit key information relative to what they presented (see: Hong Kong's ""wave"" of 75 infected a day versus NYC then suffering 4000 a day).

&gt;*China does it America does it Russia does it every nation does it.*

Tell me when the US as a whole gets labelled as liars for something one of its elected officials said, like this CNN article labels the entire Chinese government or the entirety of China.",,,1613717372,{},gnzcw24,False,t3_lmw1vz,False,True,t1_gnzazey,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lmw1vz/as_the_who_investigated_coronavirus_origins_in/gnzcw24/,1613718345,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In a nutshell:

The Pfizer vaccine is good for 10 days from time of origin doing nothing but sitting on the floor in its original shipping container, and after that it remains usable for a further 5 days at very normal fridge temperatures.

The first 10 days can be extended to 30 days by refilling the container with dry ice every 5 days, starting on day 10.

That's it.  That's all there is to it.

With stable, ""omg cold"" freezers, the Pfizer vaccine can be stored for six months.

But if we're sitting on this stuff for more than two weeks we're already doing something very wrong and storage conditions have nothing to do with it.

&gt;However, our key results are not the total YLL but YLL ratios and YLL  distributions which are relatively robust to the co-morbidity bias.  Indeed, this bias also applies to the YLL calculations for the seasonal  influenza or heart disease. Thus, the ratio of YLL for COVID-19 compared  to other causes of death is more robust to the co-morbidity bias than  the estimate on the level of YLL as the biases are present in both the  numerator and the denominator.

A official apology that can't be walked back, and US officials explicitly pointing out which lies were spewed under the previous administration and clarifying why they were lies.

&gt;Those dying from COVID-19 may be an at-risk population whose remaining life expectancy is shorter than the average person’s remaining life expectancy[16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83040-3#ref-CR16),[17](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83040-3#ref-CR17),[18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83040-3#ref-CR18). This methodological concern is likely to be valid, and consequently our estimate of the total YLL due to COVID-19 may be an overestimate.

Which essentially means that they understand their methods aren't very useful except to provide an overestimate of YLL.

&gt;However, our key results are not the total YLL but YLL ratios and YLL distributions which are relatively robust to the co-morbidity bias. Indeed, this bias also applies to the YLL calculations for the seasonal influenza or heart disease. Thus, the ratio of YLL for COVID-19 compared to other causes of death is more robust to the co-morbidity bias than the estimate on the level of YLL as the biases are present in both the numerator and the denominator. 

I take this section to be an effort to save face. They're saying that they know the YLL is inflated, but it's not that big of a deal because they declare that the YLL isn't the key finding of this study. The YLL ratios and distributions are the key findings, according to the authors. I would have taken this argument in good faith, except that they titled their paper ""Years of life lost to COVID-19 in 81 countries"". It is uncommon to title a paper using anything but your key metric.

&gt;Likewise, the age- and gender distributions of YLL would suffer from serious co-morbidity bias only if these factors vary strongly across the age or gender spectrum.

In my opinion, this sentence dampens the argument laid out in the previous three because there is little reason to believe that there isn't a strong variance.

Yes, I read the article. I believe I understood it, and I'm not misrepresenting the methods. That is the methodology that they used to establish the YLL metric.

Once lab testing is complete, the new vaccine could move to clinical trials – but a timeline is still in the works and the research is still very early.

They could maybe do one or two an hour and it would be pandemonium with a line out the door of people waiting to pick up their Rxs, waiting for consults, etc. 

With time to staff up and plan it out, sure, it could run smoother. But meanwhile, I've been volunteering at vaccine drives at my county fairgrounds, and it could not be more efficient.

But, to dive in... 

1. There's no practical way to determine someone's risk factor from employment with this level of subtlety in a way that isn't horribly abused. With age or weight there is empirical evidence. For example here in California vaccine sites are determining whether you qualify as a medical worker by asking you if you work closely with patients. They're determining if you qualify as 65+ by looking at your ID. Which one is more airtight? What happens when we expand this eligibility to other professions? How are those professions defined? CDPH defines education worker so broadly you could drive a bus through their definition.

Yes, obviously, but how does this relate to my point?  Are you saying a double mask on one party is less effective than single masks on two parties?

Not really a drastic change though.  It's basically saying ""we've discovered a way for masks to protect the user, so we are no longer mandating mask wearing for those who want to take that personal risk

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The best option is to just stick with what works for the remaining 9-12 months of this pandemic, and that’s everyone wearing masks. 

Right, because we all know it's been working so well so far.  People wearing useless neck gaiters, wearing masks under their nose, or just not wearing one at all.

I mean, that doesn't really tell the whole story.

While I definitely agree that vaccine plans aren't perfect and it sounds like the above guy should be receiving some level of priority, I think it's a bit presumptuous to say they should just open it up to all.

That county may have a higher rate of elderly (and other high priority individuals) than the national average. Maybe the county has a higher rate of non-acceptance than the national average. 

Nationally, we've put first vaccinations in like 15% of people.  It wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility for a county to be at double the national average.  So, let's say 30%.  And we'll say that 40% of eligible people said no.  That would put us up at 50% of the population who has already been worked through, so we have 30k in the current phase to work.  By opening to everyone, you've now tripled the elgible folks.  Put it in that light and it looks like it's targeted doesn't it?

It does seem a bit crazy that an area could have already worked through 50% of it's population, but so does have 2/3 of the population being eligible for vaccination so it wouldn't surprise me if they had some crazy demographics in this county that would have shoved a lot of people to high priority.",,,1613751731,{},go0q7tt,False,t3_lmwjni,False,True,t1_gnyvwe3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lmwjni/grocery_store_workers_have_been_on_the_front/go0q7tt/,1613752298,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There has been confusion about my posts, thinking that I'm anti-restrictions or whatever. Actually, I've been getting it from both sides.

The virus is serious business.  It kills people.  It makes people sick for a long time. Some people lose their sense of smell/taste. Some people don't get sick at all, but we have *no idea* who or why. Yes, I'm ignoring the age distribution stuff here, but we know that people of every age *can* get really sick.  I really don't want a loss of smell or taste to happen to me.  That's what keeps me motivated to mask up and distance.  I don't think you should ignore the danger of the virus, *at all*. 

Just because you've decided not to distance or follow the rules, doesn't mean that you get to make that decision for other people too.  Respect their choices, even if they're *terrible* choices.  You can be *so ignorant, on purpose, just to spite me* and there's nothing I can do about it. Some people have chosen to stop distancing once they're vaccinated, and that's fine, so long as they respect other people's choices.

The virus wasn't made in a lab.  That's conspiracy theory garbage, and you know it.  Even if it was made in a lab, so what? Who cares? What does that do for you?  What does that do for humanity, or our ability to fight the virus, or the people who've lost a loved one? Nothing but spread hate. Give it up.  

If you think this is me ""defending"" China, you're beyond help.

About me - I'm not ""anti-lockdown"" or ""pro-lockdown"".  In the US, I don't think we've had a ""lockdown"", we've just had restrictions, and minimal ones at that. If we had had a lockdown like in NZ or China, I do think we'd be in a better place (fewer deaths). On the other hand I'm not *totally* convinced that they are as effective as some people think. I encourage people to ""follow the rules"" or guidelines or whatever.  Masking up is so easy, and yeah, it can suck, but just do it until you don't have to anymore.  I'm ""pro-mask"" but only to a point. They do seem to work, for a myriad of reasons. Double masking is dumb, but the idea comes from good intentions. Experts are [trying their hardest, heck, trying EVERYTHING they can](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/llsmnp/singledomain_sarscov2_s1_and_rbd_antibodies/) to protect people from a deadly virus.

Any answer you get that is either ""yes"" or ""no"" is wrong, for now. We have only ""maybe, probably not"", and it's going to be that way for a long time.

In order to answer the question scientifically, it would require a ""challenge study"" where both vaccinated and unvaccinated people are deliberately exposed to the virus to see if transmission occurs.

The ethical concerns of deliberate exposure prevent us from performing these studies in humans.  It's the same reason that the vaccine trials took so long, we can't deliberately infect people to see if they need hospitalization or die. 

(EDIT: Well, now it looks like I [spoke too soon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/llw5cu/worlds_first_coronavirus_human_challenge_study/))

However, we did these studies in hamsters, and the results looked pretty bad. They were able to spread it. But hamsters greet each other by touching noses like all the time. Humans don't really do that (do you?). So we did similar studies with monkeys and the results look really good.

Also, you'll notice that any reputable person talking about this subject always says ""may be able to spread"", or ""maybe"", or ""we don't know if"". And that's because there is a small chance that vaccinated people will be able to spread the virus. But it's not a big chance. Doctors, scientists, and regulators are being very careful with their language on this subject, some would argue they're being too careful. That said, if they were to say that ""vaccinated people cannot spread the virus"", and then we find out that in some situations that vaccinated people have spread the virus, that would end up worse for them than if they hedge for a while. So at least to me, the way they're framing it seems pretty reasonable, you just have to put yourself in their shoes.

That said, they seem to be [saying what I've been saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s). Said saying. Saying Said?

Just because [mRNA vaccines aren't 100% effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/)  against the SA variant, *doesn't* [mean that we'll definitely need boosters](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gmu581s/).

**Spike mutation analogy:**

The spike protein is coded by 3,831 base pairs.  What does that mean?

Well, it's like a lego sculpture where you have 3,831 words in the instructions for how to build it, and the writer had to be super-detailed when explaining each motion and piece.    

In this analogy, your immune system makes lego pieces (antibodies) that can attach to any pair of exposed bumps on the lego sculpture.  We'll say there are 40 pairs exposed in this example.

A variant is when the instructions change by just one or more words.  Sometimes the photocopier for the instructions page gets a tiny smudge.  This could be really bad sometimes, especially if it's a critical word or phrase, like ""left"" or ""repeat six times"" or a description of a particularly detailed lego piece. Color might not always matter, but size would.

Out of those 3,831 words, how many have to change so much that every one of those 40 spots is no longer there?  It's probably a lot.

But wait, how many words have to change to make the whole sculpture really different, so that it doesn't work as a sculpture anymore?  Really not that many if they're in the right spots, right?  This is why most variants suck at being viruses; it's rare that a mistake would make the instructions *better*.

**Which vaccine should I get?**

When someone asks me what my favorite beer is, the answer is always the same.

It's the one in front of me.

So get the first vaccine you can, the differences are pretty minor.

**Booster questions to think about, I don't have answers**

(note: there's a difference between ""boost"" and ""booster"" here that needs to be understood.)

(also, what's the term for a mixture of sequences, heterogenous? Is my doubt about this term just from overthinking?)

(also also, I'm not convinced we're definitely going to need boosters, this is just fun to think about.)

Could a booster shot replace the second dose of a prime/boost regimen?

Should a booster shot use only one sequence of mRNA (or have all identical spike proteins), or should it have both/multiple?

For future vaccines, should the sequence/spike be the same for prime/boost or different?  If you have four spikes/sequences, would it make more sense to do two in each, or all four in each?

How much should we trust mutation modeling here? Should we anticipate future mutations and include them?  Are we good enough at that yet?

Do we need to give any non-booster doses to people who have recovered from infection?

Could we ""stretch"" doses of an mRNA booster by priming with a vaccine that's easier to manufacture, but maybe less effective (like ChAdOx1), and boost with the mRNA booster?  Could it be better or faster to prime with a current mRNA sequence and boost with an updated ChAdOx1?  

[**Conclusions**](https://gfycat.com/cleantalkativedassie)

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms.  This currently seems to also be true with post vaccination infection with any of the known variants. We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well. 

In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections and symptoms in those who do get infected. Therefore, vaccines should reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing an infection, each subsequent variant they are exposed to will just broaden their immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). So they'll have good and broad immunity to a variety of variants, which seems likely to be an indication that they won't catch or spread the virus as well in the future. Same thing happens when someone who is vaccinated is exposed to a new variant. Their immunity is broadened and strengthened by each subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. But remember, so many people will be less likely to spread the virus, so it's pretty unlikely that this reduced level of spread will be sufficient to sustain the virus in the way we have seen over the past year. So if a variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. If they don't become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing to have my mind changed on this with new information though, so don't take this as gospel. 

Tips on clarifying my terms/language/understanding appreciated.  Did I miss something that could help people? Please let me know!

If it wasn't safe and [effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/li9jg8/it_works_0_deaths_only_4_severe_cases_among/), they wouldn't be paying thousands for shots.

[Seriously,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4pnde/mrna1273_vaccine_induces_neutralizing_antibodies/) it's [very probably](https://reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l6vs1t/in_vitro_studies_demonstrate_pfizer_and/), like, [not going to be a problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l0yqe6/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gjwov3s?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) Yes, even the SA variant, [which might not be a concern at all.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kxkrb9/endemic_sarscov2_will_maintain_postpandemic/) The more vaccines we test, the more we find that they still [work against the variants](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lax5wa/neutralization_of_sarscov2_voc_501yv2_by_human/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), at least enough to be totally worthwhile. 

ChAdOx1 (Oxford/Astrazeneca) may not be so great against the SA variant, and we have a lot to learn here.  Novavax's vaccine also may have issues with the SA strain, though it doesn't seem that they're as big as with ChAdOx1. 

Pfizer [seems fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lf7uph/neutralization_of_viruses_with_european_south/) against the troubling variants, at least in the lab. At the very least, the mRNA vaccines [*still* work](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfp89k/neutralization_of_sarscov2_spike_6970_deletion/) on the three most worrying variants.

Still worried about variants? Check [this out!](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/27/vaccination-against-the-new-variants-real-world-data) *

Most variants aren't great at being viruses.  [Some, including that one mink variant have already gone extinct](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/19/danish-covid-mink-variant-very-likely-extinct-but-controversial-cull-continues). I think there are other Mink variants that have made it into wild Mink populations.

Vaccine induced immunity is [comparable to](https://www.verywellhealth.com/antibodies-from-vaccines-and-from-natural-infection-5092564), or [better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l5whhu/increased_resistance_of_sarscov2_variants_b1351/) immunity from a previous infection. Especially [variants of concern.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgxpre/vaccineinduced_immunity_provides_more_robust/)

Post infection immunity lasts [*at least 8 months*](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/koxkm1/sarscov2_infection_induces_longlived_bone_marrow/), though [probably a lot longer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/klpvp7/sarscov2specific_t_cell_memory_is_longlasting_in/)  Again, [*at least* 8 months, though you may not even really need very many antibodies,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ldj06f/immunological_memory_to_sarscov2_assessed_for_up/) since other types of immunity seem to be more important.  It's too soon to say ""lifelong"" but [that is a possibility.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4nkco/the_immune_system_mounts_a_lasting_defense_after/) Also, it looks like those who have recovered *may* only need [one dose of an mRNA vaccine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/labst4/robust_spike_antibody_responses_and_increased/). There are some people (~7%) who don't develop lasting immunity from infections. 

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l9nfu8/stable_neutralizing_antibody_levels_six_months/) probably a lot,[ lot longer,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/)  probably many years. 

The OG SARS virus from 2003 gave detectable immunity [both 6](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/12/7264) and [12 years later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kvbz9y/weekly_question_thread/gizs32j/)   

Covid19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, OG SARS was caused by SARS-CoV. Looks like both came from bats.  [They’re 79% the same.](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930251-8) (PDF)

This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a heavy reduction in ability to spread the virus. [Maybe with just one dose!](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242)

Multiple [studies using monkeys](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03041-6) show strong immunity, or [sterilizing immunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/la4fud/immunogenic_bnt162b_vaccines_protect_rhesus/) from multiple vaccine types.  It's unlikely that sterilizing immunity would be found in 100% of vaccinated humans, if we even get sterilizing immunity at all. This is still good news.

I didn't say anything about the order in which people should be vaccinated, but simply that the only way out of this is to get enough people vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.

Why would you expect there to be? We haven't been doing this for long enough to have long term data. 

The clinical trials were based upon two doses, so at the moment the most robust evidence we have in the medium term relates to that protocol.

I didn't suggest that it wouldn't change the situation, but if R0 is close to 5 then a very high proportion of the population needs to be vaccinated with a highly effective vaccine to get R below unity. That's just basic mathematics.

The UK’s decision to administer the vaccines in an off-label dosage regimen could just as easily have promoted additional development or harmful strains by applying evolutionary pressure to the virus, if the protection was partial but not complete.  There is still a possibility that the decision to approve the lower-efficacy AZ vaccine may actually be doing this.

I'm starting to feel comfortable from a *logical* standpoint, but that means nothing compared to how I feel after all of this shit. I got my first haircut in a long time last week. It felt so nice to feel like a human and not be afraid that I was killing someone by going outside. Obviously, masks on by everyone, limited capacity in the barber shop, etc. But fuck me if I was terrified the whole time because that's how life has been for so long. I think that I'll be alright because I have a support group around me that I trust who will help me get back to going to bars and concerts this summer, but without that support group I'd be exactly like these people.

We estimate a serial interval of about 5 days (not 14), so a decline of new infections by 40% over a 5 day period would indicate R=0.6.  The inaccuracy comes because we don't know infection days for cases, so we usually assign an R value based on today's cases, which would only be an estimate for new infections of 10-14 days ago. 

The US 7-day average of new cases has dropped from from 96.5k to 74.0k over the last 5 days, implying R~0.77.  Since January 13 (when cases first started dropping) we've fallen from a rolling 251k case average, or R~0.84 over that timeline.  As far as I can tell R is still dropping in the US.

For the UK it appears to be rising though, and I don't see how 0.6 is possible.  The rolling case average has only fallen by 13% (R~0.87) over the last 5 days, compared to dropping 24% (R~0.76) over January 25-30.

Certainly the models are going to be more advanced and try to avoid the problems with just using a 7-day weekly average (which itself avoids day-of-week problems where cases don't get reported on weekends, but does still have 3-day-weekend problems).  But the overall method is the same.

Europe is very concerned about a variant beating the vaccines.

Remember: if a mutation hinders transmissibility even the slightest (eg by a spike mutation) but confers vaccine resistance (eg by a spike mutation) it will appear just as noise in the data *until* vaccines are widespread.

It's why they're doing so much genomic surveillance at this point and trying to minimise the size of the vaccinated vs infected front - the more you ""open up"" to maximise hospital usage at the same time as you roll out vaccines, the more chances you are giving for vaccine escape.

Well, you suggested not hiring from one group. You had also agreed that the military was important. At that point, you had NOT yet suggested downsizing.

In addition, the increased production of reactive oxygen species seen in several mtDNA diseases could lead to the epigenetic modification of the nuclear genome, including chromatin remodelling and alterations to DNA methylation and microRNA expression, thus contributing to the diverse pathophysiology observed in this group of diseases. These observations open the door to future studies investigating the role of mtDNA methylation in human disease.

[How effective is a single dose](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210114-covid-19-how-effective-is-a-single-vaccine-dose). Good article with plenty of discussion and stats for the various vaccines. The main thing is there isn't data for how long immunity lasts with just 1 shot for studies. MMR vaccine shot is pretty similar in terms of effectiveness for doses, with 1 giving like 80% and 2 95% (Edit before I post, the 80% was for one those 3 but the article even mentions MMR and gives stats lol). 


My wife is a MD and has been mostly guessing all along that it'll probably become like the yearly flu shot. Get a yearly booster for the most common strains since it'll most likely never go away. ALSO, in those studies the ""effectiveness"" is different... *For one, the Israeli study found that a single dose of the vaccine reduced the number of people testing positive for the virus, i.e. being infected, by 33%, while the Pfizer paper suggested that it would prevent 52% from developing symptoms – they looked at two different things.* IIRC the Johnson and Johnson vaccine looks at ""symptoms"".

&gt;""Even if you wait six months, that's often what gives the best results in terms of long-term protection,"" said Kobinger, who helped develop a vaccine for Ebola and is involved in Quebec City-based Medicago's COVID-19 vaccine effort. 

&gt;That's because vaccines are calculated to stimulate an immune response, in effect teaching the body how to recognize and eradicate a particular virus. Boosters are like a refresher course. Another benefit: spacing out doses can also help reduce side effects.

&gt;Kobinger said there are multiple recent examples of dose-splitting, like the Yellow Fever epidemic in Africa in the last decade. In that case, doses were sometimes broken up into four smaller doses in order to reach more people. 

&gt; ""Studies afterward confirmed it was the right thing to do because the protection was still there,"" he said.

The crux of it is here, and the fact that the rate of profit was beginning to fall. The ‘deal’ wasn’t reneged upon so much as there was never any intention of following through. The post-war boom was over and we had rebuilt our allies to the point where we had to compete against them.

Of course there’s no return to ‘making things’ in America, without a total restructure of the global financial system.

Every time an incoming traveller brings in covid and it gets out of quarantine hotel, and a state goes into lockdown to contain it, people’s lives suffer in various ways. Children are socially isolated. Vulnerable adults become suicidal. Businesses fall deeper into the red. People lose jobs. People can’t get the help they need medically or emotionally. I gave birth during lockdown and couldn’t have any visitors. This was, in the scheme of things, a minor sacrifice, but not being able to introduce my newborn to her grandparents and aunties and uncles for months was heartbreaking. 

Melbourne was in lockdown for 111 days to contain an outbreak that emerged from a quarantine hotel. A lot of people’s lives suffered, all in the name of trying to prevent masses of deaths. We are doing it hard here in Australia to try to stop the disease from doing what it has done to other countries. There is a communal feeling of each of us having worked extremely hard to achieve this, and not wanting to fuck it up now. If you lockdown for 111 days, you don’t want to then end up with a massive outbreak and thwart all your efforts. 

Nobody is doing this too you - the government has not forgotten you and your fellow Australians do care about you. We want you home. We want you safe. But there is no way to make that happen easily as of yet with the current risks of this pandemic.

The idea is that when you pull the dose out of the vial with a new syringe, you should also pull some air from inside the via along with it. You do so by first pulling (aspirating) the liquid vaccine from the vial. Once you have the correct volume of vaccine in, you then move the end of the needle into the sterile air inside the vial and aspirate a little bit of that.

You keep track of the volumes by the position of the plunger and the scale on the side of the syringe.

When you inject the vaccine, you do so in a position such that the syringe is vertical (eg position the arm) so that the air bubble at the top is the last thing that gets pushed out. 

Thus when the plunger is in the fully dispensed position, there is air in the needle instead of wasted vaccine.

It’s the difference between drawing 1.1 mL of vaccine to be able to dispense 1.0 mL with 0.1 mL of vaccine stuck in the syringe, and drawing 1.0 mL of vaccine plus 0.1 mL of air and leaving the sterile air in the syringe instead.

(Numbers made up for simplicity).

The process takes a little longer to prepare each syringe, but it increases the doses available by reducing wastage.",,,1613699329,{},gnyiuwz,False,t3_lmocue,False,True,t1_gnyac86,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lmocue/pfizer_states_56_doses_in_a_vaccine_vial_a/gnyiuwz/,1613704654,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Over 30% even have less than $1.25 per day available - they are considered extremely poor. This makes the Indian subcontinent one of the poorest countries in the world; women and children, the weakest members of Indian society, suffer most.](https://www.soschildrensvillages.ca/news/poverty-in-india-602)

This is why you as a 'middle class' person can afford both a cook and a maid, because of the extreme poverty the vast majority of your country lives in. That you seem to have no idea about how well off you are comparatively is pitiful. You should be ashamed.

&gt; Led by Dr Arun N Madhavan, a general medicine physician, they checked the district editions of seven local newspapers and followed five news channels unfailingly every day. They took notes on every death reported in the news and obituary notices and diligently entered the details in a spreadsheet. ""It's a useful method of counting,"" says Prabhat Jha, of the University of Toronto, who led India's ambitious Million Death Study, one of the largest studies of premature mortality in the world.

&gt; As of Thursday night, the volunteers had counted 3,356 deaths from the infection in Kerala, which reported its first Covid-19 case in January and the first casualty in March. But the official death toll from the disease is 1,969.

&gt; ""We are missing a lot of Covid-19 deaths here,"" Dr Madhavan told me. He reckons the state has recognised a little more than half of the deaths caused by Covid - and attributed the rest to underlying conditions or co-morbidities.

&gt; India's tally of recorded coronavirus cases exceeds 8.9 million, the second-highest in the world behind the US. It has reported more than 130,000 deaths from the infection but the case fatality rate or CFR, which measures deaths among Covid-19 patients, is below 1.5%, among the lowest in the world.

&gt; Some experts believe that India's relatively low fatality rate doesn't tell the whole story and allege substantial undercounting in several states. They say suspected cases are not being added to the final count, and deaths from the infection are being carelessly attributed to underlying conditions.

&gt; It is striking that Kerala, which has claimed data transparency and has an exhaustive and detailed official Covid-19 dashboard, has been undercounting deaths. Dr Madhavan believes under-reporting is rampant. Patients who tested negative ""just before they died"" and did not belong to Kerala were not counted. Three patients - all men, aged between 65 and 78 - came to his clinic with symptoms and died in hospital in October during treatment. ""Their deaths didn't come up in the media or the official count. All of us are missing deaths, but the government is missing them the most,"" he said.

&gt; Rajeev Sadanandan, a top health bureaucrat who is advising the government on handling the pandemic, admits there has been ""some"" under-reporting of deaths. ""We did not count cases who were suffering from terminal or renal diseases and were found to be infected with Covid-19. That was wrong.

Now I have to repeat myself.


&gt;Those articles are mostly reports from one city during 2 time periods spanning a couple of days each, one in June and the other around September. More articles from foreign websites than local Indian media. And our media is free to report on whatever they want. 

&gt;India isn't one city and generalising one city's situation to the rest of the country is absolutely incorrect. 

Keep reading this over and over again. Don't reply until you can actually comprehend it. 


&gt;And the situation for the most part had been decent apart from those 2 time periods. How do I know this? Because I actually live in that city and had to get myself treated for a stomach infection in December. 

Keep reading. I can copy it many times to help you read. 

&gt;There is absolutely no evidence to suggest there is massive nationwide underreporting of deaths. My Maid and my cook, the former hailing from the poor state of Uttar Pradesh and the latter hailing from Jharkhand have both not received any news of massive deaths across their villages. 

&gt;Between my own experiences telling me something and a foreigner claiming the contrary, I would believe my experiences.

Read it again and again. 

The irony here is, a white European man living thousands of kilometres who has probably never visited the country is invalidating the experiences of an Indian who's living here his entire life because he assumed that someone who employs other people can't say what's happening on the ground.

I don't think that we are at 70% exposure just yet although there is the chance that some people are either naturally immune or naturally do not get very sick. If we had 40% exposure and 10-20% natural immunity plus 10-15% vaccinations we might be close to 70%. This would explain the precipitous drop in cases that started a few weeks ago.

I think we also need to account for the fact that the fatality counts aren't 100% accurate. This is a whole topic in itself but the way fatalities have been counted has changed in different areas, and despite best efforts I am sure there is some variance in there. This is not to allege some kind of conspiracy like a lot of people say but I wonder how they could possibly count them accurately. Add to this the fact that about 40% of fatalities occur in nursing homes where there are already 1000-2000 fatalities per day. We could be significant over or under counting that.

I feel that in the future when some more patient analysis of this is done they will find that Covid had a fatality rate of around 0.25% which is 100 to 1000 times higher in certain populations (elderly with health conditions) and 100 to 1000 times lower in others (young and healthy), and the largest problem with it was how contagious and difficult to detect it was.

It probably doesn't wane from 92% to 15% at day 50 or anything but it could very well wane enough at 12 weeks to be a concern.  Until you get data on that, you are guessing/assuming.  Also, it was very clear in phase I/II trials that antibody levels after a booster were significantly higher in the mRNA vaccines.  Any place going with *only* a single dose is making a very risky move.  A *delayed* second dose is probably less risky, but 12 weeks without any data to support it seems fairly risky as well.

In the US, changing policy now is a big gamble.  If we are mere weeks away from a surge in supply then you are talking about something like 20 million additional first doses, but you also have to consider how a change in policy based on incomplete data would influence the substantial group of people who are borderline hesitant about the vaccine because they feel there's not been enough time/data.  Would that make them hesitate further enough to offset the 20 million people who get it a few weeks earlier?  Who knows, but it's a gamble.

This isn't a realistic solution.  How do you think we could have focused more on protecting the most vulnerable?

It didn't stop the virus from spreading like wildfire among those people anyway.  This is because the risk situation changes when you're dealing with a highly contagious threat; it doesn't work like ""50% of people isolate, 50% take risks, only the 50% who take risks get infected"".  It's more like the Pareto type of distribution where if a small fraction like 20% take risks it greatly increases the danger to everyone else.  Trying to box out the population like that and saying ""only you guys need to isolate, let the other people be responsible for themselves"" simply isn't going to be effective.

I also dislike the idea of codifying some kind of age discrimination into law, like mandatory isolation if you're above some age but no restrictions otherwise.

For a government to be pro-science, it isn't required that it fund all scientific projects. I see no contradiction between a regime being pro-science, while feeling that research into finding the cure for baldness should be left up to the private sector to fund and do.

But here is the part you stubbornly don't get. If that regime all of a sudden decides that baldness is a gift from God, and so makes research into baldness illegal, and arrests and murders scientists who study baldness, then guess what? That regime is anti-science. It doesn't matter if that regime otherwise has a space program. The fact that the regime used violence against even just some scientists, to actively stiffle science, makes them anti-science.

Again, it isn't that authoritarian regimes don't actively support and fund all scientists and intellectuals.

On another note I think there is this sense of dread, not totally about the shot itself, but about the financial implications for people who don’t get it (or mainly can’t get it yet) businesses could not allow them inside and thus force them to pay more for products and delivery costs, which stinks because lots of people aren’t exactly making a ton of money right now. In a way it could be argued that it would create an additional “tax” on top of goods, or outright denial of services, as a result of a situation out of their control (being shots simply not available to them yet). Making different people pay different prices for access to the same products or services at the very least does push us down the road towards a discrimination case.

I would sign up for a study that gave me 50/50 chance at getting a 1-dose versus 2-dose regimen.

As far as the storage temperatures, the manufacturers have been experimenting with this probably since the beginning of the trials, and they could afford to take their time and gather months worth of data, rather than weeks, precisely because everyone was willing to move Heaven and Earth to make the more complicated logistic chain work while they figured out if it was necessary.

This obviously has false positives and negatives, such as someone that was not tested, or someone that died of something clearly unrelated like a car accident. This change caused their numbers to be revised downwards, but were they over counting before, or under counting now?

The average time between admittance and death in a nursing home is about 5 to 13 months and the average covid fatality had 3 other serious health conditions. I just don't see how you can determine this accurately. And there are anecdotes of someone with the flu dying of a heart attack and it being called a heart attack, and someone with covid dying of a heart attack and it being called covid. I am sure this happens all over.

If we have 35-40% of the population exposed I would expect this to be higher in certain areas, like population centers and specific locations within those population centers like grocery stores. Like I would expect that a large majority of grocery store workers have been exposed. If people like this are the primary way that the virus spreads and are now immune then the spread would be disproportionately decreased.

It's interesting too that the case counts are declining almost everywhere but vaccination is only widespread in a few countries.

The way I've been thinking about it that a virus will spread pretty unabated when there's no population immunity and then slow down as more and more people have antibodies (or vaccinations in this case). This causes cases to slow down and the rate of acquiring new antibodies does as well. 

But then when there's a change in the environment (i.e. winter seasons) that allows for more transmission, the virus can pick up it's spread again. When the environment becomes less favorable to transmission, the conditions are back to regular favorability for spread, but the virus is up against an even larger immunity.

How long can you delay the doses while keeping protected from the first dose (how long does the first dose protection last) and without negatively affecting the 2nd doses boost to immunogenicity.  There's a growing consensus that the 42 day mark is safe to delay it to.   The 90 days is riskier.   Will still probably work out, but it's a little bit bigger risk.   

Second, with the South African variant out there, and other variants out there that seem to have a level of escape from vaccine immunity, how much protection does 1 shot provide against it?   Pfizer has stated the SA variant produces 2/3rd less of an immune system response for its vaccine (immunogenicity) but thinks it's still high enough of a response to neutralize it (in other words, the previous immonugenicity was overkill, they think -- thus why 1 dose provides protection).  The Booster/2nd dose is usually responsible for boosting immunogenicity considerably (I haven't looked at Pfizer, but I know for AstraZeneca, it's upwards of 4 times -- but the response is actually greater with the longer delay -- but that's also a longer time of the lower immune response after 1 dose then).   So, will a single dose provide protection at all from these variants?

Generally speaking, vaccines given after/during infection have some chance of success if it was given before symptom onset.

In Covid's case, the vaccine might help the people with long incubation periods and probably have no effect on the people with short ones. However, if a person is known to be positive, they should not visit a vaccination center and expose other people there. If they already have symptoms, the vaccine will not help them at all.

Napkin math, the US has 328million people. About 1/3 are kids for whom the vaccine probably won't be approved until late 2021 or early 2022. That leaves you with 220 million people to vaccinate. At approximately 70% population immunity required (and knowing vaccine immunity is more robust and less transient than from natural infections), you'll need to to get to 229 million total vaccinations (assuming we're not factoring in natural immunity). Now we also know that only about 60-70% of adults are willing to take the vaccine (220 million * 65% = 143 million). That leaves the US about 86 million people short (including kids and vaccine-hesitant folks). There will be large marketing pushes to overcome vaccine hesitancy of those 30-35% of adults who will hopefully mostly get their vaccines over a slower period on the tail end of the campaign.

Now I'm not saying be hopeless; there is hope. And life will be far more ""normal"" in the summer (not acccounting for variants).

Vaccine is manufactured by Pfizer. Deals are with Pfizer.

&gt;the EU continues to send vaccines over the World.

**Lie #3**, you're on a roll.

The EU doesn't send a **single** vaccine out to the world. Pfizer, a commercial American company does, to honor their contracts.

&gt;Want Pfizer? Build your own factory, Israel.

What kind of logic is that? EU manufactures nearly zero processors. Both Intel and AMD manufacture in Asia, Israel and the US. Imagine if those companies stopped exclusively shipping to Europe in the wake of the [global processor shortage](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3602456/youre-not-imagining-things-there-is-a-serious-chip-shortage.html). That's not how economy works.

Europe does not own those plants, and had Europe restricted export to the EU only in advance much of that manufacturing would have been built elsewhere in the first place.

So you made me look at the data:

Let’s take the average reported case number of 3 weeks ago (1/28): 160000 a day. Assume undercounting of 3-5 times —&gt; true number of infected per day: 480000 to 800000 on Jan 28. Deaths lag on average by about three weeks after infection, so deaths from infection then should be in the reported death counted yesterday. We are currently averaging about 2000 deaths a day. So IFR: 2000/800000=0.25% in the low range and 2000/480000=0.42% in the high range.

I myself am closer to the belief that undercount in Jan 21 with free available testing is probably closer to 3 times, rather than 5 times. But either position is possible.

However, the IFR is lower now due to better care, more young people getting exposed, vulnerable people being more protected. Also masking potentially reducing viral load. At the beginning of the pandemic, or in a world with no restriction the IFR would be higher, much closer to the 0.7% based on the studies from spring-summer 2020.

At any rate, the thread started with the assertion that we have reached herd immunity of 70%. To reach the conclusion the author took the lowest IFR estimate of the present moment (so best case scenario) and applied to the death count which extended all the way to early 2020, ignoring that IFR was likely higher then. Doing that he reached the conclusion that we already are at 60-70% herd immunity threshold. 

My point is that we are about half way there at the moment, based on natural immunity, in line with Gottlieb’s statement. That is still significant. And when you add the vaccines, we will be at herd immunity very soon.

1) The pandemic that has killed over 2,000,000 people globally is an actual issue that people should feel some anxiety over, and your last sentence implies that it isn't.

2) What I'm decrying isn't ""exposure therapy,"" it's ridicule and dismissal. Those are not even close to the same thing. Exposure therapy would be engaging in a conversation with them about covid, the realistic dangers therein, and how to tell the difference between actual things to be concerned about and fear-based overreaction. You are equating exposure therapy with telling someone to ""just calm down.""

The method that this thread seems to use of ""dismiss and ridicule"" is almost the exact opposite of exposure, because the person didn't learn anything. They point of exposure therapy isn't to teach the brain that it's nothing to worry about, it's to teach the brain how to handle worrying about things in a healthy way, and asking questions can be a part of that.

3) This is only tangentially related, but exposure therapy is not the gold standard. There is no gold standard for anxiety and OCD, because every person is different, and has different reactions to different treatments. The closest thing to a ""standard"" is cognitive behavioral therapy therapy which included but is certainly not limited to exposure therapy.

My source? I have severe anxiety and OCD and I've been in and out of therapy for it for years since I was a teenager.

They are just analyzing the data from Pfizer's trial, that's been there and posted in the NEJM in December.   And it's not a brand new analysis.   We've known about this analysis since December.   Moderna themselves in their trial analysis pointed out their first dose has upwards of 92% efficacy just before the 2nd shot.   Again, this isn't new info.

Yes, it is new that these results are being more confirmed by real world data (such as Isreal's study and Quebec reporting 80% protection).  Isreal though is limited by the same limiting factors as Pfizer's study, in that in only got really 3 weeks of data from the first dose as they gave the large majority of people their second shot on time @21 days.

But you seem to be under the impression that the only concern was the efficacy number of a single dose after 3 or 4 weeks.   That's not the only reason many experts are still concerned.  They aren't sure how long that protection will last.   How well will 1 dose protect against variants that have some ability to escape vaccine immunity?  Pfizer has said that the South African variant reduces the immune response of it's vaccine by 2/3rds.   That immune response should still be good enough to neutralize it, but what about if you don't have the 2nd dose?  The 2nd dose is responsible for a significant increase in immunogenicity (immune response).

If you were to ask me personally, I'm starting to side on the delay argument, at least for people outside the most vulnerable.   But I'm not going to kid myself and think the matter is settled, and I realize there are very smart experts on both sides of the issue, both with legitimate arguments which is the issue you have.

Overloading the NHS is delaying cancer diagnosis and treatment, which will lead to a large number of excess deaths. These are indirect COVID-19 deaths. Far more people than normal are dying at home, and outcomes for heart attacks and strokes are worse than would otherwise be the case.

My main point was that you were equating ridicule and dismissal as a form of exposure therapy, which I vehemently disagreed with. I never said that we should shield people from reality, I was just saying we shouldn't ridicule and ignore their anxieties, rather we should welcome their questions and educate them.

To your point about deaths in relation to population, this is something we're not going to agree on, so there's no point in discussing it further. To some, any excess death is tragic and depression/anxiety inducing, and there's no point trying to argue them to your side, because it will never work.

I am equally as concerned with the economic impact of the pandemic as the loss of life.

In my opinion, a complete and total global lockdown would 100% work, and would be the only thing that worked after January 2020 or so. We missed our shot to nip it in the bud before then.

It is also my opinion that a true complete and total global lockdown to stop the virus would cause global societal collapse, with millions of immediate deaths, and hundreds of millions of deaths in the following years due to the fallout of the lockdown.

In light of that, targeted, voluntary measures to protect those truly at risk from the virus would be a real peach of an idea to have implemented. In my opinion of course. But we didn't do that either. Now we're in this purgatory of restrictive measures and fearmongering that is hurting everyone, regardless of their individual risk from covid. We know who is at risk from Covid now. Restricting the rights of everyone and creating a perception of vastly overblown risk for those who are in reality at such a low level of risk that it's inconsequential is really screwing everybody over, and it didn't have to be that way.

Widespread lockdowns will slowly trickly away as more and more people get vaccinated, but we need to be vigilant.

Instead of just thinking of human health, we need to think of whole ecosystem health since it's all interconnected.

...did you really not read the comment you just replied to? I have, lots of times. You and me both know it won't make you change your mind.

&gt;That is exactly the smug arrogance that gave Sweden the best and most scientific strategy in the world. 
&gt;

...how is me not wanting to argue something I have argued a 100 times before, on this very sub, arrogant? And how does that have anything to do with Sweden as a whole or the strategy chosen by our health agency? I'm sensing some form of xenophobia based BS stereotype here, but that might just be me.

You know the Denmark jokes are just for fun right? Don't take them too seriously

&gt;Meanwhile in Stockholm new cases went up 24% from week 5-6 and 28% from week 6-7. The region currently has as many Covid 19 patients hospitalised as all of Denmark and more new cases than Denmark and Norway combined. 
&gt;

Yes? We're doing like shit, is this somehow news to you?


&gt;But you are too self righteous to realise how deep a mess you are in. 
&gt;

Again, is this about me, about all Swedes, or about our pandemic strategists? I've been very critical of how the strategists have been handling this situation (so in that case you're incorrect), and there is certainly a hint of self righteousness there, imo (in that case you're correct). The people, just like every single other country on the planet, act based on what they are told and/or forced to do. In the case of Sweden, the people have evidently not been told and/or forced to do enough to keep the pandemic at relative bay (so in that case you would be incorrect). Though we have obviously observed that there are more factors in play than this.


&gt;I can guarantee you the image of Sweden is ruined beyond repair for years to come. The rest of the world is looking in and thinking “wtf is wrong with you”.
&gt;

Lol, that's the overstatement of the year. I have personally seen very little of this from anyone seemingly sane. Most people are correctly identifying that this was a misstep by the government and their appointed strategists.

I don't hate the US because of the Trump administration. I don't hate Americans because of the Trump Administration. I hate the Trump Administration itself.

It also helps that we're far from alone when it comes to handling the pandemic poorly.

&gt;Except off course for alt-righters, extreme libertarians and the oil lobby. A bizarre set of new friends for Sweden.

Is it really a friendship if it's that one-sided?

The graph of fatalities also has 3 peaks at about the same times, at about 2700, 1800 and 4300.

Two things I wonder about.

First, that the peaks are at about the same time. There is a 2-4 week or longer delay between a case and a fatality, so you would think that the peaks on the death chart would be 2-4 weeks later, but they aren't.

Second, the increases in fatalities are nowhere close to the increase in cases. 35k to 70k cases is +100%, but 2700 to 1800 fatalities is -67%. And 70k to 280k cases is +400% but 1800 to 4300 fatalities is +240%.

Figure 2 in Pfizer's FDA application is the relevant one here.  It shows a near full decline in new symptom onset around day 10, seemingly overnight.  The caveat is that these are tiny sample sizes (and they didn't release the raw data).  This is the exact same graph that this lancet article is replicating with a much larger sample size.

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.06.21251283v1

Here it's figure 1, and it shows a very similar effect but for something entirely different: a 75% decrease of viral load of vaccinated people who test positive, that happens over days 11-13.

The first is essentially looking at protective immunity (individual protection from disease symptoms), while the second at sterilizing immunity (ability of the vaccine to prevent spread).  So we now know that we get a good bit of both from the vaccine.  Also, note that this is by day of symptom onset (4-6 days after infection) and day of testing (3-10+++ days after infection).

So if a trial was ran a particular way, you go with that information until better information presents itself.  I don't know (would be a good question for the scientific sub) if it would require another set of trials before conclusive data would be considered actionable.  In the same way that it has been discussed that the FDA wouldn't approve vaccines based on data collected (trials ran) abroad.  In other words the trials have to be ran in the US.

Yes, things should return to near normalcy once everyone that wants a vaccine has one, what will not return to normal for long after that point are mask mandates, and capacity limits / the need to social distance.

I know some people really hate mask mandates / capacity limits, but even among vaccinated persons, they remain critically important as they reduce transmission.

Transmission is the vessel in which variants created.

In other words, vaccinated people in the Pfizer  clinical trial were 20 times less likely than the control group to get  COVID-19.  

From: [https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-explained.html](https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-explained.html)

But you're right that asymptomatic cases aren't included in the number of people who get the virus; in the Pfizer test, only 0.4% got Covid-19 (from the same source): 

&gt;One common misunderstanding is that 95% efficacy means that in the  Pfizer clinical trial, 5% of vaccinated people got COVID. But that's not  true; the actual percentage of vaccinated people in the Pfizer (and  Moderna) trials who got COVID-19 was about a hundred times less than  that: 0.04%.

Firstly, if the first dose cuts transmission in any meaningful way, which we have good reason to believe it does, then spreading the first dose out will decrease the rate of transmission and thereby the rate of mutation. 

Secondly, almost certainly, more lives will be saved this way. If the virus mutates, it mutates, there is always that risk. All the more reason to get a move on and give as many people protection as quickly as possible.

I've no issue with the opinion that the dose gap should be six weeks, but to call what the UK has done 'gambling with people's lives' is a slight bit disingenuous IMO.

There is no absence of evidence. There have been multiple documented cases of vaccinated persons both getting and transmitting covid. Do you understand that? It is really clear, black and white.

It isn't supposed to stop you from getting covid, it never has. It is meant to reduce, and hopefully prevent, severe covid and death. We still have to reduce transmission as much as possible until everyone, including children, are vaccinated.

Transmission is the vessel in which mutations occur, so until we reach the point where everyone is vaccinated and community transmission is next to non-existent, this is how it is going to be.

Few people you don't know live for a few more months? What kind oh psychopath  are you? You do know that people of all ages die from covid right? You think your singing is more important than someone's life? Please seek help for your outrageous narcissism.

Here is your realistic goals:

1.) You are not going to perform for the rest of the year at least. Tough shit.

2.) People are going to have to ""mask up"" until the end of the year, at least. Masks will be the last thing to go away.

3.) Businesses and events will open and resume by the end of the year, but with reduced capacity and masks mandates. Literally no big deal.

Get your vaccine, and continue doing exactly what you are doing now. It isn't hard. Once you and your dad are vaccinated, go hug the shit out of him, hang out with your vaccinated friends, but wear a mask and social distance in public.

Ordinary folks have been missing physical, mammographic, and dental check-up appointments, either deliberately or by necessity.

Immunologically, It doesn’t make sense to quantify an individual persons level of protection unless you were measuring indices of protection like antibody titres or t cell activity. You’re either protected or not from whatever end point was measured in the clinical trial..

When a vaccine is said to be 80% effective for instance, it means 8/10 people who receive the vaccine is protected against a particular endpoint (ie, severe disease or death, etc) NOT that each individual has “80% protection” as i keep seeing people saying when discussing vaccines in general (not specific to this thread).

However, I would be hesitant to say IgA is necessary for neutralization.

The difference would probably be in generating a productive infection. While having high mucosal IgA levels could have the potential from preventing any cell from getting infected, vaccine-induced serum IgG could still prevent the infection from truly taking hold. While you may have some cells get infected in your upper respiratory tract, the rapid influx of IgG from the blood and serum could prevent that infection from spreading to other cells and taking hold. As far as transmission is concerned that would likely have the same or similar impact to not having those few cells get infected at all.

Again this all remains to be seen as far as transmission goes, but almost all of our vaccines work by generating IgG responses and can be neutralizing even to mucosal infections.

Perhaps, although I feel it's somewhat false equivalency. At this point, we know more about the virus, how it spreads, how to take proper precautions, how to manage distancing and masking, how to better treat it, how to look for it (symptoms)...the list goes on. We didn't have *any* of those things under our belt when these idiots were protesting right off the bat. It really didn't matter what type of virus was driving this pandemic, they are just entitled individuals. 

If it was a highly deadly virus with a lower transmission rate, we'd hear *""There's not THAT many people getting this virus! It's a statistical improbability you'll contract it...OPEN IT UP!""* 

With a virus like SARS2 which is  highly transmissible, yet not that deadly, we are hearing *""It's not THAT many people dying! It's mostly elderly and sick! 98% recovery rate...OPEN IT UP!""*

It's not about a vaccine, it's not about the virus, it's not about anything other than pure and utter entitlement and selfishness, masquerading as ""freedom"". This was a chance to demonstrate you care about others and something bigger than just yourself; to sacrifice *something* so we can all get through this quicker and with less suffering. A wide swath of Americans failed this test severely.  


&gt; Lots of people voted for the candidate who promised he would “listen to scientists” and “follow the science” only to disregard said scientists less than one month into his term once CoVID threatened to not just “go away” like they’d thought. 

I, personally, do not know a single person who voted Biden saying this. The administration themselves wants to open up schools, something that has been in the works long before the election. I am genuinely confused as to where Scientists are being shunned or not listened to. Biden and his administration are working full force on implementing COVID management and vaccine distribution. Can you point me to where you see that happening?   


&gt;I am not optimistic for our capacity to overcome more pressing challenges in the future when I see people in the “informed” crowd unwilling to further countenance the science behind a struggle that lasts longer than a year.

In developing countries, a combination of age demographics leading to lower severity infections and weaker healthcare systems means underreporting rates are even higher - likely 20-25X. 

The best way to get an estimate of actual cases globally is to work backwards from deaths (which, while still under-reported, are less under-reported than cases). You can estimate age-band IFR rates based on estimates from countries that suffer least from under-reporting / have the easiest to model total infection figures and then apply that to global age demographics. 

Even using a conservative IFR of .3% you get a floor of 800 million cases based on 2.5 million confirmed deaths. Given the under-reporting of deaths and the fact that the global IFR is likely lower than that (due to age demographics), it's easy to see the actual number of global cases is over 1 billion. 

Take India as an extreme example of underreporting. Seroprevalence in New Delhi is at 50%. India has 11 million confirmed cases; New Delhi has a population of 20 million. In other words, New Delhi alone has had about as many cases (based on antibody testing) as confirmed in India as a whole (based on confirmed PCR tests).

This depends. The big question is how long these levels of immunity last - the main point of a booster is to [extend immunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/kfwqmp/why_do_some_vaccines_require_multiple_doses_or/).  

The Oxford vaccine, while lower at ~76% efficacy, has data that supports a 12 week gap w/ no decline in immunity. On the other hand, this study only tracked days 15-28 post-first jab. If on the basis of that we went with a 6 week gap, we could justify something like a 14 week gap with the Oxford one, a level of flexibility that more than offsets that 9% difference. 

Obviously there's even more to it - these are health workers, so the vaccine might work less well for them because they are exposed to unusually high viral loads.

The current method of hoping and clicking to get appointments is incredibly frustrating.  That's even harder for anyone who is not tech savvy which unfortunately does include a lot of older folks.  This can be fixed by getting it to more places and pharmacies and even general practitioners where people can just work with their normal doctors to get it fixed.  The best way to get there is get more vaccines approved and improved manufacturing.

I know if you spell it out in the most basic form, it's pretty simplistic but having dealt with logistics off and on over the years, one slip, especially at the manufacturing level basically increases time exponentially as every step adds their own delays on top of it.

Long story short, Johnson and Johnson getting approved will be huge and shorten the timeframe, 1 shot doubles it's distribution capability from Moderna/Pfizer.  I'd love to see J&amp;J just get opened to that 3rd phase since it's a little less effective than the other 2 and the Moderna/Pfizer keep rolling through older folks and essential workers.  Creating the two pronged approach will significantly lower distribution time and get Phase 3 people in line likely in April to early May.

After that it becomes production challenges for making enough for everyone. That likely will take a few months to get it fully available which may be mid-Summer.  That should be working in conjunction with less infection spread to overall get us out of pandemic mode around the same time we can walk up to a pharmacy and request a vaccine.

I've generally been a bit pessimistic the past year with all this but I'm seeing a light at the end of this thing.

ERP is considered the gold standard by many  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330213126_The_Gold_Standard_Exposure_and_Response_Prevention_for_OCD as well as https://www.google.com/amp/s/childmind.org/article/what-is-the-gold-standard-treatment-for-ocd/amp/ but there are a lot of sources. My therapist called it the gold standard as well.

I’m saying 2,000,000 deaths isn’t a lot when you take into account the world population of 7,000,000,000. Do you realize that’s .02% of the world’s population? And that many were of advanced age and frail to begin with? And now we’ve destroyed the world economy which will hurt the poor and young WAY more than the rich. 

I see your point about ridicule and dismissal - we should be kinder rather than ridiculing.

Lastly, I want to add that I completely cured my GAD/OCD by having a sleep test that identified UARS, which puts your body into fight of flight mode. Once I got it treated my anxiety vanished - something ERP and SSRI’s couldn’t do. Check this article out: https://link.springer.com/article/10.2478/s11536-009-0127-1

Among those concerned is Paul Bieniasz, a virologist at the Rockefeller University. “Rolling out a partially effective vaccine regime in the peak of a highly prevalent viral epidemic is just not a great idea if one of your goals is to avoid vaccine resistance,” he says.

There’s a chance, Bieniasz explains, that people waiting for their second dose may have a sub-optimal level of immunity that places selective pressure on the virus. If someone were to become infected during the interval between jabs, that pressure could allow for the emergence of a mutant version of SARS-CoV-2 able to shake off a person’s immune response—a so-called escape variant. Any such variant that also proved capable of causing severe disease could potentially spark a whole new, devastating wave of infections and deaths.

""If you have a lesser immune response, which is what you're getting after that first dose, then you are more likely to wound this virus than kill it,"" Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine researcher at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said last week during a call with reporters.

If we do not kill the virus, Offit said, then it will still have the opportunity to mutate.

The boost in response from the second dose, Fauci said, gives a ""greater breadth of response,"" meaning it can protect against not only the ""wild type"" of coronavirus circulating, but also against the variants that are gaining a foothold in the U.S.",,,1613759278,{},go1797p,False,t3_lndwjs,False,True,t1_go1363x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lndwjs/study_in_israel_shows_pfizer_vaccine_85_effective/go1797p/,1613761075,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Yep, we (USA) collaborated with China, partially funding ""gain-of-function"" studies at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  That type of research is still considered controversial, and was halted in 2014.  But then in 2017, we started back up.  Because we make great decisions! (/s)

Or just google ""wuhan gain of function"" for other news sources, if you don't like Vox.

I should add, they were studying CoV mutations in bats, but also other viruses and other animals.  However.. it's strange, isn't it?

If you get rid of the forests, you're eliminating those cozy places for animals to mostly isolate themselves from humans. So - they have no choice but to do all those things like chilling out, feeding, and seeking shelter all in places where humans are.

If it wasn't a wet market, it'd be just some village near an area of recent deforestation or something along those lines.

If a vaccine-resistant strain of COVID were produced, that would *definitely* cause more deaths than delaying a few vaccinations in lower-risk younger people by a few weeks.  If vaccinating people hastily with the AZ vaccine means the UK population ends up with immunity to the adenovirus vector they used, just in time for the South African strain to arrive with no quick path to producing a booster shot that can help, that will *definitely* lead to more people dying.  

Both of those situations are plausible and have been proposed by well-qualified scientists.  These, and other concerns, underpin the UK doctors association’s strenuous objections to the political decision to unilaterally change the dosage regimens.

There was no hard data in support of the UK decision at the time it was made - thats simply fact.  We merely had limited data from clinical 2 dose regimen studies during the period between dose 1 and 2 - covering only a single week of full efficacy, in the case of the Pfizer vaccine.  We know from decades of experience that different vaccines behave differently, and one of the vaccines in question here is an *entirely new vaccine platform*.

I really do understand the desire to *just do something, anything* to reopen the British economy.  But many times an aggressive move has been attempted without supporting data in the past, even when well intentioned, lives have been lost and medical disasters have occurred.

It sounds interesting.

Acting Under Secretary Bryan: We’ll get to the right folks who could.

Trump: Right. And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So, that, you’re going to have to use medical doctors with.

What will happen with the ""weak immunity"" of everyone who gets a vaccine this year, but not next year? That could be a considerable cohort. Is it a reason not to vaccinate as many people as possible right now? I don't think so.

Because it's not ""weak immunity,"" it's excellent immunity by the standard of a great many existing vaccines. It's certainly not weaker than the native immune response of an unvaccinated person, which already triggers a host of variants, and then passes the most successful of them on in great numbers to another unvaccinated person.

And it's not weaker than the weak immunity of someone who has already had another variant a year ago, and who remains unprotected by the booster effect even a first dose would offer. That's a huge cohort of people in the US.

It's not weaker than the weak immunity of someone who has gotten the first dose, in the period of the first two weeks after that dose, when immunity is demonstrably weak.
