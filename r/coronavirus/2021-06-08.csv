Now stack that up 4 months per year for years, and locals who can flee the city, the center dies out.

Your child is relatively low risk from COVID, but that does not mean zero risk.

The question I think you should ask is have we seen any data that the vaccines are more dangerous than natural Covid? The answer is overwhelmingly no. 

Blood clots? Far more common with Covid. Myocarditis? Far more common with Covid (per recent JAMA study seen in 2.3% of college athletes with Covid).

The data we have so far is strongly in favor of the vaccines. If we see data on 10,000+ children and don‚Äôt see any wildly different safety signals, it tilts in favor of vaccines again.

I suspect there is just less consistent reporting so we‚Äôll see days with a lot of shots and days with less, very annoying. 

767 first dose shots. Last week 10,555 first dose shots

7 day rolling average is 15,168 first dose shots (16,566 yesterday) 

5.487 million NJ residents with 1st dose - 61.8%

(5.486 million - 61.8% yesterday)

5.238 million 18+ with 1st dose - 75.4%

(5.237 million - 75.4% yesterday)

90.8% of 65+ have first dose (90.8% yesterday)

4.511 million fully vaccinated - 50.8%

(4.510 million - 50.8% yesterday)

At this rate, the first dose shots will reach these percentages on

**Total Population Numbers(61.8% Now)**

65% - 6/28 (6/26 yesterday)

70% - 7/28 (7/23 yesterday)

75% - 8/26 (8/18 yesterday)

**18+ Numbers (75.4% Now)**

80% - 7/7 (7/3 yesterday)

85% - 8/5 (7/30 yesterday)

90% - 9/4 (8/26 yesterday)

**65+ Numbers (90.8% Now)**

95% - 8/4 (7/28 yesterday)

**NJ case count**

7 day average is 228 down from 

234 - yesterday

256 - 1 week ago (10% decrease)

976 - 4 weeks ago (76% decrease)

Such as what?  I always like more data.  What specifically would convince you though?  Full licensure?  Actual approval?  Supposedly once a single vaccine is fully licensed, no more vaccines can be approved under EUA.  Not even sure how the &lt;12's will be handled if it is licensed for adults before EUA comes for kids. 

The 2 things that make me think it is worth the theoretical risks are:

1) The dose of mRNA that the body gets is finite and once your body runs through it, it disappears.  Meaning *theoretically* no long term effects.  With a Covid-19 infection the SARS-CoV-2 virus has no such limits, and it is often said that the lingering virus is what may cause ""long Covid"" to occur.

2) WOmen who are pregnant have received the vaccine now, at various stages.  Those babies born have some protection that was transferred to them from their mothers.  It is not the same as being vaccinated, but it is the next closest thing.  If there were any immediate side effects in very young children(newborns), we would have been alerted to them by now.

""We know that there is a strong benefit to natural immunity and we think it probably lasts at least a year. We‚Äôve only had this virus around for a little over a year so we‚Äôre not sure how long that‚Äôs going to last.""

However, she still advocates getting a vaccine even if you have natural immunity.

(Go to 00:01:28)

As far as I know the current COVID-19 vaccines are only for the original strain of the virus, and they only show the body the spike protein. Whereas with a natural infection the body sees the entire virus.

I'm not entirely opposed to vaccines. But if I am going to take one I would prefer to take one that mimics as close as possible a natural infection, which would be a live attenuated vaccine.

One of the other concerns that I have with the current COVID-19 vaccines is that they are injected into muscle, which is not the place the body sees the virus first in a natural infection. In a natural infection the body will sees the virus in the respiratory system first, or maybe in the intestines if the virus is swallowed with food or drink. The respiratory system and intestines are part of the mucosal system which has a different immune response than the rest of the body, so I've heard. So even if you get the vaccine you might still get infected in your mucosal system and spread the virus. That's the reason why health authorities were saying that you still had to wear a mask after being vaccinated.

So the ideal vaccine in my opinion would be live attenuated in a nasal spray form, or perhaps an oral pill to infect your intestines. The Codagenix vaccine is a nasal spray. Such a vaccine already exists for the flu - FluMist Quadrivalent by AstraZeneca.",,,1623192717,{},h133yfq,True,t3_ntcp34,False,True,t1_h12f0fz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ntcp34/covid19_codagenix_currently_the_only_live/h133yfq/,1623384984,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I don‚Äôt think any scientist at the moment can say anything is certain because each one of us is individual and react to vaccines differently. Im currently unvaccinated due to shortages where I live but I will certainly take the vaccine when I‚Äôm offered. But people have to realise that the vaccine does not stop everyone from getting covid but it does stop serious illness and hospitalisation. However unless there is a large proportion of the world vaccinated it just takes one person to be the unlucky one where a new variant is formed that the vaccines will not protect the vaccinated and I think this is also the reason why the Science community are telling people to be cautious.
I‚Äôve friends in countries and they‚Äôre all vaccinated because they live in countries that have quickly vaccinated their citizens with at least one shot.

Past 7 days, averaging 2000 new cases and 40 deaths per day. 

40deathsx60ish days is 2400+ extra dead Texans. There would be even more as the averages were higher at the reopen. Probably best to say 5000+ deaths that could have been less or zero. 

60% chance of having long term health complications from Covid-19. 2000casesx60days = 120,000people*60%=72,000+ people suffering for months, years, or forever. Again, the number is way higher. 

You literally do not care for random Texans' lives.

Right now, children and teenagers are in the ICUs because he opened schools and removed the mask mandates.

The pandemic is still here causing problems.

The Texas Government, especially the governor, has done a shit job. If you want to visit the Governor's mansion, lol you have to wear masks. So he fears for his life and safety but not for others. Also took a picture wearing masks while signing the no mask mandate. Nothing to fear my butt....


There are lots of problems right now.

But I would say the pandemic is a product of human development. Not interaction with wild animals though because humans actually have less interaction with animals now than they did historically. A few thousand years ago a much higher percentage of the population raised domesticated animals for food. In pre-agricultural times humans hunted and ate wild animals regularly.

Now there is a large population of humans on the planet and a lot of travel between different parts of the world. 20,000 years ago nobody went anywhere. A virus might jump from an animal that was killed by a human and wipe out half of their tribe. But that would be the end of it. The virus wouldn't have any more human hosts to live in. It wouldn't spread around the world like today.

Ya, a lot of plant foods have been cultivated over the millenia to be quite different than their wild varieties. Generally sweeter and bigger. Livestock as well are different from their wild ancestors. Fish and seafood on the other hand are probably exactly the same as from before humans walked on earth.

1) Immunizimg all of the older population first and leaving the youth unprotected lead to higher spread seen k  the UK vs the US.

From almost all state charts I see, the real problem area is 18-30 year olds. 

Unfortunately, that is college age and the age where many people work out in areas where they see tons of people a day. 

In 2 months most of the USA goes back to full open of schools. That includes out of state and international students on mass for colleges, full dorms, etc. Most schools plan to have no distancing, etc. States like Texas have restricted any state funded entity, that includes schools and colleges, from even requiring masks.

Schools open in August. August is 1 month after the 4th of July weekend.

The Delta variant is already gaining traction in the USA.

August and September are likely going to be the largest surges we see since vax started. Without more vax in that age group, we risk a huge step backwards for the country, and especially any state below 70%, which sadly looks like many states literally won't even be past 50% at that point.

If you have friends or family in this age group, or really anyone who could be, do your best to help them get vaccinated.

Where did you get this from??? Why would India use a Chinese vaccine?

They were, and still are, using the AstraZeneca vaccine and an indigenously developed vaccine(called Covaxin). From the start, India knew that they have a huge population so they prioritized giving first doses and were able to cover 10% of the population with some protection. For a country like India, this isn't bad at all. Their relatively poor healthcare infrastructure is globally known. 

In my opinion, if you filter out the people who try to score political points, India was caught off-guard with the variant. The majority of the medical community, both within India and outside, had predicted that the covid crisis in India was over. Obviously, there are always some people who give warnings and in India's case, they were proven right.

Let‚Äôs be clear going vegan does not DIRECTLY cause less caloric intake. 

Choosing to eat healthy veggies and other low calorie vegan items causes less caloric intake. Are vegans more likely to choose these less calorically dense food items? Sure. Being vegan in and of itself does not. 

You yourself said that it doesn‚Äôt ALWAYS directly CAUSE weight loss. Merely that is USUALLY results in weight loss. This is the definition of a correlation. ‚Äúa mutual relationship or connection between two or more things‚Äù

I am NOT denying a relationship. If you are vegan, the LIKELIHOOD is that you eat fewer calories and are thus not overweight (and thus less susceptible to severe Covid). But it is NOT causal. Causal would mean ‚Äúbeing Vegan directly results in not being overweight‚Äù and that is blatantly not true. As you stated above. 

whereas... ‚Äúconsistently eating more calories than you burn results in being overweight‚Äù. THAT is a CAUSAL relationship. Take in more calories than you burn = overweight

And. I don‚Äôt hate vegans. I just dislike it when folks inadvertently spread incorrect information. In this case, science terminology that we all supposedly learned in elementary or middle school.

There are reasons for people to get more than one, but the most common are:

2. Concerns about getting fake doses in certain countries.

Minnesota launched an incentive program a couple weeks ago, offering people who initiated vaccination between end of May and end of June a number of prizes, including amusement passes and VISA gift cards. Since the program launched, only ~5,200 people have claimed a prize and the new vaccination rate in the state continues to absolutely crater. 

In the seven days prior to Memorial Day, the state averaged about 7,400 first doses per day to the 16+ population (0.17% of total 16+ pop). Since Memorial Day it's about 4,300 (0.09%). 

There's essentially no way the state gets to 70% of the 16+ population with a shot by July 1st, and frankly little-to-no chance it gets there by August 1st based on the trends and numbers coming from the state, which all things considered seems to be middle of the road nationally when it comes to vaccination trends.

[This article](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/if-youre-vaccinated-can-you-transmit-covid-19-what-we-know#Some-vaccines-block-most-infections) states:

&gt; ast week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released initial results from a studyTrusted Source on the real-world effectiveness of the two mRNA vaccines approved in the United States, those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna-NIAID.

&gt;...

&gt; The vaccines were 90 percent effective at blocking infections ‚Äî symptomatic and asymptomatic ‚Äî in people who had two doses of the vaccine, and 80 percent effective in people who had one dose.

So do masks suddenly become less effective in combating the spread of *those particular* positive cases? Of course not. That‚Äôs why the decision of whether or not to wear a mask post-vaccination can only be appropriately made based upon local case count.

Now... ‚ÄúMitigating risk vs. inconvenience caused‚Äù

Really? I cannot believe it is June 2021 and we are still discussing the ‚Äúinconvenience‚Äù of masks, as though it carries any weight in stopping this virus from burning through the world‚Äôs population. Come on...

What you‚Äôre describing, is unsafe and potentially hazardous behavior. Spraying yourself with Lysol doesn‚Äôt lower the chance of contracting covid, it never did at any point in the pandemic. It isn‚Äôt healthy to overuse or misuse disinfectants. Changing clothes, wiping down everything, bathing constantly when you come home ‚Äî also, will not likely decrease your chances of contacting the disease, even if you managed to be exposed.

My point is, I don‚Äôt think anyone should be judging one another for things like mask wearing or avoiding crowds. Some people are more comfortable right now with a mask and that‚Äôs fine, even though they‚Äôre vaccinated. It doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone. The Lysol, and other obsessive procedures, just aren‚Äôt healthy physically or mentally.

Something else worth noting is these are reported cases of hospitalizations and deaths. Imagine all the unreported cases of asymptomatic COVID in people who never get sick enough to know it. That would tell us this vaccine does have a hand in that risk reduction.

I'm not a medical professional but my guess is that breakthrough death rate would suggest those people may not have had much luck either way. And considering that their denomination would be the death rate of all breakthrough cases, not just reported, it's likely much less than that.

&gt;I think, as in the U.K., the U.S. has given up on caring about people who are too stupid to get their shots.

Actually that's definitely not the case in the UK. Uptake is 99-100% in the most vulnerable groups. The over 40s are ticking up towards the 90% mark as well. There's likely to be a shade more hesitancy among the youngest groups, but polling suggests not a great amount more. Unlike some other countries at similar points in the vaccination campaign, we still have many more people willing to step up and do their part. Today was, I believe, the biggest day for vaccine registration to date as younger age groups become eligible and sign up. There has been, in particular, great effort to contact the hesitant among vulnerable groups and facilitate them getting a shot. When areas with lower rates of uptake became hotspots, extra effort was taken to bring vaccines to people in those areas and persuade them to make use of them. It doesn't feel like anyone has been given up on. 

That's the reason it's taken so much longer than other countries to get down to younger ages. We're not just vaccinating the half or three quarters of adults who are willing--we're getting damn near *everyone*.

So I do have faith that this is going to be okay in another couple of months, with millions more vaccines under our belt. We just have, at this stage, a giant pool of unvaccinated younger people and children that the virus can just rip through unhindered.

But that's why things like vaccine passports don't seem like the most useful idea in the UK. In places where hesitancy is greater, absolutely! It seems to have really increased uptake in Israel, for example. But in a country that's going to have like 85-90% of the eligible population willing to get it, it doesn't seem like a vaccine passport is going to be of much use. And I say that as someone who was fairly supportive of the idea until it became clear that we wouldn't really need it.

‚ÄúOr someone tests positive for covid‚Äù with what test? Pcr? Again, it‚Äôs cute how you don‚Äôt debate the efficacy of the pcr test in your reply, even though I linked a rudimentary video explaining how pcr tests, that even a child could fathom. 

If the entire premise for testing covid positive (the pcr test) is flawed, everything else that comes after is skewed data. 

I had an acquaintance who believed he had covid but never got tested. The life that person lived is quite unheathy, am I supposed to disregard this in the context of covids severity? No, because that‚Äôs not scientific. If a virus comes out that only kills people who eat McDonald‚Äôs everyday, then no, I‚Äôm not going to take that virus seriously because I don‚Äôt eat McDonald‚Äôs everyday, what I will allow is for the affected to take their health seriously. Instead people who have poor health are trying to blame the healthy for their covid troubles. 

Boohoo your friend lost his sense of taste/smell, that literally happens to me every time i get a seasonal flu or cold. But I don‚Äôt let it last 2 weeks, i actually do something other than laying in bed ordering Uber eats pretending I‚Äôm going to die from a virus with over 99% survival/recovery rate. Remember, your mental state is one of the biggest things that helps you survive near death medical issues. When you give up that‚Äôs when you die. 

If you think me telling you, how I know how to better manage my health than you, is me ‚Äúthinking I know better than everyone‚Äù you have insecurity issues. Call a therapist kiddo so you can resolve this trauma promptly. 

Are you seriously trying to take the moral high ground with ‚Äúall you‚Äôve got is a YouTube video to support your claim‚Äù when you are literally saying ‚Äúyeah because my friend got covid and was never tested the numbers are actually much higher‚Äù 

I used pretext to say outright, the video I was sending was a rudimentary explanation, do you know what that word means? Look it up. Where as you‚Äôre saying outright ‚Äúyeah because my friend had this experience the numbers must be higher‚Äù. Sorry that‚Äôs not how statistics work kiddo. Do you have any degree of evidence to support your claim? My comment overall was explaining basic science to you, because when you understand that you‚Äôll know that covid is really not that serious. 

Your immature belief that I believe in healing crystals shows how one track minded you are, you are not here for open minded civil discourse, you‚Äôre here to vilify anyone who doesn‚Äôt agree with your countries narrative, which now seems that be a narrative that you accept and support.

It does my head in, because some of those who most loudly complain about the fearmongering over the virus itself are the ones fearmongering the most about the vaccines!

Now, you could argue that by Bayes' Theorem you have to multiply exposure risk by risk of death/serious disease to get your actual risk level over time of covid, and that that (for younger people) would not justify the risk/benefit balance. But you have to understand that dealing with this pandemic without a vaccine would require a very large number of people to get this *at some point* - in other words, you're passing into the 'recovered' compartment of the Kermack-McKendrick model somehow, be that by infection or vaccination.

All in all, herd immunity was the only practical way out for most places in the world except isolated islands, and it's either through vaccination or infection.

In everything I've observed, this seems to be a very under-appreciated point.

This study is good, on the one hand, because it observes real-life behavior (as opposed to stuff like mannequins and compressed air blowers). That means it will account for human error.

But on the other hand, it observes behavior and results only over a very limited time interval (a minute and a half for the talking test, 30 seconds for the coughing test).

What happens to the human error factor when you expand that to 4 or 8 hours of continuous mask-wearing?

Also: If mask efficiency at blocking droplets emitted while talking is only 70%, how much time with continuous exposure has to pass before the protective effect of masking is obviated? What about for droplets blocked through just breathing (which wasn't measured for % effective in this study, but we know they are smaller and less forwardly propelled than other respiratory droplets and are less effectively blocked by masks)?

How does real-world risk compensation play into all of this?

Anyone who‚Äôs here on reddit is able to access case numbers local to them. They can be a big kid and make decisions for their self.

I don‚Äôt have a problem with people taking the available factual information and making decisions based upon said information. The moment that process turns into making decisions emotionally based on what other people are (or are not) doing then I no longer support such decision-making.

That‚Äôs sort of my whole point - nobody IS forcing you to wear a mask anymore, but that doesn‚Äôt make it any less effective a tool in combating the spread of disease. It is because of the scientific basis for mask usage that I support it for all people in areas with high circulation of the virus, vaccinated or not, mandated or not.

When we do the formulaic version of herd immunity we assume the second.  But since vaccination isn't random, but based on values and beliefs (which families and friends tend to share); we always actually have something closer to the first case.

1% is from a few weeks ago, and the most recent interval shows 5%.  6% for this week makes sense - but this would not contribute to current hospitalizations yet, and is still far from ""more than we know"" when we know exactly how much there is.

I actually gave a conservative estimate with thousands a week.  It's about 15,000 sequences a week.  We've had about 100k cases in the last week so this is 15% of cases.  But it's also a flat 15,000 number that, if taken at random from any number of cases, will give an extremely low confidence interval for how much of each lineage there can be.

But, those numbers are all nationwide.  If we look locally we might get a different answer, and this brings me back to Grand Junction.  Cases are rising, hospitals are already near capacity, and a quite solid portion of cases are from Delta.  Of course, only around 1/3 of the population is vaccinated - many more probably have had the disease, but that may not help so much against Delta and Gamma.",,,1623267245,{},h16wrpw,False,t3_nvvcin,False,False,t1_h16ve4m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nvvcin/in_the_us_hospitalizations_are_rising_in_areas/h16wrpw/,1623473130,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Contrast with, for example, MD, where that percent (current 71+%) is the first item shown in the dashboard.

I guess it depends on how highly you value the additional protection from the vaccine, since we do know from the data that the vaccine offers greater protection than natural immunity, and IIRC the vaccines offer more robust protection against theoretical variants. As a father of two children that wants to make sure I'm there for them until they're adults at least, almost any even tiny increase in protection is worth one day on the couch. If I worked for someone else (instead of myself) I'd definitely use vaccine day as an excuse to call in a sick day and order pizza and watch Netflix.

This group is also why I still think we'll see a hundred or two hundred thousand vaccinations per day even into winter.

You're asking what repercussions we may have in the future from something that hasn't had data accumulated for that long. How can anyone answer this accurately without speculating and essentially creating a circle jerk of ""what if"" scenarios?

I agree that the mrna vaccine is very clever and generally solid in its design, but that doesn't mean it's going to remain that way.

In addition to that, emergency use certainly *does not* contain the same rigor as FDA approval (which is why the FDA hasn't approved any of the vaccines yet). When you accelerate access to treatments you increase the chance of missed opportunities for research, can delay critical data and even cause damage/harm to the receiver. We learned about this in med school when studying meta-static breast cancer treatment in the 90s.

I think the FDA made the right decision when considering some EUAs, but another complication from this is redirection of funding. For example, covid has seen over *600* EUAs (That is absolutely wild) which ended up pulling funds and resources away from PPE causing shortages and possibly deaths nationwide due to these access issues. You also set precedence on how future EUAs will be granted in times of pandemic that can absolutely be harmful. Ex: Hydroxycloroquine was a EUA that was seen as a safe way to prevent covid 19. Fast forward to today and the FDA has since rescinded that EUA because of new and emerging health data that comes in pursuit of FDA approval and is part of the EUA process.

One more problem I will highlight is confidence in the body. The FDA has *huge* political pressure to blast out EUAs and approvals on these vaccines. It's concerning because 1. It's seeming to come from only one of the two parties and 2. It creates unnecessary pressure that can jeopardize the integrity of a treatment or production of a treatment. From a public health perspective (me being a psychiatrist) this can create doubt in the general public that the government may not have their best interest in mind which is one of the reasons the black community has a very high vaccine hesitancy rate. Congress actually worsens the problem when they guilt and shame others for not getting vaccinated as opposed to a purely scientific and empathetic approach.

TLDR - At the end of the day, scientific rigor is important when it comes to health and data. The FDA approval process is not perfect, but it's significantly different and better than an EUA - they are simply not the same thing. You can speculate all you want on the chemical composition and effects that are known (which can be an interesting and fun discussion), but remember that all treatments initially start this way and are dramatically different at the end due to new data and long term scientific rigor.",,,1623257861,{},h169l6l,False,t3_nunmo8,False,True,t1_h154n40,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nunmo8/united_airlines_says_it_too_wont_hire/h169l6l/,1623458670,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I don't think statewide hospital systems will collapse again but I definitely think that regional ones in anti-vaxx areas will do so yet again. There were many places last winter/summer that had statewide hospital collapses (Arizona being the most notable example, when they were shipping people from all over the state to New Mexico and California) but there were also many regional collapses. The former should be prevented by vaccines, but the latter is what I think will keep happening. Like when hospitals in the Idaho panhandle were so slammed that people were sent to Spokane or even as far as Portland/Seattle because sending them to Boise would take too long.
