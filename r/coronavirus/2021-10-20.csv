According to the official dashboard, there's a stark divide in vaccination between the different Belgian regions, with Flanders having 81% of its total population fully vaxxed while Wallonia is at 68% and Brussels at only 55%. Yet cases are growing pretty much homogeneously across the country, with East Flanders posting the highest % growth, although at the moment some regions in Wallonia (namely the Wallon Brabant south of Brussels and the provinces bordering Germany and Luxembourg) have the highest absolute incidence rates.",,,,1634797735,{},hhgns1g,True,t3_qcle8b,False,False,t1_hhgnl53,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qcle8b/6500_cases_in_belgium_a_2021_record_and_130/hhgns1g/,1634942895.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],,helembad,,,[],,,,text,t2_s0xb5,False,False,[],"The increase in the figures of the coronavirus epidemic in Belgium, far from calming down, is getting completely out of control at the end of October. The rate of increase of the average number of contaminations continues to rise day by day. And it will continue to do so: on Monday, nearly 6,500 new cases were recorded, not yet taken into account in the calculation of the average. A number never reached during the third wave! You have to go back to... 10 November, almost a year ago, still in the middle of the second wave, to find so many contaminations in 24 hours.


Unfortunately, the trend in admissions is just as worrying. Belgian hospitals have just recorded the admission of 130 new patients for Covid in 24 hours, a new record in 5 months that sets the average at 88 daily hospitalisations, 53% more than the previous week.

But more importantly, when comparing the figures for one day to the same day in the previous week, the increase is growing every day, a sign of an exponential phenomenon. 130 admissions is 80% more than the figures recorded on the previous Thursday (and corresponding in fact to the entries on Tuesday). The reproduction rate, based on the evolution of these admissions, now reaches 1.33. As soon as it exceeds 1, it is a sign that the epidemic is progressing.

The number of beds occupied by patients with Covid is now approaching 1000, of which 240 are in intensive care, a jump of 27% and 19% respectively.

The average number of deaths per day is now over 12, a third more than the previous week.

 

This is still a long way from the situation during the same period a year ago, when peaks of more than 300 hospital admissions per day were already being reached, but it is slowly approaching.

According to several experts, this time we will not experience a wave of such magnitude, but we must start being cautious again... and get vaccinated if we are not, because unvaccinated people will be even more exposed to developing serious forms of the disease, at all ages.
Consolidated figures from the Sciensano table

Note: these figures are taken from the updated data published by Sciensano in open data and tabulated here.

Cases detected¹: between 11/10 and 17/10, an average of 3249 new coronavirus infections were detected each day. This is an increase of 53% compared to the previous week.

Tests: between 11/10 and 17/10, an average of 50,261 tests were carried out daily, a total increase of 13% compared to the previous week.

Admissions: an average of 87.7 admissions were made between 14/10 and 20/10. This is an increase of 53% compared to the previous week.

People hospitalised²: 997 patients are currently hospitalised in connection with Covid-19, including 240 patients treated in intensive care.

Positivity rate³: based on test results obtained between 11/10 and 17/10, it is 6.8%.

Reproduction rate: calculated on the basis of the evolution of admissions, the Rt of the coronavirus is now 1.33. When it is higher than 1, it means that the transmission of the virus is accelerating.

Deaths: between 10/10 and 16/10, an average of 12.3 people died from the virus. Since the beginning of the epidemic, 25,816 people have died from the coronavirus.

¹ Detected cases are the number of patients for whom a positive test has confirmed the presence of the virus. The date considered is the date of diagnosis, not the test result. Data are considered consolidated after 4 days. The number of cases may partly depend on the testing strategy: if one tests more systematically, one also detects more cases.

² Inpatients are counted as patients already hospitalised for another reason and who have tested positive.

The positivity rate is the number of positive tests in relation to the number of tests performed. The same person can be tested several times. It also depends on the testing strategy: if not enough tests are done, the positivity rate will be higher.

All signs point to it becoming endemic - I'm not sure what you're imagining the never ending disease as, but that could mean something like everyone getting childhood shots and maybe a retirement booster of something, and that keeps the disease at something like the flu or the RSV or even one of the common colds - yes, some people do die every year, people do occasionally ill, but mostly it's just background noise.

Is that because of masks or because we're highly vaccinated with lots of work from home tech workers &amp; the like?  Take two schools here and do a mask vs. no mask comparison and it would be interesting to see.  

The real issue is that it is almost impossible to argue against any policies that are seen as 'more virtuous' or 'more safe' - it will almost always be in the best interest of any group to say 'we did all we could' so they can fall back on that if there are potential cases/outbreaks.

My larger point is that if people want to argue against vaccination status checks because they think they are invasive or bad or whatever, that's fine, make a case for why you don't like it.

I just think that trying to hang that argument off of ""businesses aren't capable of doing this"" is a weak argument.  Businesses are clearly quite capable of enforcing their policies and, if they wanted to, they have the ability to do this.  I mean there are dress codes and stuff that restaurants seem capable of enforcing with no issue.

I think it's ok to require proof of vaccination because I think the public good outweighs any ""harm"" caused.  Mostly because vaccination status is something we routinely disclose to access all kinds of public goods like education.

Ultimately, I don't mind if people want to make a case against them and provide a compelling argument, I'd be interested to hear it and maybe see a new point of view.

A booster dose of the vaccine elicited significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against the initial SARS-CoV-2 virus (wild type), as well as the Beta and Delta variants, when compared with the levels observed after the two-dose primary series. The reactogenicity profile within seven days after the booster dose was typically mild to moderate, and the frequency of reactions was similar to or lower than after dose two. The adverse event profile was generally consistent with other clinical safety data for COMIRNATY.

&gt; Real-world surveillance data also were presented to the VRBPAC by the Israel Ministry of Health, providing further support for the public health impact of boosters. The data presented from Israel included an analysis published this week in The New England Journal of Medicine. The analysis comprised approximately 1.1 million individuals ages 60 years and older who were eligible for a booster dose of the vaccine between July 30 through August 31, 2021. No new safety signals were observed, and reported adverse events were lower than those observed after dose two. The analysis showed that a booster dose restored very high levels of protection against COVID-19 infections and severe disease in this period when Delta was the dominant strain. Individuals who received the booster dose were less likely by a factor of 11.3 (95% CI: 10.4, 12.3) to develop a confirmed infection and less likely by a factor of 19.5 (95% CI: 12.9, 29.5) to develop severe illness compared to those who were previously fully vaccinated but did not receive a booster dose. The additional protection after receiving a booster translated to vaccine effectiveness comparable to levels seen early in the country’s vaccine rollout (an estimated 95%), when the Alpha variant was predominant.

&gt;…

&gt;
&gt; “The entire point of the vaccines is to get back to normal, and the CDC this morning really has not been messaging confidence in these vaccines,” Dr. Gandhi said in a phone interview.

Indeed.

[Notice that the WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-children-and-masks-related-to-covid-19) doesn't generally recommend children under 12 wear masks unless risk is exceptionally high and says children under 5 should never wear masks. And those assumptions are based on no vaccine.

Our data suggests abnormally low FATox and altered lactate production by skeletal muscle as a putative cause of- or contributor to the functional limitation of patients with PASC. Normally, as glycolysis increases with exercise intensity, lactate is oxidized for fuel in mitochondria, mainly in adjacent slow-twitch muscle fibers. Like FATox, lactate clearance capacity is a useful surrogate for mitochondrial function. In patients with PASC (even in those with normal pre-COVID physical fitness and free of comorbidities), the metabolic disturbances of the skeletal muscle were inferred by markedly impaired capacity to beta-oxidize fatty acids and clear lactate during exercise when compared to reported values in moderately active individuals and were startlingly even lower than those reported in individuals with metabolic syndrome.(3) Whereas rising blood lactate levels are expected during high exercise intensity (as glycolytic flux exceeds the rate of mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation), high blood lactate at lower exercise levels indicates mitochondrial dysfunction.(7) The inappropriately high arterial lactate levels at relatively low exercise intensity (e.g., &gt;9mM at 150W) indicate that, in patients with PASC, the transition from FATox to CHOox occurs prematurely, suggesting metabolic reprogramming and dysfunctional mitochondria.",,,,1634833018,{},hhi8luc,False,t3_qcvc2c,False,True,t3_qcvc2c,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qcvc2c/evidence_of_transmission_from_fully_vaccinated/hhi8luc/,1634973088.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That article was received on January 8th, what booster trials were underway in January? And why would ones later not take that into account? Why have immunologists said both the dose and interval contributed to Moderna lasting longer if it's as close as that study suggests?

Also; then why are they being so cagey about 50 vs 100 boosters?

For a virus that kills a very small fraction of the infected (like Covid, at ~0.2%), there is almost no evolutionary pressure to make it less deadly, but the evolutionary pressure to make it more infectious is still there.

So what happens with covid is that it evolves a faster viral replication rate, making it both more contagious and deadly.

But increased mortality does not matter much from the evolutionary standpoint, because even with Delta the carriers that die are a tiny minority. So overall, the faster replicating virus has an evolutionary advantage because it is more infectious.

It's likely to become a more regional problem as more people get vaccinated where possible though.  Even within nations as people in certain areas get vaccinated the disease ends up spreading more where the unvaccinated are.  So I imagine once children are vaccinated and people are getting boosters we'll see COVID eventually become something associated with more poor communities and nations.  Modern society tends to move on and forget the recent past very easily (when's the last time you thought about fidget spinners, for example?)

I think the wildcard there is how common non-death severe outcomes are, but it wouldn't be surprising if they scaled with deaths. And where/when the political will to repeal mask mandates shows up.

Those are two big questions in my mind.

Last year, I kept hearing about long-term COVID symptoms -- brain fog, sleep problems, fatigue, etc. One of my main concerns personally is, what if I get COVID, have a ""mild case,"" but still have some of those long-term symptoms? That's scary stuff, even if the virus itself isn't going to put me in an ICU.

In terms of political will, that's something I also worry about. Once something is in place for public safety, it becomes very hard to rollback. I don't know how old anyone on this thread is, but remember the 55mph speed limit? That was *extremely* unpopular across all political stripes and it was in place for like 25 years.

&gt; I would like to say we've also learned a lesson about sick leave and/or staying home when sick and that there may be a cultural shift there, but I've heard of plenty of people being told to work sick during the pandemic as long as they have a negative COVID test, so I don't hold much hope on that.

Yeah, I am hoping for a cultural shift on that too. Also, I wouldn't mind it being permanent etiquette that if you're sick, you should wear a mask. That's the norm in Asia and it's great.

I don't actually know, but that would make sense. I certainly haven't heard anyone talk about contact tracing outside of stories about countries like New Zealand and Taiwan which have very few cases.

&gt; Suppose, for the sake of argument, that it stabilizes to be a bit worse than the flu and kills about 800k per year (the flu kills about 600k).

This is the ""every flu season is a bad flu season, forever"" scenario. Historically, bad flu seasons have meant louder calls to get your flu vaccine and keep an eye on symptoms to stay home if potentially contagious (which basically everyone ignores) and not much else.

So, yeah, in that situation (which seems fairly likely), I suspect the difference from our current flu measures will be stronger pushes to get vaccinated (i.e. mandates may stay in place and with Moderna working on a combination COVID+flu vaccine, the flu vaccine may end up *de facto* mandatory), and masks will be a lot more popular, but not mandatory as long as severe outcomes stay low. I think the wildcard there is how common non-death severe outcomes are, but it wouldn't be surprising if they scaled with deaths. And where/when the political will to repeal mask mandates shows up.

I would like to say we've also learned a lesson about sick leave and/or staying home when sick and that there may be a cultural shift there, but I've heard of plenty of people being told to work sick *during the pandemic* as long as they have a negative COVID test, so I don't hold much hope on that.",,,,1634846434,{},hhj60d8,False,t3_qcoy1r,False,False,t1_hhj3a7w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qcoy1r/children_should_continue_wearing_masks_in_school/hhj60d8/,1634989953.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I would expect, though, that losing a friend or family member may have lasting social/emotional impacts, especially a parent.

There is nothing to suggest that, considering the landscape here and now (boosters and pediatric vaccines coming any day) and when the UK lifted restrictions are far different. That's just you guessing based on your preferred level of risk aversion. 

&gt;Will they lead to massive deaths and hospitalizations?

No, because they haven't now. Masks are scant in the NE, even where there are mandates, and the death rates have been nearly flat through the entire summer. 

&gt;But they will lead to significantly elevated deaths among the elderly

Again, there is nothing to suggest that especially as boosters for the immunocompromised have been approved for weeks and boosters for the elderly (and basically anyone who wants them) are around the corner. 

Further, most of the NE has far more people vaccinated than the UK even now, not to mention back when they lifted restrictions. The UK is **NOW** at 67/73% (full/first), and on freedom day they were 53/69%, VT is at 70/79%, MA is at 70/80%, CT is at 70/78%, RI is at 70/77%. 

&gt;There's no reason to say ""it's over."" That's some coping and psychological trivia.

Besides the fact that your argument doesn't logically hold water, my point in the posts above was that *it frankly doesn't matter*. People have made their decisions as to what they are willing to deal with, and in the NE Delta was really a whimper that didn't move the needle much in terms of changing public sentiment.

And cut out everything that does not fit your narrative, and simplify it to

&gt;We believe that while human works are necessary

When the original meaning was not quite what you were trying to say with that.

I had a long response typed up last night that went on like this, your glibness in talking about the other issues you bring up, etc. But it really comes down to this.

And here is the ad hominem you keep looking for.

I find this type of discussion extremely arrogant and condescending, constructed on definitions, on your part, that favor you and disfavor my beliefs. Out all the definitions that one could take for Christian belief, you take the one that says I am a liar when I say, ""I believe in Christ and am saved by his grace."" 

Your discussion, your original post that I responded to that I claimed you were running your mouth about, is you calling me and my coreligionists liars and deceivers. Beliving differently than you does not make me a liar, and saying that I am not a Christian makes you a liar, because I am. My faith must be heterodox, in your view, but that does not make my own profession of faith a lie.

Having lived among evangelicals in the southern US most of my life, it is all the same. Otherize people so you can stomp on them and drag them down because they are just a bunch of unbelievers that deserve whatever they get. I was actually told that once by a guy spouting the same nonsense you are spouting when I mentioned how I had ancestors killed for their beliefs.

Assuming that all of the vaccines convey very good protection against death, hospitalization and even “stay at home but feel super shitty” level serious illness (and the data suggests that’s the case), it no longer makes sense to focus on just the case numbers.

The thing we’re going to need to watch then is the spread amongst the unvaccinated, who will once again represent a threat to the rest us by clogging ICUs with their life-and-death COVID cases at the expense of people who otherwise need those beds. We should focus on preventing that from happening, probably by monitoring hospital capacity and banning the unvaccinated from participating in activities where they can get themselves infected when that starts to climb. 

But unless somebody can show that there’s a significant risk to the vaccinated (like a new variant), they shouldn’t be asked to shoulder the burden. After all, if COVID has been whittled away to the same level of threat as the flu for that population, there’s no reason to restrict them any further.

So asking for R to be below 1.0 for a sustained period is really an “elimination” goal, not a goal that is compatible with living with the disease in an endemic situation.

My guess is that the two are probably quite comparable if you're looking at 50 mcg Moderna booster vs. Pfizer booster. 

The other consideration is whether there might be other benefits from the mixing, since you're exposing your body to a different vaccine (slightly different mRNA). I'm not knowledgeable enough in this area but there might be some benefits to this.

In a recent randomized trial involving 1983 vaccinated adolescents between the ages of 12 and 15 years with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, investigators estimated that the vaccine effectiveness of two doses of BNT162b2 was 100% (95% CI, 75 to 100) against symptomatic infection by non-delta variants.4 The present observational study provides substantially more precise estimates of vaccine effectiveness among adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 years for both documented infection and symptomatic disease in a setting in which the delta variant was predominant. Our estimates of the effectiveness of two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine against the delta variant among adolescents are similar to estimates of effectiveness against the alpha variant in the general population with the use of the same study design5 and are similar to the estimate of 88% (95% CI, 85 to 90) against the delta variant in the general population in an observational study that used a different design.1

One quarter (827 of 3221) of the men residing at SCC in mid-July met eligibility criteria and were included in the study cohort; 468 were fully vaccinated and 359 were unvaccinated (Table 1). Residents in the study cohort underwent testing frequently throughout the study period (median, 3 tests; interquartile range, 2 to 5), and 95% were tested at least once (Fig. S3). There were 122 confirmed infections, including 27 symptomatic infections and 1 hospitalization. The estimated vaccine effectiveness was 56.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 42.0 to 67.5) against infection and 84.2% (95% CI, 56.4 to 94.3) against symptomatic infection (Table 1). A total of 36% of cohort members had a previous confirmed infection at least 90 days before the study start date (median, 210 days since confirmed infection); among these residents, the estimated vaccine effectiveness against subsequent infection was 80.5% (95% CI, 52.8 to 92.0) (Table S3).


Our results indicate that the mRNA-1273 vaccine was quite effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection during a delta variant–driven outbreak in this high-risk, congregate setting. Although the effectiveness against infection was substantially lower than that estimated in studies conducted before the emergence of the delta variant,1,2 protection against symptomatic illness remained robust — an outcome consistent with other recent reports.5 Notably, full vaccination also conferred additional substantial protection against infection in men with previous confirmed infections.",,,,1634768420,{},hhf3r0e,True,t3_qccj2b,False,False,t3_qccj2b,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qccj2b/effectiveness_of_the_mrna1273_vaccine_during_a/hhf3r0e/,1634909664.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If adults had the same outcomes from Covid as kids, it wouldn’t be a blip on anybody’s radar and no parent would be worried about it. Humans are bad at analyzing risk and the constant barrage of Covid media attention and the fact that hundreds of thousands of Americans adults have been killed by it has caused parents to tremendously overstate the risk for their kids. 

I appreciate people keeping their kids away from Covid because kids spread it and so are vectors for vulnerable adults dying. But we have no evidence that Covid is a major threat to children.

Additionally, they still don't have a firm grasp on who will turn for the worse and who won't, even among vaccinated. Yes, they have some general ideas (age, obesity, etc), but for people outside of those indicators (i.e. college students who are often young and not obese), they really don't have a clue. I suspect colleges will continue to be more cautious until infection treatment options get better.

Another point to consider is that the college campus may be in great shape, but the surrounding area can be terrible. My youngest son's college is 95% vaccinated among undergrad, 92% among graduate students with a few exempt. Employees are 98%. However, the surrounding city and county are among the worst in the state they're in. My son also chose to skip a meal plan this year and is cooking his own meals which means he regularly leaves campus. Something like 10-20% of the student body does this which is an avenue for breakthrough infections to show up.

As /u/Salt_Exercise978 pointed out, they're looking to minimize the expense of dealing with an outbreak - whether that's shutting down or even maintaining quarantine housing.

Whether it's a pandemic depends on whether a significant part of the world is still in the situation where the virus can't be controlled as above.

Please note that I'm not anti-mask, and I'm definitely not anti-vaccine. But mask usage has always been the best of bad options for stemming the flow of covid infections (either compared to shutting down in-person traffic or vaccines). It was never, ever going to stop covid by itself, and for vaccinated people it's a low-value mitigation.

[],,korokunderarock,,,[],,,,text,t2_5l2q5wse,False,False,[],"Nobody really talks about this here in the UK and I do understand why -- we would be so, so much more fucked than we are without AZ, and so much public discourse about COVID is so black and white that I think any suggestion AZ is inferior would get spun really quickly into ""AZ is useless"", which isn't true at all.

That said, I do wonder if there's something to this. There is conflicting evidence on waning (there is [some evidence](https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1438100712441974786?lang=en) they decline at a similar rate like you say, but there's also [one](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-hospitalisation-from-delta-variant) that suggests Pfizer drops off faster). But waning aside, I wonder if AZ's efficacy would ever have been enough to get R below 1 against Delta anyway? 

We knew from day one that it was probably not quite as good as Pfizer at blocking symptomatic illness (\~60-70%ish originally, I think?). But the UK historically has really low vaccine hesitancy so it *could* have ended up not mattering. Vaccinating a huge number of people with a moderately efficacious vaccine can theoretically get R below 1, same as vaccinating a moderate number of people with a super efficacious vaccine.

But then Delta showed up and it was twice as transmissible. The more transmissible something is, the higher either efficacy or uptake or both need to be to get R below 1. If we'd done the same number of people with a higher-efficacy vaccine would R be below 1? No idea. Would spread be slower? Yes, by definition.

Then again, we also opened up completely when cases were already high, and anyway the UK government are always painfully slow to act until we're in full crisis. Israel seemed to react basically as soon as there was a hint of worsening cases. Also there is some [weird shit going down](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/aug/07/jcvi-largely-opposed-to-covid-vaccination-for-children-under-16) in official quarters with regards to vaccinating young people here that I don't imagine has helped.",,,,1634771273,{},hhfa4lt,False,t3_qbxl01,False,False,t1_hhei92y,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qbxl01/boris_johnson_declared_the_pandemic_all_but_over/hhfa4lt/,1634913450.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New cases are now less than half what they were at Delta peak, so if the argument is stopping hospitals from overwhelming, that argument carried little weight in most areas. To be fair, it is an argument that can be used in the handful of places where vaccination rates were so low, that hospitals did overflow.

Herd immunity is not happening now.  You can argue for even less risk, but no expert believes there will be herd immunity.  You can see that in countries with far higher vaccination rates, while having less covid, didn't achieve complete immunity.

Children have such little risk from COVID, they are hospitalized and die at even lower risk than vaccinated adults.  Therefore if we are willing to let vaccinated adults be unmasked... ever, then I see the risk to children from COVID being a poor argument to keep them masked.  Its clearly a tolerable risk now not to live masked 40 hours a week.

&amp;#x200B;

The other argument is children can spread it to adults.  However, for vaccinated adults, that low level of risk will always be there, so that's an argument that can always be used.  For unvaccinated adults where the risk is higher, they've had about 7 months to get vaccinated.  If they aren't vaccinated now, its on them.  It shouldn't be on children to continue the burdon of wearing a mask 40 hours a week to protect adults who won't protect themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

Its also the fact that after 5 months of teenagers being allowed to get vaccinated, that half still havent, and there are still mask mandates in highschool, that I expect similiar results for grade schools.  That's why I dont trust people in power to ever give up the power and allow us to return to living.  Living requires risk, and always wearing masks is no way to live.  As I proved here, outside of literally the small amount of places that are at risk of hospitals overflooding, any argument used to require masks now, can be used to require them for eternity, as COVID is now certainly endemic.  Therefore, I think mask mandates should go away now.   The vaccines are a great risk reduction tool with little impact on quality of life.  I consider forcing kids to wear a mask 40 hours, with no logical end insight to be too big a burdon for too little a risk.   I hope as many people get vaccinated as possible, but for the people who choose not to get vaccinated, that is their risk, and not the burdon of society to negatively alter their life forever to protect against.   Since COVID is never going away, we either wear masks forever, or arbitrary pick a date later on when we arbitrarily consider the death level ""acceptable"" since most places are no longer at risk of hospitals overflooding.",,,,1634832657,{},hhi7phx,False,t3_qcoy1r,False,False,t1_hhhyww1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qcoy1r/children_should_continue_wearing_masks_in_school/hhi7phx/,1634972645.0,26,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An important challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic has been to understand asymptomatic disease and the extent to which this may be a source of transmission.

Studies have considered whether the prevalence of asymptomatic disease is determined by differences in age, demographics, viral load, duration of shedding, and magnitude or durability of immunity. It is clear that adaptive immunity is strongly activated during asymptomatic infection, but some features of the T cell and antibody response may differ from those in symptomatic disease.

Yet as I pointed out last week, L.A. County right now has overall 61% of their population fully vaccinated. Those who are 12 and older, only 70%. If you look in New York, for example, in the Bronx, 57% are fully vaccinated among those 12 and older, the Queens 71%, Brooklyn 57%, Staten Island 60%. There are lots of people left in the New York metropolitan area to become infected, and we've seen that from the other countries of the world where vaccination levels are much higher, like Singapore, like Israel. And yet we see what happens there. So all I can say is we're now more than a year and a half into this pandemic. And while that time might feel like an eternity to many of us, it hasn't been long enough to really figure out what this virus is going to do. I don't say that to shrug off or dismiss any of the remarkable work that researchers have done and continue to do at an international level. All the work is critical to understanding how we can limit the impact of this virus, but we still have so much left to learn. 

That is an excerpt from the latest Osterholm Update podcast.  

It is currently inexplicable why we have seen surges not only in low vaccination areas, like parts of Ozarks, Mississippi, Alabama, to more moderate vaccination areas, like Florida and even in highly vaccinated areas like Vermont.  Yet other moderately vaccinated areas, like NYC and LA County were largely spared.  

There is a lot we still don’t know, but to suggest that vaccines are not an important public health tool is just flat out irresponsible.

&gt;A booster shot of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is 95.6 per cent effective against Covid-19 compared with those receiving two shots and a placebo, the companies said on Thursday, citing preliminary results from the first randomised, controlled trial on boosters.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;In a trial with 10,000 participants who had all completed a two-shot Pfizer regimen, half were randomised to receive a further, equal-strength dose of the shot, and half a placebo.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Multiple subgroup analyses, the companies noted, showed that relative efficacy was “consistent” regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity or other underlying conditions.

Boosters should probably be made available to everyone.

This is a problem for global vaccine equity though. Still less than half the world has received even one shot.

In other words, general guidance for school children to be masked while the vaccine is rolled out to them has little to do with your work situation.  It could be that your company has some sort of exemption that is way too easy to get and so COVID is still spreading there and you don't know about it.  Perhaps they've gotten a discount on the insurance they provide you if they require everyone to wear a mask.  Maybe HR is just very lazy and they don't want to put effort into adjusting the rules.

The trick is to figure out when we can stop doing vaccines so that when a vaccinated person gets it, it's still mild, versus some vaccinated individuals getting it now that has been long enough from their final dose to make it a problem for them. Once that's figured out, then everyone will be pretty safe against it except unvaccinated children. But since it's very mild in infants apparently, they'll eventually catch it and have protection when they're older and it does more damage..

Finally, I was blown away when it began to hit me why people don't get vaccinated. It's this huge spectrum. Some are antivax, but more are scared for other reasons including 1) missing time from an hourly job because they've heard there can be side effects. 2) Concerns over safety (yeah I know, every shred of evidence says it's safe, but being concerned is different than being antivax). 3) Believing they don't need it because of prior infection. 4) Difficulty visiting vaccination sites. Especially true for people in rural areas or people without reliable transportation. 5) Fear of cost. Clearly we've had a huge problem of good communication. Some don't realize it's free. 6) Ignorance of risk. This one upsets me so much, but it's different than being antivax. I have friends and family that believe the risk to them from COVID is so low as to basically be zero. One family member got vaccinated right away because they knew they wouldn't see other family members if they weren't. This person has other vaccines and is not antivax.

&gt;In the trial, a booster dose administered to individuals who previously received the Pfizer-BioNTech primary two-dose series **r*****estored vaccine protection against COVID-19 to the high levels achieved after the second dose*****, showing a relative vaccine efficacy of 95.6% when compared to those who did not receive a booster**. These are the first efficacy results from any randomized, controlled COVID-19 vaccine booster trial.

So a reader who's not adept at interpreting these kinds of reports might think, ""95.6%? Yeah that does sound pretty much like the original stats about effectiveness after two doses, 95% or something, so yeah I guess it does restore effectiveness to that level.""

But saying that it ""restores effectiveness to the level seen after the second dose"" underrates the protection, since the stats for vaccine effectiveness after two doses were expressed as the reduction in risk relative to the *unvaccinated*, while the reduction in risk here is the reduction in risk relative to those who are *doubly vaccinated* (as the quoted text mentions). So they're sort of making an apples-to-oranges comparison at their own expense.

[],,GaitAtaxia,,,[],,,,text,t2_amjer,False,False,,"This is a really great question that we really won't know the answer to until we have more data over time.

Many vaccines need 2 or more doses in order to establish long lasting immunity, and that might be all that's needed here.

An alternative, and I suspect more likely, outcome is that immunity does wane after each booster, requiring routine booster shots (or some sort of re-exposure). Why? A combination of several things, but the biggest is the fact we are able to be reinfected by the endemic human coronaviruses yearly. Though the vaccines (mrna and viral vector both) are producing an excellent immune response, the mechanism of that immune response, on a fundamental level, is the same as natural infection. There are some slight pluses and minuses on the immunological level to immunity from natural infection and from a vaccine (though the vaccine has an obvious massive clinical benefit since you don't get the disease in the first place), but ultimately there is no reason to think that the vaccine will last substantially longer than immunity from natural infection.

Immunity from the vaccines starts waning in what seems to be a timeframe similar to the prior endemic human coronaviruses (under a year), and this natural infection to this coronavirus seems to be producing a similar picture. Add on to this ongoing genetic drift and some similarities in the spike protein and our own human receptors (meaning our bodies need to temper the immune response so as to not attack our own body - ie myocarditis), and I really think that this won't be a 3 and done type of vaccine.

All of this to say, we don't know and won't until we wait and see (and study). I suspect, if boosters prove to remain safe, we will have them in place for at least a few years. After that we might discover even the waning levels of immunity provide adequete ongoing protection from symptomatic protection and the young and healthy won't need boosters, while those at higher risk will require routine boosting (akin to what we currently do for several diseases).",,,,1634835561,{},hhif3rw,False,t3_qcp77g,False,True,t1_hhhj15a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qcp77g/pfizer_and_biontech_announce_phase_3_trial_data/hhif3rw/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,f4428f504931c0943120884840fae59df0488fe5,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1634835576.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Again your reasoning is wrong,  Vaccines wane in effectiveness.  They do not stop instantly on a specific day.  So for you to say ""good for vulnerable people until at least 6 months, but possibly not longer"" is not reasonable.  If as you say they are good for 6 months, then on 6 months and 1 day, which is longer than 6 months, you say they are possibly not effective, that is unlikely in terms of probability.

Thank you! I'm curious about this part: If you think of it as exposure acting like a free booster, would that mean that there's no upside to getting COVID for the first time, say, two years from now versus tomorrow? Maybe better hospital capacity by then? 

I ask because I've had friends say that they've decided to be less careful since they're most likely going to get COVID at some point, so might as well get it over with and get some of that ""free booster"" effect ASAP.

Here in Italy during the last days there has some discussing (even among public health experts) about the removal of the Green Pass and of indoor mask mandates once 90% of the population has been reached (ie. late this year-early next year). Obviously, it all depends on the evolution of the pandemic in the country and almost certainly if the situation worsened the measures would be extended. 

Anyway, in short, this leap forward by the French government worries me because there are too many times when so-called temporary measures (Patriot Act, 2015 French state of emergency) have then become permanent for no reason other than societal control, reducing civil liberties in the process.

We'll likely have vaccines for 5+ years in a few weeks, and it sounds like maybe only a few more months until we see availability for  6+ months. At that point, I think we are good. 6 months is a decent time where you can just sorta back away from much of life and take it very carefully until your kid is eligible. In a way, many parents already do that for much of that time. Many moms quit work. Dads take leave. For a large portion of society, even for those who return to the office, I suspect it will be common to have some variety of leave + virtual for 6 months until you are in the clear. And even that may be unnecessary. I believe I've read some research suggesting vaccination during pregnancy confers some immunity to the child. So that may be the easiest workaround.

HOWEVER....

Unfortunately, as long as there are still stories of people not being able to find an ICU bed in any hospital in the 5 closest states, I don't think we've reached that point on all measures. I feel that overburdening hospitals will soon be the last measure dictating how long this goes on for. And at that point, the irony is that the power to end this all will lie entirely in the hands of the people most desperate to end it, but least willing to take the appropriate steps. They want the reward, without the work that goes into it. So at that point, it's just going to be a matter of how long it takes for enough of them to get infected that they mostly have naturally acquired immunity and the burden on hospitals becomes negligible.

I have, but I feel like it's too large a topic to properly elaborate on (here at least), when talking about COVID-19. Just looking at the spectrum of responses to the disease, by locality, region, state/province or even country would give vastly difference values.
