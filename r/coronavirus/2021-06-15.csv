&gt;To understand why clotting happens, the researchers analysed blood samples that were taken from patients with COVID-19 in the Beaumont Hospital Intensive Care Unit in Dublin.

&gt;They found that the balance between a protein that causes clotting, called von Willebrand Factor (VWF), and its regulator, called ADAMTS13, is severely disrupted in patients with severe COVID-19. When compared to control groups, the blood of COVID-19 patients had higher levels of the pro-clotting VWF molecules and lower levels of the anti-clotting ADAMTS13.

&gt;The researchers also identified other changes in proteins that caused the reduction of ADAMTS13.

These are a few areas that the lab hypothesis is supported by.

*Molecular* \- the sequence of the genome suggests editing has taken place.  
*Phylogenetic* \- the group of viruses that SAR CoV2 belongs to are known not to have furin cleavage sites, and yet it shows up in sarscov2  
*Epidemiological* \- no sign of evolution early on, a period of evolutionary adaptation would be expected before the virus could spread to humans as it does.  
And then the circumstantial evidence that you have already said  you are familiar with.

It it certainly possible the virus learned several tricks to infect humans in the wild as it did, it is less likely to have learned these tricks in the wild than in a lab.   
This is not proof, and may very well be debunked.  However, it is not irresponsible to discuss the hypothesis.  

An aside - I feel we're talking past one another on a certain point.  I am not arguing that pandemics *have* to start in a lab. I never even suggested it.

The morally right answer to this should be yes but you also have go realize that a lot of people have struggled or shut themselves in for the last year or so. Mental health has been in a major decline because of all the restrictions. Wearing of masks (Just seeing full facial reactions and smiles can affect a persons mood) and continuing to keep places where people can socialize closed is hard on many people. Mental health will continue to grow worse and at some point the effects will be deadly (which I think is why I think some government officials are pushing for opening up). Humans naturally need a ray of hope or motivation to keep pushing on. 

You may not consider having public social interactions as more important then those sho can't be vaccinated but at a certain point it's hard to ask people to shut down and lower social interactions forever.

There's all sorts of vaccines out there, and if occasional binge drinking depressed vaccination effectiveness significantly there would be a general warning in society to avoid it for a couple of weeks purely based on prior knowledge from past vaccines.

I think it's safe to assume there's no issues.

The couple of things i would say is don't start drinking in the first couple of hours of the shot. Allergic reactions while insanely rare are most common in the first couple of hours, so it's just better to wait that out.

Also keep in mind you could end up with temporary side effects from the vaccine. I was pretty tired the following day after the shot, but it only lasted one day for me.

&gt;We have restrictions on stores and events (amount of visitors) and in restaurants (opening hours) but they're getting looser by the minute as we're getting vaccinated. Facemasks are an option.

please understand, misinformers try to portray as if Sweden had no casualties and took no measures, thus everything we did was useless.

Sweden had a relatively high casualty count and they did take many measures. Propaganda would have you believe otherwise.


&gt;We have a rule that state that you should wear a face mask on public transports during rush hours (06:00-09:00 and 15:00-18:00) but no more.

What do you think is more important... the rules you have or adherence to the rules you have?

Disciplined distancing is more powerful than mandated masking in places that do not want to mask.

""Here is everything you need to know about the Delta Plus variant of the coronavirus disease:

- Delta plus is resistant to the monoclonal antibody cocktail treatment for COVID-19 recently authorised in India.
- “One of the emerging variants is B.1.617.2.1 also known as AY.1 characterized by the acquisition of K417N mutation,"" Vinod Scaria, clinician and scientist at Delhi’s CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), tweeted on Sunday. The mutation, he said, is in the spike protein of SARS-COV-2, which helps the virus enter and infect the human cells.
- According to Public Health England, 63 genomes of Delta (B.1.617.2) with the new K417N mutation have been identified so far on the global science initiative GISAID.
- In its latest report on coronavirus variants, updated till last Friday, the health agency said Delta plus was present in six genomes from India as of June 7.
- Though there is no indication yet of the severity of the disease due to the new variant, say scientists.
- The Maharashtra government has sent a substantial number of samples from various districts for genome sequencing to verify if any new mutation of SARS-CoV-2 has taken place, with the aim being to identify a new Covid-19 variant Delta Plus or AY.1.""",,,1623830767,{},h1y2i7q,False,t3_o0zcmc,False,True,t3_o0zcmc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o0zcmc/new_covid19_variant_delta_plus_is_resistant_to/h1y2i7q/,1624132224,175,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

Basically it boils down to the message right?  It is a statistical anomaly. At the same time though, all spread of the virus is a statistical anomaly due to the level of dispersal. Something like 5% of individuals are responsible for something 90% of the spread (full disclosure: an approximation -- I don't remember the exact number off the top of my head). We tried highlighting dispersal early on but it was difficult for people to understand. So we can try to underscore how rare it is or we can accept that it does happen. Either way we are being truthful. 

But consider that even if the developed countries could hit 100% vaccination, there's no viable path to also get it done worldwide this year. Which means there will be no eradication, and we are thus dealing with successive iterations of spike mutations in unvaccinated populations that will then spread back into the vaccinated ones (or worse there could be a level of reservoir in developed countries as well if they don't get to the correct amount of vaccination). So that means even in vaccinated populations, we will then see increasing amounts of breakthrough cases, and vaccine makers will simply have to keep pace with that (which they've proven they can do evenhandedly).

To me the problem with emphasizing the rarity is that incidence will likely increase through evolution of the virus, and scientific discourse has already been discredited extensively in the public sphere. I think its better for public health that people perceive a small risk as real than to be lead to believe there is no risk. The really sad thing is that all of this is being politicized -- esp. in the United States where both parties are desperately trying to make it seem like the virus is gone.

Also, when seated, you don't even have to wear a mask (e.g. in cinema's). Sorry, but I will put doubt in the effectiveness of mask under the current circumstances and rules. 

Last year there was no mask mandate here, and the level of cases was low and stayed very low. Cases decreased rapidly, without mask, eventually to rose again, also without masks. Not having masks is not directly linked to having a positive trend CoViD spread trend, at least not here.

It is not that I am against masks. I have been wearing them indoors (outside my home of course) since last year, and still wearing a mask.

The getting others sick part isn’t confirmed but using the same analogy - if your dog didn’t give the thief a chance to get his bearings he likely won’t be able to run to your neighbor’s house and rob him too. In the viruses case though, the longer he’s in your house the more he multiplies into more robbers.

Without the vaccine/dog: let the thief ransack through your place as you sleep. Maybe he will hit up some neighbors too. Hopefully he won’t kill you. And yes he won’t come back because he already took everything.

Now imagine you’re given a different translation of the same text (a variant). Obviously, as with all translations, a few words are changed, different synonyms are used and, if your translation is bad, whole sentences are completely different or even missing. When that happens, it might happen that the words you remember are not in the document at all, so you might not be able to find the paragraph even if you had memorized half of it. 

The antibodies that a vaccine generates look for specific sequences or parts of the virus. If a variant suffers changes that either change the sequence or the structure that the antibodies are looking for, then they might not work as well

The woman, who has not been named, was identified as a 36-year-old living in South Africa.  
The coronaviruses gathered 13 mutations to the spike protein, which is known to help the virus escape the immune response, and 19 other mutations that could change the behavior of the virus. ......

Some of these mutations have been seen in variants of concern, such as:  
The E484K mutation, which is part of the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7, which was first seen in the UK).  
The N510Y mutation, which is part of the Beta variant (B.1.351, which was first seen in South Africa).

And since there was push to use it asap, they did not go again with the phase 3 to confirm the ""error"" dosage is actually correct one.. 
Ever since the time between doses was increased to 8-12 weeks the efficacy is comparable to Pfizer as per data from UK. And the more time passes it seems, the longer after 2nd dose, the stronger immunity is (thus we can probably expect higher percentage of efficacy for variants once more people will get 2nd dose and we will have better data)..

 The issue with short timing is that used vector is same for both doses (unlike Sputnik V) thus in short interval the immune system kills too much of the shot before it gets the job done..

Even sleeping outside many homeless folk form groups to sleep together, pool their resources, share tents, etc or going to food pantries puts them in crowded locations. 

And I imagine that at the beginning of the pandemic they might not be up to date with the latest covid news, so they wouldn’t know how it spread and didn’t have the knowledge or resources to take the precautions necessary. Is there enough outreach to homeless people to let them know the latest about vaccines? Are they in the loop about which demographics are allowed to get vaccinated at any given time? Do they know they don’t need insurance or payment to get the vaccine? If they do, are they able to get somewhere to get vaccinated? I imagine they can’t just walk in anywhere or make an appointment—I’ve seen homeless people on more than one occasion get kicked out of a store just for being homeless without the business waiting to find out if they have money or not. Are vaccination sites being open to homeless people? I know at the beginning many elderly people were having trouble making vaccine appointments because they had to be made online on complicated websites that quickly ran out of appointments, this would get a problem for homeless people too. 

And of course if they get covid they’re at the bottom of the list to get any sort of medical care. I had a homeless friend in hospital for kidney failure and I saw the way he was treated, they released him way too early after plying him with sedatives and painkillers to shut him up and there was no follow up, they wanted the bed for someone else. He didn’t make it. I doubt the situation improved during the pandemic when resources were scarce and that homeless people who might survive with proper care end up killed by the virus instead.",,,1623828544,{},h1y03b0,False,t3_o0lh6z,False,False,t1_h1x3zgj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o0lh6z/san_francisco_to_require_staff_in_hospitals_jails/h1y03b0/,1624130599,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

While it is literally true that more spread means more opportunity, in actuality the more people that aren't vaccinated, the less selection pressure there is on the virus to evade vaccine-induced immunity; the virus still has a large arena to replicate in. The variants that are arising just so happen to be a little better against our targeted vaccines.

The more worrisome situation is when a *large* proportion of the population is vaccinated yet there is still spread. Then we will see real pressure on the virus to evade vaccine-induced immunity. See [this](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0250780) paper for some research, which also contradicts the messaging that ""in order to evade our vaccines, the virus would have to become less fit/infectious"".",,,1623873395,{},h209hx0,False,t3_o0zcmc,False,True,t1_h1zm2cd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o0zcmc/new_covid19_variant_delta_plus_is_resistant_to/h209hx0/,1624181631,-6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Actually that's the exact opposite of what I'm saying. I'm saying that it is extremely scientific to analyze things under conditions that are not ideal. If we only used data from ideal conditions, then science wouldn't even exist!

The vaccine works and there is no need to obsess about going back to get a second, different vaccine. Because the virus is here to stay, boosters will be developed to keep up with the virus. Wait for a booster in several months and figure it out then.

I'm quite literally saying the same thing as you but youre putting up a strawman to argue with because you don't like the implication that the virus is spreading among vaccinated people. But as you admit that is known and expected phenomena. Again, I posted a link to the CDC website; the current guidance and consensus is that vaccinated individuals are less likely to spread the virus but the fact remains they will do so.

The only speculation I'm making is that puts us in a multiyear transitory period as we go from pandemic to endemic. So there is no reason to rush now and get a second vaccination when there's no research that documents the outcome. Like it or not, that's just the reality we inhabit. Sure maybe it will be fine if they go and get the Pfizer shot now but that's not good guidance.

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

A much better way to look at the data is instead to take the current number of cases and multiply that by 1 minus the efficacy of the vaccine.

[],,Vegaviguera,,,[],,,,text,t2_32oyd1fc,False,False,[],"&gt;The German company CureVac delivered disappointing preliminary results on Wednesday from a clinical trial of its Covid-19 vaccine, dimming hopes that it could help fill the world’s great need.  
&gt;  
&gt;The trial, which included 40,000 volunteers in Latin America and Europe, estimated that CureVac’s mRNA vaccine had an efficacy of just 47 percent, among the lowest reported so far from any Covid-19 vaccine maker. The trial will continue as researchers monitor volunteers for new cases of Covid-19, with a final analysis expected in two to three weeks.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We’re going to full speed for the final readout,” Franz-Werner Haas, the chief executive of CureVac, said in an interview. “We are still planning for filing for approval.” The company plans to apply initially to the European Medicines Agency. The European Union reached an agreement last year to purchase 405 million doses of the vaccine if the agency authorizes it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Independent experts, however, said it would be difficult for CureVac to recover. Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida, said that the vaccine’s efficacy rate might improve somewhat by the end of the trial. But because most of the data is already in, it’s unlikely the vaccine would turn out to be highly protective. “It’s not going to change dramatically,” she said.  
&gt;  
&gt;And with an efficacy rate that low — far less than the roughly 95 percent of competing mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna — the results did not bode well for CureVac’s shots getting adopted.  
&gt;  
&gt;“This is pretty devastating for them,” said Jacob Kirkegaard, a vaccine supply expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank in Washington.  
&gt;  
&gt;The news was disappointing to experts who had hoped the company could provide vaccines for low- and middle-income countries that don’t have nearly enough. CureVac had some advantages over the other mRNA vaccines, such as keeping stable for months in a refrigerator. What’s more, compared with its competitors, CureVac’s vaccine used fewer mRNA molecules per jab, lowering its cost.  
&gt;  
&gt;The trial results released on Wednesday were based on data from 135 volunteers who got sick with Covid-19. An independent panel compared the number of sick people who had received a placebo with those who had received the vaccine. Although the vaccine did seem to offer some protection, the statistical difference between the two groups was not stark, working out to an efficacy rate of 47 percent.  
&gt;  
&gt;Annual flu shots, by comparison, can reach 40 to 60 percent effectiveness. Both the World Health Organization and the Food and Drug Administration set a threshold of 50 percent efficacy to consider Covid-19 vaccines for emergency authorization. If CureVac were to stay at 47 percent in the final analysis, it would fail to meet that standard.  
&gt;  
&gt;The results caught scientists by surprise. The vaccine is made from engineered mRNA, the same technology used by the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. And CureVac’s shots yielded promising results in animal experiments and early clinical trials. “This one’s a bit of a head-scratcher,” Dr. Dean said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Haas blamed the disappointing results on the high number of virus variants in the countries where the vaccine was tested. Out of 124 of the Covid-19 cases that the company’s scientists genetically sequenced, only one was caused by the original version of the coronavirus.  
&gt;  
&gt;More than half of the cases were caused by variants that have been shown to be more transmissible or able to blunt the effectiveness of vaccines. CureVac’s volunteers were also infected by variants that have yet to be studied carefully. Lambda, which has come to dominate Peru in recent weeks, accounted for 21 percent of the samples.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Haas said that the results should serve as a wake-up call for the threat that new variants can pose to the effectiveness of vaccines. “It’s a new Covid reality, that’s for sure,” he said. Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech were tested last year before variants had emerged, which could partially account for their much higher efficacy rates. Even so, studies have found that their real-world effectiveness only drops moderately in the face of variants.  
&gt;  
&gt;Although many vaccine experts had seen promise for CureVac’s shots in much of the unvaccinated world, the new results cloud their outlook.  
&gt;

Very many didn't survive! They just had a lot more children. In ancient times something like 1/3 to 1/2 of children did not even survive to adulthood. Vaccines against serious childhood diseases are a huge key to that success.

You are only able to become skeptical of vaccines because you did not live in the age where horrible diseases, not just Covid but much worse, ravaged the populace constantly. Polio, whooping cough (pertussis), smallpox. I have 2 aunts and uncles that had polio as chilren and it was quite damaging for them, though they didn't get paralysis which can also happen to many.

&gt; Are we damaging our natural defense mechanism - immune system with every vaccine?

Absolutely not, instead you're training your natural immune system with a non-lethal or non-disease causing portion of the pathogen. So you get the benefit of a trained immune system without having to risk death or months long hospitalization of the actual disease. 

&gt; Some people have died recently after getting vaccine, why?

No medicine is 100% without risks. Especially when the vaccination program is for the entire populace, very rare side effects, even death, can be a result. Instead, you have to be able to understand the risk to benefit ratio of the risk of the disease and catching the disease vs. the risk of the side effects. It's many orders of magnitude less risk to take the vaccine. For example, in the US, there was one death due to blood clots from the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, and about 7 hospitalizations, and that was among the first 7 million people who got that shot. If 7 million people get Covid, we can expect something like 35,000-70,000 deaths. Maybe not 100% would get Covid during the next 1 year or so, but if nobody got any vaccines, possibly at least 1/3 or people would get Covid, so maybe 10,000-20,000 deaths would be the alternative to the one vaccination-caused death. Are you better off getting the vaccine? Yes! The few people who got very sick are a tragedy, but the level of risk is similar to the risk of car crash driving on the highway on your way to get the vaccine.

Through whole-genome sequencing at multiple time-points, we demonstrate the early emergence of the E484K substitution associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies, followed by other escape mutations and the N501Y substitution found in most variants of concern. This provides support to the hypothesis of intra-host evolution as one mechanism for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with immune evasion properties,” it added.

""Overall, a strong vaccine effect did not clearly manifest until at least 28 days after the first vaccine dose (HR 0·32, 95% CI 0·22–0·46; appendix p 3). Among S gene-negative cases, the effect of vaccination (at least 28 days after first or second dose) was to reduce the risk of hospital admission (HR 0·28, 95% CI 0·18–0·43) compared to unvaccinated. The corresponding hazard ratio for risk of hospital admission for S gene-positive cases was 0·38 (95% CI 0·24–0·58), with an interaction test p value of 0·19, suggesting that there was no evidence of a differential vaccine effect on hospital admissions among those first testing positive (appendix p 4).",,,1623872608,{},h207nly,False,t3_o0zcmc,False,True,t1_h204dhl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o0zcmc/new_covid19_variant_delta_plus_is_resistant_to/h207nly/,1624180538,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The Delta variant is serious. Here’s why it's on the rise.
The virus variant that caused infections to spike in the U.K. is now spreading in the U.S., and experts are very worried.

With vaccination rates slowing in the United States, and other countries struggling to secure vaccines, public health experts have growing concerns that the so-called Delta coronavirus variant, first identified in India in March, could trigger dramatic rises in cases and deaths in the U.S. and the world.

The Delta variant already accounts for 18 percent of cases in Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming, and about six percent of cases nationwide. It has already spread to more than 70 countriesand is now the most dominant variant in India, the United Kingdom, and Singapore. Last week, Delta caused more than 90 percent of the new COVID-19 cases in the U.K., leading to a 65 percent bump in new infections since May 1. On Monday, to curb Delta’s spread, the U.K. government decided to postpone “freedom day,” which would mark the end of public health restrictions.

The Delta variant is 60 percent more transmissible than the Alpha variant—first identified in the U.K.—which in turn was about 50 percent more transmissible than the ancestral Wuhan strain. “It’s a super spreader variant, that is worrisome,” says Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. It has features that enable escape from the immune system and is perhaps more evasive than the Beta variant (B.1.351) first identified in South Africa, which was the worst until now, says Topol. “Plus, it has the highest transmissibility of anything we've seen so far. It's a very bad combination.”

Dismayed by the trajectory of Delta in the U.K., Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned President Joe Biden last week, “we cannot let that happen in the United States.”

The President echoed those sentiments, tweeting “Folks, the Delta variant—a highly infectious COVID-19 strain—is spreading rapidly among young people between 12 and 20 years old in the U.K. If you’re young and haven’t gotten your shot yet, it really is time.” A complete dose of a COVID-19 vaccine is still effective at preventing serious COVID-19 stemming from Delta infection.

Why is the Delta variant so scary?
Freely circulating viruses, especially coronaviruses and influenza viruses, which encode their genetic instructions using the molecule RNA, mutate frequently and randomly due to copying errors introduced as they replicate in their human host cells. Some mutations enable the virus to evade antibodies; some enhance its ability to infect a cell; others go unnoticed since they yield no benefits or can even weaken it.

The key to Delta’s success is the collection of mutations the variant has accumulated in the spike protein, which covers SARS-CoV-2 and gives the virus its signature crown-like appearance. These mutations have changed the spike, and, as a result, some of the existing antibodies may not bind as tightly or as often, explains Markus Hoffmann, an infectious disease biologist at the Leibniz Institute for Primate Research in Germany. Hoffman has shown that Delta’s closely related Kappa variant evades antibodies that were generated through previous infection and vaccination; it also resists synthetically produced antibody therapies like bamlanivimab.

The Delta variant has mutations on the spike protein that alter how it interacts with the ACE2 receptor protein, which is found on the surface of lung and other human cells and is the portal to invade the cell. The mutation at location 452 of the spike protein, which is also present in some of the California variants, appears to make the virus more transmissible and helps it spread through the population, explains Mehul Suthar, an immunologist at the Emory Vaccine Center.

If a mutation gives a virus a fitness or reproductive advantage, that mutation tends to evolve independently around the world. Delta, its closely related variants, and the highly contagious Alpha variant all carry a mutation at position 681 of the spike protein, which is thought to be an evolutionary game changer that also makes it easier for SARS-CoV-2 to invade the host cell and spread. This mutation is fast becoming common in COVID-19 viruses around the globe.

In addition to these mutations a recent study, not peer reviewed, shows a variation at position 478 on Delta’s spike that enables the virus to escape from weak neutralizing antibodies. This mutation has also become increasingly common in SARS-CoV-2 variants in the U.S., Mexico, and Europe since early 2021.

“When you have all of these mutations, then you start seeing a difference in infectivity (of the virus),” says Ravindra Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge, who has shown in an unpublished studyhow these variants can have a greater potential to cause disease.

Vaccines less effective against this super spreader
The data from India and the U.K. show that Delta has emerged as the dominant variant in those countries within four to six weeks. That indicates Delta is more transmissible and infectious than the previous variants. There is emerging evidence that it can also cause more severe disease. For example, in Scotland it caused about twice as many hospitalizations than the Alpha variant, which already caused more severe illness than the original SARS-CoV-2.

“This combination of high transmissibility, high severity, and escape from vaccines makes Delta a very, very dangerous variant,” says Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist at Queen Mary University of London. Once Delta enters a country, it is going to spread rapidly. “It's going to be quite hard to contain, and very likely will become the dominant variant in a matter of weeks. It could change the trajectory of the global pandemic.”

While vaccines are still effective against severe disease and hospitalization caused by the Alpha and Beta variants, they offer less protection against Delta. People who were vaccinated with one or two doses of the Pfizer vaccine produced lower levels of antibodies capable of neutralizing the Delta variant compared with the levels generated against Alpha and Beta. In the U.K., 31 percent of all confirmed Delta variant patients who needed emergency care had received at least one vaccine dose.

Similarly, a study under review revealed that after both doses, the Pfizer vaccine showed 88 percent effectiveness against symptomatic disease caused by the Delta variant compared to 93 percent against the Alpha variant. Two doses of AstraZeneca vaccine were 66 percent effective against Alpha but only 60 percent against Delta. But with just single dose of either of the two vaccines, the vaccine effectiveness was only 51 percent against the Alpha variant compared to 33 percent against Delta. This effectiveness falls below the 50 percent efficacy threshold the FDA had set for designing safe COVID-19 vaccines; in which a vaccine should prevent at least half of the vaccinated people from getting COVID-19 symptoms.

In other studies still awaiting peer review, researchers report that Delta was responsible for most breakthrough infections—which occur after full vaccination—in India leading to a cluster of such cases among fully vaccinatedhealthcare workers.

There are many vaccine candidates being rolled out around the world and since there are no agreed international efficacy standards, each vaccine might offer a varying degree of protection against new variants. “We need more information about the performance of some of the more widely available vaccines in other parts of the world,” says physician and virologist Benjamin Pinsky of Stanford University School of Medicine. “I think folks need to make sure they get vaccinated. And until they are fully vaccinated, continuing with public health intervention is very important,” he says.

A vaccine alone only slows down the progression of a contagious disease by increasing the herd immunity. Until that point, preventive measures such as social distancing and masking are proven strategies for curbing the spread of the virus.

With just 44 percent of the U.S. population fully vaccinated, the majority of people are still vulnerable. Relaxing public health restrictions and declaring victory prematurely could provide an opportunity for the Delta variant to surge–particularly in the fall.

A study, not yet published, suggests the possibility of seasonal variations in COVID-19 incidence based on analyses from a full year of the pandemic in Europe and Israel. While the virus’s seasonal trends may not be clear yet, says Topol, we do know that when people spend more time indoors with poor ventilation and low humidity the virus spreads more rapidly.

What is happening in the U.K. could occur in many places worldwide. “We should keep social distancing after vaccination, because there will always be possibilities of breakthrough infection because vaccines can still be imperfect against emerging variants,” says Kei Sato,a virologist at the University of Tokyo, Japan, who has been studying the effect of mutations on the transmission of Delta and other emerging variants.

“The more variants like this spread, especially in unvaccinated individuals, the more these viruses mutate and eventually pick up mutations that allow for more efficient antibody escape. This could, in theory, make the current vaccines even less effective against these variants.” Suthar cautions.

If we don’t take Delta seriously, “there will be a further wave in the U.S. We can already see the fall in cases has plateaued,” cautions Gupta. Topol agrees that if we ignore this variant “we’ll have a significant rise in cases in vulnerable areas, more hospitalization, and the pandemic here will last longer.”",,,1623871715,"{'gid_1': 6, 'gid_2': 1}",h205l5p,False,t3_o1cfx1,False,False,t3_o1cfx1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o1cfx1/the_delta_variant_is_serious_heres_why_its_on_the/h205l5p/,1624179313,3177,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,25,[],,

I’m vax’ed but choose to still mask inside for pretty much all of the reasons given:

\- the workers still need to mask. I may be a customer but that’s an awkward amount of privilege to be unmasked interacting with someone who has to do it all day. 

  
\- Not all unvaxxed people are unvax by choice. Until real herd immunity levels are reached, they are still at risk. Kids are also at risk for more problems from some of the variants.

\- It may help someone feel better about standing next to me in line.

\- I’m vaxxed but I can still catch, carry, and spread it. 

\- Breakthrough infections are occurring, if rare. Vaxxed ppl dying is more rare but still possible. The vax side-effects were bad enough that I really want to continue avoiding the real thing.

  
\- I made fabric masks which fit me well and are not uncomfortable or annoying to wear.

\- my masks block me from smelling stinky people.

\- I don’t trust strangers and can’t ID an anti-vaxx COVID farmer on sight.

To which you responded:

&gt;Yes it is.

So bugger off with your ""I'm going to bullshit around about efficacy vs. effectiveness"" because when they said efficacy, you said it's calculated with your initial calculation.

Because efficacy vs. effectiveness the only difference is real world vs. clinical trial.

You don't suddenly get to toss aside having a control group and just divide cases by population and call that an effectiveness.

And like, mate, look at this entire post of yours:

&gt;Dude. Yes. .0000002 is such a small number that it doesn't matter what you divide it by, you will end up with 100% effectiveness.

&gt;600,000 unvaccinated Americans have already died from COVID, there aren't enough of us left to die to move the needle off of 100% effectiveness.

It's total nonsense.

If we took the time to figure out the number to divide your .0000002 (sic) by in order to find efficacy or effectiveness, it would also be a number that has a lot of zeros in front of it. 

And 600,000?  Yeah, that number needs a SHITTON of manipulation in order to be usable against your 400.  Basically impossible to do manipulation since the big factors you'll need to account for are degree of spread and effectiveness of other treatments and there's basically no clean way to do the second factor and with availability of testing being massively different throughout the pandemic it's impossible to accurately gauge spread from now all the way back to March.",,,1623866937,{},h1zugc6,False,t3_o157mg,False,True,t1_h1zoqrd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o157mg/i_work_on_cruise_ships_we_cant_get_back_to_normal/h1zugc6/,1624172580,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

So you just don't know what the word torture means. That explains a lot. It's 100% far away because one is being offered a choice, and the other is *fucking torture*. And even if you're so stupid you think making a decision and extreme physical harm are even remotely comparable, *he never confessed.* So you apparently don't know what torturing *a confession out of someone* means either.

You apparently don't know what burden of proof is or how courts work either. If they went to court the burden of proof would still be on the prosecution because if all they did was say ""I think he did it"" and sat down I would bet my life savings he would be found not guilty. The prosecution still needs to prove that he did it before he would be found guilty. The defense would then need to show he did not do it. Just like any trial ever. It doesn't matter if he was offered a 2 year probation or 5 years in prison or genital mutilation in the plea deal. Once he got to court the burden of proof is exactly the same as it would have been regardless of the plea deal, the plea deal did not magically change the way trials work. I can't believe I need to explain this.

&gt;the state telling anyone to admit their guilt or risk spending 10 years in prison is wrong

You are *exactly* saying that charging anyone with a crime that would require prison is wrong. Going to trial for any charge is risking the penalties. Again, it is completely irrelevant what the plea deal is. If you go to trial, you risk getting the sentence. If the plea deal was 5 years in prison instead, he still would have ""to admit \[his\] guilt or risk spending 10 years in prison"" and according to what you said, immoral. Again, I don't understand how you don't understand this.

Your entire argument is assuming that it's equally likely that an innocent person and a guilty person will be found guilty. According to your logic it would be better to force an innocent person to decide between 5 years in prison vs 10, instead of 2 years probation vs 10 in prison. That's completely illogical. The rational decision is that an innocent person goes to trial and gets found not guilty and does no time at all. If that isn't the case then *that's the problem.* I don't know how you think the problem is the plea deal being offered and not that you think it's so easy for an innocent person to be found guilty. And again, I don't know why you keep ignoring this, it's still irrelevant because *the guy was guilty.*

Seriously, just go back to where this all started. Someone said *this guy* played a stupid game. You then went on this giant idiotic ""what if what if what if what if"" rant about innocent people that had nothing to do with what was being discussed. In very simple terms, just explain how *this guy, in this situation* did not play a stupid game by going to trial.

Maybe, but I didn't come and present myself as a 'forest scientist' and take a public position.

&gt;You can jerk yourself off about “truth” or whatever but I think when someone lies to achieve a desirable end result, sure it’s a lie, but it ends up with net positive for society.

First off his action did not actually result in net good. It eroded trust in the medical system and made the anti-maskers feel justified. His flip-flopping is one of the biggest reasons Americans refused to wear masks. His lies had disasterous consequences. And since after this lie no one trusted him, we couldn't coordinate a pandemic response. There is no way that his action actually resulted in the greater good. 

&gt;But I guess if truth is more important to you than society’s well-being, it’s a good thing you’re not in charge of people’s lives.

You are misunderstanding a politican and a scientist. A politician does lie, yes, for the sake of the people. A scientist who lies is no longer a scientist. So what you say may be true, but if it is true Fauci is not a scientist. No one should respect him as a scientist. He is merely a politican with a science background.

In that case, what I hate most is the lie in how he presents himself. He presents himself as objective while lying. Again, that is not harmless. He has eroded trust in the medical system. I'm sure a huge percent of those who refuse vaccines remember his earlier lie. Do you really think lying is a good long-term strategy in a pandemic?

Also, I think there's a chance there will be an increase of cases in the US, just like in the UK. First of, the US overall is less vaccinated, both in terms of partially vaccinated and fully vaccinated, than the UK. And the UK is rapidly increasing its protection, while the US is relatively basically at a standstill. So if the UK has a rise in cases with their higher levels of vaccinations, what prevents a rise in cases in the US? On top of that, in certain areas, mostly rural, the level of vaccinations is extremely low in the US. This is often combined with no restrictions (or not following them). So there's basically almost nothing preventing COVID-19 rise due to the Delta variant in these areas. The only thing you can hope on is that the spread is limited due to the low density.

We all had the same symptoms minus the weird rash and purple toes /hands. We were dying for over a week, but I ended up getting pneumonia on top of it and being really, really sick for over 3 weeks.

I've got asthma too, so I really couldn't breathe and ended up using my nebulizer I hadn't touched in years every few hours for a week. I probably should have been hospitalized. My Dr put me on aleve to get rid of the fluid in the sacs of my lungs. Maybe a week later my hair started to fall out in huge clumps. I've got long very thick hair, so this was incredibly odd and alarming. I figured it must have been the aleve. After that experience I was terrified when covid started. I was sure I'd die if I caught it since I was so incredibly sick with just pneumonia. Now that we know more about covid I wonder if we all had it.
