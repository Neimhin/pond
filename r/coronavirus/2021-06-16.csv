And 38.3% unvaccinated rate among that population is definitely too high, but maybe it's slightly less terrifying than the 47.3% value? I guess?

First, the UK got hit. Terrible wave with lots of deaths. Vaccinations barely started.

Then the EU got hit. Lots of cases and also a rise in deaths. But even close as bad as the other waves. Probably due to limited vaccinations, which were going slow in the EU. It was not enough to prevent most of the wave.

After that it was the US turn for a B.1.1.7 wave. But because they were hit by B.1.1.7 later and had a successful vaccination campaign, they managed to stay ahead of most of the wave due to vaccinations. But they definitely still had a tiny wave.

What these three waves with the alfa variant show, is that vaccinations is enough to control spread and any waves with this variant. The US managed to prevent a wave mostly due to vaccines, and the EU and UK used the vaccines to control spread of the alfa variant after/during the waves.

Now what the Delta variant has shown is a lot more worrying.

&gt;It is due to expire on June 20, and the minister overseeing Japan's coronavirus response said the government would seek to move Tokyo and nine other regions to looser restrictions.

&gt;‚ÄùWe'd like to consult today (with medical experts) about placing 10 prefectures... under quasi-emergency measures,"" Yasutoshi Nishimura said at the start of a meeting with the advisers.

&gt;The looser restrictions would ask restaurants and bars to close at 8pm, but allow them to serve alcohol until 7pm, lifting the current ban on sales.

The reason polio was eradicated was that the vaccine contained disabled virus particles so the imune system could train a more diversified response against all proteins of the virus that are exposed.

Furthermore I don't think the media have done their due diligence on the current vaccine approval process there's still a lot they haven't done right or at all, for example we were told it stays in the arm but FISA documents from Japan shows within 15 min the shell lipids have been found in the whole body, same with spike pieces and there are studies showing that the spike itself is biologically active and cytotoxic. Lastly they never checked toxicity and reproductive effects in primates or humans just mice, this would never have been released for the general public under normal conditions.

Which brings me to my last point this is a phase 3 trial where no data is gathered by the producers running the study about side effects they're relying on the various public databases for it which haven't cooked under the wave of new reports (larger number of reports this year on vaccines then all other 70+ vaccines over 30 years).

All I'm saying is that there are unknowns about efficacy and safety and you should be better informed before taking a decision like using this as yet experimental therapy on your children, there have been cases in the past like Thalidomide that passed through the regulations system got mass adoption and 4 years later it was proven to be a tragedy, we have systems in place now with the FDA and they were all skirted for these medications.",,,1623922161,{},h22k6pj,False,t3_o1cfx1,False,True,t1_h226k1r,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o1cfx1/the_delta_variant_is_serious_heres_why_its_on_the/h22k6pj/,1624236197,-7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

1. We are controlling the UK (alpha) variant that is currently spreading. This indicates a high level of immunity (through shots and prior infections). 
2. It was likely we always were going to get an exit wave. The summer isn't a bad time to get it, since the seasonality of the disease. Delta hitting in winter would be a much worse situation. 
3. People are worried about future, more resistant variants, which is fair. But we will have some advantages: high levels of immunity to previous strains, and it is unlikely a variant makes vaccines 0% effective. It is harder to see serious spread if everyone has some immunity. Second, there is a booster in progress for the Beta variant, the most immune evasive.

&gt;On Tuesday, health authorities found no new confirmed cases in Guangzhou, a city of over 15 million people which became China‚Äôs new Covid hotspot.

&gt;The first new case, a 75-year-old woman, was detected on May 21. It was the first time the delta variant of the virus, first identified in India, was detected in China.

&gt;Authorities were concerned because of the highly transmissible nature of the variant and took action swiftly.

&gt;Liwan, in the west of Guangzhou, had parts of the district locked down. People were not allowed in or out of these areas except under special circumstances. Some restaurants had to close, while others operated take-out only or at a reduced capacity.

&gt;Health workers lined the streets of Guangzhou to carry out mass coronavirus testing on the population. Tens of millions of people have been tested in the last two weeks.

&gt;Meanwhile, police in Guangzhou fined and detained individuals who allegedly broke laws such as not wearing masks in public, or not cooperating when asked to take a coronavirus test.

&gt;Evolutionary history of apples: Domesticated apples (Malus domestica) have been cultivated from a wild-type [Malus sieversii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malus_sieversii) in asia. I'll only talk about the wild types, since I think that is what you are really interested in. DNA has confirmed that it is likely only this one species which we domesticated to give the varieties of apple we see today. This is not the case for oranges...which have a very complicated and hotly debated history. Apples are part of the family rosaceae, originating sometime the cretaceous. I can't be more explicit on when apples specifically arose.

&gt;[Oranges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit): They have a very complex history. Mostly because you can cross-breed just about any citrus species and get a new variety of fruit. Its a nightmare to tease apart. But from what DNA tells us true oranges are a mix (or hybridization) of 2 species: ""The orange is a hybrid of ancient cultivated origin, possibly between pomelo (Citrus maxima) and mandarin (Citrus reticulata)"". So I'll drop oranges, because they do not have a single wild ancestor and focus in on the citrus group, it being the group we can actually compare to apples. Oranges are part of the genus [Citrus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrus). They too originated in Asia.

&gt;""The taxonomy and systematics of the genus are complex and the precise number of natural species is unclear, as many of the named species are hybrids clonally propagated through seeds (by apomixis), and there is genetic evidence that even some wild, true-breeding species are of hybrid origin. Cultivated Citrus may be derived from as few as four ancestral species. Natural and cultivated origin hybrids include commercially important fruit such as the oranges, grapefruit, lemons, some limes, and some tangerines"" Oranges, and citrus species are part of the same family [Rutaceae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutaceae).

&gt;So oranges and apples are not part of the same family (or the same order for that matter), so they are very distantly related. But they are both flowering plants so that puts them closer together evolutionary speaking, then to say the conifers, or ferns, or mosses.

Clearly when everyone in a population is susceptible to infection¬†R¬†and¬†R0¬†will have the same value, but assuming some degree of immunity is produced, however short term,¬†R¬†will decrease as the infection spreads whereas¬†R0¬†by definition remains constant.

So I think what you are talking about is actually the value ""R"". I am speaking about ""R0"". These terms seem to have been used interchangeably recently and think that's the miscommunication here. 

You are right in your definition of ""R"" which is confirmed my source here:
The (effective) reproduction number¬†R¬†takes into account the actual susceptibility of the population and is defined as the average number of secondary cases induced by a typical case. For diseases in endemic equilibrium,¬†R¬†will have an average value of 1. In reality¬†R¬†is constantly fluctuating.¬†

Umm, kinda not really. Vaccine derived immunity is more consistent and consistently stronger. Both in previous vaccines for other diseases and the Covid-19 vaccines. 

We find a bunch of non-neutralizing antibodies generated by infection, mostly neucleocapsid antibodies. I seem to remember that some of these were made preferentially by the immune system.

Also, some of the proteins made by the virus aren't part of the virus, they're there just to mess up the immune response.

More than a third of tests last week came back positive, the IFRC said.

‚ÄúAfghanistan is at a crisis point in the battle to contain COVID-19 as hospital beds are full to capacity in the capital Kabul and in many areas,‚Äù said Nilab Mobarez, Acting President of the Afghan Red Crescent Society, in a statement released by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

The surge was putting intense strain on a country where millions already live in poverty and health resources are scarce.

Health authorities on Thursday registered 2,313 positive cases and a record 101 deaths from COVID-19 in the last 24 hours. Officials and experts have said low testing means those official figures are probably a dramatic undercount.

Afghanistan‚Äôs fragile health system has been damaged by decades of war. Violence has risen in recent months, with U.S.-led foreign forces withdrawing by September and peace negotiations between the Afghan government and insurgent Taliban largely stalled.

Major hospitals have closed their doors this week to new COVID-19 patients after an influx of cases left them with a lack of beds and oxygen shortages.

The IFRC warned that lack of vaccine access and hesitancy were exacerbating the situation. Less than 0.5% of Afghans have been fully vaccinated.

Around 700,000 doses of China‚Äôs Sinopharm vaccine arrived in the country last week, allowing authorities to start the next round of its vaccination campaign.

The IFRC was working with Afghan authorities to provide more resources and try and boost medical oxygen production, according to Necephor Mghendi, the head of Afghanistan Country Delegation for IFRC.

To my knowledge, the problem for vaccination efficacy in the context of autoimmune disorders isn't that you have an autoimmune disorder (for the most part), it's that the autoimmune disorder is often treated with immunosuppressants. That's not the case for Hashimoto's though.

Any side effects that pop up now due to increased sample size will be so rare that if the vaccine were an OTC medication it wouldn't even be required to list it (and indeed many common OTC medications have serious side effects which are usually considered so rare as to not be worth mentioning - and these side effects are an order of magnitude more likely than anything that's going to be found for the vaccines). It's at the level where if you really worry about that low likelihood you certainly shouldn't drive, or at least use a 5 point harness and wear a helmet when you do. I'm not being snarky - that's a low effort way to significantly reduce your risk of dying from head or chest injuries in a car crash which, compared to the probabilities we're talking about here, is downright likely. But none of us are going to do that. Paracetamol (tylonel/acetaminophen) hasn't been in wide use in the US until the 70s (it was available without a prescription by the 50s but wasn't used as much). What would you think of someone in 1995 turning down Tylonel because they wanted to see what happens to the large cohort of people from the 70s after 30 years?

If you want full empirically demonstrated evidence of the vaccine's safety after 30 years you'll need to wait 30 years.

Anyway, one of the theories, I think, is that while natural immunity can obviously offer some protection, it may not protect as well as vaccines against variants. The existing vaccines target the spike protein - which also happens to be the virus's way into our cells. If the spike protein mutates too much, it renders the virus useless.

On the other hand, natural immunity may or may not target the spike protein. Our bodies may find another part of the virus to attack. And it will be totally successful. However, if this part mutates and the spike protein remains unchanged, reinfection can occur.

&gt;In a note sent to staff, seen by NPR, the embassy says 114 people ""have COVID and are in isolation; one has died, and several have been medevaced."" The note goes on to say that military hospital ICU resources are at full capacity and that the embassy has been forced to ""create temporary, on-compound COVID-19 wards to care for oxygen-dependent patients."" Most of the cases involve individuals who are unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated.

How many Americans are working at the embassy in Afghanistan? I can‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a high number.

This is a horrible way to do this, as this number will only increase, unlike efficacy which is a much more accurate way to gauge how much vaccines protect you.

I personally feel that the CDC and many politicians have purposefully encouraged this incorrect math by not correcting it as it makes vaccines seem way better than they are - which is already very, very good. However, the downside is not only losing trust long term from the people who figure out the math is being skewed, but also that people put more trust in the vaccines than they should. I can't count the number of times recently on this very subreddit that I have read that if you keep wearing masks after you get vaccinated, then you are as bad as an antivaxxer because you aren't following the science, when in reality the science says that vaccines protect you 66-95%, which is incredibly good, but maybe not ditch all protections immediately good.",,,1623964059,{},h24x829,False,t3_o1z69f,False,False,t1_h23rsyi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o1z69f/dr_fauci_says_the_risks_from_the_delta_variant/h24x829/,1624290246,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Alpha is likely around 4 and Delta is around 6.  Measure that can knock 2/3 of the transmissions out (distancing, masks, etc.) will put flu's R to well below 1, so flu dies out.  Original COVID gets knocked down to around 1, so there's still a slow burn of transmission.

Torture often involves the decision to give the torturer what they want or suffer more pain. Telling someone they can tell you want to hear, or get water boarded. Is still choice, it just isn't much of a choice because one of those things extremely unpleasant.

&gt;And even if you're so stupid you think making a decision and extreme physical harm are even remotely comparable

Decisions can often result in extreme physical harm. If you think 10 years in American prison isn't extreme physical harm, you have no idea what prison is.

&gt;Going to trial for any charge is risking the penalties. Again, it is completely irrelevant what the plea deal is.

No, it's not. In another cases [they put a man to death who was likely innocent because he refused to take a plea and admit guilt](https://www.aclu.org/news/criminal-law-reform/coercive-plea-bargaining-has-poisoned-the-criminal-justice-system-its-time-to-suck-the-venom-out/). He was Black and represented by a public defender in a racist state and time. The state killed a man for refusing to admit guilt, to a crime he likely didn't commit, because he refused to confess to it. That's a problem.

&gt;According to your logic it would be better to force an innocent person to decide between 5 years in prison vs 10, instead of 2 years probation vs 10 in prison. That's completely illogical. The rational decision is that an innocent person goes to trial and gets found not guilty and does no time at all. If that isn't the case then that's the problem.

An innocent person would not feel as pressured to accept a plea for a crime they didn't commit if the disparity in penalties wasn't so large, and actual criminals wouldn't get off with a slap on the wrist. This guy was a danger to society and never should have been offered anything less than prison, because that's what his crime deserved. The wild disparity between the sentence he was offered in a plea deal, and what he would get at trial is the problem.

Courts aren't always going to get the outcome right. An innocent person accused of a crime knows that, and will take it into consideration when deciding whether or not to accept a plea. You're right he was stupid not to take the plea, but the problem is that would be true regardless of his guilt.

This is far from the only problem in the justice system, but it is a big one. It gives prosecutors more power than should have and tilts the system of justice toward the prosecution.

Variants have already emerged that are able to partly escape immunity due to spike protein mutations. This is a particular concern with the delta variant, which is now taking hold in the UK despite fairly widespread vaccination (admittedly, they have not yet reached herd immunity). 

As another example, in Canada, where we've relied on a delayed-dose schedule to give as many people as possible their first vaccination, the delta variant is of great concern because, to a much greater degree than with other widespread variants, a single dose of any vaccine is relatively ineffective it stopping infection. 

Granted, we're still fortunate because being fully vaccinated with either of the mRNA vaccines still provides excellent protection against every existing VOC. But we only know this because of clinical trials that are confirming it. Every time a new VOC spreads, we collectively breathe a sigh of relief when data is published showing that vaccines are still quite effective (if slightly less than before), because the possibility always exists of a new VOC emerging that escapes immunity to a greater degree. 

As far as the alpha (UK) and delta (Indian) variants go, they can wreak havoc in a place like Canada, for example, where we might have had moderately successful public health interventions, because they emerged in countries huge numbers of people became infected due to overly lax public health interventions. By the same token, areas of the world with limited vaccine uptake or limited vaccine supply are going to continue seeing the widespread circulation of Covid-19, and are potentially going to generate new variants that can pose a genuine threat even to places with relatively high vaccine uptake.

So far the beta (South African) variant has shown the greatest degree of vaccine escape, but it hasn't taken hold outside SA because it isn't quite as infectious as the alpha or delta variants, if I recall correctly. It's a matter of degree, and it's foolish to dismiss the concern, because VOCs like alpha and delta have been surprisingly infectious and and virulent, and incredibly damaging. By allowing large virus pools to remain in the human population, we're virtually guaranteeing that new, more dangerous variants will emerge in the future.

I found this regarding different dosing times for az. Honestly I didn‚Äôt know the recommendations had changed. I haven‚Äôt paid a ton of attention to az since it never got approval in the US. 

I‚Äôd like to see a lot more data before I believe that 12 weeks is actually superior. Here‚Äôs my big issue:

They start measuring efficacy starting 2 weeks after dose 2. It doesn‚Äôt matter if your interval was 4 weeks or 12 weeks.

This will necessarily confound the results. Is 12 weeks better, or does protection after 2 doses continue to build for several weeks longer than is being measured? For example‚Ä¶

Dose 2 given at 4 weeks to group a. After 12 weeks to group b. If you start measuring infections at week 14 for both groups, would there actually be a difference? Is group b getting more infections in the gap between 6-12 weeks that could have been prevented with a shortened interval?

I went into the sources and found this:

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2821%2900528-6/fulltext

Canada received a loan of 1.5M from USA, 500K from India, and Korea will provide some to come (600K) through COVAX.

I think USA supplied more that this initial loan which would cover the around 300K gap.

The good news, to the extent there is some, is that the most concentrated population centers are also the areas with the highest vaccination rates. Democrat run cities, as Trump republicans like to call them, tend to be more vaccinated meaning the denser-populated areas where the virus can spread easiest are also the most protected.

Naked RNA in cells is a danger signal - it usually signals that a RNA virus is trying to hijack a cells function. Inside our cells there are receptors called toll-like receptors (TLRs) that can detect different variations of RNA. 

When TLRs are triggered, it leads to a signal cascade response that shuts down translation and other immune responses.

&gt;Honestly, I wouldn't mind permanently losing my sense of taste. If donuts and ice cream suddenly taste the same as cabbage and kale, eating healthier would immediately become much easier.
&gt;
&gt;I'd miss my sense of smell, but I already don't have a great nose anyways, so it's not a huge loss.

You raised the fear that you won't recognize the symptom, and that's a legitimate fear. But let's pretend we don't have to worry about the death flue apocalypse for just a moment.

Is my assessment right? Is it easier for you to eat healthier now?

Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, can occur after any vaccination. If this occurs, vaccination providers can effectively and immediately treat the reaction. Learn more about COVID-19 vaccines and allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.

&gt;* Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) after Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs Janssen (J&amp;J/Janssen) COVID-19 vaccination is rare. As of June 7, 2021, more than 11.2 million doses of the J&amp;J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine have been given in the United States. CDC and FDA identified 35 confirmed reports of people who got the J&amp;J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and later developed TTS. There is a plausible causal relationship between J&amp;J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and TTS. Women younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare but increased risk of this adverse event. There are other COVID-19 vaccine options available for which this risk has not been seen. Learn more about J&amp;J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and TTS.

&gt;* To date, **one** [emphasis added] confirmed case of TTS following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (Moderna) has been reported to VAERS after more than 292 million doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered in the United States. Based on available data, there is not an increased risk for TTS after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.

&gt;* Myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination are rare. As of June 9, 2021, VAERS has received 623 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis among people ages 30 and younger who received COVID-19 vaccine. Most cases have been reported after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna), particularly in male adolescents and young adults. Through follow-up, including medical record reviews, CDC and FDA have confirmed 268 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis. CDC and its partners are investigating these reports to assess whether there is a relationship to COVID-19 vaccination. Learn more about COVID-19 vaccines and myocarditis.

&gt;* Reports of death after COVID-19 vaccination are rare. More than 302 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from December 14, 2020, through June 7, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 5,208 reports of death (0.0017%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it‚Äôs unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines.

This is still false. I am not sure what you were trying to contrast with in this statement because you state this and then you say the following.

&gt;Even with the vaccine, you can still get infected

This is true and although it's considerably lower it's not low enough for it to be disregarded which is why lockdowns are in place until a majority of the population are vaccinated. If it weren't the case vaccinated people would have a free pass to do whatever they want a week after their second shot. 

&gt;will also reduce transmission.

It reduces transmission by 25 times iirc although I don't remember which vaccine specifically this metric is for, all of them will be around the same ish value tbf. This is only if people are fully vaccinated. I already know this. Which is why I used the word 'stop' instead of reduce.

I could be wrong but I can see it quickly getting out of control despite the lockdown and border restrictions. 

It might have been manageable still perhaps. Everyone would have to cooperate. And that seems to be where the problem would lie.

Also its stupid to still have to be masked everywhere while I see all the rest of the countries in my continent without masks outside (the only have it indoors and in public transport) while our country, which is still as good in the covid race as the rest, refuses yet to remove the outdoors mask mandate: we have currently the most restrictive mask mandate in the entire world, as the other country that still had outdoors mandate just removed it today.

Assuming the analogy is only describing noticeable/hospitalization cases and we're saying asymptomatic or mild cases are equivalent to the tiger not attacking (which I think is a little bit of a stretch but I'll concede it) then the analogy makes sense, but I'm still not completely sure it's true.

The CDC website still says (last updated June 11, 2021):
&gt;There is some evidence that vaccination may make illness less severe for those who are vaccinated and still get sick.

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html

which is admittedly a less conclusive statement than
I would have originally thought, but still suggests to me that it is the working theory. I wish they linked to the studies that showed that, but I couldn't find it.

I initially felt the need to push back a bit since I feel I've heard a fair amount of evidence that if you catch covid and are vaccinated then you're more likely to get an asymptomatic or very mild case. It's hard to tell based on the CDC website if that's true. It seems like they don't really care since they say:
&gt; As of May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned from monitoring all reported vaccine breakthrough cases to focus on identifying and investigating only hospitalized or fatal cases due to any cause.

But if you remove that from the discussion and treat those cases as not catching covid then what you said doesn't sound wholly false to me, although still up for debate.

This is fundamentally very different from human coronaviruses or influenza.

It is commonly and falsely claimed that diseases spread to be more contagious and less deadly.  Diseases mutate at random - full stop.  The mutations that spread are the more contagious ones, and because of COVID's low baseline severity there is no selection against increased severity.  Most of the lineages we've seen that are more contagious are suspected to be more deadly.

We could see that kind of mutation with other endemic viruses, but because they've had so much more time to optimize themselves for human coexistence the odds are just lower.

6% of deaths were from people without known health risks. 
www.livescience.com/amp/covid-19-comorbidities.html

So that's 36,000 American deaths from people who weren't old, overweight, etc.  And you can't exactly fault the elderly, age isn't something we've conquered. Even if you assume 3/4 of the elderly had health conditions due to poor life choices, you'd still be looking at over 100,000 deaths in the over 65s.

(600,000 deaths x 0.72 (percentage of deaths over age 65) x 0.25  117,000)



And then we also know around 10% of everyone known to be infected experiences some long COVID symptoms.

All the cases in the northern provinces of Bac Giang and Bac Ninh are associated with existing outbreaks in the provinces' industrial parks. With Thursday‚Äôs tally, the number of local infections in Bac Giang from this wave has crossed 5,000.

48 cases in HCMC had made contact with confirmed Covid-19 patients, 10 are associated with the Christian mission cluster that emerged late last month, two with the city's locked down Hospital for Tropical Diseases, and two others are being contact traced to find the sources of infection.

All the cases in Ha Tinh and Lang Son are of people who'd come into contact with confirmed coronavirus patients.

In the new wave that started in late April, 8,914 local infections have been recorded in 40 cities and provinces.

Bac Giang has the highest number of infections with 5,007 cases, followed by Bac Ninh with 1,454 and HCMC with 1,197.

 There were no vaccines and even then some people were anti-maskers. After the virus seemed to vanish it came roaring back remorphed and on steroids striking down people in all age groups within 24 hours of infection. People hemorrhaged blood from the nose and mouth, some turned blue.  People collapsed on the job or in the street -- or just never rose out of their beds.

 Wagons went door to door collecting the dead. There was one anecdote when  after a grieving father's little boy was bundled into the body wagon,  he asked them to wait so that he could find his son's toy to be buried with him in the mass grave.  Who was it that said ""the price we pay for love is grief?""

Historians have wondered why much wasn't written about  that surge. Some speculate that it was because the ""survivors"" suffered from post traumatic stress disorder.

1) A published, peer-reviewed article is always preferable to preprint. Particularly this year, many studies have been widely circulated before publication, only to require substantial edits before any reputable journal would publish them. There isn‚Äôt anything in this study that seems outrageous to me, though.

2) My primary takeaway is that vaccinated people have more anti-spike antibodies than people who were infected. I may have missed something, but I didn‚Äôt see that they controlled for how long ago the infection occurred. It seems that all vaccinated samples must have been collected within 2 months of vaccination. That could skew results.

3) The bottom line is that we‚Äôre interested in protection, not immune response. At this point, there should be enough data to compare the protection from the vaccine to the protection from infection.

It won't be reduced at all without any restrictions if the Rt is still above 1,0.

The reason why doctors recommend vaccine to patients post covid is that's it's defensive advice and that there are some people who will falsely assume that they had covid without a PCR or lab serology test. 

WHO too claimed in June 2020, that there was no evidence of post infection immunity when it was clear that reinfection was pretty rare. That's most likely because they didn't want to have ""infection parties"" where people got deliberately infected.

Naturally, our bodies produce lots of *different* antibodies when exposed to the Spike (whether it comes alone or as part of the whole virus). Each mutation can potentially defeat one of them - but not all. There's a question whether a variant could ever have enough changes to the Spike's shape to appear ""totally different"" to our immune systems, yet still be the right shape to function (remember, Spike works by latching on to the ACE2 receptor in our cells: those aren't changing, so a different shape of Spike just wouldn't fit).

Monoclonal antibodies are better than nothing for patients without their own antibodies, of course, but very narrow and easy to escape compared to the variety we produce in response to either infection or vaccination: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.17.431683v1

I think it's encouraging that even monoclonal antibody therapies have held up so long against variants so far: they're the least flexible, so should be the first to ""fail"" (ie need updating/replacing to address new variants).

We don't know how high mutation rate will be in a 90% vaccinated population. Maybe variants will develop that can reliably infect vaccinated people, and with which vaccinated people can infect other people, but which isn't dangerous to them. Maybe another variant will show up with escapes our vaccines, and we need a booster.

We don't know. To some extent, we'll just have to wait and react. What we know for sure is that with another year of restrictions, we will soon have students with a bachelor's degree who have never met one of their peers. THIS will be a problem.

Novavax is incredibly promising because it's a protein vaccine that just floods the body with spike protein. It could be the best for booster shots since it's a high dose and should give very high sterilizing immunity. This is reflected in the 96% efficacy against the classic strain - but that dropped to ""just"" 90% in the mix of currently circulating US strains,  and 50-60% against Beta. This drop was predictable since it does not infect cells like mrna and vectored vaccines do. Once they switch to multivalent (a mix of spikes,  especially classic and beta and whatever the next bad spike protein is) it should be highly effective against all lineages.  It also has a very good side effect/safety profile and is easy to store (refrigerated).

Blood clots:
The incidence of blood clots from the vaccine have primarily come from the Janssen Johnson and Johnson vaccine. This one is not the MRNA vaccine and instead is a viral vector vaccine. It‚Äôs also the vaccine I received back in early March.  In the middle of April there were reports of a rare and severe blood clot cases found in six individuals who received the vaccine. After a ten day pause recommended by the FDA and CDC, that number increased to 15 people out of 6.8 million doses administered. Here is J&amp;J‚Äôs initial statement from April 13 (https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-statement-on-covid-19-vaccine-updated). After the pause and review of the cases, the CDC and FDA allowed for use of the vaccine to continue as the vaccine‚Äôs known and potential benefits outweigh the risks. Here‚Äôs a link to the press release (https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/fda-cdc-lift-vaccine-use.html) and here was one of the presentations with information regarding rate of potential side effects per million doses on slide 36 (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-04-23/06-COVID-Oliver-508.pdf). As you can see in the high risk age group (women aged 18-49) the risk of the blood clots is 7 cases per million. For clarity, I myself along with a few family members who received this vaccine fall into this group and had no side effects outside of mild to moderate flu symptoms. Yes, seeing 7 cases can be a little scary, but the odds are in your favor. Actually, seeing that there was an entire investigation into just 15 cases out of almost 7 million doses increased my confidence in the safety of vaccines. I‚Äôll let someone else cover the myocarditis information and long term effectiveness. But spoiler alert, the myocarditis risk from vaccines is lower than the risk of myocarditis after COVID-19.

Not quite right on the length of vaccine protection and type of protection.

By my calculation just about everyone will eventually get infected with one of the variants of they live long enough. The only question will be how bad the short and long term effects will end up being. 

If people are vaccinated there will be consequences X, Y, Z with associated probabilities. 

If they aren‚Äôt vaccinated there will be consequences A, B, C with associated probabilities.

Binary choice with unremovable uncertainties. If that looks like an inescapable gamble you are seeing the situation correctly. Most people dislike gambling with their health and would rather leave that in the hands of a trusted doctor, etc.

It matters a lot for controlling the outbreak though. If the sequencing comes back identical to a known source (eg someone current in hotel isolation) then it's not too much of a problem, it should be able to be contained using contact tracing techniques. If it's not from a known source then it means the government will need to lock down the city because it means there's unknown carriers out there in the wild.

Throwing away a band-aid doesn't heal the cut.

People stay home, not because of the masks themselves, but because they don't want to be exposed to a nasty pathogen.  Yeah, the younger you are,  the less nasty it is -- but that doesn't mean you want to get it (and pass it on), even if you're a kid.

My observation from within my community is anyone whose vaccination status I know (because they told me) are continuing to wear masks.  Judging by looks alone (because that's all I have, due to the lack of verification), it looks to me like it's the less-responsible people who are unmasking.  This is the opposite of building trust and irresponsible people are the people we need to keep the kids away from in COVID-world.

If you want get people out of lockdowns, you need to **build trust**.  Ending the mask mandate and reverting to the honor system **did not inspire trust**, and so lots of people (myself included) will continue to stay home for a while longer.

If that same vaccine has a 75% chance to protect you, and EVERYONE gets it, then (depending on R, etc) you effectively have a 0% chance of getting it, because we're all protecting each other.

At the state level, there aren't really that many. [Only five states have yet to fully reopen](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html). 

Washington and Michigan have dates set for reopening (June 30 in WA, July 1 in MI.) However, WA could still reopen sooner if they hit a 70% vaccination rate among those 16 and older; they're currently [at 67.2%](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/DataDashboard).

The three other states that have vaccination thresholds for reopening are pretty close:

* New Mexico's threshold is 60% of eligible residents fully vaccinated; they're currently [at 58.7%](https://cvvaccine.nmhealth.org/public-dashboard.html).

* Oregon's threshold is 70% of those 18 and older having received at least one dose; they're currently [at 54.7%](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.health.authority.covid.19/viz/OregonCOVID-19VaccineEffortMetrics/StatewideProgress) on that metric.

* Hawaii's threshold is 70% of residents being fully vaccinated; they're currently [at 55%](https://health.hawaii.gov/coronavirusdisease2019/what-you-should-know/current-situation-in-hawaii/#vaccine), though 61% of residents have gotten at least one shot.

Oregon seems furthest away from its goal (which is especially significant as Oregon's goal looks to be easier to hit than Hawaii's goal as it's only counting those 18+ rather than all residents, or even all eligible residents), but overall, there really aren't that many places that are still holding out on reopening, at least on the state level.",,,1623888793,{},h215991,False,t3_o18xcy,False,True,t1_h20aq6p,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o18xcy/pockets_of_unvaccinated_americans_threaten_to/h215991/,1624201997,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

‚ÄúLess than 1% of our hospitalized COVID patients are vaccinated,""he said.

And at Sanford Health, which runs 44 medical centers and more than 200 clinics across the Dakotas, Minnesota and Iowa, less than 5% of the 1,456 patients admitted with COVID-19 so far this year were fully vaccinated, said spokesperson Angela Dejene.

 National Injury Bureau
Falling rates of COVID-19 across the United States mask a harsh reality ‚Äì the overwhelming majority of those getting sick and being hospitalized today are unvaccinated, while vaccinated patients are becoming rare.

Hospitals in states with the lowest vaccination rates tend to have more COVID-19 patients in intensive care units, according to hospital data collected in the past week by the Department of Health and Human Services and vaccination rates published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Wyoming, Missouri, Arkansas and Idaho currently have the highest percentage of COVID-19 patients on average in their ICUs; those states all have vaccinated less than 40% of their population. 

Medical centers say there's also an obvious change in the age of their sickest patients, as older people are much more likely to be vaccinated than younger.

""We're all seeing the same thing ‚Äì when someone does get sick and comes to the hospital, they're much more likely to be young and unvaccinated,"" said Dr. Robert Wachter, professor and chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.

Cathy Bennett, president and CEO of the New Jersey Hospital Association, said the picture is the same in her state.

""As COVID vaccinations rolled out across New Jersey, there‚Äôs been a major shift in the ages of patients admitted to the hospital,"" said Bennett. ""Unlike last spring, when those 65 and older accounted for the majority of hospitalizations, we‚Äôre now seeing more young people hospitalized with COVID.""

In Ohio, Salata said the shift should be reassuring, showing the vaccines work.

""It sends a very strong message to the hesitancy people out there because the data speaks for itself,"" he said.

'It's not all about you'

Doctors say there are multiple reasons people aren't yet vaccinated. There are the hesitant, who still have questions and sometimes fall prey to misinformation, and the opposed, who often harbor anti-government or anti-science sentiments.

""We've had a little success when we've spoken to them on a one-to-one basis. We can give them the information that they need to make their decision,"" said Dr. Gerald Maloney, chief medical officer for hospital services at Geisinger health network, which runs nine hospitals in Pennsylvania.

Some still can't easily access vaccine, either because it's not available nearby or because they can't get time off work.

And while the U.S. government paid for all vaccines and vaccinations so no one should be charged, others remain fearful they will be on the financial hook for a shot, Maloney said.

Last week, Health and Human Services secretary Secretary Xavier Becerra clarified in a letter that providers may not bill patients for COVID-19 vaccines.

There's still a lot of work to be done to create the trust necessary for these groups to embrace vaccination, Maloney said.  

""The people who say, 'It's my body, my choice?' Well, it's not all about you,"" he said. ""It's also about the people that you're around.""

At this point, every vaccination is a win, one more person who can't pass the virus along. That's especially true in families where children can't be vaccinated and are still at risk.

At Akron Children‚Äôs Hospital in Ohio, ‚Äúwe have not seen any kiddos who have been admitted to the hospital who have been vaccinated,‚Äù said Dr. Michael Bigham, a pediatric intensivist in the critical care unit.

Among children 11 and younger, who can‚Äôt yet get the vaccine, having vaccinated family members is keeping them out of the hospital, and protecting them against MIS-C, the multisystem inflammatory syndrome that can be a rare but dangerous aftereffect of a COVID-19 infection in children.

‚ÄúMost of the kids we‚Äôre seeing in the hospital with COVID or MIS-C had COVID in their household, maybe a parent or a grandparent, and most of those individuals had not been vaccinated,‚Äù he said.

The message from health care workers is unanimous: They just aren't seeing many vaccinated people get sick. 

In New Jersey, the percentage of COVID-19 hospitalizations among those ages 18 to 29 has increased 58% since the beginning of the year. By comparison, the percentage of COVID-19 hospitalizations among the 65 and older age group ‚Äì with a statewide vaccination rate of more than 80%  ‚Äì declined by 31.2%.

The numbers are no coincidence, Bennett said.

But now, nearly every admitted patient he does see is unvaccinated.

‚ÄúLess than 1% of our hospitalized COVID patients are vaccinated,""he said.

In Ohio, at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, only 2% of the COVID-19 patients admitted in the last month were vaccinated, said Dr. Robert Salata, the hospital's physician-in-chief.

 Hills Pet
And at Sanford Health, which runs 44 medical centers and more than 200 clinics across the Dakotas, Minnesota and Iowa, less than 5% of the 1,456 patients admitted with COVID-19 so far this year were fully vaccinated, said spokesperson Angela Dejene.

 National Injury Bureau
Falling rates of COVID-19 across the United States mask a harsh reality ‚Äì the overwhelming majority of those getting sick and being hospitalized today are unvaccinated, while vaccinated patients are becoming rare.

Hospitals in states with the lowest vaccination rates tend to have more COVID-19 patients in intensive care units, according to hospital data collected in the past week by the Department of Health and Human Services and vaccination rates published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Wyoming, Missouri, Arkansas and Idaho currently have the highest percentage of COVID-19 patients on average in their ICUs; those states all have vaccinated less than 40% of their population. 

Medical centers say there's also an obvious change in the age of their sickest patients, as older people are much more likely to be vaccinated than younger.

""We're all seeing the same thing ‚Äì when someone does get sick and comes to the hospital, they're much more likely to be young and unvaccinated,"" said Dr. Robert Wachter, professor and chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.

Cathy Bennett, president and CEO of the New Jersey Hospital Association, said the picture is the same in her state.

""As COVID vaccinations rolled out across New Jersey, there‚Äôs been a major shift in the ages of patients admitted to the hospital,"" said Bennett. ""Unlike last spring, when those 65 and older accounted for the majority of hospitalizations, we‚Äôre now seeing more young people hospitalized with COVID.""

In Ohio, Salata said the shift should be reassuring, showing the vaccines work.

""It sends a very strong message to the hesitancy people out there because the data speaks for itself,"" he said.

'It's not all about you'

Doctors say there are multiple reasons people aren't yet vaccinated. There are the hesitant, who still have questions and sometimes fall prey to misinformation, and the opposed, who often harbor anti-government or anti-science sentiments.

""We've had a little success when we've spoken to them on a one-to-one basis. We can give them the information that they need to make their decision,"" said Dr. Gerald Maloney, chief medical officer for hospital services at Geisinger health network, which runs nine hospitals in Pennsylvania.

Some still can't easily access vaccine, either because it's not available nearby or because they can't get time off work.

And while the U.S. government paid for all vaccines and vaccinations so no one should be charged, others remain fearful they will be on the financial hook for a shot, Maloney said.

Last week, Health and Human Services secretary Secretary Xavier Becerra clarified in a letter that providers may not bill patients for COVID-19 vaccines.

There's still a lot of work to be done to create the trust necessary for these groups to embrace vaccination, Maloney said.  

""The people who say, 'It's my body, my choice?' Well, it's not all about you,"" he said. ""It's also about the people that you're around.""

At this point, every vaccination is a win, one more person who can't pass the virus along. That's especially true in families where children can't be vaccinated and are still at risk.

At Akron Children‚Äôs Hospital in Ohio, ‚Äúwe have not seen any kiddos who have been admitted to the hospital who have been vaccinated,‚Äù said Dr. Michael Bigham, a pediatric intensivist in the critical care unit.

Among children 11 and younger, who can‚Äôt yet get the vaccine, having vaccinated family members is keeping them out of the hospital, and protecting them against MIS-C, the multisystem inflammatory syndrome that can be a rare but dangerous aftereffect of a COVID-19 infection in children.

‚ÄúMost of the kids we‚Äôre seeing in the hospital with COVID or MIS-C had COVID in their household, maybe a parent or a grandparent, and most of those individuals had not been vaccinated,‚Äù he said.

The message from health care workers is unanimous: They just aren't seeing many vaccinated people get sick. 

In New Jersey, the percentage of COVID-19 hospitalizations among those ages 18 to 29 has increased 58% since the beginning of the year. By comparison, the percentage of COVID-19 hospitalizations among the 65 and older age group ‚Äì with a statewide vaccination rate of more than 80%  ‚Äì declined by 31.2%.

The numbers are no coincidence, Bennett said.

When you have extraordinarily rare events coming through, it's extremely difficult to make a link (keep in mindthat CVSTs, though very rare and quoted to be approx. 4 in a million, do still occur in the general population) and so as you can imagine, it's very hard to determine there to be a causative event. All reported events would have been documented (so to say that they found zero clotting events isn‚Äôt accurate, they would have had reports and it would have been available to see), but because of the population being vaccinated at first, it could very well be that the events were similar to what we'd normally expect. A lot of other countries were first reporting these events to be occuring in their younger population (which is why we're seeing the restriction of giving AZ to the younger people) whereas the UK didn't vaccinated this group until later (excluding front line/healthcare workers). Furthermore, there are literally hundreds ofthousands of reports that have been made with these vaccines, so unless you're actively looking for a link and unless the risk is several times greater thanthe normal expected rate, it can be very difficult to identify. Fortunately nowwe are 1) aware of the link and 2) have made the general population aware of these events and so to go by your question of ""who knows how many have had serious issues after their AZ shot‚Äù, I will say that it‚Äôs going to be a lot more accurate/reliable than it was previously since these reports are released on a weekly basis and are because of what we know now, we‚Äôre a lot more vigilant ofthese events and constantly looking out for them.

That is not the case. Something like 85% of their positives are IgM. IgM tests are finicky at the best of times and are notorious for giving false positives, especially at low levels.

I do apologize for that part. However New York had worst death rates because of the sardin level of housing in the metro area vs the rest of the state. Also Florida was only 15,000 rounded less than New York in the death rate department so not much of a margin there to really go off of when you compare the entire country. Also Michigan had even less cases and deaths than both New York and Florida. 

Michigan also has big restrictions in place for quarantine that are still in effect today. 

New York just now started lifting their restrictions due to high vaccinations and lowered cases showing up. 

Florida hardly has any restrictions in place nor did it in the beginning yet it had higher amount of cases than Michigan and almost on par with New York. 

Florida has an estimated 21.5 million population as per 2019, obviously that number is not correct anymore but it's the only number I can find right now so it's the base number to run with. 

New York has an estimated 19.5 million popular per 2019.

Michigan has an estimated 10 million population per 2019. 

Florida had 2.3 million cases with 37,265 deaths.

New York had 2.1 million cases with 52,955 deaths

Michigan had 996,275 cases and 20,808 deaths. 

Florida having the least amount of restrictions had by far the worst amount of cases with people sick which if you consider the long term effects of covid on the body, that's a lot of people who will die sooner than they should of from a preventable disease. Now New York had worst death toll because the hospitals became overwhelmed almost at once. 

So all in all, I'd say infection wise Florida did WORST with its least restrictive quarantine methods while New York had worse due to being hit all at once in a short time span. So your argument still doesn't stand because the states who did more restrictive quarantine actually fared better than those who didn't. 

If you wanna go even further. The countries who did the most restrictive have already recovered as if it never happened, such as South Korea and New Zealand.

I never said you have to take your mask off but getting more people vaccinated is the end goal and that's never going to happen if vaccinated people keep scaring antivaxx people by keeping on wearing masks.

There are also regulations about not producing components for more than 1 viral vector vaccine in the same facility in the US.

Your questions are quite reasonable and come from good observations. It's unfortunate that there is so much nuance here. The original commenter is disappointed that the reported efficacy means that community spread can no longer be stopped through vaccination alone. Things will not ever be as bad as in March of 2020, but we used to have a real shot at elimination. I'll just give you formula they are using to determine what percentage of the population needs to be vaccinated to reach the fabled herd immunity. Let S be the percentage of the population need to vaccinated for a vaccine with an efficacy E. Let R0 be the average number of individuals that an infected person would infect if no one else in the population had any immunity. Then

 S = (1-1/R0)/E

The original virus had R0=2.5 (depending on who you ask) and if we use the Pfizer vaccine with E=95%=.95, we have S=(1-1/2.5)/0.95=.63 or 63%. In this case, elimination is entirely plausible. With the delta variant, we have R0=6 (according to the original comment, I've heard 5.4 up to 6.5) and Pfizer is 79%=.79=E for this variant. Now S=(1-1/6)/.79=105%! Given that we can't vaccinate more than 100% of the population, herd immunity is entirely impossible. So yes, covid is here to stay. It's not the end of the world. Just disappointed.

Why? If 85% of the population is vaccinated, then these 85% are vastly less at risk than if they were unvaccinated, even if they all get infected.

&gt; As I already mentioned, without any restrictions the vaccination rate would have to be at or above 90% to avoid runaway with R&gt;1,0, assuming the Delta dominance.

Ok, but a runaway infection of people with a virus that overwhelmingly doesn't harm them doesn't really matter, does it?

&gt; Delta already dominates and so far the virus has evolved toward becoming more infectious and not getting less deadly. It would evolve to become less deadly only if a large share of the population would die OR if evolving to become more infectious would require it to become less deadly. But evolving to become more infectious actually seems to make it more deadly, so far.

I'm still not really buying into the ""speculating about how it might evolve to make decisions"" thing. Anything might happen with evolution of diseases.

&gt; Subunit vaccines (raw antigen)
&gt; 
&gt; These vaccines involve directly injecting the antigenic molecule. These are called subunit vaccines because the antigen is one piece of the whole pathogen. For sars-cov-2, the only reasonable choice for antigenic molecule is the spike protein. By itself, the spike protein cannot cause any infection, as it is missing the rest of the virus, in particular the virus‚Äôs genome.
&gt; 
&gt; Such vaccines are generally manufactured by creating recombinant cells (usually bacteria, but sometimes yeast, insect, or mammal) which contain the gene for the spike protein. These cells are grown and harvested, and then the spike protein is purified from the result.
&gt; 
&gt; (In theory these vaccines could be manufactured by growing the pathogen directly; in this case, conceivably improper purification and sterilization could result in a vaccine accidentally causing the disease. However I‚Äôm not aware of any vaccines made this way, and sterilization can be done very reliably.)
&gt; 
&gt; NVX-Cov2373, by Novavax, is a protein subunit vaccine in phase III trials. Various sources describe a protein subunit vaccine by Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical as in phase II or III.

&gt;How is herd immunity achieved?

&gt;There are two main paths to herd immunity for COVID-19 ‚Äî infection and vaccines.

&gt;**Natural infection**

&gt;Herd immunity can be reached when enough people in the population have recovered from a disease and have developed protective antibodies against future infection.

&gt;However, there are some major problems with relying on community infection to create herd immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19:

&gt;    **Reinfection. It‚Äôs not clear how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. Even if you have antibodies, it‚Äôs possible that you could get COVID-19 again.**
&gt;    Health impact. Experts estimate that in the U.S., 70% of the population ‚Äî more than 200 million people ‚Äî would have to recover from COVID-19 to halt the pandemic. This number of infections could lead to serious complications and millions of deaths, especially among older people and those who have existing health conditions. The health care system could quickly become overwhelmed.

&gt;**Vaccines**

&gt;**Herd immunity also can be reached when enough people have been vaccinated against a disease and have developed protective antibodies against future infection.** Unlike the natural infection method, vaccines create immunity without causing illness or resulting complications. Using the concept of herd immunity, vaccines have successfully controlled contagious diseases such as smallpox, polio, diphtheria, rubella and many others.

&gt;Herd immunity makes it possible to protect the population from a disease, including those who can't be vaccinated, such as newborns or those who have compromised immune systems.
