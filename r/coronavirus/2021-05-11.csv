But, also, vaccines don't work for everybody. That's why ""herd immunity"" matters. If everyone gets vaccinated, the few people for which the vaccine didn't take will be protected by herd immunity.

There are people that will get vaccinated, follow all of the guidelines, recommendations and restrictions, and they'll still get sick or spread Covid around.

And, the entire time the virus is spreading, it's mutating. So, if we can't knock out the infection altogether, we can expect variants to emerge and all of the work we've done could be wasted.

[],,Kensin,,,[],,,,text,t2_4nbrl,False,False,[],"&gt; , it seems to me that the solution to the problem of the virus circulating is for unvaccinated people to get vaccinated and wear a mask until they can reasonably expect their immunity to kick in. 

I 100% agree! That is absolutely the ideal, but it won't solve all of our problems. Some people will absolutely choose not to get the vaccine. Some want the vaccine but can't get it yet. Some cannot take the vaccine even if they want it. Vaccinated people who are infected with the virus can even pass the virus to other vaccinated people! That's why the real solution is to reduce the spread of the virus in your area. That will benefit the unvaccinated (whatever their reasons) and the rest of us as well. 

&gt; Vaccinated people wearing mask, while it may signal good faith intentions, doesn’t seem to have a tangle impact.   

Absolutely not true. Not only are masks effective at reducing the spread of the virus from vaccinated people to the unvaccinated (from whatever the potential of that turns out to be) but it also helps prevents vaccinated people from catching the virus which is very important in places where community spread is very high and vaccinated people are constantly challenged by the virus thanks to a bunch of infected unvaccinated people.    

Mask wearing when you're around only other vaccinated people isn't risky enough to be needed (although I suppose it can't hurt if you really wanted to), but wearing a mask while you're hanging around a bunch of unvaccinated people some of which are likely making irresponsible choices is a smart move no matter how you look at it as long as the virus is circulating widely in your community.  

It means that you're not only protecting the unvaccinated (many of which will become vaccinated over the next few weeks) but you're also helping to reduce the number of breakthrough cases which further lowers the level of community spread!     

Yes, when someone who refuses the vaccine gets infected that's nearly certainly their own fault, but that doesn't mean their getting infected doesn't negatively impact the rest of us either. The more the virus is spread in your area the more everyone (vaccinated or not) [will be impacted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/na0gbq/cdcs_slow_cautious_messaging_on_covid19_seems_out/gxt9rk3/). Yes, protecting the unvaccinated means that some willfully unvaccinated people may ""get away with it"" and not face consequences for their actions, but I'm not about to punish myself just to make them suffer for their choices. 

Right now, while the virus is still circulating heavily, wearing a mask to protect people who are waiting to get the vaccine and to help lower the spread of the virus in your community is simply the smart thing to do. As the number of vaccinated people increase and the degree of community spread decreases it will be less and less important which is exactly what the experts in this article are telling us.",,,1620793471,{},gxtfv9i,False,t3_na72f4,False,True,t1_gxt9c2l,/r/Coronavirus/comments/na72f4/got_the_vaccine_experts_say_you_can_relax_about/gxtfv9i/,1620834911,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

While Sinovac defended its different clinical results, he stated that there is evidence that CoronaVac performs better in the real world.  
Sinovac CEO Yin Weidong stated that they have given a license to Indonesia, Brazil, Malaysia and Egypt, along with Turkey, to produce the vaccine in their countries.  
Speaking to Bloomberg, Yin stated that they provided enough vaccines to Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey to vaccinate 20 percent of the population, but this was insufficient.  
In this context, Yin stated that they started the licensing process for the production of vaccines.  
In an interview with Bloomberg, Sinovac CEO Yin Weidong stated that while defending different clinical results, there is evidence showing that CoronaVac performs better in the real world.  
Real life results showed high efficacy  
CoronaVac, the CoronaVac vaccine produced by Sinovac Biotech Ltd., achieved high efficacy results in real-life observations among healthcare professionals in Indonesia.  
Indonesian Minister of Health Budi Gunadı Sadikin told Bloomberg that 25,374 healthcare workers with the Sinovac vaccine were followed up for 28 days after receiving their second dose. According to the information given by Sadıkin, the vaccine prevented 100 percent loss of life among the monitored group and provided 96 percent protection against hospitalizations.  
Sadikin gave the information that Kovid-19 transmission was prevented by 94 percent in the monitored group. It is not clear whether asymptomatic cases are included in this ratio announced by the minister.  
Sadıkin explained, “We have seen a huge decrease in loss of life and hospitalizations among healthcare professionals”.  
Results in Indonesia point to higher efficacy than results obtained from third phase studies of the vaccine. In studies in Brazil, the effectiveness of the CoronaVac vaccine was only over 50 percent.

The vaccines are extremely effective — dramatically cutting the risk of any symptoms, and driving the risk of hospitalization and death to nearly zero.

Vaccination makes me essentially safe,” William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, told me. “There’s accumulating evidence, too, that breakthrough cases are less likely to transmit (they have lower viral loads), so by being vaccinated I’m already helping protect others. But I’m also going to continue with behaviors consistent with lower contact rates in the community overall. As more and more are protected through vaccination, I’ll feel less and less of a need for that.”

(assuming mRNA vaccines, ignoring vectored vaccines) 

You want long term safety data for a vaccine for a disease that's existed in humans for less than two years? Not the most reasonable request.

Now, it doesn't matter anyway, because there will be only one effect of the vaccine that lasts longer than a few weeks : immunity to Covid-19.

How can I know?

There's nothing left of the vaccine in you after a week or two, so there's nothing there to cause any side effects.* 

Find me an example of a side effect from a vaccine approved for use in the US, that didn't show up within four months, but that did show up after 6 months, in more than 0.01% of those vaccinated. 

Kids have had the vaccine in trials for five months. Adults, coming up on almost a year. 

Getting infected is worse than the vaccine.

Not only due to supply but also due to ne central system for doctor to organize vaccinations with the people.

Now enter the discussion about giving vaccinated people their rights back. Like in door dining going to bars, vactation. All of this close to summer in an election year.

Chaos ensures. Suddenly ~40mil people are eligable but the doctors office cant organzie centrally and their supply sometimes isnt secured until 2 days before they can make appointments. Its a mess.

Vacciantion centers will not open to the great public, they will stay open only for people with prioritization due to preconditions or Job. At least for a while, but maybe wven for the whole campagin.




In short. Millions of people are now rushing because they want their freedom back but we have no way to channel this demand. We could maybe supply the vaccines in adequate numbers but have problems orginazing it. People get frustrated, try to cut any line possible, dont play by the rules. The system brakes. People get angry at the wrong people (Doctors offices).

You are overestimating the effectiveness of vaccines then.  To be clear, they are really, really good and everyone should get vaccinated. But they don't make you immortal.

95% efficacy means that if 20 unvaccinated people would get symptomatic COVID, if they are all vaccinated it is instead just 1 person getting COVID.  The vaccine reduces your chance of getting COVID to 1/20th the chance compared to if you were unvaccinated.   But if you start doing things that are more than 20X as likely to give you COVID than before, you can actually be MORE at risk.

And that's not even counting the fact that the vaccines are less effective against some variants.  For example, the mRNA vaccines are estimated to be about 75% effective against the California variant.  So if 4 unvaccinated people would have gotten symptomatic COVID, only 1 vaccinated person would.

Perhaps kids are/were less prone to infection and death. However their numbers have been slowly creeping up, when compared to an adults. Is it because of the new variant/s that are widely circulating now in the U.S. when compared to the original known strand? Or perhaps is it because kids are now starting to more widely interact with other kids in schools and in person activities? Again, I don't know. But what I do know is that, thinking they're more immune and to essentially say ""no, they don't need a vaccine"" isn't going to stop them from getting infected. The only way to truly stop/slow infection is via Herd Immunity through vaccine.

Also, I read the link you provided. While it was informative, the information they presented is almost 5 months old. I figured it'd go straight to the CDC Website for updated informative information. There's several sentences throughout the page that state, basically what I mentioned above. 

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/pediatric-hcp.html

&gt; The true incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is not known due to lack of widespread testing and the prioritization of testing for adults and those with severe illness. Hospitalization rates in children are significantly lower than hospitalization rates in adults with COVID-19, suggesting that children may have less severe illness from COVID-19 compared to adults.

So it's very likely the actual infection rate among kids is higher. Also, while less severe illness is a good thing (obviously), they're still being infected. Which means they can pass it along to other kids or adults. Why shouldn't they get a vaccine then to prevent infectivity in themselves and potentially others??

&gt; Recent evidence suggests that compared to adults, children likely have similar viral loads in their nasopharynx, similar secondary infections rates, and can spread the virus to others.

 So once they're infected they can just as easily spread the virus as an adult can. All the more reason for vaccination.

&gt; Due to community mitigation measures and school closures, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to and among children may have been reduced in the United States during the pandemic in the spring and early summer of 2020. This may explain the low incidence in children compared with adults. Comparing trends in pediatric infections before and after the return to child care, in-person school, youth sports and other activities may enhance our understanding about infections in children.

This one right here in my opinion can have a huge impact on our actual understanding of why they may of been relatively untouched so far.",,,1620829765,{},gxuv2ts,False,t3_na2gtc,False,True,t1_gxt4hmk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/na2gtc/kids_as_young_as_12_will_soon_get_the_covid19/gxuv2ts/,1620865034,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

My other grandma is 98 and has some blood problems so obviously we were really worried about her as well although she wound up getting Covid and had very little symptoms. Both have been fully vaccinated for awhile now which is a huge relief. 

And I knew that there were people who couldn’t get the vaccines because of autoimmune diseases or allergies among other reasons. My neighbor for example who is in her 30s can’t get a second dose because she had a bad allergic reaction to the first one. 

But your comment was helpful in thinking about the people in the middle that needed more info. When people say they are waiting for more information I hadn’t considered that this was information that was not easily googlable.

You know how every year you have to get a new flu vaccine? It’s not because your body doesn’t have antibodies anymore for lay year’s strains. It’s because last years strains don’t exist anymore and you’re getting a new vaccine for this year’s flu. New vaccine, new antibodies. But each new vaccine doesn’t go through clinical trials even close to what Pfizer or Moderna needed for just emergency use authorization. The technology is established and there’s a pipeline for rolling out these small changes where they can basically ahead of time quantity the risk as being super low. 

mRNA vaccines will basically do the same thing for even novel viruses. Basically you can now sequence the genomes of tons of different viruses and keep them in libraries. Then researchers can digitally seek proteins that target those viruses and spit out the exact little protein fragment to trigger an immune response. 

It’s a little more complicated obviously but this vaccine was created digitally and then tested. By doing this with a huge library of viruses, we can also do early stage testing for safe mRNA proteins that we know how to slightly modify safely and roll out into new vaccines quickly with much less testing than was required now. 

Even with as awful of a government response as we had this time, the next one won’t be as bad. 

And the technology for identifying dangerous pathogens and drugs to treat them is cheaper now than it was a year ago, way more widespread, and is going to get much much cheaper. With the exception of the US, most developed western and Asian nations are putting together programs to both do way more population genomics, but also their own local viral surveillance programs that can collaborate internationally really quickly.

At an online conference on response to COVID-19 emergencies on May 11, Son stressed that strictly following the directions of the Prime Minister and the National Steering Committee on COVID-19 Prevention on pandemic prevention and switching from defence to proactive attacking is the best way to prevent the worst.

COVID-19 has become extremely serious in Vietnam as well as other countries worldwide in recent days, he said.

Director of the Health Ministry’s Department for Medical Examination and Treatment Luong Ngoc Khue said that the ministry has lifted the pandemic prevention warning to the highest level, and ordered COVID-19 testing in hospitals.

At the event, participants discussed social distancing and quarantine procedures in hospitals, COVID-19 treatment hospitals, as well as strategies on testing, infection control and safe vaccination.

&gt;As the virus burns through India, this sense of futility and fear has become commonplace. The country is reporting nearly 400,000 confirmed infections and 4,000 deaths every day, tallies that are certain to be drastic undercounts. In Delhi, public parks have been requisitioned as makeshift crematoriums, with rows of funeral pyres burning where kids once played cricket. Hospital beds and oxygen cylinders are in short supply, as are doctors and nurses. Some researchers predict that the total number of fatalities—currently at 250,000—could top 400,000 by mid-June and then keep climbing.

&gt;The crisis in India is horrific on its own terms, generating misery and loss at an enormous scale. It also has worrisome implications for the rest of the globe. Home to the world’s largest vaccine industry and, until remarkably recently, recording only a modest number of coronavirus cases, India was central to international plans to inoculate developing countries by churning out low-cost doses. Instead its exports have largely ceased, with available vials prioritized for domestic use, and there’s no timeline for when they might resume. Meanwhile, an unchecked outbreak in a nation of over a billion citizens creates ideal conditions for new variants to take hold. It’s hard to imagine a more effective way to come up with mutations that might resist current vaccines.

…

&gt;A few weeks into 2021, the Reserve Bank of India issued a curiously optimistic press release. Straying from monetary policy into epidemiology, the central bank declared that India had beaten Covid, and that, better yet, “soon the winter of our discontent will be a glorious summer.” Of the virus’s curve, the RBI said, India had managed to “bend it like Beckham.” Although he used less florid language, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was similarly bullish. At a digital-only meeting of the World Economic Forum in January, he boasted that he and his compatriots had “saved humanity from a big disaster by containing corona effectively.”

&gt;Such statements may seem delusional in retrospect, but the viral numbers did look good at the time. After a surge last September that pushed daily case numbers to almost 100,000, by January new infections had slumped to less than a tenth of that level—a per-capita rate comparable to South Korea’s, which is among the lowest in the industrialized world. Even in Dharavi, a Mumbai slum home to perhaps a million people, an aggressive public-health campaign had kept the virus largely under control. With social distancing restrictions mostly lifted, crowds returned to markets and restaurants, and well-heeled families booked holidays at beach resorts.

&gt;Epidemiologists and armchair experts debated a range of theories to explain the decline in infections, as well as India’s relatively low number of deaths among those who did get sick. Many cited the protection afforded by its youthful population, with a median age of just 27. Others suggested the warm climate of South Asia might be slowing viral transmission, or speculated that enough Indians had already been infected to reach some degree of herd immunity. Then there was the so-called hygiene hypothesis: the notion that, in a country of crowded cities and poor sanitation, people are naturally resilient to new diseases.

&gt;Some scientists urged caution. For one thing, no one could be sure the figures were correct. India’s testing rates are less than half those in the U.S., and mortality statistics are notoriously unreliable. Even in normal times, about 1 in 5 fatalities are never reported to the authorities, and official records often don’t list a cause of death. In December, the country had detected its first cases of B.1.1.7, the variant initially identified in the U.K., prompting concerns about out-of-control spread.

&gt;Yet politicians needed little encouragement to bring life back to normal. Even as infection rates began to rise in February, multiple state elections drew huge, largely unmasked crowds to hear candidates speak. Modi bragged about the size of the rallies he and his right-hand man, Home Minister Amit Shah, had managed to hold ahead of the vote in West Bengal, a densely populated state of more than 90 million people. Officials also encouraged citizens to participate in the Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival on the banks of the Ganges that is the world’s largest human gathering. Millions did, packing shoulder to shoulder by the edge of the sacred river.

&gt;By mid-March, the number of infections reported each day had more than doubled from a month earlier, while India’s vaccine rollout remained sluggish. At the World Health Organization in Geneva, chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan fretted that her home country was ignoring a viral time bomb. “It could take off again at any time,” she said on March 13. “We should not become complacent.” It was already too late.",,,1620798618,{},gxtnc3l,True,t3_nahl1w,False,True,t3_nahl1w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nahl1w/indias_covid_catastrophe_shows_world_the_danger/gxtnc3l/,1620839437,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That's true only if you only care about yourself. Not even that, because reducing the amount of virus being circulated is a huge benefit to you even if you're already vaccinated.  Even someone who was the most selfish person on Earth should be interested in reducing the amount of community spread.   


&gt; Instead, experts said they mostly remain cautious to protect others who aren’t yet vaccinated. The vaccines are extremely effective — dramatically cutting the risk of any symptoms, and driving the risk of hospitalization and death to nearly zero. There’s some evidence that these vaccines also reduce the risk of transmission, **but we’re still learning how much they prevent someone who is vaccinated from infecting another person**. When experts are still taking precautions, it’s this concern for others that primarily drives them.   
&gt;  ...    
&gt; “It’s about protecting others. Vaccination makes me essentially safe,” William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, told me. “There’s accumulating evidence, too, that breakthrough cases are less likely to transmit (they have lower viral loads), so by being vaccinated I’m already helping protect others. But I’m also going to continue with behaviors consistent with lower contact rates in the community overall. As more and more are protected through vaccination, I’ll feel less and less of a need for that.”",,,1620781193,{},gxst4y3,False,t3_na72f4,False,False,t1_gxsr9pe,/r/Coronavirus/comments/na72f4/got_the_vaccine_experts_say_you_can_relax_about/gxst4y3/,1620821198,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; R0 remains a valuable epidemiologic concept, but the expanded use of R0 in both the scientific literature and the popular press appears to have enabled some misunderstandings to propagate. R0 is an estimate of contagiousness that is a function of human behavior and biological characteristics of pathogens.

By the predominant US definition, social distancing reduces R0. If you’re Australian, [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number), Wiki says that your Dept of Health uses your definition with the clause of absence of any intervention to reduce transmission.",,,1620780219,{},gxsr7ve,False,t3_n9pmno,False,True,t1_gxq0079,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n9pmno/just_2_of_sarscov2positive_individuals_carry_90/gxsr7ve/,1620820121,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; Instead, experts said they mostly remain cautious to protect others who aren’t yet vaccinated. The vaccines are extremely effective — dramatically cutting the risk of any symptoms, and driving the risk of hospitalization and death to nearly zero. There’s some evidence that these vaccines also reduce the risk of transmission, but we’re still learning how much they prevent someone who is vaccinated from infecting another person. When experts are still taking precautions, it’s this concern for others that primarily drives them.    

&gt; But, over time, they see even those concerns for others becoming less necessary, too.   

&gt; “It’s about protecting others. Vaccination makes me essentially safe,” William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, told me. “There’s accumulating evidence, too, that breakthrough cases are less likely to transmit (they have lower viral loads), so by being vaccinated I’m already helping protect others. But I’m also going to continue with behaviors consistent with lower contact rates in the community overall. As more and more are protected through vaccination, I’ll feel less and less of a need for that.”    

Basically, while the virus is still being heavily circulated and as people are still getting their vaccines it's smart to keep wearing a mask to protect others and help the decline in cases, but it's getting better all the time and eventually that won't be needed.",,,1620780185,{},gxsr5dt,False,t3_na72f4,False,False,t1_gxsg4x8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/na72f4/got_the_vaccine_experts_say_you_can_relax_about/gxsr5dt/,1620820083,18,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,LabWizardry,,,[],,,,text,t2_2p3w85,False,False,[],"&gt;First off, there is still risk with the second dose.

First off, the UK data shows the risk for the blood clots is even lower from the second dose (approximately 1/10th the incidence), and the original incidence is incredibly low. Ironically the second dose VITT rate from the UK is fairly similar to the purported worldwide VITT incidence rate from the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I think I did my part - you should get a dose for yourself. 

Secondly, I'm a front-line healthcare worker who got Pfizer before AZ was even approved to be given in Canada, so I didn't really get a choice though I absolutely would have taken AZ if it was the first vaccine offered me. My mom had the opportunity to get AZ or wait and maybe get an mRNA and I wholehearted told her she should take the first vaccine available to her. The mRNA vaccines also have some incidence of VITT associated with them anyways its just been at a lower incidence rate and hasn't been as widely publicized as with AZ.  


Thirdly, if you're so concerned with the blood clot risk, why did you take a first shot of AZ in the first place? All the concerns with it were just as known then as they are now, you presumably gave informed consent.  


&gt;There is no way they are going to give AZ to anyone else. 

They're currently deciding on this by ""reviewing the data"". My guess is they'll see the incidence of VITT is much lower for second doses and reserve future AZ deliveries for second doses for AZ people so 1) they can actually use the supply they'll continue to get and 2) because the UK study studying the mixing of doses is a pretty small sample size for a human trial (only about 2,000 people).

However, real world data was quite different. Israel's data found almost no protection at 2 weeks, but around 90% protection at 3 weeks.

You seem to be implying that people need to be directly touched by things in order to have them influence their actions/cultures.  A substantial portion of the southern US flies flags of a defunct country that lost a war over a century ago.  Can any American deny the influence of the Revolutionary War on our modern day culture?  No one alive today knew anyone who knew anyone who knew George Washington and yet his influence is all over the political culture.  It's also pretty simplistic to take the entire informed consent/prisoner experimentation/medical racism issue and distill it down to one study, which is far from the only transgression.

Then you have additional issues that persist to the modern day [like in this 2016 study](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/16/4296#ref-17) that shows many doctors prescribe treatments as if they believe black people actually feel pain less than whites.  Racism and race-related issues persist to today and constantly erode the trust of the communities they affect.

&gt;The simple slope analyses indicated that participants who endorsed more false beliefs (+1 SD) rated the black target as feeling less pain than the white target [β = 0.45, SE = 0.20, t(211) = 2.24, P = 0.026]. Conversely, participants who endorsed fewer false beliefs (−1 SD) rated the black target as feeling more pain than the white target [β = −0.48, SE = 0.20, t(211) = −2.34, P = 0.020]. In other words, as in study 1, participants in study 2 who endorsed false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites exhibited a racial bias in pain perception similar to the bias shown in previous work

&gt;In other words, participants who endorsed more false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites showed a racial bias in the accuracy of their treatment recommendations. Participants who did not endorse such beliefs showed no bias in treatment recommendation accuracy.

I suggest you work on your reading comprehension and then read that tweet more carefully. All it does state results from a *preliminary* investigation conducted by Chinese authorities.

That *particular* investigation did find **no clear** evidence of human-to-human transmission.

This does not mean ""no evidence"", it means the evidence they had wasn't conclusive because establishing h2h isn't just a ""yes vs no"" thing. It's a ""how does it transmit between humans"" thing, which can happen in a lot of ways, and the exact mechanics of how this happens, some of which we still do not understand **to this day**, need to be properly established and be repeatable to be considered clear evidence.

In that context, it's not really surprising that one of the first investigations, not even a month after it was discovered, didn't result in a 100% complete picture about the virus and the disease it's triggering in some people. That's just how medical science works; It's slow and difficult, not as straightforward as many people consider it to be.

&gt; I know in America views on Covid have split down political lines but don't be blind to the fact that the countries in East Asia that ignored WHO advice have been some of the most successful in this crisis.

What countries would that be which allegedly ignored WHO advice? The main reason countries like Taiwan, South Korea, and many others in East Asia have been doing so well is because, unlike most Western countries, they were actually prepared and have proper compliance with the measures among their populations. Original SARS was pretty much a non-issue in the West, while in East Asia it was very much the COVID-19 test-run.

They didn't and don't have issues with people politicizing simple measures like wearing masks, they've been doing that since even before covid-19.

What I'll say is that human's don't do well with conceptualizing probabilities. Try to think about it like this: your risk of a blood clot from the AZ vaccine is about 4 in a million. The chance of dying from that blood clot is about 1 in 4. So your risk of dying due to this vaccine is about 1 in a million.

This is equivalent to the risk of traveling 230 miles in a car.

Rationally, you should be afraid of both of these things equally (taking the vaccine and traveling 230 miles in a car). If you're afraid of the risk from this vaccine then you ought to be living your entire life in constant fear of death.

did Public Health England falsify the efficacy report on a 12 week dosing interval?

Data continue to show encouraging effects from a single dose of the Pfizer vaccination on risk of mortality in symptomatic cases over 80 who have been vaccinated, where the risk of death is reduced by 54%. Combined with the reduced risk of becoming a case, this is consistent with a vaccine ***effectiveness against mortality which is similar to previously reported value of 85%.***

[],,toontje18,,,[],,,,text,t2_meeqp,False,False,[],"85% of adults at least partially vaccinated and over two-thirds fully vaccinated by the beginning of July seems even more plausible now than when the goal was first announced. That it has become more plausible as we come closer to the target shows how everything is finally coming together. 

Considering that the figure here does not account for the Janssen and AstraZeneca doses. Because Janssen is still too new to know how reliable they are and they seem to have trouble delivering on time for now. And AstraZeneca has always been extremely unreliable. But if they achieve their goals, you should another 2 to 3 million Janssen doses and 3 to 4 million AstraZeneca doses on top of that. Also, CureVac might start deliveries in May to June, so these might also be used.

When the adults will be done within the next 2 months and 85% of adults has been at least partially vaccinated, how long is it gonna take to vaccinate the 12 to 17 year olds and the 5 to 11 year olds after that? At the end, when the speed is highest, they should be doing around 2 to 2.5 million vaccinations per week on average. For Q3 this should be even higher, as Q3 deliveries are twice as high as Q2 deliveries (like Q2 deliveries were 4 times as high as Q1 deliveries). I will assume only Moderna and BioNTech will be used for these age groups, as I only see these 2 companies actively pursuing trials for children. This group could probably only start during the third week of July, as the second doses for of the latest groups are given as quickly as possible and the remaining doses used to push the last remaining unsure population to get a vaccine anyways. BioNTech will stay very similar to Q2 deliveries in Q3, as their Q2 deliveries were already very high. Thus over 1 million BioNTech doses per week. Moderna deliveries for Q3 will be around 3.5 times as high as their Q2 deliveries. That will be around 400,000 Moderna doses per week. Thus 1.4 million doses approved for children will be available every week by then. Remaining unvaccinated hesitant adults should be able to just get the other vaccines at walk-ins. Demand will be low in that group by then anyways. There are around 1.2 million 12 to 17 year olds and around 1.3 million 11 to 5 year olds. Assuming 85% of this group will be vaccinated, we will be looking at around 2 million children that have to be vaccinated with either Moderna or BioNTech. Thus this group can be vaccinated in 1.5 week starting the third/fourth week of July, which ends July 31st. And then 3 weeks later they should get their second dose, which should be finished by the third week of August. This means all willing adults and school aged children should be fully vaccinated before the summer holiday ends and the new school year starts. Assuming hopefully 85% of the total populations wants to be vaccinated, of course. This should mean a completely normal new school year. And boosters can also be given before fall if needed.

All this with EU supply, which also exports massive amounts while during all this.

The National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology on May 11 announced the results of the genetic sequencing for eight samples taken from COVID-19 patients submitted by four northern provinces – two from Vinh Phuc, two from Bac Ninh, two from Lang Son, and one from Nam Dinh – and the Indian strain showed up in seven.

The variant B1.617, which the World Health Organization (WHO) classified on May10 as a “variant of concern,” has demonstrated higher spreading capabilities among humans, according to some preliminary studies, but further research is still needed to explore the variant's transmissibility, disease severity and whether it could make existing COVID-19 vaccines less effective.

An official from the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases – its second facility in Dong Anh district currently under lockdown – said the origin of its current outbreak could come from the COVID-19 treatment ward, infecting patients in other faculties and patients’ family relatives who came to take care of them from many northern localities.

Earlier this month, the institute’s genome probe also indicated the outbreak related to Sunny Club in Vinh Phuc, which is caused by two visiting Chinese experts who in turn have likely contracted the disease from another group of Indian experts during the time they stay at the same quarantine hotel in Yen Bai province, is of Indian variant.

Directly, it reduces your chances of getting the OG virus by 95%. So in a situation where 20 people would get infected, if everyone was vaccinated then it would only be 1 person. With some variants, it goes down to more like 1 in 4, rather than 1 in 20. 

On balance, if you do things that are far more dangerous, like going to bars, then you can actually INCREASE your chances of getting the virus while vaccinated vs. not going to those things while unvaccinated.

No, which is why I said ""any **appreciable** number of people"" and not just 'any number of people'.   

Even one person taking up limited ICU space needlessly is of course one less bed available for someone else and so risks having *some* impact on the rest of us, but when you have multiple beds constantly occupied by people who were put there by their own ignorance that the impact is more likely to be felt. Obviously the ideal would be zero covid19 patients occupying ICU beds, risking the health of staff, and taking up their time and the fewer the better otherwise.   

The point is that things don't have to get as catastrophic as they've been previously before it starts to impact the care hospitals are able to provide their communities.   

Decreasing the amount of community spread makes life better for everyone in that community. Even when it's not reflated to the impacts on the hospital system. When a kid's teacher gets sick with covid the whole classroom is impacted, when a CEO dies from covid the entire company is impacted, when a local small business owner has to close their store or limit their capacity because of covid the local economy is impacted.  Every person sickened by the virus has *some* impact that spreads beyond just that person and that effect is magnified by the number of people infected.

Data isn't as good as with AZ because it isn't being reported on as much by the media, and likely no being followed as much by doctors as a result. But current purported cases estimate rates to be about 1 in a million, so about 1/10th the frequency as with AZ, but it can likely still happen.

The pandemic, while sharply dropping off, isn't over yet (celebrating a touchdown at the 1 yard line and fumbling). What's so hard about making sure community spread is lower and not getting complacent? I'm in NJ, last summer there were around 500 cases/day, now around 1,500 (but dropping quickly). I'm sure once the trend is under a certain threshold, it will be removed. They just need to see the effectiveness in terms of when vaccine participation hits a plateau, and see the spread at that point (between seasonality + vaccines). Can't estimate that yet, and don't want to make a decision that is harder to walk back.

The chance that either of your two friends who have one dose are infected is about 8/10000 ~ 1/1000. As for the remaining party, let’s say it’s 10 people , then chance of one of them being infected is also 1/1000. So 2/1000 = 1/500 for having a person that’s contagious. Now, what about that infected person passing it to at least one person who is fully vaccinated? That’s harder to calculate, but it’s certainly less than 1/2 (maximum likelihood to pass to each vaccinated person is 1/20, so for ten of them it’s 10/20).

Direct quote from the abstract of the second journal article ""Cases of apparent secondary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) after SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination with both the Pfizer and Moderna versions have been reported and reached public attention.""

mRNA vaccines still have reports of causing thrombotic events, just the incidence is lower (1 in a million versus 1 in one hundred thousand with AZ. As a reminder both are very small for a medical intervention with as much benefit of vaccination against a deadly virus in a global pandemic). It definitely exists, but the media has chosen to latch on to AZ and not report on the others. Maybe for the best because it probably would just promote more vaccine hesitancy when the risks from all the vaccines are vastly outweighed by the benefits. To me the anxiety around AZ just shows how much the Media controls how we think, because we freak out over 0.001% chances of side effects for thinks that vastly improve our lives, while people still pay tens of thousands of dollars to get breast implants which have a &gt;2% chance of giving your a blood infection. I'm not trying to say this to downplay your anxiety, I know from personal experience anxiety is rarely logical. But from a personal risk standpoint you have very little reason to be afraid of having gotten AZ compared to any other vaccine. No one can tell you what to do, but I'll definitely be telling my mom she should get her second dose as AZ because she has nothing to fear from it compared to any other vaccine.",,,1620774364,{},gxsfgf7,False,t3_na7isg,False,False,t1_gxsd64f,/r/Coronavirus/comments/na7isg/ontario_will_no_longer_give_astrazeneca_covid19/gxsfgf7/,1620813665,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Are you ready for the possibility of yearly booster shots at higher prices?

First article claims higher prices and yearly boosters.

I had posted this in inquiry when it appeared (because it absolutely seems like something they'd try to make more money off of) but now its across multiple websites including WebMD however these don't state the price hike or yearly boosters but claim like all the websites that we need to ""prepare for a 12 month boosters shot to get ahead of the varients"" which makes me think they're easing us into it...

**Any thoughts?**

We have caps on how many doctors the government will take, even with our shortages, meaning that many doctors will just go to the US for higher pay and more job opportunities.

We have cancer patients going to the US and being told they would’ve been dead had they stayed in Canada, because cancer is fast progressing and does not wait for waitlists to be fulfilled.

Only for the playgrounds to be crawling with mask less kids and blue lives matter parents huddled in maskless groups. 

And being aware of the demographic being hardest hit, while witnessing careless and selfish groups of white people gathering like nothing. It upsets me so so very much. A local friend of mine who lives in a multigenerational home, their Hispanic, lost three members of his family in two weeks. Just a month into the pandemic last year.
But because the loss isn’t hitting white families as hard, they continue to gather maskless and ignoring any science or discussion to say otherwise.

I was in tears getting my vaccine yesterday, overwhelmed with gratitude as I thanked the nurse for saving me and everyone else there. My kids noticeably relaxed when I came home after my shot, grateful I’m protected and safe now.

But with no vax available to kids, I still don’t have the freedom to go back to normal. I don’t feel safe taking them inside a movie theater or restaurant until they’ve been vaccinated.

Perhaps all the PPE that the workers were wearing gave them the protection? The age group in which the healthcare workers in Indonesia was heavily biased toward younger groups?

If among 128K healthcare workers, if a subset (let's say 64K) was not vaccinated and 640 of them got hospitalized from Covid and the subset that was vaccinated had 32 hospitalized, we can generally infer that the Sinovac was highly effective (95+%) as the article is implying but based on the information furnished in the article, **highly effective** seems questionable to me.

I think what is aggravating is that many don't make any attempt to educate themselves on whether their perfectly reasonable on first-blush concern is actually really a concern. In a public health crisis like this, either take the time to understand what is going on in enough depth to make a good decision, or go with what the experts are saying. Don't just say 'It's too fast' and then never think about it again. I had that concern, I took the time to educate myself on the vaccine process, what is being done here, and looked at things like how big the trials of previously approved vaccines are, etc.

The other thing that bothers me is they rate the unknown potential long-term concerns, which are certainly not non-zero risks, but based on how mRNA works (it doesn't stick around) and the massive number of similar proteins to the spike protein are introduced to our bodies daily by other viruses (like colds, etc), that risk is really really small. Then compare that with the risk of not eating healthy or environmental exposures to toxins or chemicals, etc it is just ridiculous. If you are actually actively living your life to avoid those risks then maybe you have a good argument, but given the public health crisis its just ridiculous to use that minute potential risk as an excuse when you are taking many orders of magnitude higher risks every day in your life.

I think what doesn't help is that these people have avoided getting covid so far (due to measures like lockdowns and masks that have been put in place) and therefore rate the risk of getting the disease low in their minds, when in fact the risk of the disease is much higher than any vaccination risks, comparatively.",,,1620825745,{},gxumf8b,False,t3_naa357,False,False,t1_gxueteb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/naa357/study_9975_of_hospitalized_covid19_patients/gxumf8b/,1620860157,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Metro Denver counties to lift remaining COVID-19 restrictions with move to Level Clear this weekend  
Restaurants, offices, retail will be able to operate at 100% capacity with no additional requirements  
Jessica Seaman May 12, 2021 at 6:00 a.m.

Much of metro Denver will see all remaining county-level COVID-19 public health restrictions lifted this weekend, although people still will be required to wear masks in specific indoor settings as the statewide order remains in place at least until next month.  
Jefferson, Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder and Broomfield counties confirmed Tuesday they will move from Level Blue to a new phase called Level Clear on Sunday.  
Denver’s public health agency stopped short of committing to the move to Level Clear, but said the city anticipates “aligning” with neighboring counties.  
Once the metro counties move to Level Clear, restaurants, bars, offices and other indoor settings can operate at 100% capacity with no additional requirements, according to the Tri-County Health Department’s public health order.  
At Level Blue, restaurants and gyms can offer full capacity only if 6 feet of social distancing is possible, while bars only can operate at 25% capacity, and retail and office spaces are limited to 75% capacity.  
The Denver Department of Public Health and Environment “is working with regional and state partners to evaluate the potential restrictions after the expirations of our current public health order,” spokesperson Clarissa Boggs-Blake said in an email Tuesday. “We anticipate aligning with other neighboring jurisdictions as well as adopting by reference any remaining state public health order requirements.”  
Colorado handed control of most COVID-19 public health measures to local authorities last month with the expiration of the state’s color-coded restriction dial. Many counties opted not to impose further local restrictions at that point, but most in the metro area chose to remain at Level Blue for another month.  
Douglas County was the exception, opting out of plans by the Tri-County Health Department — which also serves Adams and Arapahoe counties — to stay at Level Blue through Saturday.  
The counties moving to Level Clear on Sunday will enter an “observation period” for 90 days. If a county experiences a rise in its rate of coronavirus hospital admissions, it will move to stricter restrictions, according to the Tri-County and Jefferson County health department orders.  
The state still requires masks in schools, child care centers, indoor children’s camps, prisons and health care settings. However, masks are no longer required in indoor gatherings where at least 80% of the group is inoculated against the coronavirus.  
Additionally, the state health department mandates 6 feet of distancing at indoor events with more than 100 people and requires plans to be submitted for outdoor, ticketed, seated events at locations larger than 30,000 square feet. The state also requires a review of indoor events with more than 500 people.  
“The state’s order expires on May 15, so we expect updates from the state regarding what restrictions they plan to continue before the end of the week,” said Gary Sky, spokesman for the Tri-County Health Department, said in an email.",,,1620828074,{},gxurbiu,True,t3_napcba,False,False,t3_napcba,/r/Coronavirus/comments/napcba/metro_denver_counties_to_lift_remaining_covid19/gxurbiu/,1620862908,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

Nasia Safdar and Daniel Shirley from the UW-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health are leading the SHIELD research study to determine whether commonly used antiseptics, such as a mouthwash, can prevent COVID-19. Even with successful COVID-19 vaccines available, these antiseptics may prevent spread of multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).

The SHIELD Study is seeking any workers aged 18 or older who do some or all of their job duties in person to participate in this study. Participation can take place remotely, and volunteers may be eligible whether or not they receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Compensation of up to $50 is available to participants that complete the study.

If you are interested in participating or have any questions, please contact shield@medicine.wisc.edu or visit https://shield.medicine.wisc.edu. Please also feel free to share study information with others; participants do not need to live near Madison.

The answer to how long immunity lasts depends on a lot of different factors. Age, health, strength of immune response and even diet.

Here’s the article for young people in Qatar https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00141-3/fulltext

&gt;Among 43,044 antibody-positive persons who were followed for a median of 16.3 weeks (range: 0–34.6), 314 individuals (0.7%) had at least one PCR positive swab ≥14 days after the first-positive antibody test. Of these individuals, 129 (41.1%) had supporting epidemiological evidence for reinfection. Reinfection was next investigated using viral genome sequencing. Applying the viral-genome-sequencing confirmation rate, the incidence rate of reinfection was estimated at 0.66 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 0.56–0.78). Incidence rate of reinfection versus month of follow-up did not show any evidence of waning of immunity for over seven months of follow-up. Meanwhile, in the complement cohort of 149,923 antibody-negative persons followed for a median of 17.0 weeks (range: 0–45.6), incidence rate of infection was estimated at 13.69 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 13.22–14.14). Efficacy of natural infection against reinfection was estimated at 95.2% (95% CI: 94.1–96.0%). Reinfections were less severe than primary infections. Only one reinfection was severe, two were moderate, and none were critical or fatal. Most reinfections (66.7%) were diagnosed incidentally through random or routine testing, or through contact tracing.
Interpretation

&gt;Reinfection is rare in the young and international population of Qatar. Natural infection appears to elicit strong protection against reinfection with an efficacy ~95% for at least seven months.",,,1620830957,{},gxuxtha,False,t3_na72f4,False,True,t1_gxsadk6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/na72f4/got_the_vaccine_experts_say_you_can_relax_about/gxuxtha/,1620866569,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

First off, I'm not American. Second, I know a lot about how the WHO works from first hand experience. Not from a few articles or tweets. I actually understand how the WHO works within the UN system. 

The WHO is not a perfect organization. It would be absurd to expect them to be. There is plenty to criticize. Ironically, before the waves of ignorant criticism came around I was critical of plenty. The WHO can be too slow to react and its composition (WHA as a decision making body) presents some real problems when it comes to quick and effective public health policy making. 

Having said all that, the vast majority of criticism leveled against them since the beginning of this pandemic, that they're corrupted by China, that they intentionally or negligently downplayed the risks involved, are simply wrong. This misinformation has certainly been spread by partisan political actors, both national political parties with a vested interest in mitigating criticism of their own response and from nationalists fundamentally opposed to international organizations. But you don't need to be a partisan or a nationalist to buy into the misinformation. 

One of the most significant factors in the WHO's inability to act quickly and definitively is its lack of actual authority. Too many people think the WHO is basically a global version of a national public health authority with the power of a state. It simply isn't that. Can it ever be? Probably not. But it can get closer to that power with additional funding and authority granted by its member states.

COVID has infected a far far lower fraction of the global population (so far). Updated metrics for hospitalization indicate like 3% of infected people get hospitalized. If I mentally play that out with 1918 medical technology, I'd write all those people off as dead. So imagine Spanish Flu infection rate (1/3 of population), and multiply it by 0.03, to get like 70 million people out of the modern population. That's kind of like what we would have from COVID-19 if we didn't have modern media to tell us to work from home and modern medicine to treat it.

As a counterpoint, COVID-19 is right in a sort of sweet spot between innocuous and deadly. If it had really be a cold or even an average flu, almost no one would stay home because no one stays home for the other illnesses, for which the risk of death or serious complications is so remote that altering your life beyond washing your hands and sneezing into your elbow would be ridiculous. If COVID had been deadly like Ebola, EVERYONE would have stayed home and even after the public health officials declared it generally safe, many would stay home just to make sure, because who wants a virus that makes your internal organ hemorrhage and kills like 90% of people who catch it.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, COVID-19 was deadly to about 1% of people who caught it, and generally to elderly populations or people with relatively rare immunosuppressive disorders. It was debilitating to an undetermined number of long-haulers, but governments didn't report or didn't care to differentiate the figures on how many people were getting chronic systems from COVID infections. For many other people, it really did look like a bad cold and then they recovered.

&amp;#x200B;

So faced with news that you were only really likely to die from this disease if you're over 80 or if you are chronically ill, I can understand why a lot of people never took it very seriously or treated the public health response as an overreaction (it's tempting even for me to conclude that public health officials overreacted, and I stayed fully distanced and at home with the exception of picking up grocery orders until I was fully vaccinated). I don't think that necessarily precludes a more serious response from the public if we had a pandemic with a much higher death rate or more profound, reported-on symptoms of gruesome deaths or disabilities.

&gt;Under these rules, companies manufacturing vaccines in Europe require authorisation from national authorities – which can be denied under certain conditions – before shipping vaccines outside the EU.

#

&gt;On Wednesday (24 March), the Commission tightened up the mechanism including new criteria which could deny export to countries that have already ensured a certain vaccination rate, if it is higher than the one in the EU.

https://www.aeb.com/sg-en/magazine/articles/coronavirus-eu-export-restrictions-personal-protective-equipment.php

&gt;It is important to note that the new regulation does not constitute an export ban and is in line with all of the EU’s international obligations. Export authorizations may still be granted where no threat is posed to the availability of relevant equipment for EU member states, and various special circumstances have been considered.

#

&gt;Export ban does not discriminate between full and tiny.

The events marking the emergence of HIV in the United States and its transmission through blood and blood products ***are best understood in four periods.*** 

(1) Through the end of 1982, people were **struggling to understand an emerging disease** and characterize the risk of infection.

 (2) In early 1983 official meetings took place and public and private decisions established **the blood industry's** early response to AIDS. 

(3) Meetings and other occasions for decision making from mid-1983 through the end of 1983 provided many ***opportunities for blood banks, blood product manufacturers, regulatory organizations, and other agencies to reconsider the decisions of early 1983.*** 

(4) During 1982-1985, research on AIDS led to isolation of the virus and the **development of a screening test.** Concurrently, research efforts related to viral inactivation of the antihemophilic factor (AHF) concentrate, underway since the 1970s, were accelerated and completed.

Also, Astrazeneca also has data from a large scale US trial in which its efficacy was listed at 76% after two doses. The criterion between what was and wasn't considered a covid cases was functionally identical between trials. What's important to remember is that real world data can be incredibly flukey. These real world effectiveness numbers likely come from comparing rates of infection in vaccinated groups to the rate of infection in all unvaccinated individuals in the country. That's ripe bias. Different vaccines tend to be delivered different locations, and different locations tend to have different rates of infection. Thus, if one vaccine is more prominent in areas with lower rates of infection  while the other is dispersed in locations with high rates of infection, the former has an advantage.

Modern antibiotics and antivirals would have prevented many of those deaths, particularly in young adults.

Like most Influenza A viruses, Spanish Flu had a much shorter incubation period and did not survive as long outside of the host as nCov SARS-2 can, meaning it was less contagious in some ways.

On top of those factors, the *speed* at which Spanish Flu came on and killed a seemingly healthy person was terrifying. There are primary records from doctors, nurses, soldiers, and other witnesses of that pandemic that noted how a person could wake up feeling fine, feel a little hoarse in the throat by noon, and suffocate in their own fluids by the next day due to how explosively the virus and subsequent bacterial infections would hit the body. It's incubation period is believed to be more in line with other Influenza A viruses, being far shorter than Covid, and how quickly it would incapacitate many of it's victims would limit it's ability to spread as quickly and stealthily as Covid can, and it would be less of a strain on healthcare infrastructure due to how quickly it killed hosts.

So, I'd argue that if Covid-19 hit back in 1918, it would likely have been on par with how deadly Spanish Flu was to the population of that time that didn't have ventilators, antibiotics, respirators, or any of the life saving technology and medicine we have today.

Also, virtual at home learning only works for self directed kids.  They learn much better in a classroom.

With that said our district did loose a few teachers to Covid.  Was it worth it? Not for those families.  

Another observation, to your point, for the most part Covid did not spread IN our schools due to masks, distancing.  The exception was sports.  They had multiple outbreaks because kids take their masks off there.

&gt;I can see this happening with other drugs, but not vaccines, and definitely not with the current mRNA covid vaccines.

Perhaps yes, perhaps not. Time will tell. I will encourage you to drop the ""definitely"" from your vocabulary on this. Like I said in response to the other guy, the longitudinal/comparative studies in 2-5 years are going to be very illuminating and will tell us the full story. Until then, we're reading tea leaves (like VAERS).

&gt;It's not disingenuous. If you find an example, I'd change my mind.

It's not disingenuous on your end. At least not purposefully, but moreover that specific matter has been framed disingenuously, in a way that in my eyes is anti-scientific.

&gt;I'm not interested in the safety of other drugs. Just vaccines.

What is important, what is the actual matter here and what you really want to get at is the safety of this drug, not the overall safety of the class of drugs known as vaccines. What you are asking for doesn't exist, just like you said in your original post. Vaccines are historically incredibly safe, and when there were issues the offending drugs were pulled too quickly to fully assess. I gave at least two examples, and those aren't quackery, you can read about them in the journals. I can point to a long list of ""medical reversals"" for other therapeutics and drugs but I can understand that from your perspective that's irrelevant. Just understand that from my perspective this is a (new) drug first and a vaccine second.

The UK used to be in the EU, with a portion of its laws made in Brussels.

Those laws were, for the most part, still the laws that applied last December under the Brexit transition period.

In this case, as is made clear in the link, the law said 'The EMA is the body responsible for approving vaccines, but in an emergency, member states can approve vaccines themselves'

Unlike the majority (but not all) of EU countries who chose to tie themselves to the EU's centralised vaccination scheme out of misplaced political 'solidarity' , the UK chose to rely on its own regulator, which it was previously allowed to do under EU law, and is now still allowed to do under UK law.

The EMA itself used to be based in London up until a year ago and the MHRA inherited a large number of its staff and institutional expertise, which is why they were able to act more quickly and competently then the EMA itself.

I think it gets tricky because there's a whole lot of grey area when it comes to reopening. A lot of people want to be at the finish line and completely flip the switch/declare the end of COVID with a single date that marks when everything is back to ""normal"". Personally, I'm fine with continuing some of the more reasonable restrictions within a reasonable time frame - so far the city and the state have followed through on many aspects of reopening, i.e. lifting outdoor mask mandate, increasing stadium capacity limits, public schools, etc. I might not agree with their exact timeline but even capacity limits for public and private gatherings are going to be raised in a matter of weeks.

Consider that this is just the first week where 2nd does became available to the general public, and that's if you were able to manage a Pfizer appointment right away. Once a few more weeks pass and people fully have a chance to get all their vaccines and hit the full 2 week waiting period, I think we'll see the restrictions open up even more so.",,,1620847952,{},gxw3jb9,False,t3_na9d07,False,True,t1_gxw217q,/r/Coronavirus/comments/na9d07/massachusetts_sees_a_rare_day_of_zero_covid/gxw3jb9/,1620889003,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Personal story: My family was at Disneyland with my unvaccinated 9 month old and later learned it was in the middle of a big measles outbreak. We were unscathed, but it goes to show that risk never hits zero it only approaches zero.

My point: COVID is scary, but so is measles and many other diseases. Let’s base our policy on conditions on the ground.

Methods  
Eighty‐six healthcare workers adhering to the vaccination campaign against COVID‐19 were enrolled in January–February 2021. All subjects underwent two COVID‐19 mRNA vaccine inoculations (Pfizer/BioNTech) separated by 3 weeks. Blood samples were collected before the 1st and 1–4 weeks after the second inoculation. Clinical history, demographics, and vaccine side effects were recorded. Baseline anthropometric parameters were measured, and body composition was performed through dual‐energy‐X‐ray absorptiometry.  
  
Results  
Higher waist circumference was associated with lower antibody (Ab) titres (R = −0.324, p = 0.004); smokers had lower levels compared to non‐smokers \[1099 (1350) vs. 1921 (1375), p = 0.007\], as well as hypertensive versus normotensive \[650 ± 1192 vs. 1911 (1364), p = 0.001\] and dyslipideamic compared to those with normal serum lipids \[534 (972) vs 1872 (1406), p = 0.005\]. Multivariate analysis showed that higher waist circumference, smoking, hypertension, and longer time elapsed since second vaccine inoculation were associated with lower Ab titres, independent of BMI, age. and gender.  
  
Conclusions  
Central obesity, hypertension, and smoking are associated with lower Ab titres following COVID‐19 vaccination. Although it is currently impossible to determine whether lower SARS‐CoV‐2 Abs lead to higher likelihood of developing COVID‐19, it is well‐established that neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection against several viruses including SARS‐CoV‐2. Our findings, therefore, call for a vigilant approach, as subjects with central obesity, hypertension, and smoking could benefit from earlier vaccine boosters or different vaccine schedules.",,,1620769949,{},gxs5ww1,True,t3_na8s5a,False,True,t3_na8s5a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/na8s5a/central_obesity_smoking_habit_and_hypertension/gxs5ww1/,1620808796,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,toontje18,,,[],,,,text,t2_meeqp,False,False,[],"&gt;and thanks to the DPA the EU is struggling to manufactor more for its own supply and export of vaccines..

But you have to put things in perspective. Their production might be currently limited due to the DPA, but the EU is currently far outpacing any other region in terms of current production capacity. They have produced around the same numbers as China as of early May. Thus well over 400 million vaccines. And they have produced around 80 to 100 million more vaccines than the US. And considerably more than any other country producing large quantities, like India and Russia. And the differences are only becoming greater, as initial EU production capacity was quite low (similar as US production capacity), but is now production at a much higher rate than any other place in the world, and they are still expanding production capacity. 

&gt;Now the only choice for fast supply many countries has is to rely on China and Russia who use that massive for political influence. India looked like a winner for a while as well , but then the 2nd wave came.

Also the most doses were exported from facilities in the EU, with over 200 million vaccines exported. Very similar to China, which also has exported 200 million vaccines. All other countries have exported significantly less. Combine all exports from all other countries excluding China, and it still does not even come close to half of EU vaccine exports.

Now the EU has learned their lesson, and has been gradually making sure to cut out most/all US companies/facilities from any of the steps for vaccine manufacturing and eventually for all critical supplies. For example, the newest EU contract for 1.8 billion BioNTech vaccine doses states all production steps and materials must be sourced from within the EU. But even with this handicap, the EU is outproducing the US, and the difference will only become greater.",,,1620769785,{},gxs5jdu,False,t3_n9wf6h,False,False,t1_gxqpy2j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n9wf6h/curevac_says_mass_vaccine_rollout_thrown_into/gxs5jdu/,1620808609,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The Cleveland Clinic found that 99.7% of its employees who were infected with the coronavirus were not vaccinated, and 0.3% of infections occurred in those who were fully vaccinated.

Besides the mask supply concern, they were also concerned that mask wearing would include user error where people would touch surfaces and then touch their masks, therefore applying the virus directly in the line of their respiration. They thought it was better to have people on lockdowns as much as possible as they figured out how to move forward.

Unfortunately, the focus on surfaces rather than indoor air has not been resolved in many countries yet. This is because of the focus on droplets over aerosols, and the [deep biases](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/07/opinion/coronavirus-airborne-transmission.html?referringSource=articleShare) that are attached to the subject. 

I hope what we can do now is to bring our focus on what we need to **do now** because as much as some countries are feeling some relief from vaccination programs, this pandemic is far from over and the risks will not remain contained to poorer countries, especially with vaccine reluctance and misinformation. 

First, we have to get the word out that [social distancing in indoor spaces](https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-10-28/a-room-a-bar-and-a-class-how-the-coronavirus-is-spread-through-the-air.html) is only mildly effective [because of aerosols](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/07/health/coronavirus-airborne-threat.html), and so are cloth masks or masks with gaps used in these spaces. This needs to be understood and mitigations need to be implemented in all indoor spaces, especially workplaces that cannot be remote and schools.

Simultaneously, we have to get vaccines distributed as quickly as possible to countries without their own programs however that can be done. If it means removing patent protections and the fear is lack of infrastructure and oversight, we have to remove those barriers as safely as possible. If it means having richer countries foot the bill, we have to make it happen. This is an all-at-once all hands on deck moment.

That's a bit rich, considering how much China suppressed the news. 

On 30 December the doctor who discovered the virus sent a message to fellow doctors in a chat group warning them to wear protective clothing to avoid infection.

  
Four days later he was summoned to the Public Security Bureau where he was told to sign a letter. In the letter he was accused of ""making false comments"" that had ""severely disturbed the social order"".

  
He was one of eight people who police said were being investigated for ""spreading rumours"" Local authorities later apologised to Dr Li.

a. The teachers are respected, and its a highly sought after position. 

B. Every school in the country is given the EXACT same amount of money for funding

C. Schools arent allowed to collect funds or raise their own funds in amy ways

D. The children only have to go to school for a significantly less amount of time during the day. 20 hours is the minimum and it goes up with age.

E. The teachers set their own curriculum

F. National scores are NOT publicised and are only used within a school to improve their own school.

These are just SOME of the major differences between the U.S. and Finland schools. The surprising thing is that the students performance out of Finland is the best in the world! The funding for schools is just one part of the problem. The whole school system in the U.S. needs a complete overhaul and needs to be changed completely.

Don't want to promise no masks on the hope that cases drop and vaccinations cone through and then if it doesn't you have to re-asses and re-implement some safety measures.

&gt;How can I know?
&gt;
&gt;There's nothing left of the vaccine in you after a week or two, so there's nothing there to cause any side effects.* 

I see this argument so much, including from our self-described health agencies, and it really flabbergasts me because it is so counter to the basic principles of toxicology. Yes, drugs can act as toxins and cause damage within the body that lingers after they are gone. That damage can be in the form of slow-developing syndromes. This is not advanced stuff.

&gt;Find me an example of a side effect from a vaccine approved for use in the US, that didn't show up within four months, but that did show up after 6 months, in more than 0.01% of those vaccinated. 

Of vaccines, not much of what you are asking for exists due to the historically severe standards of safety. The most similar, Rotashield and Lymerix, were pulled from the market before any link, mechanism, or rate was published. Now, your question is unfortunately disingenuous as it implies that safety profiles must be identical between different classes of drugs, i.e. classical vaccines and mRNA vaccines, which is absurd on the surface. Different drugs cause different effects, have different mechanisms, regardless of the end result. We are forced to start from a mostly blank slate when we evaluate a new class of drugs with a novel mechanism of action.

Now, of marketed drugs, there are plenty of examples. The thing you actually want is not the timing of the syndrome itself but instead when they become scientifically apparent. Belviq, a novel psychiatric weight loss drug, was on the market for 8 years before being quietly pulled in 2020 for a link to cancer. As far as I know no mechanism is known, but real data nonetheless led to that decision. And do you know how long fenfluramine was on the market before it was pulled for causing valvulopathy? If not, it will disturb you. Decades. These were targets and mechanisms that were thought to be extremely safe up until they weren't. It will happen again, it is guaranteed.",,,1620838744,{},gxvgsrq,False,t3_najat9,False,True,t1_gxue20g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/najat9/americans_as_young_as_12_begin_to_get_vaccinated/gxvgsrq/,1620877142,-6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Even at such a statistically high rate of surviving the virus, a good rate of these survivors would have needed hospital care and may have either needed oxygen treatment or to be put on a ventilator. Hospitals can and have become overwhelmed with admissions in situations where the virus has been allowed to spread. That in itself would lower the survival rate further, and deny healthcare to those who desperately need it.

Then there's the economic cost. Globally, we've probably lost trillions in GDP from COVID. It's left the hospitality industry in shambles and has left many small business owners destitute. Granted, this was from lockdowns put in place to control the virus, but these lockdowns were not wholly effective because of people or even entire nations that didn't follow suit.

What would the alternative have been if we didn't lock down at all? Care home industry would have collapsed from all their residents dying. Life insurance firms would have gone bust from the sheer amount of policies they'd have to pay out. The housing market would have gone into freefall from the sheer amount of now-empty homes being sold on by relatives of deceased COVID victims. This pandemic had the potential to kill tens, if not hundreds of millions of people, especially if the virus mutated into something deadlier.

Even for those who survive, we only recently determined that COVID-19 is a vascular disease, not a respiratory one. We understand long term symptoms like long-COVID a little bit more than we did back in February 2020. This is more shit that has the potential to make people less productive for a long time.

These are people who are most at risk with *any* disease, and generally understand the importance of getting vaccinated ASAP, in hope of getting an immune response.
