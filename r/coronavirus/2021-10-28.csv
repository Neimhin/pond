This is recognized in the OSHA ETS regarding occupational exposure to COVID-19, released this past summer --

https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/06/21/2021-12428/occupational-exposure-to-covid-19-emergency-temporary-standard

Which encourages employers to make use of elastomeric or powered (PAPR) respirators to prevent shortages:

&gt; OSHA is therefore clarifying that respirators are required for the protection of workers exposed to suspected or confirmed sources of COVID-19 in healthcare settings, and in all of those cases the respirators must be used in accordance with the Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134). _OSHA also encourages employers, where possible, to select elastomeric respirators or PAPRs instead of filtering facepiece respirators to prevent shortages and supply chain disruption. Because the crisis capacity strategy is less protective, the employer should only use crisis capacity strategies for a limited period of time and **take immediate steps to purchase and use elastomeric respirators or PAPRs in order to prevent future shortages** and further expose their workers to the grave danger of COVID-19._

Manufacturers are performing ongoing work to improve elastomeric half mask respirators for use during these sort of situations, including producing models without exhalation valves to improve source control and with speech diaphragms to improve communication ability.

https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2021/03/01/elastomeric_source-control/

Hopefully, if we get unlucky enough to go through another major pandemic in our lifetime, improved elastomeric respirators / PAPRs will help to avoid the months-long respirator shortage we experienced in the spring/summer of 2020.",,,,1635482642,{},hih5732,False,t3_qhptgg,False,True,t3_qhptgg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qhptgg/new_plasma_technology_method_neutralizes_9999/hih5732/,1635666668.0,0,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hospitals are struggling to find supplies of liquid oxygen to boost the lung function of patients as the country continues to see consecutive daily death records and has gone into partial lockdown to curb the virus. The latest tally on Friday reported 1,163 fatalities, bringing the total to 236,220, Europe’s highest.   
“I don’t want to sound hysterical, but the situation is very tense. There isn’t really a way we can scale up our production,” said Dmitriy Kuznetsov, the general manager of Cryongenmash, one of the three largest producers of medical oxygen in the country.  
Kuznetsov said his company has scaled up “immensely” during the pandemic, and now produces 300 of the 2,000 metric tons of medical oxygen used each day in Russian hospitals.  
**Apart from isolated incidents, Russia has so far avoided widespread oxygen shortages** similar to those seen in India last spring, where patients across the country died after hospitals ran out of supplies.  
However, medics and suppliers say that during the latest wave of infections in a country where only 33% of adults are fully vaccinated, they are facing unprecedented demand.  
...  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Last week, the republic of **Chuvashia**, a region 600 kilometres east of Moscow was the first to raise alarm, when it declared a state of “high alert” due to oxygen shortages in hospitals  
“The current situation is developing in a way that oxygen is running out,” the republic’s head Oleg Nikolaev told local media. **Officials said that 99.5% of the region’s Covid-19 beds were occupied.**  
Speaking under condition of anonymity, two doctors working in the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Chuvashia’s capital Cheboksary warned that oxygen was running very low.  
**“We are getting to the point where we will have to choose who gets the oxygen,” one said.**  
...  
  
&gt;  
&gt;In Russia’s isolated northern republic of **Komi**, the region’s head Vladimir Uyba said the situation was about “to burst.”  
  
&gt;  
&gt;..  
&gt;  
&gt;And in the Ural city of **Perm**, a medic told the local Ura News website that there had already been instances when they ran out of oxygen.

You can't just take an unreviewed preprint, correct one huge error that is known, and then pretend you have a real result even though it's still unreviewed and may very well have other flaws.

It also lacks important context.  For example, what if 1 in 26,315 people who got vaccinated got myocarditis, and also 1 in 31,500 people who didn't get vaccinated got myocarditis - what does that mean about the actual risk from vaccination?  Is it statistically significant at all?

And then there's the fact that it's an observational study, not a random controlled trial.  In order for the numbers to even be meaningful, you have to adjust for possible correlated factors between the vaccinated and unvaccinated set of people.  What if they came up with a set of adjustments that shows that actually, the incidence of myocarditis among vaccinated people is *lower* than among unvaccinated people?  On the other hand, what if the correlating factors they chose and adjusted by, have a huge gaping flaw that some reviewers catch?

It would be irresponsible for an article about a retraction, to effectively ""correct"" the preprint and give people the impression that with this error corrected, here's the new number.

I don't think we need to wait for the long, slow publication process to reach tentative conclusions about these things, when there are already multiple pre-prints that the same people who are doing the peer reviewing don't see any problems with.

Look at Indonesia, which had one of the worst outbreaks in the world for a while and still has a better per capita number than almost all the Western countries.  On the other hand, in very small populations a single digit number of deaths in a day moves the per capita number significantly, so it's really easy for a small population to post massive per capita numbers just from a few outbreaks; this is why most of the highest countries in per capita deaths are those tiny, obscure European countries.

[],,gorzakus,,,[],,,,text,t2_10m1ro,False,False,[],"""The findings in this report are subject to at least seven limitations. First, although this analysis was designed to compare two groups with different sources of immunity, patients might have been misclassified. If SARS-CoV-2 testing occurred outside of network partners’ medical facilities or if vaccinated persons are less likely to seek testing, some positive SARS-CoV-2 test results might have been missed and thus some patients classified as vaccinated and previously uninfected might also have been infected. In addition, despite the high specificity of COVID-19 vaccination status from these data sources, misclassification is possible. Second, the aOR could not be further stratified by time since infection or vaccination because of sparse data and limited ability to control for residual confounding that could be magnified within shorter intervals. The aOR that did not adjust for time might also be subject to residual confounding, particularly related to waning of both types of immunity. Third, selection bias might be possible if vaccination status influences likelihood of testing and if previous infection influences the likelihood of vaccination. Previous work from the VISION network did not identify systematic bias in testing by vaccination status, based on data through May 2021 (1). Fourth, residual confounding might exist because the study did not measure or adjust for behavioral differences between the comparison groups that could modify the risk of the outcome. Fifth, these results might not be generalizable to nonhospitalized patients who have different access to medical care or different health care–seeking behaviors, particularly outside of the nine states covered. Sixth, the statistical model incorporated the use of a weighted propensity score method which is subject to biases in estimates or standard errors if the propensity score model is misspecified. Numerous techniques were used to reduce potential suboptimal specification of the model, including but not limited to including a large set of covariates for machine learning estimation of propensity scores, including covariates in both regression and propensity models, ensuring large sample sizes and checking stability of weights, and conducting secondary analyses to assess robustness of results.

The Moderna shot produces much higher antibody levels, which in turn produce a better T/B cell response. JJ produces lower antibody levels, so it doesn't help with mild/moderate disease, but the severe disease protection doesn't wane as much. 

We don't know how long antibodies from the booster will last; very likely longer because they're so high. And that in turn might lead to a better memory response in the future.

I just don't think the drop looks substantial compared to the massive decreases from the historical peaks in Iran, and there have been low days as I previously mentioned on the 8th and 9th. You can pick that time frame of a week and point toward a drop as well.

If by ""decreasing"" as you originally said you mean that it's been decreasing if you look at 7-day timeframes, then yes, it's going down. But I was pointing out that your statement is inaccurate if you look on a day-by-day basis, especially if you take into account that the dip that caused the 7-day timeframe case drop was a 5-day fluctuation of lower cases that seems to have risen again.

As I previously mentioned, I do think that there's an overall trend toward a decrease and I hope it holds, but there's also a possibility that this is simply a dip before another peak considering the oncoming winter season in Iran and, going by the little I can see of the article because I don't want to register, it looks like the point is that the Delta variant is going to reinfect all the people that caught the Alpha variant already.

Yea, mathing this out, I suspect the planet needs to be planning a 6-8 month booster and likely one more at about 12-18 months after that before we convince out bodies to keep enough antibodies around to beat COVID where we’re at. If the 7% antibody reduction per month falls to 3% at 8 months, like we’ve seen and expect it to, it should be closer to 24 month, but we should be able to guess that at 18 months. This is all napkin super basic trend modeling from what we’ve seen from NAb results thus far, results may vary based on actual efficacy of the “booster” at 8 months. Basically, the current set of vaccines is not ideally timed and the titers don’t get high enough to be set for life after two doses, so “booster” likely means the vaccine needs to be three doses for those of us who got vaccinated originally, maybe four. MMR is 3 Polio was 4, so it’s not unheard of.

In addition, in 1977, influenza research was performed without modern biosafety regulations and protective equipment, making the lab accident hypothesis much less relevant to the modern GOF debate.

&gt;From Oct. 18 through Sunday, more than half the world’s new confirmed cases were reported in Europe, a World Health Organization report said, and it was the only region that reported an increase in both new infections and coronavirus deaths.

&gt;Low vaccination rates in Eastern Europe are partly to blame for the grim numbers.

&gt;Although several Western European countries have reported a rise in cases, they have fully immunized the majority of their adult populations, and have seen relatively low numbers of deaths and hospitalizations.

&gt;The picture is starkly different in the East, where vaccinations are readily available, but many people remain hesitant to get shots, mainly because of widespread mistrust of the authorities.

&gt;”The global number of reported cases and deaths from Covid-19 is now increasing for the first time in two months, driven by an ongoing rise in Europe that outweighs declines in other regions,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O. director general, said in a briefing on Thursday. “It’s another reminder that the Covid-19 pandemic is far from over.”

&gt;Europe recently overtook the United States in daily cases per capita, with nearly 29 cases per 100,000 people, compared with about 22 in the U.S., according to Our World In Data.

&gt;The countries hit hardest now are concentrated in Eastern Europe, and there are serious concerns that another surge could shatter their underfunded and understaffed health care systems.

&gt;The Baltic nations — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — are each averaging more than 100 new daily cases per 100,000 people, according to a New York Times database.

&gt;Latvia became the first E.U. member to institute a general lockdown on Oct. 21, and Estonia has also put new restrictions in place. Latvia’s vaccination rate is among the lowest in the European Union, with just under half its population fully vaccinated; the figure across the bloc as a whole is around 64 percent.

&gt;In Romania, where only 30 percent of residents are fully immunized, the situation has become so dire that this month the government asked for emergency help from other European Union countries. On Oct. 19, as hospitals were running out of beds, the country recorded its highest death toll since the beginning of the pandemic.

&gt;And in Poland the health minister said last week that the country was facing “an explosion of the pandemic,” after it recorded 85 percent and 100 percent weekly increases in new cases.

&gt;The picture grows grimmer beyond the E.U. borders. In Russia, which recorded the highest death toll in Europe, the Kremlin this week issued a stay-at-home order for workers until Nov. 7. And in neighboring Ukraine, only 16 percent of the population has been fully immunized.

&gt;But the recent spike in cases isn’t limited to Eastern Europe. In Germany, cases have doubled since Oct. 1. Britain is averaging 66 new daily cases per 100,000 people, and its positivity rate has been persistently high since the Delta variant swept through the country over the summer.

&gt;And in Belgium, the government reimposed restrictions on Tuesday that had been removed only weeks ago, with cases steadily increasing.

They make up a solid 14% of all people in this country, and out of those people 63% are functionally illiterate. So right off the bat 8% of people in America can't read and those aren't even people born here. Then you take into account generational issues, children of immigrants who can't read. For example literacy difficulties brought by low-skill immigrants persist beyond the immigrant generation. The children of Hispanic immigrants 22 percent are below basic. In addition, just 5 percent of second generation Hispanics have ""elite"" literacy skills, compared to 14 percent of natives overall.

Now that stat is for Hispanics but you can already see the pattern, and it's the same with poverty. Those born in it are likely to stay in it. So just here, if we extrapolate those numbers (which we probably shouldn't) and take an average of 1.93 kids per American household, that adds an additional 8 million people. So now we're at 44 million who can't read, or just around 13% of the total population and we just polled immigrants. 34% of children of immigrants can read at the average 7th grade level. So a little more than half of all immigrant families can't read well. That's a hell of a lot of people.

I'm not just blaming immigrants or their children here, it's not their fault if they came from that environment. It is important to remember though that they are statistically relevant when looking at things like national averages. There are also disabilities to consider. 45 million Americans have dyslexia.  Among those with this disability, about 70-80 percent have trouble with accurate and fluent word recognition that originates with weaknesses in phonological processing, often in combination with fluency and comprehension problems. So now we're at ~1/4 of the population through no fault of their own, no failure of the education system, just pure and simple bad luck.

So now we have the last 3/4 of the population and they have to fit in those last few spots. If you do the math, that last 3/4 have to spread across that data set we just laid out. Which is already heavily skewed towards illiteracy. So the last 3/4 cannot be that heavily skewed towards illiteracy. So if you take the actual population who would've been in school, who's parents were born here, and have no disabilities, they actually average out to a much higher literacy rate.

It's like people comparing medieval lifespans. Heavily skewed towards lower morality because of extrenuous circumstances but when corrected, shows people live longer after a certain age. Same thing here, higher literacy rate when you remove extrenuous circumstances.",,,,1635511148,{},hii79nm,False,t3_qhyc2q,False,True,t1_hihmqh5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qhyc2q/100_of_cubas_eligible_population_has_received_at/hii79nm/,1635686465.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody seroprevalence study among &gt;2,000 domestic cats from 4 countries during the first coronavirus disease wave in Europe. We found 4.4% seroprevalence using a virus neutralization test and 4.3% using a receptor-binding domain ELISA, demonstrating probable human-to-cat transmission.

Conclusions  
During the first COVID-19 pandemic wave, reported seroprevalence levels in domestic cats ranged from 0.4% in the Netherlands (4) to 23% among cats in COVID-19–positive households in France (13). Similar seroprevalence levels in cats and humans in the same areas found by us and others suggest that in the absence of another known source (4,13; C. Schulz, unpublished data) (Appendix Table), SARS-CoV-2 infections in cats are most likely due to human-to-cat contact transmission.  
  
Most natural SARS-CoV-2 infections of cats appear to run a mild or subclinical course, with respiratory or gastrointestinal clinical signs reported in confirmed natural infections (6–8). Evidence from experimental studies suggests that cats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and can maintain the virus within a cat population and spill the infection backward or forward to other species (2,3,14). However, no evidence of cat-to-human transmission, nor of cat-specific mutations or variants of SARS-CoV-2, has been detected thus far (8,12,15). This finding contrasts reports on minks kept in farms, where mink-to-human spillback infections and mink-specific mutations have been reported (5). Although no evidence currently suggests that domestic cats play a role in the epidemiology of human SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinicians and veterinary practitioners should recommend that SARS-CoV-2–infected persons avoid close contact with their domestic cats and practice the same nonpharmaceutical prevention measures toward cats as they do to prevent human-to-human infection.",,,,1635514634,{},hiien9q,True,t3_qicyq7,False,True,t3_qicyq7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qicyq7/early_release_sarscov2specific_antibodies_in/hiien9q/,1635690929.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But here's the thing, all of those actions above , to people, are short term cause/effect things, and they dont think or anticipate being chronic and always believe they will stop before they will do harm to themselves.

The jab is one and done, and is the red or the blue pill decision.  Modern medicine has a very long line of screw ups.  It's progress over perfection.  With the Covid vaccine, we accelerated progress and are hoping that we are close to perfection.  But we may not be.    
Some of the folks hesitant have been on the bad end of 'experts' in medicine, like me.  

So I lived like a hermit while I waited to see what happened to everyone else before getting my shot.  First one was bad, then I waited 8 weeks , took the second one and had ZERO side effects.  NOTHING.  So now I have worry that I actually got the flu shot or my immune system is so screwed up that I will catch and get seriously sick from Covid anyway.

All gambling in my opinion, which gamble do you take.  I could live like a hermit anymore so I had to make a decision.

We will never get to raise a drink to covid being over.  People will realize one day, that it has been a long time since a wave hit our areas, but there will be no parade and no absolute day that we call this thing done, because everyone will be so nervous of another variant cropping up some fall and spreading around, or that another virus like this will come out, sars3 or whatever.

Ron DeSantis of Florida announced on Thursday that his administration was suing the federal government to challenge the requirement.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Tampa, seeks to block a Dec. 8 deadline imposed by the Biden administration for federal contractors to get vaccinated.

Legal experts say the federal government has broad authority to address a public health crisis like the pandemic with measures like vaccine mandates and that such suits have little chance of succeeding. The Supreme Court has turned away legal challenges to vaccine mandates at Indiana University and for health care workers in Maine.

Mr. DeSantis, a Republican, spoke at a news conference at the Florida Air Museum in Lakeland, in a nod to the state’s aerospace contractors. Among the named defendants in the lawsuit are NASA and its administrator, Bill Nelson, a former U.S. senator from Florida.

“We’ve got a very big footprint of companies that do contracting work for the federal government,” Mr. DeSantis said about his state. “There’s a lot of folks that will be in the cross hairs on this.”

Joining Mr. DeSantis at the news conference were the state’s attorney general, Ashley Moody, and several contractors and their relatives. One contractor who provides vending machines to federal and state buildings said that he had not yet gotten a shot because he was “waiting for more information” on vaccinations.

Information about Covid vaccines has been issued by vaccine makers, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and many news organizations.

Mr. Biden told would-be litigants against his vaccine plan to “have at it” after he announced it in September. And several Republican governors have vowed to do just that.

Lawrence O. Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor who specializes in public health, wrote in an email that “DeSantis will almost certainly lose this lawsuit.”

Mr. Gostin said he expected that Biden’s order to vaccinate federal workers and contractors would stand, even in states that have banned vaccine mandates, because under the Constitution’s supremacy clause federal rules pre-empt state and local dictates.

“The president is the head of the federal workforce,” Mr. Gostin wrote. “Just like any business or employer, he has the clear power to set reasonable, evidence-based rules to ensure a safe and productive workforce.”

Lawsuits like Mr. DeSantis’s are politically motivated, and are damaging because they feed public doubts about vaccination, Mr. Gostin said.

Mr. Gostin said that he thought mandates that do not include religious exemptions, like one for health care workers in New York State, could be more legally vulnerable.

“I feel strongly there is no legal requirement to offer religious exemptions, but the Supreme Court is highly sensitive to religious claims,” Mr. Gostin said.

Mr. DeSantis faces re-election next year, and is considered to be a leading hopeful for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 in the absence of a bid by former President Donald J. Trump, who won the state in the last two elections. For months, Mr. DeSantis has been a forceful opponent of all Covid vaccine requirements.

This year, the Florida Legislature and Mr. DeSantis prohibited businesses from requiring customers to show proof of vaccination. Mr. DeSantis has said he intends to call a special legislative session to ban employers from requiring employees to be vaccinated. He also vowed on Thursday that Florida — which requires that students at both public and private schools get at least six kinds of vaccinations, including those for diphtheria, measles and hepatitis B — would not require schoolchildren to get Covid shots.

On Thursday in Lakeland, Mr. DeSantis stood behind a lectern with a sign that read “Protect Florida Jobs,” and warned of a wave of attrition if federal vaccine mandates are allowed to take effect.

“We are not going to deny people their ability to make a living based on their decision about an injection,” he said.

Considerable uncertainty surrounds the timeline of introductions and onsets of local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 globally1–7. Although a limited number of SARS-CoV-2 introductions were reported in January and February 20208,9, the narrowness of the initial testing criteria, combined with a slow growth in testing capacity and porous travel screening10, left many countries vulnerable to unmitigated, cryptic transmission. Here we use a global metapopulation epidemic model to provide a mechanistic understanding of the early dispersal of infections, and the temporal windows of the introduction and onset of SARS-CoV-2 local transmission in Europe and the United States. We find that community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was likely in several areas of Europe and the United States by January 2020, and estimate that by early March, only 1 to 3 in 100 SARS-CoV-2 infections were detected by surveillance systems. The modelling results highlight international travel as the key driver of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 with possible introductions and transmission events as early as December 2019–January 2020. We find a heterogeneous, geographic distribution of cumulative infection attack rates by 4 July 2020, ranging from 0.78%–15.2% across US states and 0.19%–13.2% in European countries. Our approach complements phylogenetic analyses and other surveillance approaches and provides insights that can be used to design innovative, model-driven surveillance systems that guide enhanced testing and response strategies.",,,,1635514200,{},hiidpa3,True,t3_qicuds,False,True,t3_qicuds,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qicuds/cryptic_transmission_of_sarscov2_and_the_first/hiidpa3/,1635690321.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We really shouldn't think of this a ""bucket"" issue.  Either you're in the vaccinated bucket or the natural immunity bucket - it can't be either/or, because it's just not that simple.  We know having previously had Covid conveys some natural immunity, but to what exactly, and for how long?  Does a previous infection of Alpha protect against Delta?  Does it protect against reinfection?  Or does natural immunity protect against serious illness and death?  And how long do these effects last?  What we absolutely know is that people who have previously had a Covid infection and then gone on to get vaccinated are about half as likely to get reinfected.  So the vaccines provide value even to those with previous infection.

Cuba had a major problem since july when it's government detained protesters, major countries step on and asked for their liberation. Thing is, we know about them.

Maduro has openly closed independent media, there's little to none coverage of negative news from the government (unless someone counts to the ones going to public busses using speakers). Cuba, surprisingly, has different sources of independent media that gets the luxury to publish in their own editorial.

I'd think that the country that calls political dissidents parasites, doesn't allow people to leave the country, doesn't allow free internet, and, you know, ONLY allows the communist party to be in power... Has more chances of brainwashing its citizens. Just saying, you know. Do Americans have their own weird culty nationalistic shit? Yes they do. Are Cubans being taught and raised in an educational system that is wholly government-owned and run? Yes, they are. 

&gt;The protests were quite small, compared to the counterprotests in support of the government, which drew about 10 times as many people. Of course, US media reported on only one of those incidents. Because, you know ... who's ""brainwashed""?

You know, I've already lived in a place where a simple trick can be pulled. It turns out that the government, which is the single largest employer in Cuba, can simply force government employees to go out to protest on the streets, lest they want to lose their jobs. Happened in Venezuela too - PDVSA workers with good jobs sometimes went to pro-government protests waearing masks since they were afraid of losing their jobs but were also embarrassed of having to politically act (albeit forcefully) in favor of a political system they didn't approve of.

Here's what your source says, among other things:

&gt;According to a January 2014 Gallup poll, 65 percent of Americans are “dissatisfied with the nation's system of government and how well it works.” Meanwhile, 52 percent of Cubans are dissatisfied with their political system, according to the new poll by Univision/Fusion.

aka, most Cubans are dissatisfied with their political system lol. Do you even read what you post? It's also an almost 8 year old poll.

The margin of benefit, based primarily on a health perspective, is considered too small to support advice on a universal programme of vaccination of otherwise healthy 12 to 15-year-old children at this time.

Seems pretty clear to me, and seems pretty clearly wrong in retrospect.

The term whataboutism is used often in Western countries every single time someone pointed out something wrong in the West. This is one of the MOST common illogical ideologies used when South Americans, South Asians, and Asians point out and highlight issues on the West.

For example, lobby groups in the USA is not contributing to government corruption. But lobby groups in India is government corruption. If I draw a comparison between the two, I would be called out as using whataboutism. LOL

Whataboutism is used by the West to scapegoat everything wrong with the West!",,,,1635531843,{},hijlqu9,False,t3_qhyc2q,False,True,t1_hij3jr2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qhyc2q/100_of_cubas_eligible_population_has_received_at/hijlqu9/,1635717595.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were 17 deaths in the fluvoxamine group and 25 deaths in the placebo group in the primary intention-to-treat analysis (odds ratio [OR] 0·68, 95% CI: 0·36–1·27). There was one death in the fluvoxamine group and 12 in the placebo group for the per-protocol population (OR 0·09; 95% CI 0·01–0·47).

We found no significant differences in number of treatment emergent adverse events among patients in the fluvoxamine and placebo groups.

Interpretation

Treatment with fluvoxamine (100 mg twice daily for 10 days) among high-risk outpatients with early diagnosed COVID-19 reduced the need for hospitalisation defined as retention in a COVID-19 emergency setting or transfer to a tertiary hospital...

Discussion

...Our trial has found that fluvoxamine, an inexpensive existing drug, reduces the need for advanced disease care in this high-risk population. A 10-day course of fluvoxamine costs approximately US$4 even in well-resourced settings.

Our study compares favourably with the treatment effects of more expensive treatments including monoclonal antibodies for outpatient treatment.

The absolute number of serious adverse events associated with fluvoxamine was lower than for placebo and this might reflect the modulatory effect of fluvoxamine on systemic inflammation in these participants. Lower respiratory tract infections were reported less frequently in patients in the fluvoxamine group than those in the placebo group. This is concordant with the reduction of hospital admissions in patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated with fluvoxamine, and the numerically lower number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.



Further, the 5% reduction in deterioration you mentioned is on an absolute risk reduction basis, which to my understanding (not in the science field) is greater than the absolute risk reduction calculated in the phase III studies for the vaccines. The 68% relative risk reduction in hospitalisations is what one should compare to the risk reductions quoted everywhere in the media for the vaccines, because those numbers quoted are the relative risk reduction calculations.

&gt; On Tuesday, an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended that children ages 5-11 be made eligible for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The FDA and the CDC must now also approve the vaccine for that age group, which could happen as early as next week.

&gt; Next on the horizon for Pfizer — the only vaccine currently available to people under 18 — is children under 5. Here’s what we know so far.

&gt; ###Is there a vaccine in development for children under 5?

&gt; Yes. Right now, Pfizer is conducting clinical trials for its vaccine for children as young as 6 months old. The trials for kids are split into three age groups: 5-11, 2-5, and 6 months to 2 years old.

&gt; ###Is the vaccine for young children the same as the one for adults?

&gt; The Pfizer formula for all age groups is the same, though dosage size differs. In clinical trials, children under 5 are receiving an even smaller dose of the Pfizer vaccine than children 5-11, who received a smaller dose than people 12 and up.

&gt; As with adults, kids 12 and up and now kids 5-11, children under 5 are receiving two doses, three weeks apart.

&gt; ###When will a vaccine for children under 5 be available?

&gt; Results from the clinical trials for children under 5 could come as soon as the end of the year, a Pfizer spokesperson confirmed. Results for children 2-5 will come first, followed by children 6 months to 2 years old.",,,,1635541659,{},hikajem,False,t3_qik5sp,False,True,t1_hik8bjb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qik5sp/fda_authorizes_pfizers_covid_vaccine_for_kids/hikajem/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,39b035cea4187dbdbacad65710558585a381995f,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1635541671.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,,

There is a perception that children are largely asymptomatic to the virus, and true long term effects of the vaccine are literally impossible to predict. Perhaps the long term effects of COVID on children (which are also yet unknown) are even worse, but even the thought of being the sole agent of harm to your own children is horrible to imagine.

Additionally, medical authorities are being a bit circumspect about their recommendations. That is not to say they are not recommending it, but they are emphasizing personal choice. There are not many serious medical authorities really saying ""oh my god get the vaccine now or your children will die"" like they have been for adults. And districts have not yet weighed in on whether vaccination will be mandatory for enrollment.

Also everyone is already back to school, and sports are resuming, and kids are playing together again, so from a practical lifestyle perspective there is not much improvement to be had.

Obviously age plays a big role in percentages for different age groups, and India is a young country. However, we know that India's health system was completely overloaded and tons of people weren't getting oxygen.

So, if you assume 10% of India got Covid in that spike (potentially conservative), then that's 140 million cases. Of those, 2.8 million would need a bed.

Or a fourth of the beds they would have needed if only 1 in 10 in India got Covid in that wave. Most of those unable to get a bed that needed one would have died. 

So that's a back of the envelope estimate of 2.1M dead in India on a likely conservative estimate. And any increase in the ratio that got Covid does not come with an increase in beds. And it assumes every bed was empty when the wave began.

And many of those hospital beds are nowhere near rural villages.

Yeah, I think it's inevitable that we're all going to get it at some point.  Even if everybody got vaccinated, I think Delta is contagious enough to keep spreading at low levels and evolve slightly more effective descendants.  But with the vaccinations, it should be no worse than a bad cold or flu, and many people won't ever even know they had it.

Those at ""the top"" may share my viewpoint that everyone is going to get it whether they're vaccinated or not, but if they said it out loud, the antivaxxers would strip all nuance from their words and claim it as proof that the vaccines don't work.  

What ""the top"" could be saying while remaining truthful is that everyone who doesn't get vaccinated is likely to get the virus *within the next couple of years*.  Delta is contagious enough that it seems likely that almost everyone who is not vaccinated will get it very soon.

Objective: Sleep complaints are frequent after acute COVID-19. Aim of this study was to videopolysomnographically evaluate sleep and sleep disorders after SARS-Cov2 infection.  
  
Methods: Patients with suspected sleep disorders after acute COVID-19 underwent video-polysomnography (v-PSG) at the Sleep Disorders Clinic, Department of Neurology, Medical University Innsbruck. V-PSG was conducted 4.2 (SD = 1.3) months after diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.  
  
Results: Eleven patients \[nine men, age 52.5 (SD = 11.7) years; BMI 29 (SD = 5.2) kg/m2\] were included. At 60 days follow-up after diagnosis, persisting breathing complaints were present in 7/11 (64%) patients. After v-PSG four patients (36%) were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Respiratory frequency during sleep was normal and no tachypnea, thoracoabdominal asynchrony, or periodic deep sighing were detected. Four patients (36%) showed REM sleep without atonia (RWA), and two additional patients showed an RWA index within the highest range of normality.  
  
Conclusion: We report videopolysomnographic findings in a series of eleven patients after acute COVID-19. A major finding of this study was the presence of isolated RWA, a recognized prodromal stage of RBD, in more than one third of the patients. Future videopolysomnographic investigations including quantification of RWA in patients after COVID-19 will give more insights into a possible acute or post-infectious CNS pathology related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said Thursday that he is preparing to request federal medical surge teams, stop elective and cosmetic surgeries, and scale up distribution of monoclonal antibody treatments as COVID-19 hospitalizations in the state continue to spike.  
Polis also said he may reinstate an order or orders rationing medical care — including a crisis standards of care directive — in the state.  
The governor said the steps will be taken in the coming days and weeks unless the number of new COVID-19 cases begins to decline, which he said he doesn’t necessarily expect to happen.  
“I don’t think they’ll all be in place in a week or two unless things get worse,” Polis said. “We still have space in hospitals. It’s tight. There’s extra shifts. People are working (hard). But we’re not at the point yet where we have to, as a state, ban elective surgery.”  
Monoclonal antibody treatments are already being distributed to urgent care and mobile clinics so that people can access them outside of a hospital setting. The treatments can reduce the risk of hospitalization in people who contract COVID-19.  
The announcement Thursday at a news conference at the governor’s mansion in downtown Denver is the most serious signal yet that Colorado’s coronavirus situation has worsened to the point that the capacity of the state’s hospitals is being threatened.  
Last week, state health officials warned that the surge in hospitalizations had left Colorado with only about 120 available intensive care beds.  
“The reality is we have a high level of cases in Colorado,” Polis said of Colorado’s COVID-19 hospitalizations.  
On Thursday, Colorado had the eighth highest number of daily average cases per 100,000 people among the 50 U.S. states, according to The New York Times.  
As of Thursday , 1,167 people with COVID-19 were hospitalized in the state. That’s the highest number since December 2020.  
“We are continuing to move very much in the wrong direction,” Scott Bookman, incident commander at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, told reporters on Wednesday. “We’re all very concerned at this point.”  
Dr. Rachel Herlihy, the state’s top epidemiologist, said Colorado is in the middle of “an unfortunate trend.”  
Many of the new coronavirus cases in Colorado are among children. The state is setting up vaccine clinics for kids 5 to 11 in anticipation of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine being approved for that age group in the coming days.  
Diana Herrero, deputy director of Colorado’s Division of Disease Control and Public Health Response, said the state anticipates being able to vaccinate young children against COVID-19 as soon as Nov. 5. Museums, schools, libraries and zoos could all become mass COVID-19 vaccination sites for kids, in addition to pharmacies and doctor’s offices.  
The state is planning to offer at least one pediatric vaccine clinic in each county.  
“Right now, we’ve got about 384 locations outside of the big events we’re planning,” Herrero said.  
There are about 480,000 people in Colorado between the ages of 5 and 11. The state hopes to be able to inoculate at least half of those with at least one dose by Jan. 31.  
Polis did not answer a question Thursday about whether he is preparing to reinstate COVID-19 public health mandates, like an indoor mask-wearing order. Some counties — like Boulder and Larimer — have done so on their own amid rising cases.  
The governor has said previously that protecting Colorado’s hospital capacity will drive his decision making on public health orders.",,,,1635513094,{},hiibagq,True,t3_qichig,False,False,t3_qichig,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qichig/colorado_governor_prepares_to_request_federal/hiibagq/,1635688879.0,24,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The official death toll from COVID-19 is set to reach 5 million within a week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. It has been six months since 4 million deaths were recorded on July 7 and despite a slowing of growth, the virus continues to take advantage of gaps in the global response.

**Geography of deaths**

Leading total deaths is the United States with more than 737,000 deaths as of Oct. 25. It is followed by Brazil with 605,804; India with 455,068; Mexico with 286,496; and Russia with 227,506. A total of 13 countries now have six-figure death tolls.

The U.S. is not just a leader in overall deaths, but also new deaths. Since July 7, more than 131,000 new deaths were added to the total, accounting for 17.8% of all deaths.

Russia has added almost 90,000 new deaths to their total since July 7, accounting for more than one third of their total deaths. This growth has resulted in new lockdown restrictions to fight the growing outbreak.

Indonesia added more than 80,000 deaths, accounting for 56% of their total deaths; while Brazil added more than 77,000 — or 13% of total deaths — and Mexico and India each saw an excess of 50,000 deaths.

Despite this growth, the Western Pacific is home to the lowest total deaths: 126,000. The African region, which excludes Egypt, has recorded less than 150,000 deaths in total. But deaths have been rising rapidly since July, particularly in South Africa which has added almost 26,000 deaths. A total of 13 countries in the region have seen deaths double since July, including Zimbabwe which has added 2,700 deaths, and Namibia which has added over 1,800. 
According to the World Health Organization, the Western Pacific has seen the fastest rise in deaths. Over 70,000 new deaths have been recorded since July 7, more than doubling the regional total. Massive growth has been recorded in Malaysia — over 22,000 new deaths — and Vietnam — over 21,000 new deaths. On July 7, Vietnam had recorded just 102 deaths.

**COVID-19 deaths versus vaccinations**

The increasing number of deaths in the African region is combined with the slow vaccine rollout, creating concern for more deaths to come. Just 10 countries have been able to fully vaccinate more than 10% of their total population. Seychelles is leading the way – more than three quarters of their total population are fully vaccinated – followed by Mauritius at 66%, Eswatini at 20%, South Africa at 20%, and Zimbabwe at 17%. Four countries have yet to fully vaccinate 1% of their population: Cameroon, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Uganda.

“We’re by no means near the finishing line for this pandemic,” Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said in a media briefing on Oct. 14. “For the end to be in sight, vaccination rates must dramatically increase, case management capacities should be expanded, and basic public health measures – including active case findings and testing – should be reinforced.”

The eastern Mediterranean and Southeast Asia also have yet to see more than a quarter of their total population fully vaccinated. The lack of information on fully vaccinated populations in North Korea, Djibouti, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen is partially responsible for these tallies.

Elsewhere, vaccinations are dramatically uneven.

The Western Pacific has the largest population of fully vaccinated individuals, thanks to strong rollouts in Cambodia, China, Japan, Malaysia, and Singapore. Over 70% of the total populations are fully vaccinated. But in Papua New Guinea, just over 1% of the total population is fully vaccinated as the government looks to mass burials to ease the growing burden on morgues.

**Underreporting remains a concern**

But 5 million deaths are just the tip of the iceberg. Underreporting has been an issue since the beginning of the pandemic, especially in countries struggling with mortality registration prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and countries facing additional crises and conflict.

Comparisons of excess mortality statistics, an analysis of burial patterns, and citizen science approaches have seen modelling estimate that the death toll is missing 50% to 75% of deaths. WHO will soon be releasing new data which they hope will augment this critical knowledge gap.",,,,1635518800,{},hiioga5,True,t3_qiedvm,False,False,t3_qiedvm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qiedvm/the_world_has_lost_5_million_lives_from_covid19/hiioga5/,1635697025.0,191,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think that we agree in general terms but that I am talking about there being a ""dead zone"" of sorts in data - where the value is no longer reasonable to assume or draw any conclusive statements from because of the noise you mention.  It may very well be that we disagree on the end points and how they apply of what conclusions from them mean (as in yes, a scale only tells you what it tells you, but reasoned thinking can overcome that failure / avoid that pitfall). 

In the case of scales, if you look at the lower end or upper end, you can't necessarily draw rational conclusions looking at just the number - otherwise a person is highly likely to be wrong. 

In the case of a scale showing zero with an item on it, you can't reasonably say/conclude: ""this item weighs nothing"" despite the number being 0.  Just as if you hit the top range of the scale, ""this item weighs x"" can't be reasonably concluded since you have maxed out what the scale can reasonably tell you; A person can say that ""the scale is saying the item weighs x"", but thinking about it, the conclusion is not ""the item weighs x because the scale says so"".",,,,1635531295,{},hijkcsv,False,t3_qhyc2q,False,True,t1_hij90df,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qhyc2q/100_of_cubas_eligible_population_has_received_at/hijkcsv/,1635716786.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm not from the US or any other country with a high quantity of anti-vaxxers either.

The lowest age group in the UK currently receiving the vaccine is 12-15.

Approving that was a stretch.

Below is the latest from the JCVI, which did not recommend universal vaccination in the 12-15 age group.

They DID recommend it for children with underlying health conditions, but not universally for all children aged 12-15.

[JCVI statement on COVID-19 vaccination of children aged 12 to 15 years: 3 September 2021
](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jcvi-statement-september-2021-covid-19-vaccination-of-children-aged-12-to-15-years/jcvi-statement-on-covid-19-vaccination-of-children-aged-12-to-15-years-3-september-2021)

&gt;The current update relates to JCVI’s review of considerations for the vaccination of children aged 12 to 15 years who do not have underlying health conditions that put them at increased risk from COVID-19. A precautionary approach was agreed given the very low risk of serious disease in those aged 12 to 15 years without an underlying health condition that puts them at increased risk. Given this very low risk, considerations on the potential harms and benefits of vaccination are very finely balanced.

&gt;Key points of consideration include that admission rates in children with underlying co-morbidities were substantially higher than those in healthy children – evidence which prompted advice on vaccination of children aged 12 and over who are at clinical risk. The extent of any indirect benefits is highly uncertain given our current understanding of the impact of vaccination on transmission in the short and medium term. Understanding of the current and future role of schools on wider transmission, due to the previous use of non-pharmaceutical interventions, increases this uncertainty about the potential impact of vaccination.

&gt;The available evidence indicates that the individual health benefits from COVID-19 vaccination are small in those aged 12 to 15 years who do not have underlying health conditions which put them at risk of severe COVID-19. The potential risks from vaccination are also small, with reports of post-vaccination myocarditis being very rare, but potentially serious and still in the process of being described. Given the rarity of these events and the limited follow-up time of children and young people with post-vaccination myocarditis, substantial uncertainty remains regarding the health risks associated with these adverse events.

&gt;Overall, the committee is of the opinion that the benefits from vaccination are marginally greater than the potential known harms (tables 1 to 4) but acknowledges that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the potential harms. The margin of benefit, based primarily on a health perspective, is considered too small to support advice on a universal programme of vaccination of otherwise healthy 12 to 15-year-old children at this time. As longer-term data on potential adverse reactions accrue, greater certainty may allow for a reconsideration of the benefits and harms. Such data may not be available for several months.

&gt;JCVI has reviewed further UK data on hospital admissions, paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admissions and deaths in children aged 12 to 15 years. For the vast majority of children aged 12 to 15 years, SARS-CoV2 infection is asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and is self-limiting.

The scale doesn't tell you if something is on it; it tells how how much weight is registered, strictly speaking. Take for example the following scenario. We take two temperature probes to an oven as it warms up. Each probe has a difference in the thickness of the metal, yielding slightly different readings. The thinner probe reads more quickly, but with a lot of noise in the data due to the inconsistency of the air inside the oven. The thicker probe reads more slowly with a delay, but the temperature curve is reading more smoothly. Which of these is better at representing the actual internal temperature at a given time? That not a great question to ask because it misses the point. They are both proxies that are useful in their own way. It's just not worth splitting hairs over it. Data collection is inherently messy. Here is another example. A bag of freshly roasted coffee is packed with a degassing valve. The bag says it is 12 oz of coffee. By the time the bag reaches the consumer it is now slightly less than 12 oz. What is the correct weight? Weighing the same item a few days apart yields a different weight reading. Data often does not account for changing variables. If Cuba says 100% of eligible people are vaccinated, well at least a few people who were not eligible today will be eligible tomorrow, immediately nullifying the accuracy of the data.

But the researchers might have an almost impossible task, given the difficulties of proving that candidates were highly exposed to the virus, argues Ahuja. They will have to confirm that the sick partner was shedding high doses of live virus when the couple were interacting closely with one another.  
  
Discordant couples are not uncommon, but it is rare to find those that meet these criteria and have been regularly tested, he says. The fact that many people have now been vaccinated, potentially masking any genetic resistance to the virus, further limits the pool of people to study, Ahuja adds.  
  
Once they have identified possible candidates, the researchers will compare the individuals’ genomes with those of people who have been infected, in search of genes associated with resistance.
