Covid was much, much more lethal for immunocompromised people, vaccine or not. So if the prevalence of covid positive people is less (or vaccinated people is greater) the risk to immunocompromised people is less. The point you keep missing is that we CAN do something for these people and that's for everyone to get vaccinated.

In fact the bigger picture you keep on missing because you clearly just are stuck in your selfish republican mentality is that the more people who are vaccinated, the safer we ALL are. The more vaccinated people we have, the less likely we will see an escape mutant that renders vaccines ineffective that is also more lethal, the less likely an immunocompromised person will encounter and subsequently develop covid-19. And finally while the fatality rate in young and middle aged adults is quite low, thousands of people in those age groups still died and thousands more are still experiencing sequalae from the disease.

And yes, I know smallpox and SARS_CoV-2 are different animals but I bet you don't know why eradicating smallpox was possible and SARS isn't. But my point remains that vaccines work for the greater good when everyone does a tiny thing like get a shot.

Seriously, what is it about republicans that they can never, ever think about the greater good. Just for once, think about someone other than yourselves?

No idea why they would include death numbers that are unrelated to COVID in the stat to begin with?

&gt;“You are just as likely to be killed by a meteorite as die from Covid after a vaccine,” Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at the University of California San Francisco, told CNBC. “In the big scheme of things, the vaccines are tremendously powerful.”



&gt;An overwhelming majority, 76%, of the hospitalizations and deaths from breakthrough cases occurred in people over the age of 65.

Remember, seniors still die from the flu every year even with getting their flu shots.  No one ever said the vaccines will 100% protect everyone.

In practice, there are loads of potential problems on each approach that end up in a much reduced amount of mRNA/DNA being translated, therefore less spike protein, therefore less immune reaction. For example, the mRNA is quite short-lived (one reason for the crazy temperatures to store it at the start) and may degrade before it has the chance of being translated, and on the other side of the fence, a good fraction of the adenovirus carrier of AZ/J&amp;J/Sputnik can be intercepted by your immune system and the DNA cargo destroyed before it gets the chance of being translated.

Each of the vaccines tries different tricks to address this issue, *I think*, Modernal and Pfizer have a slightly different backbone for their mRNA, Modernal advices something like 5x more copies per dose than Pfizer, Sputnik uses two different adenovirus so your body does not attack so easily the second shot, and J&amp;J decided to gamble on the single shot being good enough, probably because they suspected the second might not make much of a difference because of this, however AZ does two shots with exactly the same stuff and it definitely can improve the results (tough the long wait between them is probably what helps).",,,1624691317,{},h331nwv,False,t3_o80smw,False,True,t1_h32qqof,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o80smw/booster_may_be_needed_for_jj_shot_as_delta/h331nwv/,1624970731,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;”This matter is definitely not closed, despite the government’s attempts to cover it up,” a spokesperson said.
“Matt Hancock appears to have been caught breaking the laws he created while having a secret relationship with an aide he appointed to a taxpayer-funded job.”

&gt;The photographs raised more questions about Hancock’s judgment, both in appointing a friend to a taxpayer-funded role and in breaking COVID-19 guidance imposed on millions of people by the government.

&gt;Hancock has been criticized for his department’s handling of the pandemic, particularly in the early months last year when it struggled to deliver testing and protective equipment for hospital staff treating COVID-19 patients.

&gt;Hancock was found in February to have acted unlawfully by not revealing details of contracts signed during the crisis. The health ministry said it had needed to move within very short timescales and against unparalleled global demand.

&gt;Hancock also said last year that it was right that a government scientist resigned after he broke COVID rules by meeting a partner.

&gt;	But your mask doesn’t protect you. 

High quality masks, especially N95 masks, are highly protective to the wearer.  Even surgical and cloth masks confer some level of protection.

&gt;And I would imagine you were mostly outside. 

It’s Florida in July.  It’s so hot people prioritize indoor activities with air conditioning in theme parks.  OP probably also dined in many restaurants.

&gt;	Also getting coughs is normal. 

A sore throat and cough is not normal, it’s an illness.

&gt;	If you had said that you went to Florida and you didn’t like the culture I could understand that 

This is actually true:  I strongly dislike the culture of not caring about others by refusing vaccination and simple common-sense measures like mask wearing that is apparently endemic in Florida.

&gt;	but one minor sickness shouldn’t change your life as far as masking goes

In many places, masks are worn during the winter precisely because they reduce spread of an illness.  If OP started feeling under the weather, that is *especially* a good reason to put on a mask to protect others from getting sick.

Almost five years ago, scientists from the Pasteur Institute in Lille analyzed the course of almost 600 open-heart surgeries that were performed by surgeons from the hospital in Lille in 2009-2015. They also checked what happened to the patients 500 days after they left the hospital. It turned out that people who underwent valve replacement or bypass surgery in the morning had twice as many complications as those who underwent surgery in the afternoon. These complications were not caused by the doctors. These differences were due to the work of the biological clock that controls the cardiovascular system. Thanks to him, the heart is more efficient in the second half of the day and it is easier to bear the hardships of surgery.  


  
The biological clock controls the pace of work of all organs, tissues and cells, and makes sure that the entire body functions efficiently. That is why some organs work intensively in the morning, others at noon, and still others in the evening. It is in the evening that the production of melatonin begins, and with the approaching dawn its amount decreases, which wakes us up from sleep. Late in the evening, histamine levels rise, making the skin itchy and making the skin feel like asthma. Rising blood pressure in the morning is conducive to heart attacks and strokes - these incidents happen two to three times more often in the early morning than at other times of the day. In contrast, the risk of stroke is lowest when you sleep, as sleep lowers blood pressure. At night, the kidneys work much slower, thanks to which we do not have to run to the toilet and we can sleep. This is also when growth hormone is produced.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
In 2016, in the journal ""Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences"" (PNAS), scientists from the Institute of Metabolic Science in Cambridge, UK, proved that the immune system does not work in the same way at any time of the day. He, too, like all cells in our body, has been equipped with a biological clock and works according to its clock. Scientists injected mice with the herpes virus at different times of the day. Animals that became infected in the morning when they went to bed (because mice are nocturnal animals) had 10 times more viruses than rodents infected in the evening. In a comment, the Cambridge researchers wrote that ""the time of infection can have a significant impact on disease susceptibility, or at least virus replication. This observation is in line with previous studies showing that when the flu vaccine is given affects its effectiveness. '  


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  
In these earlier studies, researchers found that it is best to get your flu vaccine in the morning. Patients who got vaccinated between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. developed more antibodies, the parts of the immune system that fight the viruses, than those who got the vaccine after 3 p.m.

&amp;#x200B;

  
The same is true of the BCG vaccine against tuberculosis. People who were vaccinated against the disease between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. had a stronger immune response than those who got vaccinated between noon and 1 p.m.

&amp;#x200B;

  
So far, no studies have been carried out to show how vaccines against COVID-19 work, but the experience so far shows that the immune system works better in the morning. Perhaps it has to do with sleep. ""While we sleep, the biological clock sends immune cells to the lymph nodes to find out what viruses and bacteria have attacked us during the day, and prepare the immune system to fight them,"" writes Dr. Annie Curtis of the RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences in Dublin at pages of the popular science portal ""The Conversation"". Indirect evidence to support this thesis was provided by a study published in 2020 in the ""International Journal of Behavioral Medicine"". It shows that poor sleep in the week leading up to flu vaccination led to the production of half as many antibodies than expected. The quality of sleep on the nights before vaccination may therefore be crucial to providing effective protection against the coronavirus.

&amp;#x200B;

  
Dr. Curtis believes that our biological clock also determines our susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of COVID-19. “The receptor that allows the coronavirus to enter our cells is under the control of the biological clock. There are different levels of this receptor in the cells that line our airways at different times of the day. This may mean that we are more likely to contract COVID-19 at certain times of the day, but more research will be needed to determine if this is really the case, 'writes Dr Curtis.",,,1624680763,{},h32o81g,True,t3_o83j0f,False,True,t3_o83j0f,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o83j0f/the_time_of_day_can_make_a_difference_when_is_the/h32o81g/,1624963386,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I only just finally recovered all the weight I lost while ill, am still suffering a little mild depression and mild fatigue on occasion (was MUCH worse even a month ago: the vaccines really helped), and have bad days now and then where I feel a lot more fatigue, maybe once every 9-10 days or so...

So yeah, it can be a lot worse the 2nd time than just feeling achy and sore.

Absolutely.  The vaccines WORK.  This needs to be remembered, and shouted from the rooftops- thanks to antivaxxers.

But it's also a little too early to get complacent.  The mutant varieties (some of which the vaccines are less effective against: and even MORE resistant variations may form in the future...) are just one more reason states shouldn't be in such a hurry to remove mask restrictions- especially given the ENORMOUS economic costs if a surge of a new, mutant variant leads to another shutdown...

More masks means fewer new cases.  Fewer cases means less chance of a new mutant variety forming, or surviving past the first few cases where simple chance could wipe it out (if an infected person has 40% odds of infecting nobody, 30% of infecting one person, 25% of infecting 2 or more, and 5% odds of being a super-spreader..

Although it's true that the percentage of Brussels' resident vaccinated is behind compared to other regions, the vaccination rate in Brussels has been similar to the other regions.

The main thing is that a lot of people who work in Brussels, live in Flanders and Wallonia, especially people working in the health sector. Many have been vaccinated in Brussels. But because the vaccination status is based on the place of residency, those people have been accounted as people vaccinated in Flanders or Wallonia. About three weeks ago, the number of vaccinations in Brussels, of people living outside of Brussels was estimated at around 130 000. At that time, 600 000 total shots had been counted for Brussels resident, so the offset due to those 130 000 unaccounted shots made up for the difference.

Each region has been allocated vaccination doses according to its population, and have been vaccinating at a similar rate. There were almost no doses lost, so we should really not conclude that Brussels have been vaccinating slower than other regions.

Another minor thing, is that many people living in Brussels are nationals of other countries. So there also is the fact that some of those people got vaccinated in their own country, and because this is not counted as ""vaccinated"" in the belgian administration, those people end up being counted as unvaccinated residents. (This is my case, as a french national, because we could get vaccinated earlier than in Brussels, many of us took a 30min trip to Lille and got our jabs).

I heard that the fact that Brussels has a younger population than the rest of Belgium also lead to people from Wallonia and Flanders to falsify their proof of residency in order to get an appointment for vaccination in Brussels, as vaccination was opened to younger age classes way earlier in Brussels than in other regions. They would have been counted as vaccinated in Flanders or Wallonia as well. 

There is another minor effect, that is that it seems that people in Brussels are less responsive to preventive health campaign than other regions, as a general trend. That's something that is observed when looking at cancer screening campaign and such, but also a third of the population have not registered a general practitioner (so they are less likely to be informed of the vaccination campaign), which is a lot more than in other regions.

In the end, Brussels's number are a lot behind other regions, but it is not due to a lack of vaccination, or because the vaccination rate has been slower. It's mainly because a lot of people vaccinated in Brussels have been counted as vaccinated people in Fladers or Wallonia",,,1624708072,{},h33j5vs,False,t3_o8749j,False,True,t1_h338x8i,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o8749j/belgium_brussels_residents_can_get_vaccinated/h33j5vs/,1624980909,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Taiwan is battling a cluster of domestic infections, almost all of them due to the previously globally dominant Alpha variant, though numbers are steadying and the outbreak has been comparatively small.

Six people in Pingtung county had been confirmed to have the Delta variant, including two who returned this month from Peru, where they are suspected of bringing the infection from, said Health Minister Chen Shih-chung.

One of them has been classified as a domestic infection, rather than within the family who arrived from Peru.

The government is carrying out mass testing in the area where the cases were reported, quarantining all suspected contacts. It has ordered supermarkets, restaurants and wet markets closed for three days, Chen said.

""Now it has entered the community, and we are proactively working to contain it,"" he said.
Taiwan had previously reported five cases, all imported, of the Delta variant, which was first detected in India.

From Sunday, the government will tighten border controls to keep out the variant, requiring arrivals from five countries, including Britain, to be placed in centralised quarantine facilities.

The Delta variant now comprises 96% of sequenced cases in Britain.

The broader picture of Taiwan's COVID-19 outbreak continues to improve, with Chen announcing 78 new cases, up only slightly from 76 the previous day, though controls on gatherings and public events remain in place.

Taiwan's tally of infections stands at 14,545 since the pandemic began, including 623 deaths.

The new cases bring the total number in the country to 14,545, of which over 13,000 are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 cases in a single day.

In the two cities considered to be Taiwan's COVID-19 hotspots, New Taipei had the most new domestic cases reported Saturday, with 36, followed by Taipei with 30, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said at a press briefing.

In other parts of the country, Keelung, Taoyuan and Pingtung each reported three new cases, while Miaoli, Changhua and Hsinchu County each reported one, Chen added.

Of the 12 cases outside Taipei and New Taipei cities, 10 had a known source of infection, while the others had unclear links to other cases and were under investigation, he said.

Meanwhile, the CECC noted that of the 13,190 COVID-19 cases confirmed between May 11 and June 24, 9,916 of the patients (75.1 percent) had now recovered and been released from quarantine.

The two imported cases confirmed Saturday both involved Taiwanese women in their 30s who had recently returned to the country from Japan and the Philippines, respectively, Chen said.

They both tested positive for COVID-19 prior to being released from their mandatory 14-day quarantine upon arrival in Taiwan.

Regarding the 13 deaths, the CECC said they were eight men and five women, in their 40s to 90s, who passed away between June 21 and June 24.

To date, 623 people in Taiwan have died from COVID-19, including 611 since May 15.

Also J&amp;J and AZ come with a blood clot risk, that while very low, is still hard to justify when there is next to no risk of actually catching Covid in the community here.  That leads to much more vaccine hesitancy and we'd never get to herd immunity.

That's a single jurisdiction.  Singapore has had the same strategy and had no trouble vaccinating.  

&gt;Seems to be more reluctance in Australia.

Because all they've had access to thus far is AZ, which is limited to 60+ and has major bad press around the blood clot issue. And everyone in Australia knows the govt has ordered millions of Pfizer doses for later in the year so there's an incentive to wait for the better vaccine.  

In NZ we are getting 100% Pfizer so there is no incentive to wait and people are very keen to have it since we all know its the best.  

&gt;I've heard about the bed capacity issues but surely the solution is to expand capacity rather than make travel difficult for 2+ years more?

There's no bed capacity issue in NZ. We deliberately keep the bed numbers low to limit daily arrivals in NZ because we average 1 quarantine leak into the community for every 200 positive cases in quarantine.  More beds means more leaks and increased risk of an outbreak or lockdown.  

NZ has not had the issue of thousands of citizens trapped overseas like Australia though.  Kiwis have been able to fly in and out of NZ without much difficulty through the whole pandemic.  We also don't ban people going overseas the way Australia does.  

In the long term hotel quarantine will only be for people coming from red zone countries. Right now the whole world is red zoned (we just moved Australia back to red zone tonight due to their outbreaks), but over time that list will shrink.  But that can't start until sometime in 2022 when we've finished vaccinations. I would expect to be able to visit the US and Europe in summer 2022.

Hong Kong.

Seems to be more reluctance in Australia.

We’re visiting family next month in Arkansas where the vaccination rate is abysmally low (28% of the population has had one dose).

I am not submitting research for peer review, so I’m not sure when or why the lack of such structure is so bothersome on Reddit.

And like I said before, I’m quite happy with supplying scholarly articles and studies to those who would like them (as I have now done for 3 people who DM’d me) but if I don’t know the level at which the article is being understood, it’s tough to pinpoint where to start. For example, If I post a study on Bovine coronavirus, someone with zoonotic and viral understanding can easily deduce how it relates to human coronavirus and see the correlation in reduced severity. If I post a study on molecular structure that explains the lack of change in the spike protein and degradation of various other pieces, I limit my audience to only those who have a minimal understanding of cell structure and chemistry. In both cases I have “supplied” support of the basic principles in declining virulence but have only confused those with less of an understanding. Hence my recommendation of understanding the basics before trying to understand these types of papers. In other words, I could supply samples that are in Latin. My point is supported and I’ve supplied your necessary paperwork. But if you can’t read Latin, what is the point?

At no point did I say (nor elude to) “trust me” because… Don’t trust me! Science is based on questioning everything! And if, whatever your understanding, that leads you to deepen and strengthen your understanding of a particular subject, fantastic! Share your thoughts! It’s my responsibility to take your thoughts (with what I know) and apply them to what others know for validity. It’s not your responsibility to validate or invalidate my thoughts based on your findings. One invites debate the latter invites argument.

The reason I expressed surprise is because I have followed the (strictly science) COVID19 subreddit for the better part of a year, and the only content I’ve seen related to expected future mutations was [this recent piece titled “Has SARS-CoV-2 Reached Peak Fitness”](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01421-7).

The theory that the virus would evolve to become less deadly seemed reasonable from the start, yes I agree it can seem intuitive, but yet we have variants now that are clearly not exhibiting that behavior. While it seems intuitive that the virus would become milder over time, what seems intuitive in science is often wrong. So unless you have, or can provide a source, showing that “every coronavirus ever” started off as a much more severe virus, capable of killing large numbers of people and causing long term complications in double digit percentage of the infected, I think it’s a bit hard to back up your position.

It does.

I'm setting odds of infection to exposure to 1 for an unvaccinated person, for simplicity.

In reality, a lot depends on route and dose of exposure.

We're missing 100+ years of medical research into the female body because doctors assumed that men and women were the same and therefore it was a [waste of time /resources to include women](https://theconversation.com/gender-bias-in-medicine-and-medical-research-is-still-putting-womens-health-at-risk-156495) in research. This is also why women are way more likely to be [misdiagnosed when having a heart attack](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/10/191015115352.htm), women are underdiagnosed with conditions like [ADHD](https://www.additudemag.com/inaccurate-gender-stereotypes-hindering-treatment/) and [ASD](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/14/thousands-of-autistic-girls-and-women-going-undiagnosed-due-to-gender-bias), and why we know [so little about pregnancy/birth](https://reproductive-health-journal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12978-017-0419-x). 

It's easier to sit back and say ""Oh men are dumb"" or ""Oh men smoke more"" than to admit that medicine has been incredibly misogynistic and is only now beginning to change. Still don't believe me?

AstraZeneca claimed 92% against ""hospitalization"" with Delta, it was 100% before this variant. That means its efficacy for ""symptomatic infection"", which was 60-80% before, would probably be \~50% against delta. I am pretty sure sinovac/sinopharm are in the same boat, if not worse.

They were accused by experts in the US of massaging the data to give a more favourable result.*  
*The data safety monitoring board issued a statement accusing them of putting out “potentially misleading” figures.It was unprecedented. Data safety monitoring boards don’t normally go public. But they had, with no warning.*  
*Then the National Institutes of Health, headed by Dr Anthony Fauci, weighed in. “We urge the company to work with the DSMB \[Data and Safety Monitoring Board\] to review the efficacy data and ensure the most accurate, up-to-date efficacy data be made public as quickly as possible,” it said in a statement.*  
*Fauci appeared on Good Morning America, describing the data issue as “an unforced error … this kind of thing does nothing but really cast some doubt”.*  
*Oxford and AstraZeneca’s scientists were astounded by the onslaught. They worked day and night to update the figures. Adding the very latest data pushed the overall efficacy down from 79% to 76%, which was barely a drop, and actually pushed up efficacy in the older age group from 80% to 85%.AstraZeneca’s vaccine is still not licensed in the US.*

If maintaining housing is required to contain the virus, then the government should step in and pay for it. If it isn't then why expect private individuals and companies to carry the burden of unpaid rent for others?

Rental assistance programs have been useful and many have been able to get it, but there's a couple of issues. First there's a real lack of oversight on who's getting the funds. People applying for it are getting help whether they really deserve it or not. Maybe they ran the numbers and figured spending the time to vet people would have cost more than just handing out the money. Who knows? 

The other issue is that they're putting all the initiative in the group that has the least interest in getting help right now: the tenant. The tenant doesn't care if the landlord goes unpaid. They have until the end of February **2022** to pay any rent they owe since March 2020. That's a whole **2 years** to pay rent.

They're happy to sit on their ass because they don't have to pay anything for another **7 months** on rent that's **already due 1 1/2** years ago!

The least they could do is have the rent relief be landlord initiated. They at least have a power incentive to get the ball rolling.

Yep.  Phase III trials for Pfizer and Moderna were 94-95% effective.  As someone trained in Clinical Research I don't give two shits about later data that hasn't had time to be fully analyzed and is based on smaller samples so far- Phase 3 trials are what the FDA relies on for issuing final approval for a reason...

So, if 2000 people are exposed to Covid-19, 100 will still get infected.  Some tiny % of these will still die- mostly from the 65+ age group, especially the otherwise immunocompromised.

&gt; But the idea with widespread vaccination is to halt outbreaks, so that seniors can go out &amp; about with their lives without worrying that they're rolling the dice every time they hit up the Landmark or see a Broadway revival show.

This.

It's also to reduce the incidence of Covid to such a low level that very few people get it, and new mutations are extraordinarily rare.

Also why we have to vaccinate all of India and SE Asia: unless we want new Covid variants to keep coming out until we have one our current vaccines are completely ineffective against (Delta+ variant is already more than 2x as good at getting past the vaccine as other Covid strains: preliminary data from abroad indicates the vaccines are probably a bit less than 90% effective against Delta+...)",,,1624677367,{},h32j0hd,False,t3_o7sxpf,False,False,t1_h30ttv6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o7sxpf/cdc_says_roughly_4100_people_have_been/h32j0hd/,1624960636,15,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

For each vaccine, the fact sheets for healthcare providers have been revised to include a warning that reports of adverse events suggest increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly after the second dose and with onset of symptoms within a few days after vaccination, the FDA said.

  
As of June 11, more than 1,200 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis have been reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), out of about 300 million mRNA vaccine doses administered.

  
The cases appear to be notably higher in males and in the week after the second vaccine dose. The CDC identified 309 hospitalizations from heart inflammation in persons under the age of 30, of which 295 have been discharged.

  
Health regulators in several countries have been investigating cases of myocarditis and pericarditis, more frequently found in young men, after a shot of Pfizer or Moderna, vaccines that are based on the mRNA technology.

  
The latest update from FDA follows an extensive review of information and the discussion by CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting on Wednesday.

  
Pfizer and Moderna did not immediately respond to requests for comment after business hours.

The city state of Singapore has stated Covid will be treated like other endemic diseases such as flu.

  
There will be no goals of zero transmission. Quarantine will be dumped for travellers and close contacts of cases will not have to isolate. It also plans to no longer announce daily case numbers.

  
But people may need to take tests to head to the shops or go to work.

  
""The bad news is that Covid-19 may never go away. The good news is that it is possible to live normally with it in our midst,"" wrote Singapore's Trade Minister Gan Kim Yong, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong and Health Minister Ong Ye Kung in an editorial in the Straits Times this week.

  
""It means that the virus will continue to mutate, and thereby survive in our community.""

  
Like most countries, Singapore had an initial peak of cases last year, topping out at 600 a day in mid-April. Following a smaller wave in August, Covid-19 hasn't flared up since.

  
However, the nation of 5.7 million, slightly larger than Sydney, has had a steady undercurrent of 20 to 30 cases every day. The nation has recorded 35 deaths in total.

What evidence is there of that?  I've heard about a lot of vaccine hesitancy in Japan, which isn't a zero-covid country.  Other than that you've got Taiwan which couldn't get vaccines for political reasons, Vietnam which hasn't been able to afford them and Australia and NZ which have purchased them but have not yet had the doses delivered.  None of us have even had the chance for vaccine hesitancy to be an issue.  

The polling in NZ shows 90% of the population is keen to be vaccinated, much higher than the US.  The govt is under huge pressure to deliver vaccines and the opposition makes it a regular attack point.  

&gt;Vaccinated tourists makes sense but the lack of recognition that COVID is going to be endemic is very strange to me.

There's no lack of recognition.  The head of the Ministry of Health has said repeatedly that Covid will be endemic in NZ, and we will abandon our elimination strategy once the population is vaccinated.  However that doesn't mean doing nothing to control it at all.  The plan will move from elimination to suppression, keeping its numbers as low as possible.

Western Australia has had among the most normal experience with minimal disruption since this all started. The central state/territory (South Australia and the Northern Territory) also did very well (NT has never had a confirmed case of community transmission ever to date).

Even during the initial wave, the East Coast states did have a couple of months of lockdown or thereabouts around late March to around June from what I remember.

Victoria did get hit badly with a second wave and that was the most severe one anywhere in the country - 112 days which ended around October last year, I think. I believe it started with a quarantine breach that didn't get detected in time. It's also where around I think 750 or so of our 912 deaths came from.

I think that lockdown was also a function of how our states can lock each other out. Victoria knew they had to eradicate it totally or a lot of the other states would not let them back in. So they did it for as long as they had to as they probably didn't have a choice despite all the pressure about that.

I can't speak for Victorians and how that second lockdown was like but overall as a nation, we've been very fortunate compared to much of the rest of the world (I did get stuck in the Northern Beaches lockdown for my first vacation since January 2020 - I could have gotten out of it legally but the virus doesn't care about technicalities so I chose to stay put for 10 days).

As for where I would have gotten out to back then - well, I also live in the Eastern Suburbs so certainly do have some luck there.

Not being able to get out readily, though - that's understandably a big issue for a lot of people.

(Weirdly, my life was one of the probably few that got a bit better because of the changes from the first lockdown - had to move right near work so I could walk there instead of a 75-90 minute commute for starters.)",,,1624715653,{},h33u7st,False,t3_o83jkz,False,True,t1_h33sd6z,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o83jkz/greater_sydney_placed_into_lockdown_as_state/h33u7st/,1624987407,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;**No corona-related deaths reported for the first time since September**  
&gt;  
&gt;*The RIVM has not received a single report about a deceased corona patient in the past 24 hours. This was revealed on Saturday in the institute's latest figures.*  
&gt;  
&gt;On September 7, 2020, the RIVM last reported zero deaths due to COVID-19. Already in mid-April, zero corona-related deaths among Dutch nursing home residents were reported for the first time since September last year.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact that the RIVM is not registering any deaths does not mean with certainty that no people have actually died from the effects of the coronavirus in the past 24 hours. It is possible that there is a delay in reporting the figures and that they will be adjusted retroactively at a later date.  
&gt;  
&gt;On March 6, 2020, someone in the Netherlands succumbed to COVID-19 for the first time. It was an 86-year-old man from Hoeksche Waard. According to the RIVM, more than 17,000 people in the Netherlands have died from the effects of the coronavirus since then. 89 percent of all fatal Dutch victims were seventy years of age or older.  
&gt;  
&gt;Since the start of the pandemic, 1,680,228 people have tested positive in the Netherlands. That amounts to almost 10 percent of the total population. It is possible that the actual number is much higher, because initially not everyone could be tested.  
&gt;  
&gt;The numbers of infections, hospitalizations and deaths increased again after the summer last year, after which new peaks were measured in December and January. No new spikes are expected now, because this time the decreases are due to vaccination.

Pfizer and the like uses a brand new method of vaccination with mRNA. This new vaccine gets the cells in your body with the mRNA to grow protein spikes, like on the Covid—19 spikes. Then it trains the immune system to attack cells that have these protein spikes.  That’s why you take two shots. It’s literally training the body. This has never been done before. That’s why it’s “bleedy” edge.

While it claims that anyone can edit it, the reality is that articles on controversial topics get taken over by small numbers of obsessive editors who use them to push a certain viewpoint.

Thirty people related to the hospital have tested positive for COVID-19 as of Friday.

The suspension of services starting Saturday will last for 14 days and will allow the hospital to run at reduced capacity, it said.

The infected were three nurses, nine caregivers, as well as 12 patients and six of their family members, according to the hospital.

Taoyuan Mayor Cheng Wen-tsan (鄭文燦) said the decision was made after discussions among the city government, the hospital, the Medical Affairs Bureau under the Ministry of National Defense, and the Hospital and Social Welfare Organizations Administration Commission under the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

A total of 15 COVID-19 patients currently under hospitalization will be evacuated to other hospitals as well, Cheng said.

The hospital has tested 1,400 mostly medical staff as well as some patients with the PCR test, with those showing positive results required to seek medical treatments as regular patients do.

Aside from this, the hospital has designated hotspots in its facility where there is a higher chance the virus may have been transmitted and medical staff working in those areas all have to go into quarantine centers, regardless of their test results.

Medical staff outside of those hotspots can also choose to stay in hotels instead of going home, if they want to reduce the chances of spreading the virus to their family and community, if they are infected.

The hospital had previously announced its first suspension of major services from June 20-22 following a cluster involving four patients and five caregivers.

As the cluster grew, that suspension was extended to June 24, and the hospital restarted operation on June 25.

He went to the hospital, was listed as a ""severe reaction to COVID vaccine"" whatever that means.  Basically he had a really high heart rate and blood pressure was whack.  He only stayed one day.

I also reached out to the other person I know, a colleague.  He says he went to the hospital preemptively.  He had severe pain throughout his body and almost physically couldn't move, with sweats, fever, the whole deal so it was actually his wife that ""took him"" but they just said it was a bad reaction and to wait it out at home.

This is absolutely *not* a guarantee.  The vaccines target the spike protein and there is a limit to how much the spike protein can change and still latch on to our cells.

Obviously we should be concerned about it.  I wish everyone who ie eligible would get vaccinated.  But given that we know that won't happen, we need to be clear-eyed about the future.

Possibility 1: The vaccines might continue to work fine, and covid will continue to kill the unvaccinated.

Possibility 2: The vaccines might lose some efficacy (it is very unlikely that they will suddenly stop working completely), and then we will need boosters, which Pfizer says it can make happen in &lt;100 days and which we have proven we can distribute rapidly, at least in the US.

&gt;  
&gt;*Trade experts warn that restrictions on vaccine exports risk squeezing production just when it is needed most*  
&gt;  
&gt;International tensions over access to Covid-19 vaccines have intensified as supply hiccups disrupt mass rollouts of shots. But trade experts warn that restrictions on vaccine exports risk making a bad situation worse.  
&gt;  
&gt;That’s because the world’s major vaccine producers rely on each other for the essential ingredients to manufacture vaccines through a web of cross-border supply chains in complex chemicals, fatty acids and glass vials. If governments restrict vaccine exports, they risk retaliation from other members of this exclusive club of vaccine makers, who could withhold vital supplies, squeezing production just when it is needed most.  
&gt;  
&gt;*\[GRAPH - Sources of ingredients and vaccines\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;These supply chains stretch across the world, drawing in producers of basic chemicals that provide critical ingredients as well as the pharmaceutical powerhouses that make the vaccines.  
&gt;  
&gt;*\[GRAPH - Sources of ingredients and vaccines\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;The  U.S. , the  European Union  and  China  are among a handful of territories that produce vaccine ingredients and final vaccines for the entire world.  
&gt;  
&gt;*\[GRAPH - Sources of ingredients and vaccines\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;More than half of global vaccines and of key vaccine ingredients come from the  U.S.  and  EU.  
&gt;  
&gt;*\[GRAPH - The ""Vaccine Club""\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;These 12 countries and the EU make up the “Vaccine Club”—producers that make both the key ingredients as well as final vaccines.  
&gt;  
&gt;*\[GRAPH - The ""Vaccine Club""\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;Five club members make the lion’s share of the world’s supply of Covid-19 vaccines.  
&gt;  
&gt;Data compiled by Airfinity Ltd., a science and healthcare data company, shows that five club members accounted for 95% of all Covid-19 doses produced in the world through March. Smaller players including Argentina and Brazil are expected to start contributing shots later this year.  
&gt;  
&gt;The members of the vaccine club, though, source on average 88.3% of the imported ingredients used in vaccine production from other club members, according to economists led by Simon Evenett, professor of international trade and economic development at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland, who have mapped trade flows between the world’s major vaccine producers.  
&gt;  
&gt;Limiting vaccine exports to another major producer would therefore risk retaliatory action that could undermine production, threatening the mass vaccination drives that are the key to ending the pandemic, Prof. Evenett said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Everyone has a gun to each other’s heads,” he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;*\[GRAPH - Ingredient imports by vaccine club members\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;The members of the vaccine club source ingredients for their vaccines primarily from other club members.  
&gt;  
&gt;*\[GRAPH - Ingredient imports by vaccine club members\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;The  U.K. , for instance, gets 98.7% of its imported vaccine ingredients from fellow club members. The majority of those ingredients are from the  EU  and  U.S.  
&gt;  
&gt;*\[GRAPH - Ingredient imports by vaccine club members\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;Less reliant on other club members are countries such as  India  and  China , which get a smaller—though still significant—percentage of their ingredient imports from other big producers.  
&gt;  
&gt;So far, sporadic curbs on exports of vaccines by countries including India and EU member states haven’t yet led to an all-out conflict. But it is an uneasy peace, Prof. Evenett and colleagues wrote in a March report for the World Bank.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Our analysis of the incentives created by the Vaccine Club imply that the status quo is unstable, susceptible to policy overreaction to cross-border shipment delays. If Covid-19 vaccines are equitably distributed worldwide without a significant outbreak of vaccine nationalism, it will be by luck not design,” the report said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The EU and the U.K. have sparred over access to doses of the shot developed by AstraZeneca PLC and the University of Oxford, with Italy impounding some 250,000 doses destined for Australia.  
&gt;  
&gt;More significant for global vaccine supply was the decision in March by India to temporarily halt exports to expand its own vaccination campaign amid a deadly wave of new infections. The country’s vaccine exports have slumped, official data shows, hurting in particular supplies destined for poorer parts of the world that are relying on Indian-made vaccines.  
&gt;  
&gt;*\[GRAPH - India's Covid-19 vaccine exports\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;Modeling by Airfinity suggests the disruption could set back vaccination drives in Africa and parts of Asia by months. Epidemiologists and public-health experts warn that gaps in vaccination coverage world-wide will give the virus a chance to survive and mutate, potentially leading to future outbreaks.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Serum Institute of India, which manufactures the AstraZeneca vaccine for large parts of the world, has said it hopes to be exporting again by June.  
&gt;  
&gt;India, though, isn’t alone in limiting vaccine exports. The U.S. and the U.K. have reserved all or nearly all of their homemade doses for domestic use, according to data compiled by Airfinity, though the U.S. this week said it would share 60 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine with India and other developing countries combating surging infections.  
&gt;  
&gt;*\[GRAPH - Covid-19 vaccine dose production and exports\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;Trade experts say the best way to ease tensions would be to increase vaccine production. In an open letter to President Biden, a group of former heads of government including former U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged the U.S. and others to agree to temporarily suspend Covid-19 vaccine patents and to press drugmakers to share technology and know-how in an effort to turbocharge global manufacturing of the shots.  
&gt;  
&gt;Global vaccine production is already accelerating. Analysis by Airfinity suggests U.S. vaccine makers will have produced sufficient doses to inoculate the whole U.S. adult population by June, resulting in a surplus of around 500 million doses by September if production goals are met.  
&gt;  
&gt;Data compiled by Unicef shows production capacity for approved vaccines is expected to increase by 7.9 billion doses in the second half of the year.

Anyone who exhibits any type of concern, along with 90% of all epidemiologists, is considered an alarmist and/or doomsayer. It's human nature to want normality and ignore any facts that lead to a negative outcome.  The WHO wants everyone, those both vaccinated and unvaccinated, to practice social distancing measures due to the rise of the delta variant. It also takes seconds of exposure to cause infection, no longer the 15 minute threshold. When the U.S. follows the rest of the world into lockdown, it won't be so easy this time.

Also, there are reports that the Delta variant can evade immunity gained by previous infection. A possible 32% increase immunity invasion from previous infection.

Highlighting this statement from the above report: 

""“Delta variant has the maximum transmissibility yet seen, and reduces neutralisation protection from previous infections and vaccines...""

So you are correct, all the signs are there, and yet so many people have blinders on because they want it to be over, even when you present them with studies. The U.S. is weeks behind the U.K. and since the U.S. is far less vaccinated, currently at a little over 45%, we are basically defenseless. So we can party all we want to, but we are on a trajectory toward winter 2020, and this time it will be worse due to the increased transmissibility, infection, and death rate. Since younger ages are now more impacted by this variant, I cannot believe schools will remain open. 6 feet of distancing indoors is not even logical. This variant approaches measles rate of transmission.

Keep expressing your concerns, and ignore those who say you are fear mongering.

Agreed, I'm extremely thankful how quickly we were able to get vaccines here in the USA.  That said, I still wear a mask in crowded places.  Most are focused on hospitalization and death while ignoring the fact there's ~1 in 10 chance of breakthrough cases that may be asymptomatic or mild — and some research is showing that 1 in 5 of those who are asymptomatic will be long-haulers. 

One thing is for sure, our CDC says they aren't tracking mild cases and I don't think that's a very good idea.

If anyone refutes these observations, please enlighten me.

“Asymptomatic individuals may be less often intensely monitored due to an inherent notion of low risk for severe acute disease; however, this is problematic as asymptomatic individuals account for 32% of the long-haulers observed in this study,” Yong Huang, a PhD student at the Sue &amp; Bill Gross School of Nursing at the University of California Irvine, and colleagues wrote.

Many ‘Long Covid’ Patients Had No Symptoms From Their Initial Infection

An analysis of electronic medical records in California found that 32 percent started with asymptomatic infections but reported troubling aftereffects weeks and months later.

Depending on the percentage calcium hypochlorite, and the amount of free chlorine gas in the same bottle - just the vapors can scar your lung tissue permanently and diminish your ability to process normal oxygen inward and carbon dioxide outward.

I have to presume that you mean to inhale bleach vapors, and not aspirate the bleach itself.

Aspiration of the bleach itself may cause chemical pneumonia, which must be treated - and may lead to (depending on the concentration of chemicals) multiple organ failures and death.

Where symptoms follow that include:

- Rapid or shallow breaths
- Rapid pulse
- Oral, nasal, or skin burns
- Pale or cyanotic skin and lips
- Heavy sweating
- Altered thinking or reasoning skills
- Unconsciousness
- Swelling of eyes or tongue
- Hoarse or muffled voice
- Chemical odors on other areas of the body
- Frothy spit from a cough
- Fever

[],,Molire,,,[],,,,text,t2_174cr0,False,True,[],"&gt;_New Delhi_ — Doctors and epidemiologists are closely monitoring the rise of yet another [coronavirus](https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/coronavirus/) variant that has been detected in almost a dozen countries, including the U.S. Concern that the so-called Delta Plus variant — a mutation of the [now-widespread Delta strain](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-delta-varient-dominant-strain-likely/) first detected in India — could be more infectious and cause more significant health problems than other variants prompted Indian officials this week to label it a ""variant of concern.""  
      
&gt;But while the variant's fast spread, and India's painful experience with the original Delta strain, have raised alarm in the vast nation, epidemiologists there and abroad say much more data is needed before broader cautions are issued around the world about Delta Plus.  
       
&gt;Delta Plus cases are mounting fast in India, but the strain has also been detected in the U.S., U.K., China, Japan, Russia, Portugal, Switzerland, and Poland.  
           
&gt;On Tuesday, India labelled Delta Plus (or B.1.617.2.1) an official Variant of Concern and asked three states — Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh — to increase vigilance and screening for the strain. More than 40 cases of Delta Plus have been found so far in those states. At least one of them, in an unvaccinated patient, was fatal.   
          
&gt;A consortium of Indian labs involved in genome sequencing to identify and track the spread of various coronavirus variants told the government that Delta Plus appears to have three worrying characteristics: Increased transmissibility; more capacity to attack lung cells; and a potential reduction in monoclonal antibody response — or, put simply, possible resistance to vaccines and immunity gained through previous infection.  
        
&gt;Experts caution, however, that with such low numbers far more data and research are needed to determine whether the new variant is really more daunting than the Delta strain. That variant is already [causing significant concern in the U.S.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/delta-variant-covid-19-contaigous-next-wave/) and elsewhere as it does appear to spread far more easily than previous strains.  
      
&gt;""We don't have much reason to believe this [Delta Plus] is any more dangerous than the original Delta,"" Dr Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, told CBS News' partner network BBC News. ""I would keep calm. I don't think India or anyone else in the world has released or accumulated enough data to distinguish the risk from the so-called Delta Plus as being more dangerous or concerning than the original Delta variant.""   
         
&gt;While the Indian government's decision to label Delta Plus a variant of concern may seem premature to many experts, it likely stems from the fact that the original Delta variant is believed to have fueled the second wave of COVID-19 infections in India in April-May. That surge saw up to 400,000 people infected in the country, and for a while it claimed about 4,000 lives per day.  
    
&gt;While the second wave has waned and much of India has returned to a degree of normalcy, with lockdowns lifted and large crowds back in the streets and markets, experts are already warning about a possible third wave within weeks.  
       
&gt;The country is still reporting more than 50,000 cases and 1,000 deaths daily as it comes down from the second wave, and the real figures could be much higher given the relatively low rate of testing and confirmation of COVID-linked deaths.  
    
&gt;The fear is that the spread of Delta Plus, or any other new variants, could make things worse, and fast. The government's own COVID-19 experts have insisted that there's no need to panic, but as Kamil told BBC News, the government ""would rather over-react now than seem flat-footed later, as was the case with the Delta variant.""

More than 177 million people have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine in the United States, and CDC continues to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for any health problems that happen after vaccination.

Since April 2021, there have been more than a thousand reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of cases of inflammation of the heart—called myocarditis and pericarditis—happening after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (i.e., Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna) in the United States.

These reports are rare, given the hundreds of millions of vaccine doses administered, and have been reported after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, particularly in adolescents and young adults. View the latest information.

CDC and its partners are actively monitoring these reports, by reviewing data and medical records, to learn more about what happened and to understand any relationship to COVID-19 vaccination.

Most patients who received care responded well to treatment and rest and quickly felt better.

Confirmed cases have occurred:

Mostly in male adolescents and young adults age 16 years or older

More often after getting the second dose than after the first dose of one of these two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines

Typically within several days after COVID-19 vaccination

Patients can usually return to their normal daily activities after their symptoms improve. They should speak with their doctor about return to exercise or sports.

CDC continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination for everyone 12 years of age and older, given the risk of COVID-19 illness and related, possibly severe complications.

Getting vaccinated is the best way to help protect yourself and your family from COVID-19.

More information will be shared as it becomes available.

Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis is inflammation of the outer lining of the heart. In both cases, the body’s immune system causes inflammation in response to an infection or some other trigger. Learn more about myocarditis and pericarditisexternal icon.

Should I Still Get Myself or My Child Vaccinated?

Yes. CDC continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination for everyone 12 years of age and older, given the risk of COVID-19 illness and related, possibly severe complications, such as long-term health problems, hospitalization, and even death. If you or your child has already gotten the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, it’s important to get the second dose unless a vaccination provider or your doctor tells you not to get it.

The known and potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the known and potential risks, including the possible risk of myocarditis or pericarditis. Also, most patients with myocarditis and pericarditis who received care responded well to treatment and rest and quickly felt better.

If you have concerns about COVID-19 vaccination, talk with your or your child’s doctor, nurse, or clinic.

What Myocarditis/Pericarditis Symptoms Should I Be on the Lookout for after mRNA COVID-19 Vaccination?

Be on the lookout for any of the following symptoms:

Chest pain

Shortness of breath

Feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart

Seek medical care if you think you or your child have any of these symptoms within a week after COVID-19 vaccination.If you have any health problems after vaccination, report them to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Systemexternal icon (VAERS).",,,1624660559,{},h31ph9l,False,t3_o7x8hf,False,False,t3_o7x8hf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o7x8hf/myocarditis_and_pericarditis_following_mrna/h31ph9l/,1624945706,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Also, minors don't control their medical decisions, so there are a lot of kids who might want to be vaccinated whose medical care is being dictated by anti-vaxxers and covid denialists, and that's unfortunate to say the least.

It's easy to say that rates of infection among children are low, but considering the increased prevalence and virulence of the Delta variant and the abysmal vaccination rates in some areas (one of my [fully vaccinated] relatives lives in a backwater burg with a 30% vaccination rate that isn't moving upward anymore), it's hard to conclusively say that the risk is acceptable. 

The playing field is changing so rapidly. 

Sometimes I get sick of masks, too. I have explained to my (fully vaccinated) family that although we are unlikely to present a significant danger to others since even if we did get it, we would hopefully not have a high enough viral load to spread it, there's really no point in testing that theory in real life, since masks aren't *that* onerous.

Personally, I've been monitoring rates of new cases in my area, and they're just as high as they were last summer, so we're just going to wait until the circulating pool of Rona in our community is a little lower to stop wearing masks.

If the WHO and CDC say be concerned, you don't need wait for the exact peer review or chart you want to see before wearing a mask or practicing social distancing.  If many scientists agree on something, whether it's cited in the Guardian, Forbes, WSJ, or NEJM, it is more than just your life if you choose to ignore it. Your choices do have an impact on others. I wouldn't wait until the very last minute to take the appropriate action.

Also, whether I said ""unlikely"" or ""impossible""...and? Using argument of fallacy to prove people wrong is rather ignorant. I recommend when you make an argument, you consider the issue at large.

It’s been accepted for a while now that covid would become endemic like the cold or flu, and vaccines help to make that a hopeful reality by reducing viral load, hospitalizations, and death. None of that changes with the variants, as a virus mutating is normal and expected…because even when viruses mutate, they still maintain a lot of the makeup of their original copy. This is true for all variants circulating, including the Delta. It may be more contagious as a whole, but it’s still extremely difficult to break through vaccine barriers in an impactful way, and that’s normal. 

The media is likely having a slow week and is therefore hyping this up more than they need to. “This just in: a virus is behaving in a way that all other viruses known to man do! Alert the masses!” 
I know the news cycle can feel insane at times, but it was only 3-4 months ago that this same exact hype was happening over the Brazil variant.

**Youth, Delta variant behind UK COVID surge**

**Young people are behind the surge, with a 5-fold higher rate of COVID-19 test positivity among children 5 to 12 years (0.35% prevalence) and adults 18 to 24 (0.36% prevalence)** than in those 65 or older. People younger than 50 were 2.5 times more likely to be infected than older people (prevalence, 0.20% vs 0.08%), although the researchers noted that infections seem to be growing at a comparable rate in both age-groups.

Beyond these restrictions being unprecedented, people now know pretty much that there is no real end date to them. If it had had this many immune people in March 2020, the UK probably wouldn't even have had the restrictions it currently does, but the standard is now that every time a new variant arises that raises the herd immunity threshold, they just have to wait a bit longer. 

I'm not saying that people who want restrictions to stop COVID are wrong. But it's clear by now that being patient and waiting and getting vaccinated are not going to stop the restrictions, because the virus will always be mutating somewhere in the world, and there might be a true vaccine escape variant earlier than we think.

So the protesters may be wrong to oppose restrictions, but they're right to believe, at this point, that being patient and following the rules won't end restrictions; the only way to not have them is not to have them.",,,1624728243,{},h34if73,False,t3_o8er4u,False,False,t3_o8er4u,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o8er4u/thousands_attend_antilockdown_protest_with_more/h34if73/,1625001220,69,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;The Finnish health institute’s director, Mika Salminen, told public broadcaster YLE that more than 120 virus cases have so far been detected from passengers returning from St. Petersburg, mostly soccer fans, and the number is likely increase.

&gt;Though the Finnish Border Guard was prepared for heavy return traffic from St. Petersburg, the key Vaalimaa border station got badly jammed Tuesday with lines of dozens of buses carrying soccer fans and hundreds of cars waiting for the required coronavirus test after border formalities.

&gt;As the queue got longer and the border station was to be closed, Finnish authorities decided to let passengers into the country without testing, on the condition they would take one at their respective home region after arrival.

&gt;Finnish health officials said earlier this week that they traced some of the infections to a German beer hall-style restaurant in St. Petersburg.

&gt;There are two main crossing points between the countries in eastern Finland, making it a trip of between 180-220 kilometers (112-135 miles) from the border to St. Petersburg.

I cannot and will not avoid public space for years to come.  It's literally part of life.  I need to be able to get on an airplane, go shopping, grab food, etc.

Being ""safe"" is a sliding scale and everyone does completely different risk assessment.  It's like arguing your favorite color.  I have no issues with what you or anyone else does as long as they don't try to push their version of ""the truth"" on everyone else.  Obviously it's a bit of a paradox because COVID impacts all of us as a society, so some consensus and rules are required.  Hence the pissing matches over risk assessment will continue indefinitely and we'll be arguing over it here on Reddit for a long time to come.",,,1624719681,{},h341k0o,False,t3_o89dy8,False,False,t1_h33y5a8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o89dy8/some_fully_vaccinated_people_may_still_get_sick/h341k0o/,1624991566,51,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; What's the big deal with wearing a fucking mask and trying to stay distant from people you're not too familiar with?

I don't think anybody should criticize you for these things.

However, concerts are a something many people rely on (directly or indirectly) for income, so it is a big deal to them.  Many people also simply enjoy these things.  When fully vaccinated, people can evaluate their personal risk, and it will (in general) be very, very low.

Once Fall comes around, in particular, nearly every American over the age of 6 months will have had access to the vaccine.  There are some for whom the vaccine might be less effective.  They should continue to wear N95s.

It was 5 am and I was a bit tired when I wrote that, so funny how you focus on the typo

&gt; J&amp;J works more like a traditional vaccine that it still uses an underpowered virus: “an adenovirus vector, which is a genetically engineered virus.”

J&amp;J and other vector virus vaccines do not work ""like a traditional vaccine"". Just like mRNA vaccines, they deliver instructions to your cell which then in turn produce the covid spike protein. Just like mRNA vaccines, they use your own cells as factories.

The difference between mRNA and viral vector vaccines is primarily how these instructions are delivered. mRNA vaccines cover the instructions in lipids, whereas viral vectors use another, harmless virus (the vector virus) to basically infect your cells and deliver the instructions.

This is radically different to traditional inactivated virus vaccines that use the actual virus and injects it (after ""killing"" it to make it harmless).

Also note that there have only been two approved viral vector vaccines prior to covid, and both were new ebola vaccines.

Masks are really important for this pandemic because they help prevent you from infecting others if you're sick, so even if you walk around when you're pre-symptomatic, your odds in infecting others drastically go down.

However, there have been numerous studies done that show that wearing a mask doesn't actually prevent *you* from getting sick that much.  Just as a personal example, I'm planning on wearing a mask in the future when I go out in public with a cold or something like that so I decrease the odds in infecting others.  However, just wearing one to prevent yourself from getting sick when nobody else is wearing a mask only helps marginally.

Delta is moderately resistant to vaccines, particularly in people who have received just a single dose. **A Public Health England study published on 22 May found that a single dose of either AstraZeneca's or Pfizer's vaccine reduced a person’s risk of developing COVID-19 symptoms caused by the Delta variant by 33%,** compared to 50% for the Alpha variant. **A second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine boosted protection against Delta to 60% (compared to 66% against Alpha), while two doses of Pfizer’s jab were 88% effective (compared to 93% against Alpha).**  


&amp;#x200B;

&gt;covid will continue to kill the unvaccinated.

if you're fully vaccinated,  infected with delta, and sick enough to go to the hospital, there's a **36% chance** you don't go home..

**Of 806 people infected with the Delta variant** who ended up hospital in England between 1 February and 14 June 2021:  
527 (65%) people were unvaccinated  
135 (17%) were more than 21 days after their first dose of vaccine  
**84 (10%) were more than 14 days after their second dose**  


As of 14 June, there have been **73 deaths in England of people who were confirmed as having the Delta variant** and who died within 28 days of a positive test, and of these:  
34 (47%) were unvaccinated  
10 (14%) were more than 21 days after their first dose of vaccine  
**26 (36%) were more than 14 days after their second dose**

  


&gt;But given that we know that won't happen, we need to be clear-eyed about the future.

For one thing, it’s half a channel — it only pierces the cell membrane halfway. It also has an unusual fold not seen in other ion channels.  
While no one knows why the virus carries a gene to make an ion channel — and a strange one, at that — researchers have found that by knocking out the ORF3a gene in SARS-CoV-2 and a related ORF3a gene in the original SARS virus, SARS-CoV-1, the severity of the disease is reduced, at least in animal models. This, the researchers say, makes it a good target for drugs to reduce the severity of human coronavirus infections. A high-resolution cryoEM structure published this week by the UC Berkeley team provides key information needed to find such drugs.

Right now, in the US, we are down to numbers that reflect a very bad flu season (not taking into account the spanish flu). We have never had a mask mandate for the flu outside of the spanish flu.

I'm beginning to think that just like not wearing masks when 3k people a day were dying is the badge of the political right, we now have the badge of the political left of 'masks forever'.

Both sides need to come up with their standards of what is acceptable. I think a death rate of 400 americans a day where 95% of them are unvaccinated is completely acceptable.

Subtract the voluntary unvaxxed deaths and you have a death rate that would make for what we would call a very mild flu season.

For those who cannot vaccinate for other reasons, a well made N95 mask along with a %60+ vaccinated public will leave them very well protected.

I'm not saying you're wrong, but the [official numbers](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths) say 16 people died on Monday in the whole UK from COVID, let me know if I'm missing something.

For what it's worth, I *do* wear a mask despite being fully vaccinated, and I have been incredibly diligent about social distancing and mask wearing for the past 18 months. 

My point is that the messaging of saying vaccinated people should still social distance and wear a mask is more harmful than the statistical odds of a fully vaccinated person dying from COVID. If people who are hesitant to get vaccinated are seeing that fully vaccinated people have to do the exact same thing, what's the incentive? 

The entire point of the vaccine is to get back to normal. If being fully vaccinated isn't the line where we go back to normal, where is?

&gt;The British athletes who do not want to get vaccinated against Covid-19 before the Tokyo Olympics are doing so over performance-related fears rather than an anti-vax stance, the Guardian understands.

&gt;The British Olympic Association remains confident that almost all its 370 or so Olympians will have two jabs before they fly to Japan, with only “a small handful” still remaining unconvinced.

&gt;It is believed the remaining holdouts are worried that the possible side effects of the vaccine – which can include tiredness, headaches and chills – might affect a crucial period of their training given the Games are due to begin in just under four weeks. However, the BOA remains hopeful they will change their minds.

&gt;Speaking to the BBC, the BOA chief executive, Andy Anson, said “well over 90%” of British athletes will have two vaccine doses by the Olympics. But he also admitted “there are individuals who didn’t want to be vaccinated”.

&gt;Anson said: “We’re trying to convince them it’s the right thing to do. People have got the right to choose, and we have to respect that. But it’s not necessarily that helpful.”

Yes, SEVERE illness is well near eliminated for vaccinated individuals.  30 people in your hospital is amazing considering what it used to be.

This is from someone wearing masks in Tropical Climates (surgical disposable masks are almost a necessity, cotton cloth feels asphyxiating).

With all due respect, you need to get some perspective. You need to learn to value your fellow humans a little more than what you’re valuing them now. We spend billions fighting diseases that kill less than that. We need each other to thrive and live happier lives.

So wear surgical disposable masks (or reusable cotton ones if the climate allows). Surgical masks only help: they are cheap, comfortable, biodegradable, sustainable and demonstrably help eradicate disease (some flu strains have been eradicated thanks to widespread use of masks indoors for less than one year). We’d save lives from covid and more, it would be a huge net positive.

I think that's the problem.  As Covid gets less pronounced testing will be very sporadic.  This is why I've always focused on deaths.  Even states like Florida have a hard time covering it up when it gets significant.   

Long term complications though is something that is undefined.  I understand that in the same way high fevers and even the flu can have long term damaging effects if severe, but I'm really not sure we are in a position to actually quantify that.

Absolutely not ""fearmongering"". There are not really many publications on this yet that piece together or model what the Delta variant means for the pandemic as a whole because there's virtually no data. But what we do know is that:

- R0 is a lot higher for Delta
- Viral load is higher
- Vaccine effectiveness is across the board reduced for Delta, massively with one dose and significantly less (but still decent, yes - but lower) for 2 dose.

Putting these together, it stands to reason we will have (1) more breakthrough cases in the vaccinated, (2) more transmission chains involving vaccinated individuals, (3) lifting all restrictions will greatly enhance transmission overall. In fact data from the UK indicate that for predominantly Alpha cases, which is less transmissible than Delta, there is only a 40% reduction in household transmission if the positive index case is vaccinated vs unvaccinated. So now that's eroded even more most likely. All children under 12 are unvaccinated by no fault of their own, and the unvaccinated by choice have definitely messed this up for everyone and create much more of a problem for those not by choice. Nothing you can do about it though since you can't really force them. So I think continuing masking is a totally reasonable thing to suggest and there is absolutely no ""science"" that tells you it is or isn't truly necessary.

Roughly 5000 people correspond to this category in Brussels, and 25 000 in Flanders. There are 5 times more people in one of the most at risk category in Flanders than in Brussels. This is a trend that can also be seen on the number of people who died in Belgium, from covid, which is a lot larger in Flanders than in Brussels.

So yeah, maybe the percentage of 85+ people vaccinated in Flanders is higher than in Brussels, but there are still a lot more people at risk in Flanders than in Brussels. And this is what counts at the end of the day.

The other thing that is important is that the potential for the virus to mutate does not depend on the percentage of people who are likely to catch covid, but on the absolute circulation of the virus. 10% of a population of 10 000 people are less lilkely to lead to mutations thant 2% of a population of 100 000 people.

About the readiness of people to get vaccinated, I do agree. That's why I talked about the fact that people in Brussels are less enclined to follow preventive health campaign as a general trend, even for matters that are not related to covid. But this has to also be put in perspective with the fact that Brussels' population is a lot younger than the rest of the country, even though it only partially explains that trend. But yeah, older population tends to see doctors more than younger generation.

One should also note than Wallonia opened its vaccination campaign to young people quite early as well (actually earlier than Brussels and Flanders), and its vaccination rates are not as good as Flanders', even though they're still good globally. This indicates that they finished vaccinating willing elder people quite fast as well.

And yeah, if 50% of elders did not get vaccinated in a region with 5000 elders, it would not be as dramatic as if 30% of elders did not get vaccinated in a region with 50 000 elders. In the first case, that's 2500 potential hospitalisations, in the second case, that's 15 000 potential hospitalisations. At the end of the day, this is what counts. 2500 hospitalisations is a lot more manageable than 15 000, and will most definetly leads to less deaths. The problem with the pandemic is not the percentage of people who died in regards of the population, it's the absolute number of people who died. And now that we have the means to protect those people, each individual who dies of covid and could have been vaccinated, is someone who should not have died.

Using percentage instead of absolute number has been a strategy for downplaying the seriousness of the pandemic, as people where talking about the mortality rate being very low, so we should not be doing anything to stop the pandemic. But those people complitely forgot to put those numbers in perspective (which is the main problem when it comes to people not using statistics right), because even though the mortality rate is low, the contagiousness of the disease is high, and a lot of those death were avoidable.

Here it's the same, and it is not sensible to only talk in terms of percentages, without having some context. Especially as Flanders and Wallonia are vasts regions, that counts several big towns. There is nothing here that says that towns in Flanders/Wallonia have the same vaccination rate distribution than the countryside when looking at the global statistics. Although it's true than in Flanders, the big town have higher vaccination rates of 65+ than Brussels, it is not as much of a big gap. Antwerpen has an 87% vaccination rate (first dose) of 65+, Woluwe saint pierre is 85%, Auderghem and Watermael are 83%, Woluwe saint lamber is 82%. At the same time, Liège has an 81% vaccination rate for 65+, and Charleroi is 78%.

It just seems that the general trends is that people in city are getting less vaccinated than people in the countryside. Even though it seems that in Flanders, those vaccination rate are better amongst the elderly, 61.5% of people over 65 in Belgium live in Flanders. (That's 1.4 M people in Flanders, 687 000 in Wallonia, and 160 000 in Brussels). Actually, if you break it down, unvaccinated 65+ are distributed as follow in Belgium :

* 17,9 %  in Brussels
* 34,7 % in Flanders
* 49,9 % in Wallonia

&gt;Several scientists who signed The Lancet letter denouncing the consideration of anything but natural origins have since said they are more open to lab involvement. One, Bernard Roizman, an emeritus virologist at the University of Chicago with four honorary professorships from Chinese universities, said he was leaning toward believing there was a lab accident.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I’m convinced that what happened is that the virus was brought to a lab, they started to work with it,” he told The Wall Street Journal, “and some sloppy individual brought it out.” He added, “They can’t admit they did something so stupid.”  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Charles Calisher of Colorado State University, another signatory, recently told ABC News that “there is too much coincidence” to ignore the lab-leak theory and he now believes “it is more likely that it came out of that lab.”  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Peter Palese, the virologist who wrote about the 1977 flu pandemic, said that “a lot of disturbing information has surfaced since The Lancet letter I signed” and that he wants an investigation to come up with answers.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Other scientists have also said they have changed their minds. One, James Le Duc, the recently retired director of the Galveston National Laboratory, a major lab that studies the coronavirus and that trained many of the Wuhan biosafety specialists, said in May that it was “important to look closely at the laboratory conditions and explore what was being done where and have a serious investigation.”  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Ian Lipkin, the director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University and a co-author of an influential article in Nature Medicine that argued in favor of a natural origin in March 2020, is also now more skeptical. “People should not be looking at bat viruses in BSL-2 labs,” he told the science reporter Donald G. McNeil Jr. last month. “My view has changed.”

We’ll have more information on whether or not delta infected vaccinated people spread it, and then hopefully policy will reflect that information. 

All that said, I don’t think you’re going to need to personally worry if you’re vaccinated. Though we’ve seen breakthrough infections, it’s not clear if it happens more often than otherwise. Further, every breakthrough infection I’ve heard of results in either nothing more than a positive test or an extremely mild course of disease.

Just because you don't want a thing to be true doesn't mean it isn't.  Your reply reinforces my point that its easier to deny than to prepare or take caution.. That's unfortunate. Myself, epidemiologists, the WHO advise caution. Why is that such a bad thing for you? How is that fear-mongering?  Why not err on the side of caution? I just don't understand the callous disregard for lives, and disrespect for the 600k who have died


Other countries are locking down to prevent spread. Why wouldn't we follow suit? It's only logical. And for these variants, just vaccines won't be enough..

Any relatively stable substance whose molecules can't be separated into constituent parts is technically a chemical. Colloquially it's usually used for artificial substances, but most things in nature are chemicals or made of chemicals.

Basically, even though you can't *smell* a strong chemical (due to an impaired sense of smell, which is a neurological problem not a mechanical one) the vapor is still interacting with the smell receptors of your nose (as well as your respiratory structures). These chemicals can damage smell receptors, sometimes permanently. They can also potentially have more systemic effects, as you're still breathing them in and therefore may be introducing them to your bloodstream.

So basically while strong scents have value for testing and monitoring how impaired your sense of smell is, you shouldn't be exposing yourself to really harsh chemicals directly.... well, ever. Try to find benign yet pungent chemicals (like a scented candle) to test your sense of smell.

[],,francessfractal,,,[],,,,text,t2_n2jza,False,False,[],"I really like point number 2 - getting time off work if you’ve been vaccinated. Even for more typical vaccines, like flu and stuff.

Think about it, as science and technology progress it’s usually employers, not the working class, who reaps the rewards. New tech lets the employees do the same work in less time, but since the employee is paid based on time spent instead of value produced they continue working the same amount for the same pay and the employer gets the economic benefit. Working class does get some secondary benefit where the product that company produces is sold for less (as long as fair market is working properly and companies compete to sell their products by lowering the price, which isn’t always the case). But for the most part, the benefit of that new technology goes to the employer. At best, the employee works the same amount for the same pay, or in worse cases they get fired because the technology made them redundant.

Now look at vaccines. Without them, employees catch the flu and have to call in sick for work. Depending on the employer, they might get paid time off or might not. But either way, the employer loses out on that employees time. If they do PTO, they lose out on that money. If not, it’s still pretty inconvenient to have an unpredictable schedule change like that. On the employee’s end, they partially loses out on that time as well. They’re sick and feeling miserable and can’t really do what they want since they’re staying home to rest.

Now consider what happens with a vaccine. There’s probably some estimate of sick days per year per employee the flu causes without vaccinations. Consider on those days, the employee doesn’t get sick anymore, and the employer doesn’t have to deal with last minute schedule changes or paying the employee for time not worked. The employee has to work and doesn’t get to spend that time watching Netflix. They’re not sick, but that healthy time goes straight back to the employer, who gets x more days of productivity out of each employee. If the employer gives PTO for sick days, there’s no financial difference for the employee. They’ve simply traded being sick for having to work. It’s a little ambiguous which is better. It sucks being sick, but sometimes if the flu is mild and work is mentally draining and stressful, then having some time off work is a welcome break, even if you’re sick. If the employer doesn’t do PTO for sick days, then yes, the employee ends up being better off financially because they no longer lose out on pay for being sick.

Now imagine if they took the estimated average sick days per year per employee caused by the flu, and everyone who got the flu vaccine was entitled to that many days of PTO. Now, instead of the employer yet again reaping the benefits of technological (or in this case medical) advances, **for once** the working class would get most of the benefit. The employer wouldn’t even lose much, since without the vaccine they would have had to deal with sick employees anyway. In countries where they’re actually required to give PTO for sick days they’d lose nothing, and even gain predictability being able to schedule that PTO in advance and not needing to deal with the flu hitting their workforce all at once, as it tends to do. In countries and companies where they don’t do PTO for sick days, then yeah the employer does lose out having to pay for time not worked, but tbh those kinds of policies are kind of fucked up to begin with, imho, and it’s long past time PTO became just a little more normalized.

It’s also not a forgone conclusion that there won’t be new variants that reinfect more often or cause more breakthrough infections.


Think of it like a camp fire that burned all evening, even throwing a whole bucket of water on it doesn’t guarantee the fire is out and won’t restart. That’s why you use a fire pit or a fire ring.   

Reducing initial viral dose also helps reduce infection severity, and being vaccinated helps further also.

A bulletproof vest doesn’t make you immune to bullets. Avoid war zones and dangerous situations. (Stay out of super packed bars and gyms where unvaccinated people gather and do high risk things.) If someone is shooting at you, hide behind stuff. (Wear a mask), or just leave.

-------

&gt; My social anxiety, which had been a low hum in the background became full on agoraphobia. 

Oh boy I feel this sentiment so hard. I didn't know this about myself pre-pandemic. While I don't think I got to the point of being *full* agoraphobic, it was *super* close. There was like a 3-4 month stretch there where I didn't *have* to leave, so I didn't. I wasn't *great*.

It felt like all the work on social anxiety I did the last decade+ came unglued, like peeling wallpaper that I couldn't maintain or fix. If there's ever a silver lining to be found for myself *personally* is that under the right circumstances, that seed is there waiting to grow if I let it.
