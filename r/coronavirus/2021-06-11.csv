This means 18-24 year olds aren't vaccinated (except the vulnerable) in the UK, whereas there will be more people in this age group with jabs in the USA. Many of my early-20s American friends have had their vaccines.

So it's no wonder the UK has exponential growth in a non-vaccinated age group that socialises a lot amongst other people of the same age group. There is no immunity amongst young people.

The question is: Does it matter that young people are catching it? Does it justify lockdowns and restrictions?",,,1623455177,{},h1gniw7,False,t3_nxlolz,False,False,t1_h1gd848,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nxlolz/lockdown_boris_johnson_set_to_delay_june_21_rule/h1gniw7/,1623729757,20,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5cpyh,False,False,,

Also, Texas had a lot of data dumps from backlogged information earlier this week. That is why cases numbers on Tuesday were higher.

However, I do have to be amused at this statement in the article 

&gt; According to data collated by the University of Oxford-based Our World in Data, Canada now ranks first globally in terms of the share of the population with at least one dose of the vaccine, having surpassed previous leader Israel yesterday.

This is actually not true. What the authors did was go to that website, look at the default chart which shows a subset of ""notable"" countries, and saw that Canada is now on top of these. 

However, if you go to the actual website (linked below), click on chart, and sort by the share of population with one dose as of June 10th, you will see that there are still several regions that are still ahead of Canada. Most of these are British overseas territories or the like (St. Helena, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, etc.) which it could be argued ""don't count"". But there are still 4 independent countries ahead of Canada on first doses according to that source: San Marino, Nauru, Seychelles, and Malta. 

All of these are small countries, but they are still ahead.

&amp;nbsp;

Indeed.

Especially when you've ORDERED the other vaccines first but they still haven't been fulfilled.  

I just learned (since I posted) that my country finally got Pfizer vaccines in this week and starting this weekend, they'll have them available exclusively for 12-17 year olds (since that's the only one approved for that age range).  But its literally the first allotment.  230k vaccines.  Not much at all.

&amp;nbsp;


So, to recap, 10 million astrazeneca (first deal signed) has become 0 deliveries so far.  

&amp;nbsp;

2nd deal, 8 million pfizer, has become 230k...finally now on June 11th.  

&amp;nbsp;

3rd deal that was signed very late, Sinovac,has delivered around 5 million shots.  since Last week of February to June.

&amp;nbsp;

Covax Initiative has delivered around 800k astrazeneca vaccines that has been delivered in small amounts from March to June (technically, a small batch every month).  

&amp;nbsp;

It ain't much but its something.  And it is in no way been a ""choice"".

[Mortality data is in this article.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2774465) 

For example, in the 45-54 age group last year you can read off that covid killed triple the number of people as car accidents, with essentially nobody vaccinated.

[The mRNA vaccines have, so far, been roughly 99% effective at preventing death](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.21.21255873v1)

If you then make relatively conservative assumptions of an equal probability of getting covid this year vs last year, and that the vaccine efficacy against death is the same for all age groups, and that the vaccine efficacy against death doesn't change for the variants (and there is no evidence that it does), then your relative risk from covid goes from 3x as large as a traffic accident (2020) to ~1/30th as a large as a traffic accident (2021).

I think some of the measures are general hygiene practices and some are way overboard.  Not to say I didn’t do many of those but knowing what I know now, I’d say they were pointless. 

In my opinion the best case for cleaning surfaces is to prevent aerosolization of virus in highly contaminated areas.

These people will less likely have severe symptoms, but they all become brewing beds to give lots of chances for covid to mutate as long as R0 &gt; 1 (as is the case now in UK).  Mutations lead to new variants, and you need just one deadly variant created to cause all sorts of problems even for the vaccinated.

Passports hopefully will keep R0 &lt; 1 for a couple more months until you move towards zero number of new cases.  Dead virus = no chance to mutate.  Kind of like Israel right now.

The way I see it, this covid passport implementation if successful will last probably 3 to 4 months tops?  Again Israel has given us a perfect example (even though they didn't exactly use passport.. or did they?)  Now that they have virtually zero new case, they are ready to fully open.

With more countries joining that club, a covid free bubble can be formed rather quickly.. then more countries join the bubble, and u will have a covid free world.

The absolute continuation of this lifestyle with some people/institutions even after vaccination is starting to genuinely frustrate me. These vaccines work. Holy shit. Cases are low. The chance you’d even *encounter* someone with covid is slim after so much natural infection and vaccination. It’s over. This virus is not going anywhere.

At one point can I have a normal college experience without any masks or any testing? When I saw vaccination was required, I was ecstatic. It showed that they wanted a return to normal.

You could need multiple vaccine doses for a few different reasons (probably not an exhaustive list; I have no expertise here other than reading too many internet posts about COVID-19 vaccines):

 * The immune system needs to see the infection enough times to decide it's really a threat worth remembering. This is the intuition behind why basically every vaccine involves multiple doses. I'm not sure about other vaccines, but for the mRNA COIVD-19 vaccines, the two doses are identical, just delivered spaced out to make sure the immune system treats it as a permanent and not temporary threat and actually continues its immune response long-term.
 * Related, the immune system has forgotten about the infection. Sometimes vaccines need to be repeated decades later. For example, when there's a measles outbreak, people likely to get exposed are sometimes given antibody tests to make sure they still have measles antibodies, and given another dose of the vaccine if not. My understanding is that this is very rare (at least for measles), and easily confused with poor records meaning that the person actually never got the vaccine in the first place. I'm not sure if some infections the immune systems forgets about more easily than others.
 * The virus changes enough that the subsequent doses are vaccinating for a different, although similar, virus. This is why there's an annual flu vaccine. So far [COVID has not mutated enough for this to be an issue](https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20210521/covid-vaccine-variant-protection), and we simply don't know whether or not it will (although the fact that it hasn't yet is a good sign).

3\. The vaccine manufacturers are [actively developing](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210224006083/en/Moderna-Announces-it-has-Shipped-Variant-Specific-Vaccine-Candidate-mRNA-1273.351-to-NIH-for-Clinical-Study) new vaccines focused on the variants, so they'll be ready to administer them as boosters if necessary.

Additionally, there's ongoing work on [a 'Universal' Coronavirus Vaccine](https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/a-universal-coronavirus-vaccine-to-prevent-the-next-pandemic1/).

Pharma companies are preparing for the possibility, but it’s by no means a given. 

How often you need a booster depends on a few factors. Some things, your immune system does eventually “forget.” Usually, those are bacterial pathogens. That’s why you need a tetanus booster. The kid of immunity your body makes against clostridium tetani bacteria is temporary. 

Something like measles, your two shot MMR is good for life because the kind of immunity your body makes against measles virus is for life, and measles almost never changes, and even if it does, it can’t change very much at all or it’ll stop being able to infect. 

On the other end, you’ve got flu, which mutates super fast, and has a whole lot of infectious mutation pathways. So you need a flu shot every year because the flu is different enough every year that lasts year’s shot isn’t going to do you any good. 

Corona viruses are in between. They can mutate more than measles, but not nearly as much as flu. The immunity to them is long lived, people who survived SARS 17 years ago are still immune, and there’s no reason to think SARS 2 would be too much different. The reason to potentially spin up a booster is just in case it mutates enough that another dose with slight modifications might protect against newer variants. So far, the current vaccines work against all identified variants, but we’re ready just in case they ever don’t. 

Newer vaccines are going to go a little more slowly now just because the virus isn’t circulating as much, so it’s going to take longer to reach their numbers to determine how effective it is. But they’re still working on some. We have a whole planet to protect, we need as many as we can get.

Basically he suggests that lifelong immunity is only possible for certain virus (likes measles or Mumps) where the virus has to disseminate through the lymphs or blood in order for pathogenesis or onward transmission to occur. Presumably that is because after our initial infection or vaccination, our lymph nodes and blood are filled with immune cells that can fight off infection in those areas before the infection gets out of control.

In contrast, viruses like influenza and common cold viruses simply have to replicate in our mucosal surfaces (nose, throat, lungs) in order for pathogenesis or onward transmission to occur. And it turns out that our bodies are less capable of controlling (or perhaps more permissive of) infections in the mucosal surfaces. We do have mucosal antibodies, but for whatever reason they’re less effective at totally blocking infections. So that’s why, even though we’ve all probably been exposed to common cold coronaviruses dozens of times throughout our lives, we still get reinfected every couple years. 

(Side note: Even though measles, for example, has a respiratory route for infection, I think one implication here is that technically you could have a measles infection in your lungs, but your body stops it there, so it never causes disease or leads to onward transmission).",,,1623524184,{},h1jk7ya,False,t3_ny0sg7,False,True,t1_h1ijz0o,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ny0sg7/daily_discussion_thread_june_12_2021/h1jk7ya/,1623797720,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_16yuw3,False,False,,

It's too bad that most statistics around here show first dose numbers and not full vaccination; my city has 96% of target population vaccinated with the first dose, but as far as completing the two doses all we know is that there's one region (Magallanes) with 73% of target population fully vaccinated, there's a bunch other regions with 60%+ and others with just 50%+

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

[],,cloudhid,,,,,,[],"Measuring infectious virus from environmental samples is very difficult and  virologists have different levels of success depending on the species of virus and environmental conditions. There are ways to culture viruses, but we can only make deductions based on secondary effects, most notably 'plaques' formed in epitheial cell cultures, for instance. So there is an element of 'artificial inoculation' inherent to culturing surface samples.

We don't have sufficiently sophisticated sampling technology to know how many virons are necessary for infection in different tissues, how the viral degradation process proceeds over time at various temperatures and humidities and at what point a viron is effectively sterilized, what microbiomes are supportive or deleterious to viral longevity, etc. etc.

The outdoors has good ventilation but people still can sneeze, cough, yell, sing, talk, or just breath at you and you can get a face full of highly infectious droplets and aerosols. There are precisely zero people who would have gone to an outdoor superspreader event and not come within breathing distance of others, and more importantly, literally not go anywhere else or be in the vicinity of others for a week before and after said event.

Even if there were thousands of such potential living proofs of pure fomite transmission, the tracing programs in the US and many places around the world were and are, frankly, pitiful. Through no fault of the actual scientists and investigators, of course. In the US, they could only do it somewhat effectively early on, in certain states, for big clusters, in a limited way, and they were politically hamstrung the whole way. 

What we're left with is a handful of studies of isolated events; a superspreader restaurant in China, a church choir practice in the US, an anti-masker bar or restaurant, etc. To my knowledge there has not been a comprehensive assessment of tens or hundreds of thousands of cases actually representative of all forms and modes of spread, with full transmission trees, with rigourous confidence intervals for each branch or whatever.

The messaging this whole year and a half was stupid as hell, you won't hear any argument from me there. The CDC should have known that this was aerosolized and that clouds of respiratory droplets were the primary vector. Even if they didn't know it, they should have erred on the side of caution and assumed it until proven otherwise. Cotton or gauze masks should have been recommended from the beginning, ventilation should have been prioritized, etc.

I don’t think theres a single reasonable person that doesn’t already know the reality of covid and it’s seriousness. We inundated with it. I think you think I’m some sort of trump supporting, partying, frivolous complete covid denialist. But I’m not. Yes I’m bitter. Losing my sanity. Questioning everything. Myself. Those that don’t question themselves. I know I’m a hypocrit. I suffer from the dunning Kruger effect. Cognitive dissonance. All of it. So what is there that you want from me to think other than that everyday and every moment that whatever I’m doing could potentially kill someone? I do try to think that… the plight of others… how do you not?

I’m just a dumb dumb, scraping it out down here. I was lucky to be deemed an essential service during COVID in my line of work which is private avaition. Medical flight contracts. My wife lost half her business to covid lockdowns… and I know “woe is me” it’s all relative right. 

I think what you said about billions being invested into diabetes prevention is great… yet after reading books like homo deus by yuval harari and lifespan by David Sinclair… I realize how it’s also public knowledge that billions and billions are invested into medical fields and projects actively trying to prolong life to its limit… something that will likely only benefit the ultra rich… and I think about how Obama tried to revamp the school food program for only that to fail as well. 

So if I’m painted a conspiracy theorist, and your in the medical field I already know you’re smarter than me. I’m just scraping it out discussing covid and it shouldn’t be some thing that induces a polarization or divide. You can’t listen to a layman’s perspective because it’s beneath you or something? Some people just over think and want to be heard instead of dismissed… everything I’ve read about history, everything when you just try to think about multi billionaires and government elites, books on climate change, our state of the world, mass automation, our energy sectors, agriculture, the problems climate change is *already* having on us… and then at the end of the day we’re just told to believe they’re magnanimous altruists… it’s a hard pill the swallow because with what I know… fails in comparison to what they know. And as soon as you use that word “they” and you can’t attribute it to anything tangible… you’re credibility, your critical thought, beliefs, understandings are compromised. I get that. 

I’m not trying to fight you… I just want truth. You’re telling me it’s this simple right… than I truly am lost I guess.

I can’t talk like this with people at work… or my friends or neighbours… but shouldn’t we? This is how discussions are right? The sharing of each other’s experiences.

While the numbers are much better now than they were a few months ago, in some areas of the country, the infections per 100K people are still worrying.  Our best bet to stop the spread outright is the vaccinate as many people as possible to eliminate vectors for infection. 
2. Even the best vaccines aren't 100% effective, so our best bet for truly ending the pandemic is to vaccinate as many people as possible to eliminate vectors for infection. 
3. Some people medically can't be vaccinated, and remain at risk, and it's incumbent upon the rest of society to get vaccinated to prevent potential harm for this group of people. 
4. Every infection can potentially lead to millions of viral replications.  Each viral replication has a chance at producing a mutation.  While most mutations are generally not harmful, it only takes one mutation to create a new variant capable of circumventing existing vaccinations and then society is back to square one with regards to economic lockdowns and hospital infrastructure overruns. 
5. People who choose not to get vaccinated are not the problem in this specific thread.  People who choose not to get vaccinated and then lie about that status are the problem being discussed.

The article says that's 1/100th of a percent, but they did the math wrong; 40 out of 4,000,000 is actually 1/1000th of a percent.

1/1000th of a percent of the US population would be 3,300 deaths.

April 28 was about two months on average since these people got vaccinated. In the same time period in the US there are, on average:

    5,800 flu deaths
    6,300 car accident deaths
    5,000 brain anyerism deaths

This is an extremely simplified view but yes, at a glance, it appears to me from the data we have that death from vaccinated Covid is less likely than the three causes listed above.

Well my friend, I think we are seeing it right now. There is just more vested interest in, if it ain't broke, don't fix it...There are several meat ""alternatives"", but all ultra processed still. Solar and wind energy is getting more efficient and cheaper. Hard to see changes in great leaps and bounds anymore, everything is so incremental with our tech advances.

As I said above, several contributing factors, but we can only control what we can control(I feel like I should recite the serenity prayer...lol). However, we can actually control a lot when it comes to consumerism and capitalism (which I refer to as the PAC man model, because large entities eat/absorb smaller ones. 

All we can do is keep it up and spread the knowledge.

I love to chat with people on here because I believe some meaningful conversations can happen here that otherwise might be limited by the aforementioned advances in tech(internet, exchange of data, science and news, and social platforms). 

""We the people"" does still mean something. We need to understand that we do actually have the power as consumers.The pendulum is broke, check and balances don't work...Capitalism is great, but we have allowed the monsters to take control.

The best estimate is that 40% of Wisconsinites have caught Covid, I’d argue higher in places that had schools open. 

Our vaccination rate and natural infections gives the USA a better chance with the variants. 

I am not saying the variants are not a concern, and I definitely hope we can get our vaccination rates up to 70%-80% But I think most places in the US have until late August to get the virus in check. 

Wisconsin right now has a 7 day average of 121 cases per day, and falling fast.

Take the variants for example. We know that e.g. the Beta (SA) variant has significant immune escape, potentially lowering Pfizer efficacy to 75%. But you rarely hear about that in the media - whenever they quote scientists saying something, they’ll say “the vaccines are still highly effective against all variants”, which is quite true (75% is still pretty good and more than enough for herd immunity), but they don’t mention that all else being equal, the Beta variant will increase the risk for vaccinated people fivefold, which you would think is important information that could easily factor into people’s risk assessments.

I mean, I understand why they do it. They want to encourage people to get the vaccines, so they try their best to make them sound as appealing as possible. They’re working off the assumption that people are generally too stupid to understand statistics, which frankly is not inaccurate. But still, just out of principle, I believe that it’s still best practice to give people the facts, to inform them as accurately as possible, rather than trying to manipulate them through selective information into doing what we want them to do, even if it’s “for their own good”.",,,1623475467,{},h1hkgt9,False,t3_nxhntl,False,False,t1_h1hj0ru,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nxhntl/fda_tells_jj_to_throw_out_60_million_doses_made/h1hkgt9/,1623751603,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_vg2ir,False,True,,

However, there's been so little information afterwards about comparing real world efficacy, so all of our questions have just gone unanswered: do we need a booster shot, should we get an mRNA booster, how safe are we traveling to an unvaccinated country and so on. Pretty much all of our data is coming from foreign countries which aren't using J&amp;J, and the only thing I've seen is the CDC saying that ""no unexpected patterns have emerged"". I can't help but feel it's possible that they are seeing clear data that J&amp;J is worse and are purposefully stifling it to avoid discouraging people from getting the vaccine, I hope I'm wrong on that but the CDC is publishing so little data on breakthrough cases that I can't help but wonder if something like that is up.

I admit, I feel completely burned by the CDC on this one, I went and got the first shot that was available even though I felt it wasn't the best one, and now I don't know whether it is safe for my wife and I to travel to her family in South Africa where no one has been able to get vaccinated yet.

It's not useful to compare dollar amounts without adjusting for inflation, GDP, population, etc. Although yes even with those adjustments US debt is increasing

&gt; If you look at retirement returns which is how this affects the average worker.

What investment are you referring to?? That sounds like government bonds to me.

If I don't, it starts destroying tissue throughout my body, including my connective tissue holding my joints together (I have ehlers danlos hypermobility as well).

I knew I don't tolerate or process traditional vaccines at all, but I also knew all these asshole antivaxxers weren't going to get us to herd immunity enough for me to function and survive as a human being, so I decided to try MRNA. I really wanted Pfizer, because it's a lesser dose, but all I could get in my eligibility slot was Moderna.

I'm on steroids (with their own complications to my body), and I missed a call from the CDC yesterday checking in.

I don't regret getting vaccinated at all, but I know I will struggle physically for the next year and might rack up damage that kills my performance career. I should have stuck with my gut, ignored everyone who insisted I was nuts and that it didn't make a difference and I should get first available, and waited for Pfizer.

&gt;First of all, kids can get the flu shot.

Kids can get the flu shot, which is only about 50% effective. This still leaves them vulnerable. Do you think children should wear masks to protect themselves from seasonal influenza?

&gt;Secondly there’s more than dead vs not dead when it comes to covid. Long Covid is absolutely a thing and it’s brutal.

The evidence for long covid is mixed at best, particularly in children. Children getting severe symptoms for any length of time from covid is very uncommon.

&gt;Thirdly, it doesn’t seem like you understand how covid works, 16 months in and you don’t realize that it attacks multiple organ systems, leaving them heavily damaged.

Again, this is incredibly rare in children. The evidence does not support your fear mongering.

&gt;But I’d venture you’re an anti-vax type of person so any facts just zoom right by you because some dude on YouTube said so.

Nope. I follow the data and act accordingly. I got the vaccine, and if I had a child I would have them vaccinated as soon as possible. I would not have them wear a mask, because it's not neccesary in young children.

That is my take as well. People here generally think the vaccine will be safe and effective.

But I think there is also a realistic fear and understanding of the danger of the virus. It probably helps that the danger or even existence has never been widely used as a political issue in our country.

Personally I felt there is some risk in the vaccine but I was more than willing to take that chance. Even as a young person getting covid could have permanent effects that could disable a person or damage quality of life. Probably most agree with that.

We managed to take samples from the air and prove it contains infectious virus and we did so fairly early in the pandemic.  It is much harder to sample the air in this manner. 

I’m not talking about super spreader events. Any cluster will do. There are plenty of high touch surfaces in well-ventilated places. If this were common it would be easy to detect a pattern as it was with aerosol transmission. It was obvious to aerosol experts very early in 2020 that it spread through aerosols and there are many non-superspreader examples in addition to super spreading examples where the only plausible explanation is aerosol transmission. 

As far as super spreader events you are vastly understating the known examples.  You don’t need such a rigorous example. If you can find a single one where it was entirely outdoors it would be news to me. Yet that should be the case if fomite transmission were anything beyond exceedingly rare.

There are exactly zero examples of highly likely fomite transmission at all - not even super spreading events.  All examples I’ve seen are the researchers spitballing ideas that aren’t as plausible as other scenarios. Elevator buttons are in elevators which are not generally well ventilated. The quarantine trash scenario was basically disproven. 

If it’s 2-3% there would be examples. Many examples. 

There have been plenty of periods of time across the globe where countries or cities with a heavy contact tracing presence in a low case burden area would have been able to trace such events. 

We already have animal models demonstrating that aerosols require a much lower load than nasal doses. This is in keeping with what is known about other respiratory viruses. All available evidence points to the conclusion that surface transmission is so rare that regular surface decontamination is only beneficial if a maximum effort had already been put in place to mitigate aerosol spread. Forcing distance, very high ACH, mask use, speaking quietly or not at all, etc.  Every place that allowed loud conversations or singing while decontaminating surfaces should have done the opposite.",,,1623465182,{},h1h50fa,False,t3_nx2q0e,False,True,t1_h1gz7ax,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nx2q0e/2_passengers_test_positive_for_covid_on_first/h1h50fa/,1623741626,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_int0o,False,False,,

It's really all about the gestation period.  The nightmare scenario is a highly lethal virus that takes a long time to present symptoms, giving the host plenty of time to spread it.

Eg, if Covid was way more lethal but still took 3-4 weeks to kill and was able to spread asymptomatically, we'd be in a bad, bad place.

&gt; One thing that is often claimed, but attracts scientific scorn, is that the virus must get milder in order to spread more easily. There is very little evolutionary pressure on the virus for that to happen. The virus is already off into the next person long before it kills the person it infected. And the people who do the most spreading (younger people) are those who don't get very ill.

I think one of the mistakes made by many governments is that they have not communicated solid metrics.  Perhaps Australia, as a whole, can get a high percentage of the population to vaccinate by giving a metric that when a certain percentage of the population is vaccinated, everything opens and stays open.  It will be incentive for everyone to go get a vaccination and people won't necessarily feel strung along.

[],,jjcityscenes,,,,,,[],"Your math is off as masks without a vaccine ≠ masks with a vaccine.  The difference a mask makes on a vaccinated person is much lower than on an unvaccinated person.  Also, that effectiveness number includes a lot of maskless people/activities, so it's misleading.  People still had their masks down and even more importantly, met in homes maskless, went to restaurants maskless, etc.  Also a mask can be only a tad effective or nearly 100% effective depending on filtration and fit.  What I used/am using is way more effective than what nearly everyone is using. Also if someone wears a highly effective masks but then goes maskless inside with people or lives with people who don't have great mask usage then they would still be at risk.

Though I agree with the overall sentiment.  A vaccinated maskless person is far less of a threat than nearly every masked unvaccinated person to others and health systems (themselves) based on what people used and how they used them.  Plus the protection is 100% of the time so it's far more practical as they can eat, meet indoors, etc.  As into masks as I am and understand their importance, vaccination is even better overall, and so far the numbers reflect this (not surprisingly). And I'm soo glad about this.

Though masks can still be a useful tool in various ways.  Especially is there's a vaccine escaping varient (hopefully not but it's possible, at least eventually) before a booster is available and for other illnesses and pollution.
