‚ÄìThen, you'd actually have to be symptomatic enough for it to matter, and that's also not a guarantee.

We could probably have close to a billion doses by 6 months after people realize its a real threat. And if we're starting the production of new vaccines when a new variant of interest is first detected, we could start right at testing when we realize its the next big variant of concern. A year after, we'd probably have a few billion doses. If all that is needed is a single booster, that's enough to help limit the spread of the disease and protect the most vulnerable worldwide. 

Also, its unlikely a new virus would be significantly worse than delta and existing immune system have no effect. If the new big variant is a Delta ancestor, the Delta-vaccines we're currently studying would likely be fairly effective as a stopgap. So we probably won't be back to square 1.

It comes a day after the Japanese health ministry said it was investigating the death of two men who received shots from tainted Moderna batches - though the cause of their death is unknown.

The Okinawa prefecture, in southern Japan, said Sunday's vaccination programme was partially postponed.

""We are suspending the use of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines as foreign substances were spotted in some of them,"" it said in a statement.

The lots affected by the contamination spotted in Okinawa on Saturday are different from the 1.63 doses suspended after the two deaths, according to local media reports.

That suspension came after the health ministry said two men, aged 30 and 38, died in early August after getting their second Moderna doses.

Those doses were drawn from one of three batches suspended by the government on Thursday after several vials were found to be contaminated.

The ministry said however that it was investigating the cause of death and it is unknown currently if there is a causal link with the vaccine.

""At this time, we do not have any evidence that these deaths are caused by the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, and it is important to conduct a formal investigation to determine whether there is any connection,"" Moderna and its Japanese distributor Takeda said in a joint statement on Saturday.

The nature of the particles found in the vials, which were manufactured by a Moderna contractor in Europe, is also not known yet.

""The vials have been sent to a qualified lab for analysis and initial findings will be available early next week,"" Moderna and Takeda said.

The contractor, Spanish pharmaceutical firm ROVI, said in a statement Thursday that it was investigating the cause of the contamination in the batch, which was only distributed in Japan.

It added that the issue may have originated on one of its manufacturing lines.

About 44 per cent of Japan's population has been fully vaccinated, as the country battles a record surge of coronavirus cases driven by the more contagious Delta variant.

Not a single student wears an N95 and I teach in a wealthy district. Cloth masks, neoprene masks, masks with valves, novelty sports masks (Cowboys/Mavericks/Rangers/Stars), no masks. But not a single quality mask to be found.

There has been nothing done to address the brutal air quality and HVAC/indoor ventilation systems in schools. As it gets colder, indoor transmission in schools will be the number one driver. Hospital capacity is already stretched thin; hospital staff cannot be asked to do more than they are or to keep up their Herculean efforts for much longer. Burnout is real. I want to keep schools virtual during this surge to make their lives easier. 

Kids do not socially distance, and even when mandated it is never and I mean *never* enforced. I mean, socializing is the biggest benefit for kids of in-person school, not actual face-to-face instruction (as most of the kids are on laptops now during class regardless). 

You can say ‚Äúthese things should happen‚Äù, but they have to be enforced. A teacher vaccine mandate has to be enforced, just like masks have to be enforced, just like quarantine has to be enforced, just like distancing has to be enforced. 

There will be no enforcement without incentives (cash stimulus) and threats (firing for teachers, detention then suspension for students). Neither have ever been present at a local let alone regional or national level. 

Again, we have not focused on producing or proliferating quality masks for children at any point in the pandemic. I remember the ‚Äúkids need to see each other smile‚Äù argument from last year. Now it‚Äôs ‚Äúwell, only 1-2% of kids will get hospitalized, so what‚Äôs the big deal‚Äù.

&gt;CoVID is not very dangerous to children

That‚Äôs not true of the delta variant - but even if it were, **long COVID symptoms are devastating to a child‚Äôs learning curve**. CoVID fog, fatigue, and - [if recent research is to be believed](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20210730/study-finds-covid-19-may-lower-intelligence) - a 3-7 point drop in IQ for those with significant symptoms.

From the study:

&gt;Those who had previously had the coronavirus found it harder to complete tasks related to **reasoning, problem-solving, and spatial planning**, the authors said. Researchers controlled for age, education, and overall mood.

Are you saying that noticeable decreases in reasoning, problem solving, and spatial planning capacity for children are ‚Äúnot very dangerous‚Äù to kids? I‚Äôll concede that they‚Äôre not *lethal* side effects, but for a kid depending on education (not socialization) as their ticket out like I did, developments like this are absolutely dangerous to both their current and future prospects. Rich parents can afford tutors and therapy, poor kids and those from struggling families will just fall by the wayside. 

Do not conflate ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù with ‚Äúlethal‚Äù. The dangers of long CoVID for students will be with us for decades. The lethality, hopefully, will subside as kids can be vaccinated. Until then? No in-person school until the curve comes down.

Oh wait, Labor Day weekend is coming up. Schools will be 100% open after families get back from vacations and football games and airports and similar gatherings. It might make sense to close schools for two weeks just to prevent that level of inevitably astronomical community spread.

One variant of COVID may have spike proteins with a higher efficiency of cell entry, yes, but all spike proteins of one variant are the same. Efficiency of cell entry is only one way to look at it as well. Another way to increase infection could be the rate at which the virus can deliver its ‚Äòpayload‚Äô into the cell. For example, the P681R mutation that promotes spike protein activation can do so by lowering the energy barrier needed for the furin (TMPRSS2) enzyme to operate. Think of it as holding the door open for someone such that they don‚Äôt have to reach out and twist the door knob. If the virus can more quickly enter your cells then your antibodies simply have less opportunity to bind the spike protein and initiate immune system attack. 

As for viral load, this can be thought of as the number of particles introduced into your system. With Delta, it appears to have mutations that result in a much higher density of viral particles (I believe the jury is still out on the mechanism for this increased number) so combining this with faster and/or more efficient cell entry are two key reasons for the substantial risks associated with this variant. As an additional clarification, I‚Äôm using ‚Äòviral load‚Äô here to represent the number of particles an infected person is passing on to someone else.

Starting in the mid-1990s, Harris spent almost 20 years with a practice in infectious disease, treating HIV patients and hospitalized patients with difficult and sometimes hard-to-diagnose infections. He left the practice to become an area health officer over seven north Alabama counties in 2015. He became acting state health officer in 2017 and was named state health officer in February 2018.

Harris said the politicized nature of some of the debate over COVID-19 policies has made it hard to cut through the noise at times.

‚ÄúI think the single most challenging thing has just been the facts don‚Äôt win the argument sometimes or even most times,‚Äù Harris said. ‚ÄúPeople tend to pick whichever facts they want that supports whatever they were already going to believe anyway.‚Äù

Harris trusts the research behind the COVID-19 vaccines and hopes to help convince others. But he‚Äôs respectful of those who have their doubts about getting the shots.

‚ÄúThere are lots of people that have lots of very reasonable questions and ideas that they need to explore and information they want to obtain before they make a decision,‚Äù Harris said. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs perfectly reasonable. So, we‚Äôre trying to explain to people how we see the evidence on the vaccines, what we think about the safety and effectiveness of them.‚Äù

Harris said he believes the overarching lesson from the pandemic will be the need to close gaps in health care access.

‚ÄúI hope that people recognize that pandemics have always been around for human history,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always had them and this is only the latest one and we‚Äôre absolutely going to have them again. So, hopefully we can be more ready next time.‚Äù",,,,1630193978,{},haqqo7v,True,t3_pdf6k1,False,False,t1_haqp720,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pdf6k1/intensely_frustrated_alabamas_top_health_officer/haqqo7v/,1630277661.0,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

And to see people behaving in ways that accentuates the threat to me &amp; mine, &amp; I am helpless to change that, then it‚Äôs even more stressful. Example: local school board banning a universal mask requirement &amp; bringing kids back in person even after watching the virus burn through the South‚Äôs schools &amp; hospitals.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What I'm getting at is that based on the data we have now, the absolute best way to get rid of covid is to have everyone get vaccinated and eventually reach herd immunity by everyone becoming infected. 

I think I would want to see data on viral loads in people who've gotten third doses and had breakthroughs. Problem is it seems breakthrough infections are rare with third doses, so it might be a while until we can get a good enough sample size. And we don't have any idea how long that protection will last. 

With only two doses, viral loads are so high (I think they're still like x300 that of WT covid without a vaccine?) that there's a ton of opportunity for immune-escape variants to be selected for. OTOH, if we could vaccinate everyone with 3 doses, we'd have stronger herd immunity than we have against measles (for as long as it maintains such a high level of protection).",,,,1630202482,{},har7ali,False,t3_pdi563,False,True,t1_har1l7b,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pdi563/a_grim_warning_from_israel_vaccination_blunts_but/har7ali/,1630286618.0,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

One suggestion I found really helpful is to vary routine and add novelty back in to the environment to make up for the new places and people I'm not seeing. For instance, I periodically change where I work between my home office computer, a desk I set up in my living room, and my dining room table, and I also change those environments as well. I've moved furniture around and alternated pictures on the wall. I also set off the weekends with unique plans to make them stand out from the rest of the week.

Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection is a safety concern for vaccine strategies. In a recent publication, Li et al. (Cell 184 :4203‚Äì4219, 2021) have reported that infection-enhancing antibodies directed against the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein facilitate virus infection in vitro, but not in vivo. However, this study was performed with the original Wuhan/D614G strain. Since the Covid-19 pandemic is now dominated with Delta variants, we analyzed the interaction of facilitating antibodies with the NTD of these variants. Using molecular modeling approaches, we show that enhancing antibodies have a higher affinity for Delta variants than for Wuhan/D614G NTDs. We show that enhancing antibodies reinforce the binding of the spike trimer to the host cell membrane by clamping the NTD to lipid raft microdomains. This stabilizing mechanism may facilitate the conformational change that induces the demasking of the receptor binding domain. As the NTD is also targeted by neutralizing antibodies, our data suggest that the balance between neutralizing and facilitating antibodies in vaccinated individuals is in favor of neutralization for the original Wuhan/D614G strain. However, in the case of the Delta variant, neutralizing antibodies have a decreased affinity for the spike protein, whereas facilitating antibodies display a strikingly increased affinity. Thus, ADE may be a concern for people receiving vaccines based on the original Wuhan strain spike sequence (either mRNA or viral vectors). Under these circumstances, second generation vaccines with spike protein formulations lacking structurally-conserved ADE-related epitopes should be considered.

Note: there is another recept paper supporting this theory with some experiments: [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.22.457114v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.22.457114v1) and here is the link to the paper the authors here refer to: [https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00756-X](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00756-X)

I think that's one of the reasons, as to why these anti-vaxxer cohorts doesn't want to give up with their stupid pseudo scientific rhetoric.

It kinda gives them that ""moral (immoral) 'perceived power' of them thinking themselves to be ""superior"" or ""stronger"" compared to the ones who get vaccinated.

For a lack of a better word, they might be suffering from some kind of inferiority complex or chauvinism, which results in such nonsensical behavior - a characteristics they might very well be sharing with their close 'flat-earthers' cousins.

September and October are generally good times to be vaccinated against flu. Ideally, everyone should be vaccinated by the end of October. Additional considerations concerning the timing of vaccination for certain groups include:

Adults, especially those 65 years and older, should generally not get vaccinated early (in July or August) because protection may decrease over time, but early vaccination can be considered for any person who is unable to return at a later time to be vaccinated.
Children can get vaccinated as soon as vaccine becomes available, even if this is in July or August. Some children need two doses of flu vaccine. For those children it is recommended to get the first dose as soon as vaccine is available, because the second dose needs to given at least 4 weeks after the first.
Early vaccination can also be considered for people who are in the third trimester of pregnancy, because this can help protect their infants during the first months of life (when they are too young to be vaccinated).

50 out of 117 is almost 43%, fully vaccinated thus excluding people with only 1 shot. I agree it makes sense that if most are vaccinated, most admissions will be among the vaccinated. 
But in the UK, the rate of fully vaccinated (as July, the time of the article, even though the material in discussion happened earlier) is 50% and including at least 1 shot it's 67%. (Our world in data, taken from google)

""The headline of the blog claims this equates to 62% of the 117 fatalities being people who received either one or two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. The blog itself, however, says this figure is actually 60%, which is closer to Reuters‚Äô calculation of 59.82%. This 2% discrepancy appears to stem from the headline percentage including the three people whose vaccination status was unknown.
The blog also says 37% of the fatalities (Reuters‚Äô calculation: 37.6%) happened in unvaccinated individuals.""

At that time, the unvaccinated were clearly not over represented in the deaths as opposed to vaccinated individuals.

They‚Äôre steadily going up.  Hospitalization is going up too, though still much lower than the pre-vaccine surges.

Basically there‚Äôs always going to be susceptible hosts for Delta.  Unvaccinated folks are 2.34x more likely to be re-infected than vaccinated people.  Dr. Poland from Mayo Clinic doesn‚Äôt believe natural infection from Delta triggers long term immunity as good as Alpha did.

All the while vaccinated people are more likely to experience Breakthrough infection the longer it‚Äôs been since their last jab.

Meanwhile, Delta continues to rapidly mutate everywhere where it‚Äôs spreading substantially.  And the Fall/Winter seasonal surge is baring down on us.

This doesn‚Äôt just burn itself out at this point without direct intervention.  We need to actively fight to control covid with vaccine mandates, mask mandates, capacity restrictions, and hopefully‚Ä¶ if cases ever get low enough one day, a proper contact tracing program of test, trace, isolate.

We‚Äôre probably still looking at 2-3 years of this with what we‚Äôre doing today.

First, understand that 99.9999999....% of all genetic mutation are dead ends for the virus.  If a mutation occurs that limits or prevents the virus from binding to a cell in our body and replicating, then it'll fade out of existence as an evolutionary dead end. 

Think of the handful of successful covid-19 mutations there have been thus far and then multiple that number by a billion, and that'll give you a very rough underestimate of how many unsuccessful covid mutation there has already been. 

Unlike a coded computer virus, biological viruses have no goals or intentions to do harm to the host. The core foundation in the viral genetic code is to find ways to make copies of itself and then improve on how effectively and efficiently it can continue to replicate over and over and over again. In terms of biology and evolution, it's in the best interest of the virus not to kill it's host. But again, there's no notion of intent from the virus trying to achieving this goal. It's just random chance based on the number of viruses that are currently in circulation.  

Every single viroid is an opportunity for a mutation.  If there's not many circulating around then the chances of mutations that make the virus more prolific are very astronomically low.  Let the virus circulate unchecked and then the odds for successful mutation starts swaying in the viruses favor.  The more of the virus in circulation the greater the probability it's going to mutate in a way that we don't want. There's a tremendous amount of the virus in circulation at this very moment that the probability of more prolific, vaccine resistance and virulent variants emerging is highly likely.  

The current mRNA vaccines help our immune system make antibodies that ""click"" into place with covid spike proteins. It's the shape of the spike protein that's important terms of the mRNA vaccines.  Mutations that alter the shape or orientation of the spike protein make it difficult for the antibodies to bind as readily as they were able to with the Alpha and Beta variants. The antibodies still bind to the delta spike proteins, but not quite as effectively as with previous variations of the virus. Nevertheless, the vaccine still works extremely well prevented people from falling ill.  

The big challenge with the delta variant isn't so much in the slight change in protein spikes, it's more with the viral load it imposes within an infected individual.  People infected with delta are saturated and shed at it at a significantly higher rate than previous variants.

If you are vaccinated and come into contact with one single delta variant virus, your immune system will quickly make short work of it.  But with delta, people are getting hit with millions, probably billions, of the virus at one time. Even vaccinated individual's immune systems have a hard time coping with the initial intrusion, and it's take a few days for the body to produce enough antibodies to neutralize the infection.",,,,1630259338,{},hatu9xb,False,t3_pduqve,False,True,t1_haswo0w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pduqve/new_covid_variant_detected_in_south_africa_most/hatu9xb/,1630336664.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is some truth to this though. Deaths aren't as high as they were in the past with similar case counts.

Delta is bad, but most of the worst fears about it never came to fruition. It isn't evading vaccines en masses. Breakthrough cases are extremely mild. It isn't any more virulent than any other variant.

There were lots of stories of people who felt normal with oxygens much below 80% in hospitals during the first wave. 

[https://www.bu.edu/articles/2020/3-reasons-why-covid-19-can-cause-silent-hypoxia/](https://www.bu.edu/articles/2020/3-reasons-why-covid-19-can-cause-silent-hypoxia/)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; One of the biggest and most life-threatening mysteries is how the virus causes ‚Äúsilent hypoxia,‚Äù a condition when oxygen levels in the body are abnormally low, which can irreparably damage vital organs if gone undetected for too long. Now, thanks to computer models and comparisons with real patient data, Boston University biomedical engineers and collaborators from the University of Vermont have begun to crack the mystery.  
  
Despite experiencing dangerously low levels of oxygen, many people infected with severe cases of COVID-19 sometimes show no symptoms of shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Hypoxia‚Äôs ability to quietly inflict damage is why it‚Äôs been coined ‚Äúsilent.‚Äù

There's nothing really stopping journalists from jumping the gun and publishing preprints. It happens quite often actually. Not saying its bad! I love to feel excited when journals release things coming up on the pipeline. If anything, these sources also present the data in a more palpable way to the general public instead of just doing some data dump with numbers and figures, as well as using nomenclature that is basically another language to someone not in that field. 

 I found this online source a more palpable explanation in regards to disseminating sources. (I would say Sciencemag is probably in the category of 1 or 2 (im leaning on 2 because they're acknowledging the limitations of the study (i.e. observational study,  self reported testing amongst affected individuals, etc.)

**The numbers list is copied exactly from the link i posted above**

1.Newspapers and magazines containing news - Articles are written by reporters who may or may not be experts in the field of the article. Consequently, articles may contain incorrect information.

2. Journals containing articles written by academics and/or professionals ‚Äî Although the articles are written by ‚Äúexperts,‚Äù any particular ‚Äúexpert‚Äù may have some ideas that are really ‚Äúout there!‚Äù

3. Peer-reviewed (refereed or scholarly) journals - Articles are written by experts and are reviewed by several other experts in the field before the article is published in the journal in order to ensure the article‚Äôs quality. (The article is more likely to be scientifically valid, reach reasonable conclusions, etc.) In most cases the reviewers do not know who the author of the article is, so that the article succeeds or fails on its own merit, not the reputation of the expert.

&amp;#x200B;

Now onto Preprints -----&gt; Peer reviewed 

Preprints: https://www.aje.com/arc/benefits-of-preprints-for-researchers/  
Preprints are usually like after the Principal investigator finishes up with collecting the data, analyzing it, and then writing up the results in a manuscript of sorts. The preprints have their benefit in a sense that the author can claim ownership of the study (its like calling dibs on the front seat to get radio privileges when going driving with friends! or you submitting your homework to your teacher before your friend who copied your homework cause they partied too hard just in case so you don't get in trouble but he does) as well as it helps it get exposure with the general public to get excited about! 

Now onto peer reviewed journals.

 The purpose of peer reviewed journals is to assess the validity of the data, the methodology, analysis, discussion, population, and of course! the conclusion. Peer reviewed journals are basically like when you have the experts in your field assess your data in as much as an impartial way as possible (so no, just cause your professor friend Dr. BillybobThorton looked over the study you conducted and says its good does not make it peer reviewed/scholarly). These impartial, sometimes anonymous experts would then do the following:

a. accept the manuscript and say its super legit,

b. ask for some minor revisions or follow up studies (i.e. wanna try it with a larger population? Maybe randomized double blinded clinical study? In vivo vs in vitro?) 

c.) completely evicerated and you go drinking with your buddies to fill that empty void in your heart cause you poured years of your life into this (i.e. coworker i went drinking with last night) 

In conclusion: Journals and magazines have their merit, Preprints have their uses, but peer reviewed journals are too legit to quit, like the reaaall good shit. (but take some time, like one of my colleagues told me, ""Science that is patient in the process is the one that is durable and helps the most patients!""

But that is unethical so you do a double blind study where you give half of them the vaccine, the other half a placebo, and send them all out into the wild and then track them for a few months. That is where the ""90% efficacy"" comes from.

What are someone's odds of being exposed to the virus, and what are their odds of getting infected once exposed, with and without the vaccine? Nobody knows. But how many people get sick from the virus even after being vaccinated? That has been measured many different times and is in the 0.01% range. 

Are breakthrough cases because of especially high viral load, or something unique to the person or their immune system or other circumstances? Nobody knows. They do know that almost all of the people that get seriously ill from a breakthrough infection are elderly with other serious health conditions.

If someone had super high exposure like dealt with symptomatic people every day is the vaccine any less effective? They have actually measured this, they check front line workers, and it isn't really.

If someone was in an enclosed space and the room pumped full of virus for weeks would the vaccine still work? We will probably never find out because this is unethical, and this doesn't test or simulate anything that actually happens.

&gt; Children are the people least protected against the virus in the U.K.

Given the recent findings that naturally acquired immunity provides better protection than vaccines, and that (probably) more than 50% have immunity, that's going to slow the spread compared to previous.

The way this article is written it sounds like it's the first time schools are returning since the pandemic started, but schools have been open since early March. They saw the end of the Alpha wave and the vast majority of the Delta wave (so far).

I mean, there will be spread, because that's just the reality of the Delta where we need 98% immune to get to herd immunity. That's not going to happen as immunity wanes to fast even if you can get to 98% of people taking the vaccine.

And we are holding on with the skin of our teeth. They have canceled tons of surgeries, but outpatients and emergent surgeries are still happening. The people with horrible cancer are still getting operated on. Our 20 tray morgue has only been over capacity twice. I still think they should call in the cooling truck, but they want to avoid the optics. Plus, all the trucks with actual body trays in them have been rented, so they‚Äôd just be putting bodies on the floor in the trucks.

Minds aren't fixed, they are healed. Regardless, the mental health issues of the country are much bigger than the pandemic. 

The labor dynamic in much of the world is broken. Depression and deaths of despair are a natural outcome of companies that don't treat employees as human beings. 

The climate is changing, animal species are dying in a mass extinction event, summer is now fire season. Whole neighborhoods are being burned to the ground, wiped off the map. That would make anyone anxious and depressed. 

The government, justice system, and law enforcement has been corrupted. Companies like chevron and Goldman Sachs use the justice system vindictively, to punish enemies or disloyalty. Living in a society with a financially segregated system would make anyone paranoid. 

Companies are fully corrupt. Insurance companies regularly delay or sue to avoid fulfilling the sole purpose of their existence. Pharmaceutical companies sell us heroin. There is rampant price fixing and wage fixing in agriculture. The priorities of finance and investment have been made the only decision making metric there is, so people are treated as numbers. People are destroyed for profit every day. This is depressing. 

This is all facilitated by the huge population explosion of rhe last century. All of our ideologies like capitalism where imagined when we had less than a third of the population we have today. None of our ideologies where imagined with the population we currently have. 

The population allows for a lot more facilitation of greed because there is a lot more competition over the same amount of resources. Nobody wants to be the one to throw their own children under the bus to secure the future of the species.

After that if there is a need for boosters then you will be able to get them. So use this time to think about your dream job. Work out how you will get it and focus on what a great life you will have. Don't look back. The best way to achieve something is to imagine it, dream about it in detail and it wil become part of you.

All of our deaths have been in the very elderly who are not vaccinated except for one who had a myriad of health issues including end-stage renal failure.

It's true that majority of the cases are mild or feeling absolutely nothing. We have triple digits because of mass testing and tbh, without the testing, we will probably have single or low double digits because no one would feel sick and therefore no one will be going to the doctor.

The problem is that our population is split into two groups - those who panic and cry for tougher (yet maybe unnecessary) measures whenever there's a sudden rise in cases, and those who are saying that we should be opening up further because our case numbers may be high but the condition of the patients are mostly stable.

I guess our leaders are torn on who to please and are trying to find a balance.

It was [Houston Methodist]
(https://www.houstonmethodist.org/) that fired a total of 150 unvaccinated hospital staff (mostly nurses, but not all). This is a health system with seven hospitals. [The biggest by far is the original Houston Methodist Hospital that has 900 beds and over 7,000 employees.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Methodist_Hospital#Locations) There are over 12,000 employees across the whole system. So the people who got fired were a tiny percentage of the total work force, and they were the hard cases left after several rounds of persuasion and incentives to try to get employees vaccinated voluntarily. 

Houston Methodist (HM) is considered the gold standard of Texas health care. It's a very desirable place to work, even now. That's part of why HM was the first Texas hospital to make vaccination mandatory-- they thought they could replace the lost staff (and 150 out 12,000+ isn't that many to replace). 

IMO, the op-ed is slanted. I'll grant that the hospital overload situation in Houston is a serious crisis, but the op-ed tries to paint the decision to fire anti-vax nurses as the cause of all Houston Methodists' problems. Guess what? There would be too many COVID patients in Texas whether or not HM fired one percent of their workers.

I really don't know what to say other than...be pragmatic? You can only hope for the best, even though you're essentially being handed the worst. There comes a point where - especially as a health care worker - you just need to numb yourself to the emotional toll of what you experience. Maybe I'm an odd one out but at this point, death no longer impacts me...early 2020 I was working in a long term care home and watched close to 60 people die in a few weeks. I had to turn off that part of my mind and contextualize it in the right way. I knew what was happening etc...so I just had to acknowledge that each day I went to work, someone might die.

I guess that's why the media loved to call us ""front line"" health care workers, as if we were sewing up wounds in Afghanistan. I suppose, in a way, we are, but the enemy is silent and cannot be seen. And it's not happening in Kandahar, it's happening in schools and shopping malls where we live. It fucks up my mind thinking that so many thousands - millions - of lives have been lost from this. At some point, all you can do is turn that empathy switch off and do your job. Or maybe I'm already too pessimistic and you shouldn't listen to me haha. Either way, good luck!

You say the debate is complicated but I dont see it. You vaccinate kids to protect them from severe covid complications. Thats it. 

I think the way media talks about protecting others via vaccination has muddied the waters so people are getting confused. Vaccines go into your body. Its effects are firstly in your body. The protection applies to you. You should get vaccinated for yourself. Then if you want you can consider society or your family etc. If you dont care about yourself and you just want to visit your grandparents then thats as good a reason as any.

The PM made the statement at a conference with the education sector held online on Saturday.  
  
He requested the Ministry of Education and Training to collaborate with the Ministry of Health to implement the COVID-19 vaccination programme for students.  
  
They will have to access vaccine manufacturers, seek sources of vaccines suitable for people over 12, and work out a plan to prioritise vaccinating students according to their age groups.  
  
Vi·ªát Nam should have vaccinated students return to school like in other countries, he said.  
  
Leaders of many localities also suggested prioritising vaccinations for students.  
  
According to Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Quy√™n Thanh, vice chairwoman of Vƒ©nh Long Province‚Äôs People‚Äôs Committee, 91 per cent of teachers in the province have received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine and 44 per cent have been fully inoculated.  
  
The students haven‚Äôt been vaccinated so they have no other choice but studying online.  
  
This form of learning was not effective, especially for more than 14,000 disadvantaged students, she noted.  
  
She suggested priority should be given for students over 12 to be vaccinated so schools can reopen.  
  
Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Thanh L·ªãch, vice chairwoman of Gia Lai Province‚Äôs People‚Äôs Committee, said it was hard to keep students learning amid school closures in the province due to the socio-economic situation here.  
  
She said she expected a vaccination programme for students so they could return to school and the traditional way of learning.  
  
V≈© ƒê·∫°i Th·∫Øng, Secretary of the Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh provincial Party Committee said the pandemic was still developing in a complicated manner with many positive cases recorded in the past three days.  
  
He suggested the ministry of education and training issue guidance so localities could be more flexible and the vaccination programme be made available at schools.  
  
Vi·ªát Nam to date has received about 28 million doses from various sources, mostly AstraZeneca with 17 million doses, followed by five million doses of Moderna (US donation).  
  
The country has administered about 19 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines.

The information was released by Minister of Health Nguy·ªÖn Thanh Long during an online conference on Sunday morning. The conference was chaired by Prime Minister Ph·∫°m Minh Ch√≠nh ‚Äì head of the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control and involved 20 provinces and cities across the country.  
  
Minister Long told participants that the pandemic is still at a complicated and critical stage, pointing out how HCM City and B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng continued to see high numbers of new infections, with about 50 per cent of the new cases discovered in the community.    
  
However, he did say the situation was gradually being controlled in other southern provinces, with the number of new cases discovered in the community had been decreasing at a rate of between seven and 15 per cent.  
  
In H√† N·ªôi and central provinces such as Kh√°nh H√≤a and Ph√∫ Y√™n, the pandemic was also being controlled thanks to drastic measures and social distancing.  
  
However, Long said, this was not the time to be complacent, as there was still a great risk of further outbreaks in the future.  
  
Since July 19, 23 provinces and cities in the country implemented social distancing based on Direction 16.  
  
Besides modern equipment, the Ministry of Health has created 11 resuscitation centres for serious patients in southern provinces. In HCM City alone, six centres with a large number of beds have helped reduce fatalities.  
  
Minister Long said that by Saturday, more than 19.2 million doses of vaccines had been given to residents across the country. ‚Äî VNS",,,,1630250052,{},hat7te3,True,t3_pdx26r,False,True,t3_pdx26r,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pdx26r/vietnam_more_than_16000_experts_medical_workers/hat7te3/,1630323647.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vaccine breakthrough cases were significantly more common in the four weeks before the report came out as compared to the entire reporting period since February (due to the Delta variant now being at 99%).   
In the last few weeks, **15.6%** of all cases were breakthrough cases (meaning people who **tested positive** after a full course of vaccination). Considering that 60% of the German population is now fully vaccinated (65% at least one dose), this confirms the high efficacy of the vaccines against symptomatic disease of over 80% found elsewhere.   
Asymptomatic transmission may of course be a bit higher.  


This is also confirmed by looking at the breakdown of the current infection rates of vaccinated vs. unvaccinated.  
For instance, in Bavaria, according to [most recent figures](https://www.br.de/nachrichten/bayern/holetschek-zahlen-belegen-pandemie-der-ungeimpften,ShJKzTE) there are 111 cases per 100,000 in unvaccinated and 9 per 100,000 in vaccinated. In [Hamburg](https://www.t-online.de/region/hamburg/news/id_90683274/hamburg-so-hoch-ist-die-corona-inzidenz-unter-den-geimpften.html), the same figure is 78 per 100,000 vs. 3.3 per 100,000.

Breakthrough cases are significantly more common among the older population, who has also been vaccinated earlier. Here are the [RKI-calculated](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/Wochenbericht/Wochenbericht_2021-08-26.pdf?__blob=publicationFile) shares of breakthrough cases per age group in weeks 30-33 of 2021:

&amp;#x200B;

|12-17 years|18-59 years|60+ years|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1.1 %|15.9 %|38.5 %|

The type of vaccine and dosage interval may also be interesting for comparison with other countries.   
I took the values from [this table](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Daten/Impfquotenmonitoring.xlsx?__blob=publicationFile) and tried to calculate percentages (cross-vaccination makes it difficult to get the exact numbers. I did not find any exact breakdowns of what the share of the two mRNA vaccines in cross-vaccination was but it looks like \~85% BioNTech/Pfizer):  


|*fully vaccinated*||
|:-|:-|
|BioNTech/Pfizer|68 %|
|Moderna|8 %|
|Astrazeneca (2 doses)|7 %|
|Astrazeneca + mRNA cross-vaccination|11 %|

The south side of down would be almost empty  of ""locals"" because we all learned the hard way to stay away from that side of town when they held Scheid DieselFest. Picture a 3 lane main street with huge diesel trucks drag-racing down the street, blowing thru stoplights and not caring at all for other people on the road. Diesel trucks literally filling parking lots of retail establishments because they had nowhere to go. People would be having sex in the back of their trucks in the open. And then of course ""bottle girl"" made it internet famous. One year it was estimated they caused over $60,000 in property damages on the south side of town. About 5 or 6 years ago someone higher up finally grew a pair and started cracking down. Doubled the police on duty while they were in town. Private companies started hiring extra security and blockading their parking lots. They issued hundreds of tickets each year for public intoxication, underage drinking, fights, indecent exposure (all the fun stuff) and threw the idiots in lockup for the weekend when needed. The Scheid promoter started sniveling about how ""her"" people were being persecuted while in town and it ""wasn't fair"" how they were being treated. So they finally found a place ""out of the city environment"" (that is what their website actually says) and now they do their thing on some land outside of Lyons.

The rally is massively important for the local economy, generating more than $500 million in sales each year.

""People come here because they‚Äôre free of all that unnecessary political government control exercised over their lives,"" said Rod Woodruff, owner of the Sturgis Buffalo Chip campground about three miles outside the city.

Woodruff said he was not aware of a single Covid-19 case traced back to the rally.
""All these people here ... know all the crap, all the baloney that has gone back and forth about how dangerous all this unseen stuff is and the viruses,"" he said. ""Everybody‚Äôs aware of all that and they have assumed the risk of getting out of their home and getting away and going someplace else and hanging out with people that are like-minded.""

However you choose to look at it, Sturgis 2021 was a massive success in financial terms. Only time will tell whether it has been a disaster in other ways.

[],,RyanWilliamsElection,,,[],,,,text,t2_1zfi7ezn,False,False,[],"You are still saying ‚Äústanding‚Äù and ‚ÄúDriver‚Äù referring to a person in a vehicle standing, this is where you lack clarity. This is a confusing point.  When I‚Äôve been standing near a car crasher I have been ‚Äústanding‚Äù while pedaling a bike and the crash moved from next or behind me to my location. I was not injured while next to the crash but as the crash moves into me I was injured. A crash is moving thing so ‚Äúnext to‚Äù might be temporary so next to a crash is not safe.

You moved on to me driving past a crash after it happened . This is a bit confusing because it is after something happens. I‚Äôm sure you have walked into a room where an infected person had been. As time passed droplets were no longer in the air.  As time passes a covid cough zone and a car crash zone eventually has the risk level decrease.

Are you trying to say that the average covid cough range covers more distance than  the average loss of vehicle control to point of impact distance?

Are you trying to say that when a car crashes the impact happens so fast  that covid droplets would be in the air longer than the time from loss of control of the vehicle to the moment of impact?

Is your point that the duration is longer or path of destruction of a car crash is shorter than a covid cough?


I‚Äôve been in rooms with then infected pre vaccine for 20-40 hours easily with out any physical harm or infection. The seconds of impact when the crash moves from next to me to me is when and where I have had physical harm.

I think the biggest lack of clarity is the different perceptions of the definition of a car crash. If you define a car crash as the moment and location the car stops moving and I define a car crash as the moment the driver loses control and everything it hits on the way we would have very different definitions and a lack of clarity in the conversation.

If you are from LA and you define a car crash as a bad merge accident in bumper to bumper traffic and I‚Äôm from Iowa and I define a car accident as a 70 car winter pileup we are talking about totally different things when we say car crash.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hcSC-HittR

If you do want to debate or convince people of these perspectives I would recommend better define a car crash and be ready for some one to have a different definition.

When you mentioned standing next to someone drowning and being safe I visualized Jesus Walking on water next to some one drowning. That makes no sense. So next I visualized standing next to someone drowning on a sinking ship and drowning with them and that destroyed your point that it is safe to stand next to someone that is drowning.

* Unlike Sturgis, the [Lollapalooza festival required verification of vaccination status or a recent negative COVID test](https://support.lollapalooza.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403048984852-Covid-19-Health-Policy-and-Lollapalooza-Entry-Requirements). Sturgis, in contrast, asked for neither.
* Obama's Birthday Party [was massively scaled back; hundreds were asked to not attend, and the event was, in the end, only open to close friends and family who were vaccinated or those who had recent negative COVID tests](https://www.wkbn.com/news/national-world/hundreds-of-guests-are-asked-not-to-show-up-for-obamas-60th-birthday-party-on-marthas-vineyard/).

Quote:

&gt;At two weeks since the start of the music festival, the city is well within the timeline to see COVID symptoms develop and cases be able to be identified that can be linked to the event. Arwady said an estimated 385,000 people were there throughout the four day festival.  
So far, only 203 attendees have tested positive for COVID-19, or about 0.05% of people who attended.  
""The bottom line is, we've not see anything that has surprised us related to this Lollapalooza outbreak,"" Arwady said.

The same cannot be said of Sturgis. That's why bringing up Lollapalooza and Obama's birthday party are idiotic diversion.

But what we see with Delta is that despite it's relatively low antigenic drift (compare to e.g. Beta) it is able to generate quite a lot of breakthrough infections. So ADE in the N-terminal domain could be an explanation for this. Still, the facts on the ground clearly show the scales are in favour for the vaccinated and recovered.

The mutations in Delta's N-terminal domain, a region of the spike, abrogates neutralizing activity of existing NTD specific antibodies (e.g. from vaccine or people infected with other version apart Delta). Instead those antibodies may enhance infection activity by binding but not-neutralizing there.

The bioRxiv paper I linked also shows this behaviour in experiments. The authors there speculate that this is why Delta already could achieve quite some breakthrough infections by enhancing infectivity in vaccinated and recovered people.

So, if this holds true an upcoming variant with even more mutations on relevant sites could tip the scales in favor of enhancing antibodies meaning that you may have neutralizing antibodies from vaccine or being recovered, but they might (I emphasize this has not been proved in vitro yet) in fact enhance the infection (Dengue is a prominent example).",,,,1630216823,{},haruxpx,True,t3_pdpmr2,False,True,t1_hartq78,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pdpmr2/infectionenhancing_antisarscov2_antibodies/haruxpx/,1630299019.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,True,,,,,,,,,,,

Assessing antibody affective was over time to different variants for mRNA-1273 (Moderna)

Only 8 random samples in each age group, so margin of error could be quite high here so take with a grain of salt.

Some notes:

-	You definitely need a second dose of these two dose vaccines. Antibodies were only 8% effective against Beta at 29 days, but 54-58% two weeks after second dose (43 days).  Note: this is not simple vaccine efficacy, so these percentages are still neutralizing levels.
-	These are similar results to BNT162b2 (Pfizer): https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2104974  https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2101765
-	Moderna performs the worst against Beta; all other variants were 88%-96% at 43 days
-	Antibodies were still effective at 209 days (6 months)
-	Early results for booster of original Moderna or new Moderna variant booster (mRNA-1273.351) encoding the B.1.351 (Beta) spike shows promise boosting antibody response to Beta and other variants.",,,,1630216633,{},haruoub,False,t3_pdll0k,False,False,t3_pdll0k,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pdll0k/durability_of_mrna1273_vaccineinduced_antibodies/haruoub/,1630298894.0,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;It‚Äôs also not yet crystal clear whether immunity from contracting COVID-19 is as powerful as the protection of a vaccine. What is evident is that the available vaccines mount crucial defenses against severe disease and death‚Äîeven against more contagious variants such as Delta.

These are what your links say about natural immunity. The CDC study just compares recovered + vaccinated vs those recovered + unvaccinated as far as I understood.

The OP study doesn't contradict this one. It just says that recovered + unvaccinated persons have better protection that non-recovered + vaccinated ones. 

This means that while vaccinating recovered patients can boost their immunity, the question I ask is if it even is necessary. Considering they already fare better than purely vaccinated people, they would risk complications from the vaccine, while the risk of complications from covid is already pretty darn low for them.

My boyfriend has a rather flippant attitude about the virus in general. While he does wear masks, and has obtained the vaccine, he always forgets his mask wherever we go. 

I started bringing it for him, and had to remind him once we got in the store to put it on.  And he always wanted to be in public, going out to eat, etc. I always felt like I was at risk for catching the virus.

Couple that with the news about our police state and the mass protests and I went off the deep end. I smashed one of our doors in the RV, and sent both my parents a crushing text message where I read them for filth about how they raised me as a child.

I ended up moving out temporarily this past February because our fighting over me watching the news and the pandemic in general was making me, well beyond paranoid into borderline schizophrenia.

I have seen what the German Robert Koch Institute says about this. FYI in most of Europe where I live recovered patients (genesene) have same rights as vaccinated (geimpfte) ones, but only for 6 months.

Germany recommends single-dose vaccination only after 6 months due to *lack of data* on the duration of natural mmunity.

Denmark recognizes recovered patients for 12 months on the other hand.

[Recombination in viruses: mechanisms, methods of study, and evolutionary consequences, 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25541518/)

&gt;Abstract

&gt;Recombination is a pervasive process generating diversity in most viruses. It joins variants that arise independently within the same molecule, creating new opportunities for viruses to overcome selective pressures and to adapt to new environments and hosts. Consequently, the analysis of viral recombination attracts the interest of clinicians, epidemiologists, molecular biologists and evolutionary biologists. In this review we present an overview of three major areas related to viral recombination: (i) the molecular mechanisms that underlie recombination in model viruses, including DNA-viruses (Herpesvirus) and RNA-viruses (Human Influenza Virus and Human Immunodeficiency Virus), (ii) the analytical procedures to detect recombination in viral sequences and to determine the recombination breakpoints, along with the conceptual and methodological tools currently used and a brief overview of the impact of new sequencing technologies on the detection of recombination, and (iii) the major areas in the evolutionary analysis of viral populations on which recombination has an impact. These include the evaluation of selective pressures acting on viral populations, the application of evolutionary reconstructions in the characterization of centralized genes for vaccine design, and the evaluation of linkage disequilibrium and population structure.

[Epidemiology, Genetic Recombination, and Pathogenesis of Coronaviruses, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0966842X16000718#kwd0005)

&gt;The major reason for recombination may be at the replication step in the virus life cycle. During
replication, a set of subgenomic RNAs is generated, increasing the homologous recombination
rate among closely related genes from different lineages of CoVs or other viruses by template
switching. Concurrently, circulating CoVs in multiple host species likely contribute to
increases in the rate of recombination events. However, the exact mechanism of genetic
recombination in CoVs remains unclear: recombination site ‚Äòbreakpoints‚Äôin the viral genome
‚Äìthe crossing point of the recombinant genes between two distinct viral strains or genotypes ‚Äì
appear to be random, as different recombinant strains have different breakpoints.

&gt;Genetic recombination has been previously documented for animal CoVs, for instance: MHV, TGEV, as well as feline and canine coronaviruses. Genetic recombination for other HCoVs including OC43, NL63, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV have also been documented and are discussed in detail below.",,,,1630253869,{},hatgwjc,False,t3_pduqve,False,True,t1_hasxm13,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pduqve/new_covid_variant_detected_in_south_africa_most/hatgwjc/,1630328819.0,20,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quote:

""Four IC elements and the National Intelligence Council assess with low confidence  
that the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection was most likely caused by natural exposure to  
an animal infected with it"".........

So the paragraph says that; the council **assess** **with low confidence that the** initial **virus was caused by natural exposure to an animal infected with it**

Quote:

""Most agencies also assess with low confidence that SARS-CoV-2 probably was not genetically engineered.""

This states that **they have low confidence that it was not genetically engineered**, thus leading to the conclusion that it WAS genetically engineered!

**CONCLUSION**

So the intelligence community implies with their intel-doublespeak that the virus was genetically engineered AND its spread was NOT associated with an infected animal but with ""moderate"" confidence, a lab ""incident"" (not accident)!!

So this report fails to access any other possibilities leaving open a wide-range of possibilities INCLUDING an intentional ""incident"" of a genetically engineered virus. This report is a mastery of language written to disguise the full range of assessment probably contained in the classified portions of the report.  I am very familiar with this intelligence jargon having read and authored thousands of intelligence reports.

Most importantly, we closed our international border back in March 2020 and then several states closed their borders to the rest of the country. Since then each state has taken it upon itself to close their border to another state if necessary.

Each state can decide whether or not they do a lockdown, however support payments are mostly up to the federal government. This has at times been a source of tension between governments.

Australia originally pursued a suppression strategy but most states ended up achieving elimination without really aiming for it (during the national 6 week lockdown) and decided to keep pursuing that. NSW was the exception. Their approach of quelling outbreaks without shutting down the whole city or state sort of worked until Delta came along. 

Border closures and lockdowns have been a source of tension between states and between the stare and federal government's st times. The leaders (i.e. the Prime Minister, 6 state Premiers and 2 Chief Ministers - we have 6 states and 2 territories) meet at National Cabinet every Friday.

Our federal government and the NSW Government are run by the Liberal Party, which actually lean to the right side of politics and are based on neoliberalism (which is more about economic freedom than social freedom). The other states currently have a mix of Labor and Liberal Governments). The Liberal Party would be seen as moderate in the US though. It's actually centre right whereas Labor is centre left.

Our covid response was mostly been driven by the state premiers. Our PM is a complete tosser and is a Pentacostal Christian who only really cares about the economy. If it was all up to him then the economy would never have shut down and we'd be like other countries overseas (with tens of thousands of deaths).

You can't take either Cases, Hosptialisation or Deaths in isolation.  Cases are an early warning of Hospitalisations which are an early warning of deaths. There will never be a single metric, you can't use one over the other. e.g. If cases are high and the hospitalisations/deaths are low then the pandemic is over or cases are low and deaths are high then we have new deadlier variant etc.

If the case rate is 26x higher then vaccines need to reduce death by 26 times to keep us in the same place as last year. I don't think they are as effective as that. The death rate is 12x higher than this time last year, 26x more cases give 12x more deaths. A win for vaccines, but a terrible situation to be in?

Note:

Hospitalisations are worse now, per case, than 6 weeks ago.

&gt;other countries, outside Canada and Germany I think haven‚Äôt cut checks to their citizens during the pandemic

And I would wager that the citizens of Canada and Germany have more normal lives, safer lives, less politicization of the pandemic response, fewer deaths per capita, less preventable homelessness, better-paid teachers, more robust social services, wider vaccine adoption, and more day-to-day stability than the citizens of the United States. Cutting people checks isn‚Äôt a silver bullet, but to deny its viability in terms of promoting sedentary economic consumption as opposed to, I don‚Äôt know, **cutting state and federal unemployment to force people back to work during a worsening pandemic**, seems poor in comparison. 

&gt;Only like five countries have single-payer healthcare 

Right, and how are those countries‚Äô coronavirus responses and health outcomes compared to ours? How about their vaccine adoption rates? I know those Brits love their NHS and they have the vaccination numbers to prove it. 

We don‚Äôt even have a public option, which is what was campaigned on thirteen years ago before being reneged before the current administration campaigned on and then reneged on the same issue. Private systems cannot handle public catastrophes, and decentralized profit-seeking outfits and contractors cannot compete against a centralized federal system. 

&gt;reddit can‚Äôt grasp this for whatever reason, and it continues to annoy me as some who did healthcare research for a previous job.

You know what annoys me? Medical bankruptcy. You know, that weird phenomenon which is just not a thing in other countries like it is here. Other universal care countries like Germany with an opt-out option for wealthier citizens,, or other single-payer entities like the NHS - medical bankruptcy just isn‚Äôt the chronic problem it is here.

What you said about vaccinated people taking more risks vs those who've had it is just your guess. I can easily say that I believe otherwise, that those who've had covid, on average, probably don't take it as seriously while those who are vaccinated may be more aware of the risks associated and took steps to protect themselves. You see how opinions and guesses can just swing whichever way, right?


What the study shows is the overall trends of a sample population, in this case pretty large. If you choose to believe there are vastly different behaviors between vaccinated and natural immunity groups of people over a large population, I guess you can. I tend to take the neutral case, that over a large enough population, individual preferences and biases that swing whichever ways cancel out.

Andrew Lloyd Webber‚Äôs musical, ‚ÄúCinderella,‚Äù made its glittering debut in the West End after several Covid-related delays. On the subway, where masks are still mandatory, half the riders go barefaced.

&gt;All this at a time when Britain is reporting more than 30,000 new coronavirus cases a day, hospitals are coming under renewed strain, and preliminary data shows that the protection provided by vaccines ebbs several months after the second dose.

&gt;Such is the strange new phase of Britain‚Äôs pandemic: The public has moved on, even if the virus has not. Given that Britain has been at the vanguard of so many coronavirus developments ‚Äî from incubating variants to rolling out vaccines ‚Äî experts say this could be a glimpse into the future for other countries.

&gt;,We don‚Äôt seem to care that we have these really high infection rates,‚Äù said Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at King‚Äôs College London, who has been leading a major study on Covid-19 symptoms. ‚ÄúIt looks like we‚Äôre just accepting it now ‚Äî that this is the price of freedom.‚Äù

&gt;Some of that equanimity may stem from the fact that Britain‚Äôs case rate, while high, has not yet risen anywhere near the level that government officials predicted when they lifted virtually all Covid restrictions last month. Some may be because of the weaker link between cases and severe illness. And some of it may simply reflect fatigue, after 17 months of baleful headlines and stifling lockdowns.

&gt;‚ÄùThere‚Äôs a feeling that finally we can breathe; we can start trying to get back what we‚Äôve lost,‚Äù said Devi Sridhar, the head of the global public health program at the University of Edinburgh. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really difficult to ask people not to mix for a prolonged period, especially if there is no solution.‚Äù

&gt;With nearly 80 percent of the adult population fully vaccinated and the virus still circulating widely, Professor Sridhar said, Britain may be a model for other European countries and the United States of ‚Äúwhether you can manage Covid in a sustainable way.‚Äù The evidence, she added, was inconclusive because Britain still faces critical challenges, like the reopening of schools on Wednesday.",,,,1630191104,{},haqkuco,True,t3_pdjox5,False,False,t3_pdjox5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pdjox5/many_in_the_uk_are_flouting_pandemic_rules_even/haqkuco/,1630274454.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;The study, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal on Friday, is an analysis of more than 40,000 coronavirus infections in England. It adds to evidence suggesting that Delta may cause more severe illness than other variants do.

&gt;Fewer than 2 percent of the infections occurred in fully vaccinated people, and there was not enough data to draw firm conclusions about hospitalization risks in that group specifically, the researchers said.

&gt;‚ÄùThe main takeaway is that if you have an unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated population, then an outbreak of Delta can lead to a higher burden on hospitals, on health care, than an Alpha outbreak would,‚Äù said Anne Presanis, a senior statistician at the University of Cambridge and one of the study‚Äôs lead authors.

&gt;The Delta variant, which was first detected in India, is roughly twice as infectious as the original virus and as much as 60 percent more transmissible than the Alpha variant, which was first identified in Britain.

&gt;In the new study, researchers analyzed the health data of people who tested positive for the virus in England from March 29 to May 23, as Delta was spreading through the country. Seventy-four percent of people were unvaccinated, 24.2 percent were partly vaccinated, and 1.8 percent were fully vaccinated.

&gt;Genetic sequencing confirmed that 80 percent of the study participants had been infected with the Alpha variant, while 20 percent had been infected with Delta.

&gt;For both groups, the risk of hospitalization was small, the researchers found. Just 2.2 percent of people with Alpha and 2.3 percent of those with Delta were admitted to the hospital within two weeks of testing positive for the virus.

&gt;But people infected with the Delta variant were younger, on average. When the researchers adjusted for age and other factors that are known to affect disease severity, they found that when Delta caused the infection, the overall risk of being hospitalized was more than two times as high.

&gt;When the researchers broke down the data by vaccination status, they confirmed that Delta doubled the risk of hospitalization for those who were unvaccinated or had received their first dose less than three weeks earlier. The fully vaccinated group was too small to be rigorously analyzed on its own, the researchers said.

&gt;‚ÄùWe already know that vaccination offers excellent protection against Delta, and as this variant accounts for over 98 percent of Covid-19 cases in the U.K., it is vital that those who have not received two doses of vaccine do so as soon as possible,‚Äù Dr. Gavin Dabrera, a lead author of the paper and an epidemiologist at Public Health England, said in a statement.

Mutations in the spike protein can contribute to things like viral load, binding affinity to the target ACE2 receptor of the host cell, or spike protein ‚Äòactivation‚Äô prior to host cell entry. To provide some context to the last point, my understanding of the Delta variant is that it has several important mutations that together contribute to increased infectivity, one of which contributes to spike protein activation. How this works is that the virus takes advantage of a protease (enzyme that breaks down proteins) already present in our cells, called furin, which clips the S protein such that it becomes capable of entering the cell. This specific mutation is a proline at position 681 that is modified to an arginine (P681R) and dramatically increases host cell entry. This coupled with the Delta variant having orders of magnitude higher viral load (from 300-1000x over other variants) in addition to potentially other less known contributors and you can end up with something quite a bit more dangerous than the previous iterations all the while not having any direct effect on antibody recognition.",,,,1630247958,{},hat2ztt,False,t3_pduqve,False,True,t1_haswo0w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pduqve/new_covid_variant_detected_in_south_africa_most/hat2ztt/,1630320938.0,21,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know these seem like unfounded worries but based on what we've seen, it seems like a possibility. Lots of people thought the UK was approaching herd immunity last summer as lots of things were open and deaths were less than 10 a day. 

That illusion of immunity was dispelled in winter. I know there was the involvement of a new variant, which confounds things. But that will likely happen again. 

What if our vaccine immunity is like a 1m high flood barrier that prevents 100% of waves less than 1m. What happens when the waves get bigger than 1m.

These are just random thoughts and hopefully they have no basis in reality. 

Btw I don't want to start an argument, but there are actually things about winter, and cold conditions, which are favourable to these common viruses. A lot of people say the difference is just behavioural so I understand why you think that but that's not what the current scientific understanding is. 

It's thought that several different factors as well as behavioural are involved in seasonality.

One factor is vitamin d, the majority of Brits are deficient in winter. 

Another factor is the stability of droplets in the air which is dependent on temperature. Think how viruses spread on these droplets. On a hot day, they are not stable in the air and cannot travel far. On a cold day they can be much moreso. 

There are studies which say these viruses are more active with lower absolute (not relative) humidity. 

Cold air can hold less water than hot (hence why the water precipitates out as fog), meaning it has lower absolute humidity.

I had one question that maybe you can clarify: it is understood that the vaccine can help limit the effects and illness of hosts. No real debate here on that. But what do you mean when you say ‚Äúdeprive the virus hosts where it can mutate freely‚Äù? The vaccine doesn‚Äôt take away potential hosts from the virus, as there is no debate the vaccinated aren‚Äôt exactly protected from infection. The virus still infects hosts, taking over the hosts cells and replicates. Replications lead to mutations whether in a vaccinated person or in-vaccinated. So help me understand this better, my limited understanding is definitely not at your level. So, if it is assumed that vaccinated are less likely to be infected, say a 50% population reduction in infections, many of those infected will be asymptomatic and not know they are sick. They won‚Äôt be taking steps necessary to kill the virus, or socially distancing, diligent in wearing a mask, staying home, etc. This is advantageous for the virus as it allows for replications and mutations, the greater number of replications and mutations before the body fights it off completely allows for statistically better chances to create advantageous mutations that result in variants. Advantageous mutations are ones that allow the survival of the virus in the host, higher spread rate, higher replication rate (which RNA viruses are already good at), less symptoms for the host, etc. which is why most variants historically have been less viral and more contagious. Isn‚Äôt the vaccine actually pushing this process?

You're deliberately ignoring the point that WeedIronMoneyNTheUSA raised above and that I raised in my other response. Masks and vaccines are not 100% effective (far from it). Therefore, a masked, vaccinated person is not totally protected and his or her risk will also be affected by the vaccination status and mask-wearing of the people around him or her.

You seem to be casting this reality aside by pretending that ""effective"" is a binary quality and that when people claim that masks and vaccines are ""effective"", they mean that these measures totally prevent COVID-19 transmission. That's a straw-man argument because nobody is making that claim.

&gt; The issue with masking is that people who wear the masks have to NOT touch them after putting them on, or if they touch them they have to sanitize their hands before touching anything else.

[],,harryyplopper,,,[],,,,text,t2_65se9,False,False,[],"I‚Äôve given some serious thought to natural immunity and I don't think this provides an ""Anti-Vax"" argument at all and shouldn't be considered taboo. I believe that (1) there‚Äôs a pro-vax argument to be made by acknowledging it and (2) lack of acknowledgement makes the vaccine‚Äôs efficacy look like it wanes faster than reality. Based on the Israeli study, natural immunity appears better than vaccination but this is NOT an anti-vax argument like everyone says.

 

My rationale is that current efficacy stats compare unvaccinated to vaccinated, which has suggested that the vaccine is losing its efficacy (ie lower efficacy against the delta variant). However, if natural immunity really is as good or better than the vaccine, then the vaccine isn't LOSING effectiveness (or at least not as quickly as the numbers suggest), rather the proportion of unvaccinated becoming immune is RISING. The real measure of efficacy should thus compare (i) double vaxxed to (ii) non-immune (ie unvaxxed AND previously infected). Because the number of non-immune must logically be less than the number of unvaxxed, comparisons to unvaxxed alone can only understate the vaccine's effectiveness and understate the death rate to the unprotected.

 

For example, if 50% of the unvaxxed were previously infected, then (hypothetically) (i) a reported death rate of 1% for unvaxxed would mean a 2% for non-immune (ii) a 80% vaccine efficacy relative to unvaxxed would mean 90% efficacy against non-immune.

 

This has several implications:

(1) failure to acknowledge the effectiveness of natural immunity means that danger to the unprotected is UNDERSTATED. If you are unvaxxed and not immune then the virus is MORE DANGEROUS than the stats suggest, meaning that people may feel falsely secure by not getting vaccinated. I'll bet that the majority in the hospital are both unvaxxed and non-immune

(2) failure to acknowledge the effectiveness of natural immunity makes comparisons between vaxxed and unvaxxed underplay the vaccine's efficacy, because the vaccine is actually more effective against NON-IMMUNITY. 

(3) It‚Äôs possible that the vaccine‚Äôs waning efficacy is overstated

(4) failure to acknowledge the effectiveness of natural immunity will erode public trust, converting more people into conspiracy theorists because they feel they're being lied to

(5) I optimistically predict that the vaccine protection against the delta variant is closer to the prior variants than the official numbers suggest

I have sensed that government agencies and the media are extremely reluctant to acknowledge this out of fear of causing vaccine hesitancy, however I believe that is a mistake for the reasons outlined above. Also, anecdotally, I shared that Israeli study with a couple of friends and they got FURIOUS, accusing me (a double vaxxed individual) of being an anti-vaxxer. This is leading me to believe that life-and-death public health decisions are being made based on emotion (fear and hatred) rather than facts, statistics and logic; for obvious reasons I find that horrifying.",,,,1630251556,{},hatbaqk,True,t3_pdxi1g,False,True,t3_pdxi1g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pdxi1g/natural_immunity_from_covid_infection_is_stronger/hatbaqk/,1630325590.0,-4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

- some form of a herd immunity (50% adults vaxxed + 20-40% additional post-infection)

- less connections with jnternational destinations (compared to UK, France, Germany) - so Delta takes more time to arrive

- we opened up vaccinations to all groups very early on, whereas UK and some other countries took more time because they wanted to vaccinate senior citizens fully. So in July we robably already had herd immunity in the groups that were the most likely to spread the virus, whereas UK and a bunch of other countries had almost none.


The weirdest thing for me is that south-east regions of Poland have almost no vaccinations (10%), because people don‚Äôt care. They don‚Äôt wear masks, and don‚Äôt care about restrictions much. They didn‚Äôt have serious waves either - so no herd immunity at all. And yet they don‚Äôt have an explosion in cases.

One thing is that, with vaccines, there is pressure for the virus to become vaccine resistant. But in order to do this, it has to pretty drastically change its layout, notably how it attaches to ACE2 receptors. We will eventually hit a point (and we might be there already) where the virus mutates to sacrifice lethality/transmissibility in order to evade vaccines more effectively.

A bit more digging indicates that many journals will often publish pre-prints, which I always thought was a no-no. 

I'm unclear on whether that means that this can still be considered a pre-print or not (the article that I originally posted did not contain any mention of it's status).

Why is that, though? Well, the longer it takes to train a medical professional, the more time they have to spend in the American for-profit education system.

And the American Medical Association - do they have anything to do with wanting to keep the number of practicing physicians artificially low by making the barrier to entry artificially high? Let‚Äôs check this [article from 2008 in which they apologized to Black physicians](https://www.propublica.org/article/exploring-the-amas-history-of-discrimination-716):

&gt; in 1910, the American Medical Association commissioned a report of all medical schools. They were very interested in lowering the number of physicians. They wanted to raise the professional stature of physicians, and they wanted to do that by exclusion. They commissioned Abraham Flexner to go to every medical school in the U.S. and Canada and make an assessment -- basically which medical schools should and should not be encouraged to continue. When Flexner did this, he deemed every black medical school substandard and recommended they all be closed, except for two, Howard and Meharry.

Yeah well, that sounds bad. But it was 100 years ago! Plus, what does that have to say about socialism? From the same article:

&gt;during the civil rights era, things came to a head. We were seeing open warfare between black and white physicians. Black physicians picketed AMA meetings. Black physicians pushed legislation that AMA doctors were visiting Congress trying to get annulled. Black physicians wanted Medicare and Medicaid passed. **But white physicians and the AMA, in particular, were damning it as ""socialized medicine.""**

The foundations and history of the medical profession in the United States are fraught with both racist capitalism and anti-socialism because the two go hand-in-hand. It is impossible to say that capitalism has anything but a primary role in dictating the misery and unhealthiness of our population. Health insurance is a benefit, not a right. You can go all the way back to FDR to see how titans of industry wanted to make sure nothing along the lines of a nationalized health care system developed.
