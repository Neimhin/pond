[],,Taellion,,,[],,,,text,t2_ip71i,False,False,[],"But IFR is not a fixed and universal number, and this is the IFR for New York City at that particular period.

IFR can change depending on demographic, location, wealth of the country/people, hygiene, prevalence of mask, access to early testing, treatment, sex, time, underlying condition etc. 

Let's look at two real world example, the IFR for COVID 19 in Singapore is about 0.05%, which is much lower than the flu. While Italy's IFR is about 4.5%. 

The reason of this is huge difference is because the virus that hit Singapore was a [milder strain](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/singapore-researchers-discover-new-covid-19-variant-which-causes-milder-infections), the [virus hit a generally young and active group (construction workers), they had experience dealing with another coronavirus outbreak (SARS), had early access to testing](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-singapore-explainer-idUSKBN2680TF) and we know [Vitamin D deficiency plays a part in increasing complications](https://www.nutraingredients.com/Article/2020/10/01/COVID-19-Scientists-raise-the-vitamin-D-alarm). Which in a tropical country like Singapore, which is basically summer all year round, vitamin D deficiency is an unlikely condition.

Compared to Italy, which the virus hit an [older demographic](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1105061/coronavirus-deaths-by-region-in-italy/), and probably [some suffering from Vitamin D deficiency](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507121353.htm) due being further from the equator, and we need to remember in the first wave, hospitals in Northern Italy were overwhelmed, forcing medical professionals to [ration care and ICU treatments](https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/2020/3/31/21199721/coronavirus-covid-19-hospitals-triage-rationing-italy-new-york), further driving the IFR up. 

While IFR does give us some picture how deadly a disease is, is not an accurate picture especially if you don't take it with context, especially during an [ongoing outbreak of a novel disease](https://youtu.be/2qdd7kirwIk).

For example, in the case of SARS, the [IFR for it in South Africa is 100%](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome), which means it was more deadly than ebola (50% ~), smallpox (30% ~), nipah virus (40 to 75%) and hendravirus (57% ~). 

But wait that doesn't sound right, right? The reason is because the only infected person in their country with disease died.

Without knowing which studies you are referring to or how did they get their numbers, whose to say that is not the IFR of Taiwan or South Korea, or they scale the population of those countries to balance it out with countries like USA and Brazil?",,,1604456044,{},gb2lgdi,False,t3_jnkdxl,False,False,t1_gb2ehl0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jnkdxl/covid19_is_10_times_deadlier_than_flu_and_20/gb2lgdi/,1604462592,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1604461414.0,,

Communications

• Ensure that changes between Stages are announced at least two (2) business days before enactment to give business operators time to prepare.

• Promote messaging that the three Cs (crowded places; close-contact settings, especially where people have close-range conversations; and confined/enclosed spaces with poor ventilation) highlight where risk of transmission of COVID-19 is highest and what should be avoided.

• Discontinue messaging on “social circles” and “bubbles”. The communications of keeping close contact to people in our households plus 1 to 2 people who provide essential social support should be used instead, to ensure consistency and so that everyone understands the central importance of keeping the number of close contacts small to minimize the chance of exposure to COVID-19.

• Increase awareness throughout the province about when individuals should wear masks and how to wear masks properly (over the nose and mouth).

• Increase provincial education regarding 2-metre distancing, hand hygiene and isolating when symptomatic.

• Encourage workplaces to continue supporting employees to work from home or transition employees to work from home to decrease community transmission where possible.

Masks

• Require mask use indoors at all times and in all settings and outdoors when physical distancing is a challenge when interacting with those outside of the household.

• In addition to cohorting and protective barriers, and regardless of 2-metre distancing, masks must be worn whenever individuals are interacting or sharing a space with coworkers, at all times in all work settings indoors and even outdoors when physical distancing is a challenge).

• Provide official provincial guidance regarding the construction of cloth masks (materials and design). Currently the public is not adequately protected from mask that are poorly constructed, especially those with poor filterability, breathability, and fit.

Restaurants, bars and nightclubs and event spaces

• Align criteria for indoor gathering limits no matter the venue (restaurants, conference centres, meeting and event spaces) to require that there is always enough space between patrons from different parties.

• Require patrons wear a mask when interacting with a server or any staff and when leaving their table and when not in the process of eating or drinking.

• Encourage hand sanitizer be made available at each table to facilitate hand hygiene before and after handling one’s mask.

• Continue with current regulations: No person shall dance, sing or perform music at the establishment except where stated in ONTARIO REGULATION 364/20.

• Encourage businesses to provide safer spaces for staff breaks and ask staff to not socialize in workplaces beyond work hours without precautions.

• Ensure venues are open long enough to avoid promoting gathering in less-controlled spaces.

Gyms and fitness centres

• Require a minimum physical distance of (2m) during activities.

• Require masking in all gym and fitness centres at all times for staff and patrons.

Team sports

• For team sports, continue to support that no scrimmages or games take place.

• Limit access to locker rooms, clubhouses, and other amenities to washrooms, emergency aid and equipment management.

• Limit pre/post group activity and gatherings (carpooling, team meals, in parking lots etc.), and encourage mask use whenever possible during play (use should always be mandatory outside of play or practice).

• Prohibit coaching and training staff from rotating across various teams or cohorts of players and enable a larger number of people on the ice to facilitate cohorting with one group of coach and training staff.

Personal Service Settings (PSS)

• Require businesses to operate by appointment only and record each patron’s name and contact information.

• Require that staff wear medical grade masks and face shields.

Measures (such as regular masking, proper distancing, hand hygiene, and minimizing social contacts) require hard work and personal sacrifice. They are the small price we must all pay in order to prevent COVID-19 transmission and maintain and improve economic activity to avoid further harms caused from unemployment and increasing mental distress. I believe the people of Ottawa can learn to coexist with COVID, with care.

The current harms to health arising from societal disruption are significant and the measures to limit COVID-19 transmission in Ottawa must be sustainable and balanced following the end of the modified stage 2 restrictions implemented by the province on October 10, 2020. The approach I am recommending is that we learn to coexist with COVID, with care.

The goals of the response to the pandemic continue to be to minimize hospitalizations and death, as well as societal disruption. The rate of people testing positive for COVID-19 and the viral load measured in our wastewater started to stabilize during the second half of October. This suggests that the efforts of the people of Ottawa to keep distanced from people outside their households, wear masks indoors and also outdoors when proper distancing is not possible, keep their hands clean and stay home when they are sick are making a difference. The modified stage 2 closures reduced the incidence of close contacts in higher risk settings and supported declining levels of virus in the community. Going forward, the emphasis must remain on the importance of individuals doing their part with businesses reopening.

The rationale for continuing measures to limit COVID-19 transmission includes: the per cent of people testing positive for COVID-19 has not declined and is still sitting at 2.7%, with some areas of the city with even higher rates; the number of outbreaks remains high, leading to hospitalizations and deaths; and the potential for rapid virus spread remains if we let our guard down and become complacent, given the ongoing widespread incidence of the virus and the lack of any significant population immunity.

The rationale to adjust measures to enable businesses to open or ramp up their operations includes some signs that the majority of people in Ottawa are and will do their part to limit COVID-19 transmission as asked when the situation is serious; negative impacts on the health of the population from the unemployment and closure of businesses resulting from the pandemic; and peoples’ need to have supports that will help them live with COVID-19 through the winter and for the foreseeable future at a time when reported mental health challenges are high and there is no end in sight for the pandemic.

Little evidence exists to determine the right balance between COVID-19 control measures and supporting economic activity to keep people employed and mitigate mental health and other harms, though Ottawa Public Health (OPH) monitors situations and practices world-wide. Data collected during our case and contact management processes recently indicates that we have some significant blind spots occurring in situations not covered by provincial or municipal regulations. We continue to see problem areas such as the public gathering with extended family and larger friend circles, as well as socializing before or after playing a team sport, or travelling to or from a sports practice without wearing a mask. Similarly, school return has added transmission pressure particularly in relation to socializing on the way to and from school and other activities ancillary to school. We also see that transmission can occur in bars, restaurants and during physical activity in enclosed spaces without mask use.

Transmission of COVID-19 will occur in any setting if given the opportunity. A large part of the solution to managing these risks lies with modifying our behaviours. The risk is higher wherever people are less than two metres apart from each other and not wearing masks. Within closed spaces, even these measures will not prevent all COVID-19 transmission. People are gathering in closed spaces, in close contact without masks across our community, including at home with non-household members.

In discussions with members of our community, we have received feedback on the specific behaviours that residents of Ottawa feel are putting the community at higher risk of resurgence. On the Engage Ottawa platform – an online portal to engage with residents – people reported that dining indoors; attending indoor events with a maximum of 50 people; going to a bar or nightclub; and attending an indoor party or gathering at a friend’s home were of particular concern. There are examples and reports of larger gatherings in private settings where no COVID-19 control measures were in place. Thus, another rationale for opening businesses is as a harm reduction approach, to minimize private or underground gatherings of higher risk where there is not oversight and, too often, no COVID-19 mitigation controls in place to minimize transmission.

Ottawa Public Health has collected input to inform recommendations about COVID-19 control measures from stakeholders, including populations at higher risk (such as long-term care home stakeholders, newcomers and racialized communities), hospitals, business associations, industry leaders, other city departments, and members of the public by email, petition and on social media.

Work with community partners to better identify and address needs of racialized and low-income communities is critical and is progressing. I am thankful for the many partners, including the city, engaged in this work.

I have looked at the levels of unemployment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic response, indicators of the mental health of our community, and the challenges arising from a backlog in surgical and medical procedures and I am concluding that more needs to be done to enable people to return to more of the usual supports and services in their lives.

Similar to how schools are able to be open with precautions in place, businesses should be able to open with precautions in place. People should be able to learn to live with COVID-19, with caution.",,,1604454421,{},gb2il0c,True,t3_jnnqfl,False,True,t3_jnnqfl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jnnqfl/despite_having_record_case_counts_ontarios_public/gb2il0c/,1604461023,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Did this have any effect at all on mortality? We have no idea.  IFR did drop substantially over the summer,  according to the UK ons's surveillance testing.  But it's since doubled again,  so it might just have been seasonal or simply due to fewer nursing home infections.  It is now back up near 1% (the serosurveys from the UK in spring would put it around 1.2% then, and 0.4% from summer surveillance testing).

Frankly,  I'm just in the habit of prefacing any claim of IFR near 1% with a disclaimer to avoid having to argue.  I see no reason to believe less than 1% of our population will not be dead by spring.  The central problem with all IFR estimates isn't that they assume a given set of age demographics,  it's that they assume medical care will be available.  But it is absolutely guaranteed most of the population will not have any medical care if the disease progresses through natural herd immunity in areas with a high portion of elderly people.

Unfortunately it flies in the face of the WHO's best estimates

**WHO official says they estimate 10% of the world's population have been infected with covid.**

The head of emergencies at the World Health Organization said Monday (Oct.5) the agency’s “best estimates” indicate roughly 1 in 10 people worldwide may have been infected by the coronavirus

https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-who-official-says-coronavirus-may-have-infected-10-of-people/?fbclid=IwAR0Fv2KSgN2KgHhzCQK25CX4EHtrpyOe_I2aatej3PDngwEngnh-lWoVqbo

Global population = 7.8 billion

10% of 7.8 billion = 780 million

Total number of deaths attributed to covid = 1.2 million

1.2 million = 0.15% of 780 million

Covid has an IFR (infection fatality rate) of 0.15%...probably even less.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci the seasonal flu has a ""mortality rate"" of 0.1%

“The flu has a mortality rate of 0.1 percent. This has a mortality rate of 10 times that. That’s the reason I want to emphasize we have to stay ahead of the game in preventing this,” he added.

Idk how to do that thing which makes a square with texts,  but I will pop out the detail.

*To understand seroprevalence dynamics, we conducted a retrospective, repeated cross-sectional analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies in weekly intervals from the beginning of February to July 2020 using more than 10,000 plasma samples from patients at Mount Sinai Hospital in NYC. Here we show the dynamics of seroprevalence in an ‘urgent care’ (UC) group, enriched for COVID-19 cases during the epidemic, and a ‘routine care’ group (RC), which more closely represents the general population. Seroprevalence increased at different rates in both groups, with seropositive samples as early as mid-February, and levelled out at slightly above 20% in both groups after the epidemic wave subsided by the end of May. *

This just got published before editing. Nothing in the article says 20% of new Yorkers are or were infected.  Of the 10,000+ plasma samples, sure. Unless I'm not reading it right.

Imagine testing a population of 1000 patients. 

In the first scenario, we'll say **50%** of the population has the condition. With 98.5% sensitivity and 94.2% specificity we might get:

* 492 true positives
* 471 true negatives
* 8 false negatives
* 29 false positives

Overall, we have 521 positive results, of which 492 are genuine. So, if you get a positive result, you can be 492/521 = 94.4% sure you have the condition. This is called the positive predictive value. Similarly, if you get a negative result, you can be 98.3% sure you don't have the condition. This is the negative predictive value.

In the second scenario, we'll say 1% of the population has the condition. Now, we get:

* 10 true positives
* 933 true negatives
* 0 false negatives
* 57 false positives

In this scenario, there are more false positives than true positives, simply because there are way more people who don't have the condition than who do have it. The positive predictive value is only 14.9%, although the negative predictive value is (experimentally) 100%.

If 99% of the population has the condition, then this would be reversed, and we'd get high positive predictive value, and low negative predictive value.

Since covid (currently) has low prevalence, this test would not be able to confirm cases due to low positive predictive value. However, its convenience and high negative predictive value may make it useful for screening.",,,1604480178,{},gb3ldog,False,t3_jnmbbc,False,True,t1_gb3elxv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jnmbbc/mit_teams_cough_detector_identifies_97_of_covid19/gb3ldog/,1604480519,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

&gt;School closures can affect children in many ways  
&gt;  
&gt;School absence affects equity, education, child health and development USEFUL RESOURCES  
&gt;  
&gt;• Disruption to instructional time can affect a child’s ability to learn. The longer marginalized children are out of school, the less likely they are to return UNITED NATIONS  
&gt;  
&gt;• Closures disrupt school-based services such as immunization, school meals, mental health and psychosocial support, and can cause anxiety due to loss of peer interaction and disrupted routines  
&gt;  
&gt;• Being out of school increases the risk of teenage pregnancy, sexual exploitation, child marriage, violence and other threats  
&gt;  
&gt;• Harms are greater for children of migrants, refugees, minorities; children living with disabilities; and children in institutions or in countries affected by conflict More than 1.5 billion students were affected by school closures worldwide   
&gt;  
&gt;Ø Many schools are unable to offer remote education or alternate strategies

That is short term thinking, but it is excused by the hopes of a vaccine. A vaccine would significantly lower R, maybe low enough for simple masks and 2meters to be enough for eventual eradication.

But assuming that vaccines doesnt come this year (lets say that the last phase suddenly finds a lethal side effect. Attempt at eradication is reasonable, but nearly impossible, we would have to keep lockdowns until every country has eradicated, my native country - Latvia managed it, New Zeland did so too, but if all of europe and Asia would have to eait until Trump got his shit together and stopped spewing nonsense? Yeah, China and Russia will not be okay with this. And all the countries doing well? We would have to ask those countries to sacrifice their economies for a few hundred deaths.

So while waiting until vaccines are widespread, we should try keeping it low, but killing people with lockdowns is not worth it.

If we R is currently between 1.1 and 1.4 ir Europe (heard this number somewhere around 2 weeks ago) a 50% effective vaccine for 50% of the population would reduce R to 0.825 to 1.05. Basically eradicating it with current methods.

Our next step is to tell them that we hold them responsible if we do get sick and we had to send them to school in the middle of so many cases.

But since everyone is so divided, the numbers are still rising, and more and more people get sick at the school, we figured we will hold off as long as we can.

I understand that everyone's situation is different. 

We have time and resources to educate them, and they're too young to miss anything super important. The biggest reason they gave were the lack of social skills, and I thought ""you need to come over and see how much energy we put in them, and why this isn't a problem""

The last time school closed for three weeks, we received online education, and we decided to do the things that level higher kids did, and we went thru it all like it was child's play.

They all hate to go to school, and leave their best friends behind, their brothers and sisters.

That would provide reasonable data about how deadly the virus really is.

On the other hand in france they have been pointing out there might be 100k daily cases. I think numbers are not realistic also in other countries, they did not give figures but I think also the italian authorities believe the new cases are undercounted.

[],,Brilliant-Point,,,[],,,,text,t2_5w19z2as,False,False,[],"&gt; Background: Close contact with children may provide cross-reactive immunity to SARs-CoV-2 due to more frequent prior coryzal infections from seasonal coronaviruses. Alternatively, close contact with children may increase risk of SARs-CoV-2 infection. We investigated whether risk of infection with SARs-CoV-2 and severe outcomes differed between adults living with and without children.

&gt;Methods: Working on behalf of NHS England, we conducted a population-based cohort study using primary care data and pseudonymously-linked hospital and intensive care admissions, and death records, from patients registered in general practices representing 40% of England. Using multivariable Cox regression, we calculated fully-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of outcomes from 1st February-3rd August 2020 comparing adults living with and without children in the household.

&gt;Findings: Among 9,157,814 adults ≤65 years, living with children 0-11 years was not associated with increased risks of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related hospital or ICU admission but was associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 death (HR 0.75, 95%CI 0.62-0.92). Living with children aged 12-18 years was associated with a small increased risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.03-1.13), but not associated with other COVID-19 outcomes. Living with children of any age was also associated with lower risk of dying from non-COVID-19 causes. Among 2,567,671 adults &gt;65 years there was no association between living with children and outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2. We observed no consistent changes in risk following school closure.

&gt;Interpretation: For adults living with children there is no evidence of an increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. These findings have implications for determining the benefit-harm balance of children attending school in the COVID-19 pandemic.

&gt; The situation regarding corona infection among mink has now developed to a critical stage in North Jutland.

&gt; According to B.T.'s information, a mutated coronavirus migrated from mink to humans and has since spread strongly among the citizens of Vensyssel in North Jutland.

&gt; On Tuesday, the government received a note from the Statens Serum Institut, which has exposed the mutated coronavirus to antibodies. The result, according to SSI, was deeply troubling because the mutated coronavirus did not respond well to the antibodies.

&gt; Thus, there is a risk that a possible vaccine against covid-19 will not have the desired effect if the mutated virus from mink spreads further among humans.

&gt; That is why Mette Frederiksen has convened a press conference on Wednesday at 4 pm, where she herself will participate virtually.

&gt; B.T. learns that there are new restrictions for humans on the way in northern Jutland to stop the spread of the coronavirus from mink.

Why was staffing not discussed as an ""issue"" during the first wave?  There were much higher numbers and higher hospitalizations but there was no talk of hospitals ""running out of staff"".

Now here we are 7 months later with the benifit of hindsight. We have had 7 months to prepare. And now instead of having our ""numbers"" concentrated in a few cities, they are much more spread out.

But somehow we are running out of staff *right at the beginning* of this?

Seems odd, right?

But ... as we have been told, we shouldnt expect to see hospitalization numbers going up.  No no no.  If we hear that there is a terrible outbreak in a city, we might actually see *plenty of empty hospital beds* in the statistics now!

But we shouldnt allow ourselves to be fooled!

Because it is only the ""staff shortage"", which we cannot see or gain any insight into, that is causing those empty beds.

Thirty-four deaths (1.5 per 1,000 cases) were reported among 23,434 symptomatic pregnant women, and 447 (1.2 per 1,000 cases) were reported among 386,028 nonpregnant women, reflecting a 70% increased risk for death associated with pregnancy (aRR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.2–2.4). ”

What does it mean that 116 more cases of asymptomatic infections have been detected in Xinjiang? Two points of clarification.

On the evening of November 3, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Government Information Office held an eighth press conference to report on the prevention and control of the latest new coronary pneumonia epidemic in Shufu and Aktau counties.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

　　The meeting reported that on November 2, 24:00 to 3, 20:30, two new confirmed cases in Kashgar region, both asymptomatic infected referred to confirmed; new asymptomatic infected 116 cases, all from receiving isolation medical observation personnel, all associated with Shufu County Station Min Township.

&amp;#x200B;

　　Why are there so many new asymptomatic infections in one day?

&amp;#x200B;

　　Three rounds of full nucleic acid testing in 11 days.

&amp;#x200B;

　　The high number of new asymptomatic infections is first associated with intensive full-team nucleic acid testing. From Oct. 24 to Nov. 3, Xinjiang's Kashgar region has completed three rounds of full-team nucleic acid testing in 11 days, which can be described as a veritable ""due diligence"".

&amp;#x200B;

　　In the first round of nucleic acid testing, 183 positive cases were detected.

&amp;#x200B;

　　On October 24, Xinjiang Kashgar region Shufu County to ""should be checked and checked"" personnel in regular testing, found a case of new coronary pneumonia asymptomatic infection. Nucleic acid testing of all staff began that night. As of October 27, Kashgar region completed the first round of nucleic acid testing of all staff, except for 183 people in Shufu County, all negative.

&amp;#x200B;

　　Of the 183 positives from the first round of nucleic acid testing in the Kashgar region, 137 asymptomatic infections from Shufu County were all associated with the first asymptomatic infections at the Three Village factory where the parents of the asymptomatic infections were located (reported on the 25th); there were also 26 asymptomatic infections, all of which were close contacts of the 25-day asymptomatic infections; and on October 27, there were five confirmed cases of referral from asymptomatic infections.

&amp;#x200B;

　　Second round of nucleic acid testing, another positive test in one place

&amp;#x200B;

　　A second round of full nucleic acid testing has been carried out in Kashgar since October 29. As of October 31, the second round of nucleic acid testing is complete, there have been 51 confirmed cases (all asymptomatic infections referred), 222 asymptomatic infections, all from Shufu County and Aktau County.

&amp;#x200B;

　　It is noteworthy that it was on October 31 that 15 cases of asymptomatic infections were also detected in Aktau County of Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture, which is adjacent to Shufu County in the Kashgar region, in addition to Shufu County.

&amp;#x200B;

　　Third round of nucleic acid testing, completed in three days

&amp;#x200B;

　　On the evening of November 1, the third round of full nucleic acid testing was launched in Kashgar. On that day, three new cases of new coronary pneumonia confirmed (two of which were asymptomatic infections referred) and six new cases of asymptomatic infections were reported; on November 2, 13 new cases of asymptomatic infections were reported.

&amp;#x200B;

　　On November 3, the third round of full nucleic acid testing was completed, and all but 116 people were found to be positive that day, all of whom were negative, and all of whom were associated with sparsely populated Station Min Township.

&amp;#x200B;

　　As of 20:30 on November 3, there were 64 confirmed cases and 330 asymptomatic infections in Kashgar. Together with the 15 existing asymptomatic infections in Kashgar, Xinjiang now has 64 confirmed cases and 345 asymptomatic infections.

&amp;#x200B;

　　In other words, three rounds of full nucleic acid testing down in 11 days, a total of 409 positive cases were detected. It is reported that on November 4, Kashgar region will carry out another fourth round of full nucleic acid testing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

　　Incubation period of the new coronavirus varies

&amp;#x200B;

　　In addition to intensive testing, the pattern of transmission of the new coronavirus itself is the reason for the large number of asymptomatic infections.

&amp;#x200B;

　　According to the relevant person in charge of the CDC in Kashgar, the incubation period of neo-crown pneumonia is 1 to 14 days, with a common incubation period of 3 to 7 days, which means that about 90% of people will test positive for nucleic acid in the third to seventh day after infection with the virus, while others will have less than 3 days and some more than 7 days.

&amp;#x200B;

　　In addition, because of the time of exposure to the infectious agent varies from person to person, as well as individual differences, the time for the nucleic acid to turn positive varies widely, but is still within the incubation period. Nucleic acid testing is the ""gold standard"" for confirming infection in asymptomatic individuals who have no apparent clinical symptoms during the incubation period.

&amp;#x200B;

　　Since there is a time lag between infection and detection of the virus, if the previous nucleic acid sample falls within this time interval, it may not be detected. Therefore, there is a need to increase the intensity and frequency of nucleic acid testing. Intensive nucleic acid testing, can in the shortest time accurate identification screening out the still latent infected, not only for early treatment, early recovery time, but also to prevent the spread of the epidemic.

&amp;#x200B;

　　It is noteworthy that at present, the asymptomatic infected persons reported in Shufu County and Kashgar County in Xinjiang are screened and found among persons under isolated medical observation.

&amp;#x200B;

　　The large number of asymptomatic infected persons found among the centralized isolated observers under intensive all-staff testing shows that prevention and control are ahead of the epidemic's development.",,,1604477013,{},gb3hxs0,False,t3_jnmq0y,False,True,t1_gb3a5vl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jnmq0y/china_update_on_covid19_pandemic_situation_as_of/gb3hxs0/,1604478912,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

This man did a literary review of case mortality rate and found 0.23% to be on the high side. 

Influenza has a yearly estimated case mortality rate of 0.13% - ish if I am allowed to go by these numbers posted by the CDC.

I'd love to be proven wrong, but honestly, a peer-reviewed research by the WHO?

In the paper, that was not peer reviewed, he suggested that the current IFR has decreased due to better medical care, and the IFR is somewhere between 0% and 1.2%, he gives a very low average of 0.2% to 0.3%.

John is a skeptic of lockdowns and has disappointed colleagues with his over optimistic projections. For example, in March he predicted in a paper based on the Diamond Princess, as few as 10,000 deaths in the US, and in an interview with Journeyman pictures, he said that the outbreak would have gone unnoticed this year except there's a test that can detect the virus. One of his interviews was removed from YouTube for his inaccurate claims. 

He was also the author of the deeply flawed Santa Clara antibody study that claimed that the IFR of the virus was hardly worse that flu, 0.12% to 0.2% (more people in New York City have died than the upper estimate). The study used an test that was not licensed or accurate enough for the few positives they claim they found (they could be all false positives). It was also was not a random sample. They advertised for participants and paid them in shopping vouchers. Indeed, the wife of one of the authors emailed her school advertising the test, at time when RT-PCR tests were rationed, telling people that they could find out if they had the virus and were now immune. 

I saw the advert here on Reddit, and some of those who took the test told me that got tested as they wanted to find out if their illness was due to COVID-19, obviously biasing the result. 

And two authors on the paper wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journals the day the paper was published talking about the study, claiming that it showed the virus was much less lethal than feared and lockdowns weren't necessary. They did not disclose their connection to the study (the article was updated with that information later on). 

Furthermore, the source of the funding for the study wasn't initially disclosed, but it was later discovered that a lot of the funding came from the owner of Jetblue airlines, David Neeleman.

Finally, a corrected paper was published at the end of April, and buried in the statistics was an admission that the number of positive results could have been Zero. And even if not, the selection bias remains.

All on all, it's been very sad to see John Ioannidis, one of the World's top epidemiology experts, play down the seriousness of the pandemic and cosy up with people who have economic interests in portraying the virus as relatively harmless.

* 29 Dec: Hunan wet market linked to novel pneumonia 29 Dec

* 1 Jan: WHO and other countries notified
* 6 Jan (known later): health care workers infected conducting surgery
* 11 Jan: first novel coronavirus death
* 16 Jan: only those without fever permitted to exit Wuhan
* 23 Jan: total lockdown of Wuhan

Basically three weeks between cluster identification and more effective public health responses started. It might have been possible for the novel pneumonia cluster to be identified up to a week before 29 Dec, if they were looking for one. But in the real world, with a few patients scattered across multiple hospitals, perfect responses don't happen. 12 days between the first death and total lockdown of a city isn't bad, in the real world. See how lethargic Western responses have mostly been.

Unfortunately, the lunar new year holiday was celebrated on 17 Jan, and many returned from Wuhan to other cities, passing the fever check, between then and 23 Jan.

It is always good report the absolute risk of various exposure vectors and rank their probability. I think it is unethical and irresponsible to say that any potential vector is not important because there are so many more likely ones. Depending on your specific lifestyle and mitigations, some item on that list is going to be the ""most risky"" for you. 

You may not do the 1st, 2rd, and 5th items on the list of possible threats; making the 3rd listed *your* biggest risk--even if 50% of the population/community is most at risk because they do both the first and second routinely. 

If you are going out into public all the time, drinking, going to gyms, restaurants, not wearing masks, etc... having kids in school does not increase the risk that much, as any one person bringing it into the home (probably from one of these higher risk vectors) is likely to infect others.

If you are **not** doing any of those things, working from home, doing distanced deliveries, not visiting family, etc. starting to sending a child to school *may* *become* the highest risk activity in your household. A house that has mitigated every factor and thinks sending kids to school is safe, or is forced by the local government, *is* increasing the risk to themselves, their child, and their household.

In my case; if I get COVID, the most possible vector for all of my mitigations would be physical contact with items that are delivered (particularly the few grocery items that have to be decontaminated with isopropanol and taken inside that can't sit in my garage for 3-5 days.) This is a lower risk activity compared to many others; but it is the *only possible* exposure activity given my lifestyle and mitigations. I have the months of security footage to prove it is the only possible vector. I am not the typical study participant, but the risks to a typical study participant is not representative of my lifestyle or mitigation strategies.

Just because most households are getting infected some other way sooner, does not mean that children cannot bring COVID into the home, and then spread it to others (and then on into the community or to at-risk housemates.) Children can and do get COVID and can and do spread COVID, often with fewer symptoms and less testing (some parents intentionally withholding testing to avoid forced quarantines/school closures). Some children become seriously ill and die. Some will be exposed at school. More will be exposed by their parents activities--essential or nonsensical (but risky).

Similarly having unprotected vaginal intercourse (especially for men) is lower risk for HIV transmission than sharing IV drug use or anal sex; but if you are not doing those other higher risk activities, that *is* the highest risk for some individuals. That lower-frequency vector is ultimately what does cause some individuals to become infected and to infect others.",,,1604485731,{},gb3qw1y,False,t3_jntmdw,False,True,t3_jntmdw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jntmdw/coronavirus_living_with_children_no_increased_risk/gb3qw1y/,1604485742,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

They can't be this dumb, can they? Please say it isn't so.

You aim for eradication, i.e. a robust R&lt;&lt;1, via continuously improving TTI, hygiene measures and contact restrictions.
With better tests and perhaps even vaccines, you can replace some of these measures.

If you don't do robust, you'll get a Covid rollercoaster wrecking society.
If you don't do R&lt;&lt;1, you get lockdown after lockdown.
If you do R=1 like Germany in the summer, you'll get a lockdown in the autumn. Watch Korea. They'll get wrecked sooner or later.

You simply can't control a system with high uncertainty, latency and a degree of unpredictability like they wan't to do.

* There is a correction of old death reported on 12/7 (-1) so today the number of new deaths reported is actually +29. These include 3 (for a total of 13 currently) without specified date. Of the rest 26, all are added recently - 21/10 - 3/11. 
* As of todays report there is once again a double-digit deaths on a single day, reported for 26/10 (currently 10 death reports). The last time the deaths on a day were double digit was 18/7, three and a half months ago.
* The newly reported deaths are distributed per region as follows: +1 in Dalarna, Östergötland and Jöngköping;  +2 in Kronoberg, Västra Götaland, Örebro and Västerbotten; +7 in Skåne; +10 in Stockholm; Per age group they are +1 in 20-29, +2 in 50-59, +1 in 60-69, +4 in 70-79, +8 in 80-89 and +12 in 90+. 
* &amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Please, remember there is lag in reporting and deaths reported on a certain day are usually mostly deaths that happened on previous days. On average it takes up to 11 days to report 90% of the deaths for a certain day (see in the links graphs about how that looks)**

Several in my family also showed symptoms around that time.

Especially in 3rd world counties, I question how we would expect to ever know with as much certainty as people seem to express.

How long did Chinese doctors just think it was just a normal pneumonia presenting in older patients before they finally decided there was something going on? How long before enough doctors saw it that one of them decided to get genetic testing done? How long before that actually gets recognized as something novel?  How long before the study is confirmed?

According to the latest Health Ministry report, a total of nine regions registered occupancy of ICUs above 35%, which is considered to be an upper limit

Emilio de Benito

Madrid - 04 nov 2020 - 10:14 CET

A third of Spain’s intensive care unit (ICU) beds are now occupied by coronavirus patients, according to the latest report on the pandemic supplied on Tuesday by the Health Ministry. In total, 2,754 people are receiving intensive care treatment for Covid-19, 104 more than on Monday, and with 531 more admissions than discharges. Since the pandemic took hold in March, a total of 15,898 patients have needed ICU treatment for the coronavirus.

This indicator is a key trigger for Spain’s regions to ramp up their coronavirus measures, given that ICUs are the most difficult to set up on an improvised basis and their availability has an immediate effect on the mortality rate. There are nine regions where the latest report shows occupancy above 35%, which is considered to be an upper limit: Aragón (48%), Asturias (38%), Castilla y León (39%), Catalonia (42%), Ceuta (47%), Madrid (38%), Melilla (57%), Navarre (40%) and La Rioja (57%).

A total of 238 fatalities were notified in the 24 hours prior to the publication of Tuesday’s report, with 832 over a seven-day period

Hospitalizations are also at a high, with 16.24% of beds occupied by Covid patients. According to Fernando Simón, the director of the Health Ministry’s Coordination Center for Health Alerts (CCAES), this means that “in some hospitals, the programmed activity is being suspended, and that is not good news.”

The regions of Aragón, Asturias and Castilla y León, as well as the North African cities of Ceuta and Melilla, are the most compromised, with percentages above 20%. The importance of this indicator is reflected by the fact that it is these are regions that have requested tougher coronavirus measures. Currently, there are nearly 20,000 people hospitalized in Spain due to Covid-19.

In terms of fatalities, a total of 238 were notified in the 24 hours prior to the publication of the report, with 832 over a seven-day period. This means that the rate of 100 daily Covid-19 deaths is holding steady, but this parameter is not, for now, increasing at the same speed as the number of hospitalizations and ICU admissions, which are the first data points to reflect a rise in cases. The official coronavirus death toll in Spain now stands at 36,495.

While the epidemic continues its advance through the country, there are some signs of a change in trend. For example, while the number of new cases continues to be high, coming in at 18,669 in Tuesday’s report, it is far from the record set on Friday of 25,595. Yesterday’s data broke a four-day run of rising figures, not counting Monday’s new cases given that these include Friday, Saturday and Sunday. In total, 1,259,366 positive cases have been officially confirmed in Spain since the health crisis began.

The 14-day cumulative number of coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants has also fallen in six regions: Aragón (1,119), Canarias (73), Castilla y León (820.2), Madrid (373.7), Navarre (1,182) and La Rioja (764). In Monday’s report, this data point only fell in the Canary Islands, Madrid and the Valencia region.

Focussing on the improvement of Madrid’s figures, Fernando Simón on Tuesday night pointed to the region as an example of how the restrictions that have been implemented – including perimetral lockdowns of the entire region and of individual healthcare areas – can have an effect on flattening the curve. On September 29, the region registered 784.71 cumulative coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants over 14 days. By October 16, that number had fallen below 500, although there was controversy over changes made by the region in terms of a reduction in the number of tests being carried out. And 15 days after that, the number dropped below 400. Simón also used this result to bolster the Health Ministry’s current position that a full lockdown similar to the one implemented in March is not currently necessary.",,,1604503867,{},gb4h8j8,True,t3_jnyohg,False,True,t3_jnyohg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jnyohg/nearly_onethird_of_all_intensive_care_beds_in/gb4h8j8/,1604504298,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1604504139.0,,

All Danish mink must be killed.

This is what Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen (S) says at a press conference.

\- The virus is mutated in mink, and the mutated virus has spread to humans.

Corona has been observed today on 207 mink farms.

\- The mutated virus among mink may involve the risk that the upcoming vaccine will not work as it should, says the Prime Minister.

\- We risk that the effect in the worst case will not occur. It could have devastating consequences for the pandemic of the entire world. A mutated virus is at risk of spreading to other countries.

According to SSI, several people from North Jutland are infected with mink, and the virus has changed so much that it can be a bomb during vaccine development.

According to the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, 1,137 mink herds have been registered in Denmark, where there are approximately 12 million mink.

there are [ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY](https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2020/3/covid-19-vaccine-tracker) vaccines in the works. 

This is not the first one that you snort.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200821155747.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200821155747.htm)

Scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have developed a vaccine that targets the SARS-CoV-2 virus, can be given in one dose via the nose and is effective in preventing infection in mice susceptible to the novel coronavirus. **The investigators next plan to test the vaccine in nonhuman primates and humans to see if it is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19 infection.**

&amp;#x200B;

The study is available online in the journal *Cell*.

Unlike other COVID-19 vaccines in development, this one is delivered via the nose, often the initial site of infection. In the new study, the researchers found that the nasal delivery route created a strong immune response throughout the body, but it was particularly effective in the nose and respiratory tract, preventing the infection from taking hold in the body

&amp;#x200B;

Although there is an influenza vaccine called FluMist that is delivered through the nose, it uses a weakened form of the live influenza virus and can't be administered to certain groups, including those whose immune systems are compromised by illnesses such as cancer, HIV and diabetes. In contrast, the new COVID-19 intranasal vaccine in this study does not use a live virus capable of replication, presumably making it safer.",,,1604503052,{},gb4fl91,False,t3_jnx6ix,False,True,t1_gb4ap4h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jnx6ix/nasal_spray_could_mean_needlefree_covid19_vaccine/gb4fl91/,1604503355,1,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,True,

If you’re familiar with the *Butterfly Effect*, you know that **the earlier you act, the greater effect it has on the future.** *Example:* If you get bad grades your first year of undergrad, it’s much harder to get out of college with a 3.5. 


Similarly, this virus spread for weeks, maybe even months in China. Usually what happens in these local annual epidemics: **The country with the outbreak contacts the WHO/UN *immediately* for assistance &amp; cooperates with whatever they recommend.**


CCP had every chance to say something, and they didn’t. They had every chance to do something. And they waited at least one month, maybe longer, from the first cases to do *anything*. **They objectively spent weeks trying to hide it. That is fact. That is criminal.**


It was **one week after** CCP locked people into their homes that **Trump stopped flights to-and-from China, while at the same time being called racist/xenophobic** by everyone on the left.


Then everything shut down, like everyone wanted. Then the economy tanked, and its all his fault...for doing...*exactly what everyone wanted.* 


Then everyone wanted to go back to work. So states started opened up...and cases started going up...*and that’s also all Trump’s fault.*


Look. I recognize he wasn’t technically 100% honest. I think he should have kept his mouth shut in a lot of situations. He’s an asshole. He’s not a scientist. However, personally I’m glad he misled me. I’m convinced that his downplaying of **how long a solution would take** is the reason our economy didn’t crash immediately. Imagine if he came on TV and said “*We might be locked in this situation for a couple years*.”


**Everything would have collapsed. People cannot digest that information.** Instead, we’ve limped along month-to-month. Now, we’re almost a year along. A lot of damage has been done, but there’s nothing anyone could’ve done (*short of an intense lockdown at the start, like you said.*)


But that severe ten week lockdown tactic ONLY makes sense now; it would have been laughed at back in March because we didn’t know what we know now.

At best, you can speculate that this is the case, but evolutionary biologists ALWAYS avoid making adaptive claims like this without cold, hard evidence (ignoring evo-psych bs). Please do not abuse evolutionary genetics by confusing the hypothesis with the result. You would need to show that, compared to the original strain, the new mink strain somehow evades the mink immune system better or is more infectious than in humans - something that certainly has not been shown. 

You can reason yourself to the conclusion that it's probably incorrect regardless of data. The original spike protein's amino acid sequence has not changed since it first transmitted to humans, and therefore it wasn't forced to adapt to anything. Whatever adaptations may or may not have happened would have happened in the original reservoir species (like bats) before the first human infection - otherwise the first human transmission would not have been possible at all. Not only that, we can apply the same logic to minks - whatever allowed this virus to transmit to minks occurred either in humans, or, knowing that the original spike protein sequence is unaltered, in the original reservoir species.

The situation regarding corona infection among mink has now developed to a critical stage in North Jutland.

Right inside the government offices, the situation is categorized as very serious and there is talk of a coronavirus 2.0.

Therefore, the government has decided that all mink herds must now be killed because coronavirus has mutated among mink and has spread to humans.

This is what Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen says at a press conference on Wednesday.

“You lose life's work, which in some cases has been inherited for several generations. It is a day of sorrow for you and for all who work in the mink profession. The government is aware of this, ""says Mette Frederiksen to the mink breeders. 

A mutated coronavirus has spread from mink to humans and has since spread strongly among the citizens of North Jutland.

On Tuesday, the government received a note from the Statens Serum Institut (SSI), which has exposed the mutated coronavirus to antibodies.

The result, according to SSI, was deeply troubling because the mutated coronavirus did not respond well to the antibodies.

When the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration killed mink in Brovst on Sunday, they had no containers for the dead mink.  Therefore, they were just thrown to the ground.  Photo: private photo.

Thus, there is a risk that a possible vaccine against covid-19 will not have the desired effect if the mutated virus from mink spreads further among humans.

At the same time, the concern is that the new coronavirus from mink means that all people who have been infected with corona can once again be affected by the mutated coronavirus.

There are also new restrictions on the way for citizens in a number of municipalities in northern Jutland to stop the spread of the coronavirus from mink.

So far, these are the municipalities of Hjørring, Frederikshavn, Brønderslev, Jammerbugt, Thisted and Læsø, Mette Frederiksen informs.

»We know very well that we will leave you in North Jutland in uncertainty until tomorrow. I am sorry about that. But we must act now. It is about life and death not only in Denmark, but in the whole world, ""says Mette Frederiksen.

The new restrictions will be announced on Thursday.

Since the government received the worrying note from SSI on Tuesday, government offices have been working hard to find out what restrictions are needed.

The coronavirus has spread rapidly on Danish mink farms since the summer. At the time of writing, more than 207 mink herds have been diagnosed with corona, and therefore all of these mink must be killed.

But now the order from Mette Frederiksen is that all mink on the more than 1,100 mink farms in Denmark must be killed.",,,1604524388,{},gb5oz5k,False,t3_jnwx9x,False,False,t3_jnwx9x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jnwx9x/denmark_mutated_coronavirus_from_mink_is_a_threat/gb5oz5k/,1604529974,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

He finally received the operation (all went well luckily). A week later, the hospital announced it was massively scaling back non urgent surgeries. I'd guess he was lucky.

Luckily it was not urgent, so it could've probably waited a bit longer, it's good he got treated just before surgeries were scaled back. He had been waiting for months already (since the first wave).

Another question, why did they opt for a CABG instead of a CTO PCI. A PCI puts less stress on the body.

""

The  excess deaths up to the 19th of September was recorded as 151.059,  covid deaths was at 136.565 at that date. So 10.6% above reported  deaths.

One thing to consider is that covid reported deaths in Brazil indicate when they were reported and not when they happened, the Amazonas state, for instance, reported hundreds of deaths in October as revised covid deaths that happened up  to the beginning of the pandemic, so this number might get lower.

In the worst case, we risk that the pandemic starts all over again based in Denmark, says the Statens Serum Institut.

All Danish mink must be killed.

This is what Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen (S) says at a press conference and calls it an ""extremely serious situation"".

- The virus is mutated in mink, and the mutated virus has spread to humans.

It could be a bomb during an upcoming coronavirus vaccine .

- The mutated virus among mink may involve the risk that the upcoming vaccine will not work as it should, says the Prime Minister.

The worst case scenario is that we have a pandemic that starts all over again based in Denmark.

Corona has been observed today on 207 mink farms in Jutland. The Statens Serum Institut has found five examples of mink farms and 12 examples in humans where mutated viruses show reduced sensitivity to antibodies .

HERE THERE IS MOST INFECTION

Hjørring: 41 mink farms with coronavirus out of 60
Jammerbugt: 39 mink farms with coronavirus out of 72

- We risk that the effect in the worst case will not occur. It could have devastating consequences for the pandemic worldwide. A mutated virus risks being spread to other countries, says Mette Frederiksen.

It is very serious, says Kåre Mølbak, director of the Statens Serum Institut.

- The worst case scenario is that we have a pandemic that starts all over again based in Denmark, he says.

Breeding animals must also be killed

According to the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration , 1,137 mink herds have been registered in Denmark, where there are approximately 12 million mink.

It will not be possible for the mink breeders to keep individual animals so that breeding can continue again at a later date.

- Even the retention of a small amount of breeding animals will constitute a risk, says Minister of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries Mogens Jensen (S).

He expresses sympathy for mink breeders and the affected communities, but he stresses that it is a serious threat to public health .

- We are in a situation where the light at the end of the tunnel is in danger, says Mogens Jensen.

67 mink farms have already had their herds killed, and the killing is taking place in collaboration with the police.

National Police Chief Thorkild Fogde states that they are now putting a turbo on the effort to get the minks killed.

- It requires cooperation across the authorities , but also cooperation from the mink breeders, it sounds from the National Police Chief .

New initiatives on the way in North Jutland

Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announces new measures to contain the infection with the mutated virus in North Jutland.

This applies to Jammerbugt, Hjørring, Brønderslev, Jammerbugt, Vesthimmerland, Thisted, Frederikshavn and Læsø Municipality, among others.

But it is not yet clear what new initiatives are coming.

The Serum Institute estimates that five percent of the viral infections in North Jutland are of the new type of virus mutation.

Health Minister Magnus Heunicke (S) urges the people of the affected municipalities to pay extra attention to the current restrictions .

- It is important that we have the support of the local population in the affected municipalities. It is especially important that you adhere to guidelines for a maximum of 10 people together, and adhere to the rules on distance and bandages where required.

In addition, there will be an increased test capacity in the area.

- And then there will be further restrictions to curb activity in the affected municipalities, he says.

You’re absolutely playing with fire if a new mutation begins spreading quickly that is a little or far worse than other stands... and you allow it to spread.

We are always one mutation away from everything changing in a direction we don’t want to think about. Odds are VERY low. But they increase the more the virus spreads human to human (winter fuels that) and across species and back to humans like the minks and seagulls in this area.

Coronavirus is so crazy because it is that unique mix of infectious and deadly. If you cut down on either infectiousness or deadliness, then it becomes less of a problem.

The situation regarding corona infection among mink has now developed to a critical stage in North Jutland.

Right inside the government offices, the situation is categorized as very serious and there is talk of a coronavirus 2.0.

Therefore, the government has decided that all mink herds must now be killed because coronavirus has mutated among mink and has spread to humans.

This is what Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen says at a press conference on Wednesday.

“You lose life's work, which in some cases has been inherited for several generations. It is a day of sorrow for you and for all who work in the mink profession. The government is aware of this, ""says Mette Frederiksen to the mink breeders. 

A mutated coronavirus has spread from mink to humans and has since spread strongly among the citizens of North Jutland.

On Tuesday, the government received a note from the Statens Serum Institut (SSI), which has exposed the mutated coronavirus to antibodies.

The result, according to SSI, was deeply troubling because the mutated coronavirus did not respond well to the antibodies.

Thus, there is a risk that a possible vaccine against covid-19 will not have the desired effect if the mutated virus from mink spreads further among humans.

At the same time, the concern is that the new coronavirus from mink means that all people who have been infected with corona can once again be affected by the mutated coronavirus.

There are also new restrictions on the way for citizens in a number of municipalities in northern Jutland to stop the spread of the coronavirus from mink.

So far, these are the municipalities of Hjørring, Frederikshavn, Brønderslev, Jammerbugt, Thisted and Læsø, Mette Frederiksen informs.

»We know very well that we will leave you in North Jutland in uncertainty until tomorrow. I am sorry about that. But we must act now. It is about life and death not only in Denmark, but in the whole world, ""says Mette Frederiksen.

The new restrictions will be announced on Thursday.

I haven't played attention to Denmark lately to know where they lean for their preferred disposal method, though. But yes, it's very tricky. It's one of the biggest concerns any country has with any disease outbreak. These are at least small. How you handle it when it's large livestock is another huge problem.

As for offering an anticoagulant the initial PTPTT would have to come back outside of normal range for them to really be considered. There are, like you said, a lot of other factors including patient age, sex, diet, medical history, etc. elderly patients tend to get low does of anticoagulants when admitted regardless. You’re more likely to clot laying in a hospital bed than you are being up an about. As for following it depends really on how out of range the initial PTPTT is. You’d treat and monitor it as long as it remained a problem. We do this now with geriatrics that take blood thinners like warfarin to ensure their blood is not becoming too thick or thin.

It’s the “government as a household” framework where it needs to balance the budget; balancing funding with revenues such as taxes. So I understand when you are saying that what government funds, eventually needs to be paid back and that it cannot print money forever.

But printing money forever is not really what Im advocating either. Perhaps Im doing a poor job explaining but I think you’re missing my point. That paying back the debt and balancing the budget is unnecessary given that the US is a sovereign currency issuer and not a currency user. In fact, even eliminating the deficit can have bad consequences. 

For example, during the Clinton years, the government achieved an unprecedented surplus but this had negative consequences on private sector surpluses because government deficits and private sector surpluses have an inverse relationship. Why? Because the government balancing its budget actually has negative impacts on the economy. [This chart illustrates it perfectly.](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fb21685654da9367fef942a2abd45758-c) 

If the government creates the money first and from this framework, if they were to pay off all of the debt it would [eliminate the entire money supply.](https://keanchancom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/fiscal-deficit.jpg?w=748)

I take a proton-pump inhibitor, and am just as well informed on the medical realities of B12 as you seem to think you are as a result. It's the entire reason why I'm not willing to stand by and watch you make claims that are objectively untrue about it. 

For example, the entire reason why tablets don't work for you is because your [gastric intrinsic factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_factor) is defective.

I highly doubt that a nutritionist told you that humans cannot live completely without meat, but I wont dismiss that it's possible. After all, anyone can call themselves a nutritionist without any sort of training, education, or professional license. It's dietitians who have to have a an actual degree and certification for professional practice.

&gt; Vegans are also like this a lot of the times.

And they, unlike you, can take a simple B12 supplement and actually absorb it with normal efficiency. *You* can't, but *you're* not representative of the overwhelmingly vast majority of humans, so stop pretending otherwise.

If one was probably exposed to COVID-19, by staying in the same room with an infectious person, are there any measures that should be taken to mitigate the effects of a possible infection? 

After a couple weeks fo WFH, I went back to the office on Monday. I work in the same room with another person, our desks are about 6-7 feet apart. On Monday, everything was fine. Yesterday, he started coughing, not directly at me, but kinda in my direction... I asked if he's okay, any other symptoms like loss of smell, etc... He's like 'oh, no I'm fine, it's just a little cold, nothing to worry about'. Well suuure..... We were in the same room for about 5-6 hours that day.

This morning he didn't come in, says he has a fever and will get tested. 

So this is a guy who I don't remember getting a fever in the 4+ years I've been working with him, I'm quite positive he has COVID-19 now. 

I already came back home, and will self-isolate until he gets his test results back, and if he's positive, I'll stay home for the next 2 weeks at least. 

I'm fine for now, but is there any measures that should be taken to help my immune system fight back a possible infection? I mean stuff like getting a lot of rest, taking more vit. D  C, and zinc?

**They first trained a general machine-learning algorithm, or neural network, known as ResNet50**, to discriminate sounds associated with different degrees of vocal cord strength. Studies have shown that the quality of the sound “mmmm” can be an indication of how weak or strong a person’s vocal cords are. Subirana trained the neural network on an audiobook dataset with more than 1,000 hours of speech, to pick out the word “them” from other words like “the” and “then.”

To date, the researchers have collected more than 70,000 recordings, each containing several coughs, amounting to some 200,000 forced-cough audio samples, which Subirana says is **“the largest research cough dataset that we know of.”** Around 2,500 recordings were submitted by people who were confirmed to have Covid-19, including those who were asymptomatic.

The team used the 2,500 Covid-associated recordings, along with 2,500 more recordings that they randomly selected from the collection to balance the dataset. **They used 4,000 of these samples to train the AI model.** The remaining 1,000 recordings were then fed into the model to see if it could accurately discern coughs from Covid patients versus healthy individuals.",,,1604513484,{},gb51o3s,False,t3_jnmbbc,False,True,t1_gb3zpyu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jnmbbc/mit_teams_cough_detector_identifies_97_of_covid19/gb51o3s/,1604516340,3,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,True,

It seems to me that the mink virus should be at least as infectious as the original virus as that evolved in bats.  And as far as one outcompeting another, the new mink version may not do as well as the dominant strain in new infections, it could very well dominate in reinfections of previous cases.  

Of course all of this is speculative, one study from one institute is incredibly preliminary.

It is concerning though.  To compare to bird flu, bird flu isn't normally able to transmit to humans because different receptors in people than birds.  But bird flu can transmit to pigs, and pigs have receptors in common with people.  So, bird flu can mutate in pigs and jump to people.  We don't really know what went on inside the mink.

He also predicted that up to 150,000 people could die. There were fewer than 200 deaths. . . .



&gt;In 2002, Ferguson predicted that up to 50,000 people would likely die from exposure to BSE (mad cow disease) in beef. In the U.K., there were only 177 deaths from BSE.

&gt;In 2005, Ferguson predicted that up to 150 million people could be killed from bird flu. In the end, only 282 people died worldwide from the disease between 2003 and 2009.

&gt;In 2009, a government estimate, based on Ferguson’s advice, said a “reasonable worst-case scenario” was that the swine flu would lead to 65,000 British deaths. In the end, swine flu killed 457 people in the U.K.

&gt;Last March, Ferguson admitted that his Imperial College model of the COVID-19 disease was based on undocumented, 13-year-old computer code that was intended to be used for a feared influenza pandemic, rather than a coronavirus. Ferguson declined to release his original code so other scientists could check his results. He only released a heavily revised set of code last week, after a six-week delay.

At the press briefing, Kåre Mølbak of SSI said that the strain found in mink has *less* response to existing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. He added that it still *does* respond to them; it doesn't ""just grow freely when exposed to the antibodies"", to use his wording (although, of course, he said it in Danish) - and he also added that cellular immunity doesn't seem to be affected. The concern isn't that this has immediately destroyed all vaccine hopes (remember that most vaccine candidates produce much higher antibody titres than natural infection, *and* also induce cellular immunity) - the concern is that if it keeps replicating and mutating unchecked, it might turn into something that does. This is why all the mink are being killed and why the affected part of the country will have stricter measures imposed tomorrow (what exactly hasn't been announced yet). Gene sequencing of infections in surrounding areas is also intensified, to track if it has spread.

The news outlet that most of non-Danish-speaking Reddit is responding to is basically a Danish tabloid. While they haven't said anything that's outright false, they've been a bit creative in their reporting: a ""lessened response"" mutated into ""only a weak response"", for example.

Alan Greenspan in 2005: “There’s nothing to prevent the federal government creating as much money as it wants in payment to somebody.” He explains that the real problem is whether there are enough resources or assets in existence to support all the purchases the extra cash would demand. See the exchange here: https://youtu.be/DNCZHAQnfGU

Ben Bernanke: “It’s not tax money. The banks have accounts with the Fed, much the same way that you have an account in a commercial bank. So, to lend to a bank, we simply use the computer to mark up the size of the account that they have with the Fed. It’s much more akin to printing money than it is to borrowing. ... And we need to do that, because our economy is very weak and inflation is very low.”
https://youtu.be/odPfHY4ekHA

If creating new money out of thin air creates inflation, why was there no inflation when Ben Bernanke created $1 trillion in assets to save the banks during the financial crisis? (Some estimates have this as high as $29 trillion.)

Examples:
1. Japan runs a deficit of 240% of GDP, yet has no inflation.

2. Doesn’t US military funding happen “out of thin air” when for example, it just looks for the legislative votes and it happens?

3. The gov. creates its own money and sets the price at which it is available to the markets. Doesn’t it therefore have monopoly power in the fundamental underlying prices of everything in the economy? Any debts denominated in its own currency can be paid in its own currency or can be settled by the creation of new money. Right?

According to economist Warren Mosler: “The government creates money in order to spend it. The government does not impose taxes in order to find money. “Spending” and “creation” might as well be the same thing.”

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — In a rare recognition of Taiwan's existence, a top World Health Organization (WHO) official lauded the country's handling of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.

In an [interview](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/02/covid-lockdowns-are-cost-of-self-isolation-failures-says-who-expert) with the Guardian published on Monday (Nov. 2), WHO spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris explained why the organization does not recommend that countries implement full lockdowns as coronavirus cases skyrocket in the U.S. and Europe. Instead, Harris recommended testing, contact tracing, and quarantining and as an example highlighted Taiwan's use of these techniques to avoid a lockdown altogether.

Although WHO officials such as Tedros Adhanom and Bruce Aylward lavished praise on China early on in the pandemic for the alleged results of its extreme lockdown of Wuhan, the organization has maintained that such lockdowns should be something of a last resort. Instead, as stated by Harris, the WHO is advocating isolation: ""That's not just the isolation of people who are sick — it's the isolation of people who have contacts and are first-degree contacts.""

Unlike Aylward's awkward [moment of silence](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3906512) when asked about Taiwan's membership in the WHO, Harris proactively praised Taiwan as having ""the best management."" However, this was tinged by her labeling of Taiwan as one of the Asian ""economies"" that contained the virus better, a clear attempt to avoid Chinese angst about Taiwan's status as a country.

Harris chose Taiwan to dispel the myth that only ""non-liberal, non-democratic command economies"" can control the pandemic by pointing out the fact that it is ""definitely a highly liberal society."" She emphasized that lockdowns come at a price and that avoiding them requires ""a lot of planning. It requires a lot of a great deal of partnership with community and with local authorities...""

Indeed, Taiwan began planning for this pandemic after it learned a hard lesson from SARS 17 years ago, starting with the establishment of a permanent National Health Command Center (NHCC) in 2004. When reports of atypical pneumonia cases in Wuhan started to stream in, Taiwan on Dec. 31 of last year contacted the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and a World Health Organization (WHO) IHR focal point to clarify whether human-to-human transmission was occurring in Wuhan.

However, the WHO only responded with a short message stating that Taiwan's information would be ""forwarded to expert colleagues,"" and China only issued a press release. As a result, Taiwan was unable to receive confirmation through either the WHO or Chinese channels that human-to-human transmission was taking place.

Therefore, the government went ahead and launched enhanced border control and quarantine measures ""based on the assumption that human-to-human transmission was in fact occurring,"" according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En/Bulletin/Detail/PAD-lbwDHeN_bLa-viBOuw?typeid=158). On Jan. 20, the CECC was activated, with Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) at the helm.

Steps taken by the CECC from that day forward have been key in eliminating local coronavirus infections in Taiwan for 205 days and counting. Examples include canceling entry permits for tourists from Wuhan, implementing mandatory quarantines for all visitors, imposing a total ban on foreign travelers, setting up a name-based mask rationing system, using cellphone data to enforce quarantines, and carrying out extensive contact tracing.",,,1604504047,{},gb4hlg8,True,t3_jnyqol,False,True,t3_jnyqol,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jnyqol/taiwan_news_who_offers_rare_words_of_praise_for/gb4hlg8/,1604504510,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

[],,Diabolico,,,[],,,,text,t2_3dbz5,False,False,[],"It is not that the viruses evolve in a more extreme way in animals. It is that a virus in humans evolves in a way that best helps it survive in humans. It does not evolve in the way that is most harmful to humans unless those two things happened to be similar.  

While a virus is circulating in the human population it is developing traits that help it spread among humans and it is not developing traits that help it spread in any other species. If it coincidentally is able to spread to another species it encounters a completely different environment. In that environment it will evolve to survive and spread more effectively and that may mean changing things that are fundamentally useful to the virus when it is in humans. Usually that means it is less infectious to humans.

The problem is that any time a virus jumps between species it is a showing up with a completely new bag of tricks. Most of these new tricks are useless, but occasionaly one of them is extremely useful and is not the sort of thing that would have naturally evolved in that population.

In this case the parts of the virus that we are targeting with vaccines are parts of the virus that are very very stable. They are stable because they are effective at helping the virus survive and spread in humans. Turns out they were not super effective in infecting minks, so the virus mutated and these parts of it were not so important anymore and different version that better effect minks survived and spread. That virus then jumped back to humans with its new, possibly less effective tools.

The trouble is that those old tools were what we were targeting with our vaccine. If this strain of the virus is able to survive and spread, even if it is less infectious than the current version we are living with, we have a problem because the vaccines that we are working on will not help.

And, we don't actually know whether it is more or less infectious, or more or less deadly.  I think we prefer not to have to find out.

 I think the real nightmare scenario here is that this virus becomes specialized in jumping between species.   Maybe we can all live on pasta for a month in a locked down, maybe we can get every man woman and child vaccinated.  We sure as hell can't vaccinate every squirrel cat cow mink and bat.

&gt;Today, the architect of Sweden’s lighter-touch approach says the country will have “a low level of spread” with occasional local outbreaks. “What it will be in other countries, I think that is going to be more critical. They are likely to be more vulnerable to these kind of spikes. Those kind of things will most likely be bigger when you don’t have a level of immunity that can sort of put the brake on it,” he adds.

And then:

&gt;Herd immunity is one of the most controversial concepts of the Covid-19 crisis. Tegnell is adamant that it was not Sweden’s goal to allow the virus to run its course until enough of the population had been exposed and the infection rate slowed. But he argues immunity is at least in part responsible for the sharp recent drop in Swedish cases and questions how its neighbours will fare without it. “What is protecting Copenhagen today? We will see,” he adds.
