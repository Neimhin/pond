It does not reflect the strain differences from year to year. It is changed annually based on prediction of what strains will be most prominent for that coming flu season. Sometimes that is bigger changes and sometimes it‚Äôs smaller. They also sometimes get it right and other times they don‚Äôt. ‚ÄúReflect‚Äù gives the impression they are adjusting with current data but that is not the case. By the time they have data from the current flu season it is too late and relying solely on the previous season could be wrong. 

The point the other person is making still stands true. Our immunity to things degrades over time. If it didn‚Äôt then you could immunize against all flu strains and be done with it. But it doesn‚Äôt work that way. Instead there is an educated guess on what will be prominent and we vaccinate against that hoping it will help when it comes to the flu.

&gt;	The booster is the same shot with the same materials.

Many boosters are. They don‚Äôt change the Tdap, MMR, Men, etc. If or when Covid changes enough that a vaccine change is necessary there is no doubt they will make the change. We might even see a single vaccine to address two strains the way we see from 2,3,4 strain flu shots.

Overall your comment does not change anything the person said. We get vaccines to protect ourselves from disease. At some point we will also need boosters. That might be a different mixture for a different strain that we have previously been subjected to our it could be the same mixture. It doesn‚Äôt really matter.

So if I extrapolate that across the population, I‚Äôd say 25 people are expected to be hospitalized if they all got Covid. **YOUR** data bolded above says out of 100k Covid cases from unvaccinated, 45 would be hospitalized.

Anyway, to my question. We are really wondering if we had Covid and had a false negative. WHICH antibody test is best at detecting prior infection wheh you‚Äôve also been previously vaccinated?

The CDC site said some antibody tests may give you a positive due to your vaccination, but some are more effective at detecting antibodies from ACTUAL infection. But they stop short of specifying which test to ask for.

Anyone know? I‚Äôm just really curious if we had it. I kind of hope we did, because we all came through ok, and it would give me peace of mi c about my toddler who is too young to be vaccinated. She was very sick as well.

&gt; Much like Germany, Austria was divided into American, British, French, and Soviet zones and governed by the Allied Commission for Austria.\[96\] As forecast in the Moscow Declaration in 1943, a subtle difference was seen in the treatment of Austria by the Allies.\[93\]  
 The Austrian government, consisting of Social Democrats, Conservatives,  
 and Communists (until 1947), and residing in Vienna, which was   
surrounded by the Soviet zone, was recognised by the Western Allies  
 in October 1945 after some doubts that Renner could be Stalin's puppet.  
 Thus, the creation of a separate Western Austrian government and the   
division of the country was avoided. Austria, in general, was treated as  
 though it had been originally invaded by Germany and liberated by the   
Allies.\[97\]

People do and are asking questions, which is why you can read commonly asked questions and their answers [here on the CDC website.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/keythingstoknow.html?s_cid=10493:vaccine%20for%20covid:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY21)

And also you imply that people are injecting the vaccine left and right like a heroin user. The vaccines are administered in a medical setting with qualified professionals and you can only get the ones you're qualified to get. 

They are literally made for the sole purpose of preventing people from dying to COVID so I don't understand why you're so against something that benefits everyone.

If you're skeptical of side effects you can look at [the data](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/reactogenicity.html) to see how uncommon a serious side effect is.

The good news is, though, it won't be one and done and two and done, it could be three and done. I do not think we're going to need boosters on a regular basis after that.

Don't know that for sure. But looking at some of the data, I think we're going to have some longer-lasting protection after that third dose.

Just like we do with a lot of pediatric vaccines where you give a series of quick immunizations and then we wait six months to a year and then boost, and then we don't have to vaccinate again for five years, sometimes 10 years.

Sorry for the delayed response I was buying groceries.

Out of curiosity we got tested for antibodies three times. As a family we have had one thing in common so far: 
Ever since getting infected the amount of antibodies within our bodies has steadily increased and seems to keep increasing. 

I only see two possible explanations: 
Either the immune system is still naturally producing antibodies on its own as an ongoing reaction of the unnoticed infection which is what our family doctor was suspecting or we all came into touch with the virus multiple times without noticing. Either way it seems irrational to be scared of a reinfection.
As of now I‚Äôm stacked to the teeth with antibodies that seem to keep increasing.

I see no reason at all to get a vaccine that is slowly starting to lose its efficacy after only two months when I am producing even more antibodies naturally which was confirmed by the tests that we‚Äôve undertaken.

Like I wrote though I live in Sweden and healthcare with yearly tests and stuff isn't a thing here. You have to get up there in age to get appointments to have your health checked if you are otherwise healthy. Basically you are only in contact with a nurse or doctor if there is something wrong with you.

For example, I had extensive testing done last year when I turned 40. This was the first time in my adult life that I got scheduled to have my health examined. It's a thing they do for everyone when they turn 40. The next schedule health checkup will be when I turn 50 I think. It's a PSA test for prostate cancer.

I guess it's possible though to go to private health practitioner to get some testing done even if you are healthy. Like I wrote if I as a healthy person turned to our normal health care system and asks to have some tests done it will not be granted unless I have some medical problems that would indicate I needed it. So asking to have my vitamin D levels checked out when I am an otherwise healthy person they will not do.

Abstract  
Objectives  
Hyper-inflammation caused by COVID-19 may be mediated by mast cell activation (MCA) which has also been hypothesized to cause Long-COVID (LC) symptoms. We determined prevalence/severity of MCA symptoms in LC.  
  
Methods  
Adults in LC-focused Facebook support groups were recruited for online assessment of symptoms before and after COVID-19. Questions included presence and severity of known MCA and LC symptoms and validated assessments of fatigue and quality of life. General population controls and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) patients were recruited for comparison if they were ‚â•18 years of age and never had overt COVID-19 symptoms.  
  
Results  
There were 136 LC subjects (89.7% females, age 46.9 ¬±12.9 years), 136 controls (65.4% females, age 49.2 ¬±15.5), and 80 MCAS patients (85.0% females, age 47.7 ¬±16.4). Pre-COVID-19 LC subjects and controls had virtually identical MCA symptom and severity analysis. Post-COVID-19 LC subjects and MCAS patients prior to treatment had virtually identical MCA symptom and severity analysis.  
  
Conclusions  
MCA symptoms were increased in LC and mimicked the symptoms and severity reported by patients who have MCAS. Increased activation of aberrant mast cells induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection by various mechanisms may underlie part of the pathophysiology of LC, possibly suggesting routes to effective therapy.",,,,1637326977,,{},hl90957,True,t3_qxfqxo,False,True,t3_qxfqxo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qxfqxo/mast_cell_activation_symptoms_are_prevalent_in/hl90957/,1637665466.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Probably not. Not sure if they put you with the hard-boiled criminals, but if it's really just a few hours there might be holding cells at larger precincts for that purpose. They are usually used for holding petty criminals before transfer to court or sobering up drunks/addicts.

Abstract  
COVID-19 infection survivors suffer from a constellation of symptoms referred to as post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. However, in the wake of recent evidence highlighting the long-term persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens in tissues and emerging information regarding the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and various components of the host cell macroautophagy/autophagy machinery, the unforeseen long-term consequences of this infection, such as increased risk of malignancies, should be explored. Although SARS-CoV-2 is not considered an oncogenic virus, the possibility of increased risk of cancer among COVID-19 survivors cannot be ruled out. Herein, we provide an overview of the possible mechanisms leading to cancer development, particularly obesity-related cancers (e.g., colorectal cancer), resulting from defects in autophagy and the blockade of the autophagic flux, and also immune escape in COVID-19 survivors. We also highlight the potential long-term implications of COVID-19 infection in the prognosis of patients with cancer and their response to different cancer treatments. Finally, we consider future directions for further investigations on this matter.

Short-term severe symptoms that required medical attention were found in 6.8% among the post-infected individuals, while none were found in the infection na√Øve population.

If it comes across as a ‚Äúscare tactic,‚Äù or even super extreme, I feel like if you blatantly refuse or choose not to get vaccinated you should absolutely not get ‚Äúpreferential‚Äù treatment for catching it. 

I‚Äôve been reading and seeing *SO MANY* occasions of how unvaxxed people sick with covid are all going to the front of the line at emergency care places, literally jumping the line of vaccinated people with other problems, taking up critical ICU space, and it leading to a lot of responsible people that have had other life-threatening issues dying because of it. 

Not only are the unvaccinated people catching, spreading and getting themselves killed by covid at an incredible rate, they‚Äôre also getting other people, with other emergencies, killed at an alarming rate that could‚Äôve been avoided if they just get over their moronic selfishness and get vaccinated. 

I absolutely believe if someone is found to have covid and is **not** vaccinated, they should be moved to the bottom of the list as far as ‚Äúpriority based on severity‚Äù list goes. 

One of the stories off the top of my head was about a early-mid 30s veteran in Houston. He started having bowl/guy issues, searing pain and he tried to get help but the ERs and ICUs were full as far as 6-8 hours away. They couldn‚Äôt get him in anywhere. They almost did find one at the last minute, but when they finished paperwork the hospital that said they had the bed basically said, ‚Äúsorry, we thought we did, but we had to admit someone for covid and it‚Äôs no longer available.‚Äù They had to send the guy home, effectively telling him, ‚Äúthis is what it‚Äôs gonna be, and it‚Äôs terrible how this played out, but go home spend time with your loved ones, I‚Äôll keep trying, but we‚Äôre basically sending you home to die.‚Äù 

They sent him home, and within a day he died... of appendicitis. Just so fucking sickening that someone died of a incredibly fixable health issue, all because they literally had nowhere with space to do the surgery because **SO many** unvaccinated people sick with covid are taking up that much needed ICU/Emergency Use space for weeks, sometimes even months, on end just to die anyway because they refuse to get vaccinated.

I take the sticker off as well (which can trigger a gate search even if you were ""cleared"" before), but it's a moot point for me as I always get flagged for search 100% of the time anyways because I have a naughty flag in a CBP/DHS database somewhere. 

This whole ""interview you at check-in"" process is done by private contractors on behalf of the airline (who are in turn complying with DHS/CBP regulations that, if they do not follow, they will have issues being cleared to land in the US.. so it's essentially an extension of the DHS). This is why at *most* airports you can no longer do mobile check in for international inbound flights to the US (although there are exceptions, again based on arbitrary risk scoring I guess). 

I used to commute to London from the US weekly for work for almost *two years* but every time I was scored as high risk and had to go through a search, both at Heathrow and back upon arrival in the US by the CBP.

Is that different than Christian Scientists? Because Christian Science very much is not encouraging people to oppose vaccine mandates.

&gt;Concern for public health and safety is something that all responsible people share‚Äîincluding Christian Scientists. Grateful as we are to live in communities where honest differences can be respected, Christian Scientists are also mindful of the obligations all citizens have to respect the rights of others in their communities.

&gt;**For more than a century, our denomination has counseled respect for public health authorities and conscientious obedience to the laws of the land, including those requiring vaccination. Christian Scientists report suspected communicable disease, obey quarantines, and strive to cooperate with measures considered necessary by public health officials. We see this as a matter of basic Golden Rule ethics and New Testament love.**

&gt;As for the issue of exemptions for vaccination in the law, Christian Scientists‚Äô perspective on this issue may be unique. **In the past, many public officials have been broadly supportive of exemptions when these have not been considered a danger to the wider community. In more recent years, public health concerns relating to vaccinations have risen as exemptions from them have been claimed by larger numbers. Christian Scientists recognize the seriousness of these concerns.**

&gt;Most of our church members normally rely on prayer for healing. It‚Äôs a deeply considered spiritual practice and way of life that has meant a lot to us over the years. So we‚Äôve appreciated vaccination exemptions and sought to use them conscientiously and responsibly, when they have been granted.

&gt;On the other hand, our practice isn‚Äôt a dogmatic thing. Church members are free to make their own choices on all life-decisions, in obedience to the law, including whether or not to vaccinate. These aren‚Äôt decisions imposed by their church.

Also, would a company spend a salaried worker's time calling up 100 different pharmacies and doctors offices to verify each persons vaccination status?

The answer is a centralized database for easy verification that aggregates the data from vaccine administers to be made available to the checkers. And it already exists. It's a vaccine passport. And that will be a solution that can be done politically in some areas, but for a national problem, it needs a national database.

As of next Monday, access to more indoor spaces will be limited to the vaccinated, he said during a televised address. Proof of a negative test will no longer be sufficient for unvaccinated people to enter cinemas, theaters, museums and gymnasiums, he said. The new restrictions broaden those imposed in mid-September, which barred the unvaccinated from the indoor areas of cafes and restaurants.

To increase demand for booster shots, Mr. Mitsotakis also said that the vaccination certificates of those over 60 would expire after seven months. Greece opened eligibility for booster shots last week for all those over 18 who had their last shot at least five and a half months ago. Those who got the Pfizer, AstraZeneca or Moderna vaccines initially were advised to get a Pfizer or Moderna booster. Those who received the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot were advised to get Pfizer, Moderna or a second Johnson &amp; Johnson shot as a booster.

Mr. Mitsotakis appealed to all, particularly the unvaccinated elderly, to get their shots without delay.

‚ÄúGreece is mourning unnecessary losses as it very simply does not have the vaccination rates of other European countries,‚Äù he said.

About 61 percent of Greeks are fully vaccinated, below the average rate in the European Union of 65.4 percent, according to the vaccine tracker of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Since the end of September, new daily cases have shot up from an average of about 2,100 to more than 6,500, according to the Our World in Data project at Oxford University, and daily Covid deaths have spiked over the same period, going from an average of around 30 to more than 74.

With Europe as a whole experiencing a sustained wave of cases, the sharp restrictions in Greece have been matched or surpassed by other E.U. nations. Austria, for instance, will impose full lockdowns in two states ‚Äî Salzburg and Upper Austria ‚Äî next week, after having imposed broad restrictions on the activities of unvaccinated people.

On Thursday, lawmakers in Germany‚Äôs Parliament approved a bill whose measures include a rule that only people who are vaccinated against the virus, have recovered from an infection or test negative can ride public transit or attend work in person. The measure is expected to be passed by all 16 states on Friday.

France and Italy have allowed people to enter indoor areas such as cafes, museums and gyms with a health pass that shows the holder has been vaccinated, has recovered from Covid-19 or has tested negative for the virus. However, both countries are reportedly considering restricting access to such areas to the vaccinated.

The Czech Republic, which is experiencing some of its highest caseloads since the pandemic began, will bar people without a vaccination pass or proof of a previous Covid infection from restaurants, bars and hair salons as of Monday. They will also be barred from attending large events.

And lawmakers in the Netherlands, which is reporting record case numbers and sharply rising positive tests, recently restored mask mandates in some public indoor places and instituted a three-week partial lockdown that includes earlier closing hours for restaurants, bars and shops. However, the Dutch government has resisted urgings to close schools, despite significant outbreaks among those aged 4 through 12.",,,,1637347376,,{},hlacl7e,True,t3_qxmnr4,False,False,t3_qxmnr4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qxmnr4/greece_like_some_other_eu_nations_facing_case/hlacl7e/,1637693172.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚ÄúI have determined that all soldiers who refuse the mandatory vaccination order will be flagged,‚Äù wrote Christine E. Wormuth, the secretary, in a memo this week, which would prevent them from promotions, awards, bonuses and the like. If troops persist in declining, they will not be permitted ‚Äúcontinued service‚Äù unless granted an approved exemption from the vaccine, she wrote.

Last week, Oklahoma‚Äôs newly appointed adjutant general for the National Guard, Brig. Gen. Thomas H. Mancino, announced on behalf of Gov. Kevin Stitt that guardsmen in the state would not be required to get a Covid-19 vaccine. The policy defies a Pentagon directive issued in August that makes vaccination mandatory for all troops, including the National Guard, by deadlines set by each service branch.

The memo created a testy stand off between Oklahoma officials and the Pentagon, which insists that all National Guard members must follow the same vaccine procedures as active duty troops. Guard troops are under the authority of the governor unless federally deployed. However, the Pentagon has stood its ground on the notion that its vaccine mandate trumps states‚Äô rights.

In Oklahoma, 89 percent of airmen in the Guard have been vaccinated, while only 40 percent of Army guardsmen have had shots; the deadline for members of the Army National Guard is coming next month. All branches of the military have been permitted to come up with their own vaccine mandate deadlines for active duty and guard troops, as well as their own punishment systems for refusing shots.

The Pentagon has been wary that other states may follow Oklahoma‚Äôs lead.

Texas Guard officials, for instance, said in an email that the Pentagon appeared to be imposing vaccine mandates on military and National Guard members without adequate protections in place for individuals with religious objections and hinted it, too, might permit members to skip the shots.

The governor of Alaska, Mike Dunleavy, has also issued a memo noting that ‚ÄúPresident Biden and his Administration have taken actions, or announced plans to act, that threaten the sovereign authority of the State of Alaska,‚Äù which included ‚Äúimposing vaccine mandates on military and National Guard members without adequate protections in place for individuals with religious objections.‚Äù

In essence, Texas and Alaska appear to be engaged in a passive version of the Oklahoma written policy. ‚ÄúWe are awaiting additional guidance from the Departments of the U.S. Army and Air Force that addresses National Guard requirements,‚Äù said Candis Olmstead, a spokeswoman for the Alaska Guard, in an email.

So far, the Defense Department has granted a smattering of exemptions from vaccines, including for people who were already leaving the military or who have medical issues, but those for religious reasons are still pending.",,,,1637347257,,{},hlac97j,True,t3_qxmm8l,False,False,t3_qxmm8l,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qxmm8l/the_us_army_secretary_to_national_guard_members/hlac97j/,1637692980.0,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The move was welcomed by desperate tourism operators and workers, who have struggled to make a living since the start of the pandemic.

‚ÄúI rejoice at and fully support the news of reopening the country to vaccinated tourists without quarantine,‚Äù said Chhay Sivlin, the president of the Cambodia Association of Travel Agents. Tourism directly accounted for more than 12 percent of the country‚Äôs economy in 2019 and provided jobs to 630,000 people, she said.

Last month, the Southeast Asian nation of about 16 million announced plans to let fully vaccinated foreign tourists begin entering the country at the end of November if they first quarantined in selected areas for five days.

But citing the rapid pace of inoculations and a vaccination rate of 88 percent, Prime Minister Hun Sen accelerated that plan and said that fully vaccinated tourists could arrive without quarantine, effective on Monday.

‚ÄúThis is a big step towards reopening the entire country,‚Äù said Mr. Hun Sen, an authoritarian leader who came to power in 1984. ‚ÄúI hope our compatriots enjoy our reopening. It is widely due to the country having achieved such an outstanding rate of vaccination.‚Äù

While the prime minister put the fully vaccinated rate at 88 percent based on a population of 16 million, The New York Times database puts the rate at 80 percent, based on a population of nearly 16.5 million.

More than two million people have received a third dose.

About 90 percent of Cambodia‚Äôs vaccines came from China, including more than nine million doses of Sinovac and nearly four million doses of Sinopharm.
Under the new rules, travelers arriving from abroad can skip quarantine if they are fully vaccinated, test negative for the virus before departure and test negative again on arrival. Travelers who are not vaccinated must still spend 14 days in quarantine.

Ms. Sivlin said that tourist bookings were beginning to pick up and that airlines were working to increase the number of flights to Cambodia.

Some flights are scheduled to the capital, Phnom Penh, but none for Siem Reap, the town near the ancient city of Angkor that is one of the most popular destinations in Southeast Asia.

Like many of its neighbors, Cambodia reported relatively few virus cases in 2020 but faced a deadly surge this year.

In these regions, some fraction of people who turn up with COVID also have parasitic worms.     What's more, the steroids often used treat COVID have a secondary effect of suppressing the part of the immune system that keeps parasitic worms in check.   So you get COVID under control but the worms go out of control and may kill the patient.

So, *when worms are possible*, using ivermectin helps in the same way that antibiotics help with respiratory viral infections: doesn't help with the primary infection but it knocks down a secondary threat to the patient.    

And, because there are safe and effective doses of ivermectin, the straightforward approach is to just deworm everyone coming in areas where worms are endemic.

The move is the latest sign of China‚Äôs efforts to chase full elimination of the virus through stringent ‚ÄúCovid zero‚Äù measures, even as the rest of the world looks to open up.

The man, who was identified only by his surname, Cao, was convicted of lying on a health declaration form when he crossed China‚Äôs border with Vietnam in late April, the court said on its Weixin social media account.

He concealed that he had been staying in a hotel in Vietnam where some people with coronavirus infections were also staying, the court said. Then he obtained cold medicine and hid a fever and other symptoms consistent with a coronavirus infection.

Once in China, he also sneaked out of his quarantine room to meet friends, the court said. Mr. Cao could not be reached for comment.

Huang Qinmei, the deputy mayor of Chongzuo, the city of which Pingxiang is part, said at a news conference in May that Mr. Cao had tested positive.

&gt;Russia's herd immunity has surpassed 50%, Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova said Friday.

&gt;Two more Russian coronavirus vaccines are currently undergoing preclinical trials, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said Wednesday. So far, Russia has authorized four vaccines: Sputnik V, the one-dose Sputnik Light, EpiVacCorona and CoviVak.

&gt;There is ""no end in sight"" to the Covid-19 pandemic in Russia yet, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday.

&gt;A Far East Russian region has become the first in the country to introduce vaccine passports for internal flights Wednesday as federal lawmakers race to mandate health passes for public transport and other areas.

&gt;Russia will resume air travel with Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Costa Rica and Mongolia from Dec. 1, authorities announced Tuesday. It will also lift all remaining restrictions on flights with Mexico, Cuba and Qatar starting that day.

We tread the line with restrictive identity politics, with gerrymandering limiting our power, with parochial influence in politics (and I say that as a person of faith!), how our telecommunications and privacy are handled, and many intrusions into our lives. 

Will a health mandate one day cross a line? Absolutely. Probably in a bill cluster that crosses the line in two other places so we don't notice. But it's not *here*.

You're bringing up the safety concern, but I can't help but feel like you would be against regardless of 100% pure safety data. Like you're bringing it up to try and use a science taking point to influence a political concern.

Regardless, the data shows so far that there is not an issue with fertility. And if a year of data isn't enough, maybe you'll want 5 or 10, or it will need to churn to see if there's a generational deformity 35 years from now.

It's not that the safety of a health mandate isn't a concern, it's just likely that no amount of time or proof of harmlessness will ever convince you it's the right thing to do.

Of course we don't know the answers to the questions you posed. I am just getting a bit confused with all the info that we are bombarded with on a daily basis. 

Recently, I was at the local hospital and inquired as to what the info is on boosters. They said no info, this is not a discussion at this point .( As if I was asking when we would colonize Mars). Now suddenly as if within a night we get flooded in info about them and that we should literally run and get them ( I am referring to how my country handles things). 

The recommendation is to get the booster as soon as we hit the 6 month mark. I have so many questions concerning,you know , waning immunity ,what the booster does, how helpful it will be, how much more protection we can get, and whether it's protection from severe illness or just infection etc. 

I also hear here and there people from my extended circle getting a breakthrough infection at 3 or 4 months after vaccination, you know it's scary.

[Roche's website](https://diagnostics.roche.com/us/en/landing-pages/elecsys--anti-sars-cov-2-testing-sites.html#Anti-SARS-CoV-2-Qualitative-Nucleocapsid) lists some testing centers, but honestly, I'm not sure how easy it is for a member of the public to just get tested at them.

There could be other options.

One option is just to ask your doctor if he or she can order an antibody test for you.

Absolute caseloads matter less and less as more people are inoculated (no one cares if 100k people catch the common cold every day for example). Besides that, the R number also goes down as more people are vaccinated because the vaccine also blocks transmission (albeit not as good as that it prevents hospitalization and death).

And yes, human rights are very important but they are not absolute. At this moment my human right to go and do what I want (for as far as those activities do not break the law of course) is impeded in order to prevent our healthcare system from collapsing which has a big impact on my mental health.

Sometimes human rights simply cannot coexist. At this point for example, in countries where vaccination uptake is insufficient the human rights of freedom of movement and congregation, the human right of receiving sufficient healthcare when needed and the human right to not get vaccinated (in this case against COVID-19) if you don't want to cannot coexist together. If you want to retain right 1 and 2 you cannot retain right 3, if you want to retain right 1 and 3 you cannot retain right 2 and if you want to retain right 2 and 3 you cannot retain right 1. So you have a choice to make. And in my opinion not retaining right 3 is by far the least damaging choice because the COVID-19 vaccine has been proven safe and effective and only causes short term mild inconvenience (mild fever, stiff/ painful upper arm) when received (yes, I know there are extremely rare cases of severe adverse reactions.

For covid-19, and to some extent other respiratory virus, it's more important not whether you caught the virus, but how much dose you have been exposed to. This means that if cases were low, even old people with comorbidities would probably be fine with waning immunity from the vaccine and would not get sick if exposed to covid.

The problem gets complicated when the virus is spread to much in the population, suddenly you are exposed multiple times to the virus and eventually reach a dosage of it where your immune system is not capable to produce enough antibodies on time, and you end up on the hospital.

So it doesn't matter how great new vaccines can be, they are always limited by what our immune system can do, and for this type of virus there will always be a high enough dosage that will put anyone sick.

The vaccine can elicit a lot more than just myocarditis. It elicits an immune response, which carries it's own risks regardless of the cause. There is a link between vaccination and GBS, as well as onset of autoimmune diseases. They're exceptionally rare and can occur from natural infection as well, but the correlation isn't really disputed. And there's a nice list of all the systemic and local adverse reactions of varying severity that the vaccine can cause, which shouldn't be completely ignored either. It can also cause an allergic reaction, although I think those are pretty rare in this particular vaccine.

And this may surprise you, but not everything an anti-vaxxer says is wrong, it's just generally being applied incorrectly. We do ourselves a disservice by just ignoring everything that anti-vaxxers use to support their arguments though, and it actually ends up further polarizing the issue of vaccines, which is far worse than just letting parents wait a bit to see how things go.

You seem to like to default to the extremes though. This isn't anything like Russian roulette. Russian roulette has a high chance of lethality. This is barely a gamble. In fact, getting vaccinated is still its own gamble because of possible adverse reactions. The odds simply favor getting the vaccine rather than the virus. That's one of the things that drug safety profiles are meant to establish.

&gt; There were 27 passengers near him on the flight for Naha, according to the prefectural government, seven of whom it has not yet been able to reach. None of the other 20 passengers have reported positive tests for the virus.

&gt; ‚ÄúIt is deeply regrettable because the case could lead to expanding the infections in the prefecture,‚Äù a prefectural official said.

&gt; The infected passenger, a man in his 20s who belongs to Camp Foster in Okinawa, arrived at the airport near Tokyo on Oct. 30 on a flight from the United States, prefectural officials said.

&gt; He tested positive at a quarantine station at the airport. It is not known why he was not put under quarantine.

&gt; According to the prefecture, it is a common practice that if persons related to the U.S. military test positive at an airport, other military personnel come out to pick them up and then isolate them inside the base.

&gt; But the man took a flight from Narita Airport to Naha Airport in Okinawa Prefecture on Oct. 31, according to the prefecture. He then made his way to Camp Foster spanning Kitanakagusuku village and other municipalities using a friend's car.

&gt; He later tested positive in a COVID-19 test conducted by the U.S. military. During questioning by U.S. military officials, he admitted that he had tested positive at Narita Airport. The U.S. military reported this case to the prefectural government on Nov. 1.

&gt; Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno at a Nov. 16 news conference said that following the incident, the government asked the U.S. military in Japan to thoroughly take countermeasures for border control and to prevent such a case from happening again.

&gt; Matsuno reported that the U.S. military said the man would face disciplinary action and told the government that it would ""issue a harsh response over this case, including punishing the man.‚Äù

&gt; He said that the U.S. military assured him that, ‚ÄúWe will take this case seriously and have warned all U.S. military personnel in Japan that they should comprehensively comply with measures to prevent the spread of the infection.""

&gt; The prefecture is asking the foreign and health ministries to investigate the causes of the case and provide an explanation about why it was allowed to occur.

Overall, your risk is very low but its a real concern. Most people that did get it, were able to get it resolved. It is a very serious condition and not every persons was resolved. Additionally, the tracking in the US for symptoms is terrible. So many people in these forums saying, my heart was racing, etc. - was that from fever? Was that bad? Did it cause damage? We haven't tested it. We don't really know the effects of the booster yet. We don't know timing, we dont know how long it lasts, etc. We should have never gotten the 2nd dose 3-4 weeks after the first to begin with. Even the main pfizer/moderna research studies showed 1 shot was still increasing in antibodies when we got the first. So yes this is all rushed. Yes you have a right to ask these questions and be concerned. No 99% of the people on this forum are not doctors, epidemologists, etc.

Yes‚Ä¶it absolutely does. If there is zero Covid in the state then this stat will say there are zero hospitalized per 100k in the unvaccinated population. Using your math, you could extrapolate that if everyone in the state had Covid there would be no hospitalizations. 

This stat is not a constant that happens regardless of caseload. It‚Äôs a snapshot of current hospitalizations, which is a *product* of current caseload. If cases continue to rise, hospitalizations per population will also rise, as a higher proportion of the population has Covid, which you can [literally see in my original link. ](https://public.tableau.com/views/VaccineBreakthrough_16310446543620/State?%3Alanguage=en-US&amp;%3Adisplay_count=y&amp;%3Aorigin=viz_share_link%3Adevice&amp;%3AshowVizHome=no&amp;%3Adevice=desktop)

When a virus becomes endemic this means it shifts through the population in waves. We have seen this for other endemic coronaviruses aswell:

https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6530/741 Immunological characteristics govern the transition of COVID-19 to endemicity

&gt; The rapid rise in both IgM and IgG seroprevalence indicates that primary infection with all four endemic HCoV strains happens early in life, and our analysis of these data gives us an estimate for the mean age of primary infection (MAPI) between 3.4 and 5.1 years, with almost everyone infected by age 15 (see SM section 1 for details). The absence of detectable IgM titers in any individual over the age of 15 years suggests that reinfection of adults causes a recall response, indicating that while HCoV-specific immunity may wane, it is not lost. Whether immunity would wane to na√Øve levels in the absence of high pathogen circulation remains an open question.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1083-1 Seasonal coronavirus protective immunity is short-lasting

&gt; We monitored healthy individuals for more than 35 years and determined that reinfection with the same seasonal coronavirus occurred frequently at 12 months after infection.

https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613(21)00404-0#relatedArticles Transition to endemicity: Understanding COVID-19

&gt; When an infection becomes endemic, there are different ways in which immunity provides protection without eliminating the virus from the population, such as by a reduction in susceptibility to infection (IES) or by a reduction in pathology (IEP). In the case of viruses against which infection does not generate life-long immunity, including SARS-CoV-2, it will be important to understand how these different aspects of protection wane with time and how they are boosted by natural infection and vaccination.

Good to know and thank you for the reassuring information! When I found out about the mandatory vaccination today I was actually getting really scared that the punishment for refusing to get vaccinated could  end up to be even more severe. 

Are you sure that going to prison for not getting vaccinated isn‚Äôt going to show up in my criminal record or is this still something that‚Äôs left to be decided? 
I have no criminal record and I‚Äôd like it to stay that way obviously.

I‚Äôve read that the fine for not getting vaccinated can be as high as 25.000‚Ç¨ if I‚Äôm not mistaken? 

So I think I‚Äôm in all likelihood going to jail for a couple of days (or maybe weeks if necessary).

Do you think that this is going to be a one time penalty and after my time in jail I‚Äôm good to go and allowed to walk freely?

I‚Äôm not an anti-vaxxer by the way. 
It‚Äôs just that my mothers friend died shortly after the vaccine from a cerebral vein thrombosis and I just can‚Äôt overcome my fear of the vaccines.

Evidence suggests that airborne transmission of infectious respiratory aerosol plays an important role for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This work characterized respiratory aerosol emissions from a panel of healthy individuals of varying age and sex while talking and singing in a controlled laboratory setting. Particle number concentrations between 0.25 and 33 Œºm were measured from 63 participants aged 12‚Äì61 years with concurrent monitoring of voice volume and exhaled CO2 levels. On average, singing produced 77% (95% CI: 42,109%) more aerosol than talking, adults produced 62% (CI: 27,98%) more aerosol than minors, and males produced 34% (CI: 0,70%) more aerosol than females. After accounting for participant voice volume and exhaled CO2 (both of which were positively correlated with aerosol emissions) in linear models, the age and sex differences were attenuated and no longer statistically significant. These results support further investigation of voice volume and CO2 as indicators of infection risk indoors.",,,,1637331495,,{},hl997tn,True,t3_qxh3sa,False,False,t3_qxh3sa,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qxh3sa/respiratory_aerosol_emissions_from_vocalization/hl997tn/,1637670158.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Again, decision is yours but stuff like ‚Äúthis is new‚Äù and ‚Äúlong term side effects‚Äù when it‚Äôs been over a year since folks in the trials got their shots and vaccines leave your body so quickly are not valid reasons.

Because the studies show that's apparently not necessary. Vaccines, and the immune system in general, are strange and unintuitive. More does not necessarily mean better, it may mean just wasting vaccine. I think the intuition here is that you want to present the immune system with enough of the threat that it notices but any more than that doesn't make the immune system notice more, it just means the immune system is wasting effort fighting off more of a fake threat.

No, the third shot is identical to the first two (with the exception of Moderna being at a lower dose).

SARS-CoV-2 doesn't mutate quickly.  It's actually fairly stable/slow mutating as viruses go.  As such, the likelihood of persistent every-x-months vaccinations is low.  

What we're seeing is decreased effectiveness of the vaccine due to time.  This is a normal things for vaccines.  [Several childhood vaccines are multi-dose affairs](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html).  

My guess (purely a guess) is that we'll need three, four, or five doses total.  The first two shots at a month interval (Pfieser and Moderna) will eventually be viewed as a single dose and the normal-for-other-vaccines two-to-four dose schedule will be in effect to give lasting protection.

So what this study is essentially saying is that COVID is affecting the brain negatively in the long term. If it is causing this particular issue in so many, then what else is it doing to the brains of those who have had it? Sometimes things that seem inconsequential can lead to major breakthroughs in our understanding. In this case a rather minor long term symptom points to a long term neurological change, which means we are missing a lot of what long haul COVID is really affecting. This tells us that we need to keep looking at what COVID does to our brains and how it might be changing the way they work.",,,,1637281561,,{},hl6wj3u,False,t3_qx2khz,False,False,t1_hl6uw2d,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qx2khz/more_than_a_million_people_in_the_us_may_not_have/hl6wj3u/,1637625454.0,37,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As you pointed out it is very rare, but that doesn‚Äôt make it less real. It‚Äôs possible you would have gotten lucky if you got Covid instead of the vaccine and been fine, or maybe somehow the impact means Covid would have hit you extremely hard, we just don‚Äôt know at this point.

I can‚Äôt imagine experiencing that with no idea when it would stop or how bad it could get, just like some of these people with long Covid or other less understood situations; I feel nothing but sympathy.

So many choices in this pandemic feel like a roll of the dice to some extent, but at least with the vaccine the odds are more favorable and you have some level of control. I hope you‚Äôre able to arrange things (e.g. time off work) once you need the booster so you can get full protection from it once/if your current immunization starts to wane, and even better if you don‚Äôt have the same side effects. I would focus on trying to get good sleep, less stress (easier said than done), eating healthy, etc before your booster because while they didn‚Äôt cause the problems alone, those things can add on to inflammation and reactions to make any reaction worse.

Germany having a low vaccination rate won't help, of course, but cases are rising at a significant (but slightly slower) rate in many of their neighbours.

One other theory is that it's Germany's relatively low rate of previous infections that's giving it problems now, because that would otherwise cover quite a lot of the unvaccinated (and give an immunity boost to the quite a lot of the vaccinated). But that doesn't explain the Netherlands, which is growing at Germany's speed and had as many recorded infections (per capita) as USA, UK and other high-infection countries.

A new variant would have been detected by now, surely...

Germany has had very strict mask rules for ages now too, and doesn't seem to have slowed down it's case growth vs. neighbouring countries with less strict rules.

Getting a bit meta: the thing I'm most concerned about is the fact that so few commentators with influence (e.g. prominent scientists, not just randoms on Reddit like me) have talked about this, but have instead cherry-picked single examples to make a crude point that could easily be invalidated by looking at all the available data.",,,,1637354559,,{},hlavwyz,False,t3_qxhpgg,False,False,t1_hl9gy2x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qxhpgg/disease_control_chief_all_of_germany_is_one_big/hlavwyz/,1637704512.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes, administering boosters now will still result in humoral immunity fading over time. But the current data out of Israel shows this time period is extended to at least 9-10 months. Possibly more, we will need to wait for the end of the study.

of course there is. There are several more studies. 

\&gt; Waiting longer between doses means longer time at risk for disease, as one dose has little efficacy against delta.

That was the logic at the time and I'm not sure it was wrong. But it isn't optimal for long term protection.

This part is not correct. Vaccines very much do lower transmission rates. The same way they lower risk of severe symptoms. By lowering the risk of infection dramatically. An unvaccinated person is magnitudes more infectious than a vaccinated one. Even in breakthrough cases.

&gt;In the absence of a 95-99% vaccination rate there are going to be huge spikes. 

This is also not accurate. The vaccination rate needed to achieve herd immunity depends on the infection rate or how infectious the disease is. For Delta it's 85 - 90%.

Also knowingly having an STD and then engaging in unprotected sex without the other person knowing is a crime in most places

Also, I'm not gonna catch the STD the check out person at the grocery store has, like you can with a communicable disease like Covid

Portugal has great vaccination rates, yet their cases are rising. Its a given that everyone not vaccinated will catch the virus and might face severe illness. Everyone will catch covid again and again, probably.
About the future of covid in israel: it depends. On how many get vaccinated, boostered and how government reacts when cases are rising. When a new wave just starts to build up small NPIs can be enough to stop it.

hmmmm....I can think of a few:

1) have more than one freaking impfzentrum to cover a city of over 1 million people, not to mention locate it more centrally so that people didn't have to travel an hour or more each way to get there.  I can't even count how many people I know who tried to book a vaccine there for months and couldn't get in.  Most of us got our shots purely due to random luck - my doc was one of few offering the vaccine and since I've been a patient for years I got in - he unfortunately could not take randoms as it's a small office and they just don't have the capacity while maintaining normal care for other patients.  Most others finally got vaccinated when their employers arranged shots for their teams and their families.  It took a long time for employer sponsored vaccinations to even begin as  there was, as usual, a big regulatory kerfuffel around it.

2) even without mandatory vaccinations, they sure as hell could have introduced 2G rules months ago

3) nix the re-opening of bars and clubs until we were well out of the woods.  

4) sending a big pile of unvaxed kids back to school...also not really on.  Yeah I get the concerns about not letting them return to some normalcy, but I know TWO families whose kids have tested positive just in the last two weeks.

And the best part is, the smaller markets all around the city have not been cancelled (yet), just the big one at Marienplatz.  So guess where all the people who want to hit a market are going to go?

&gt; Additionally, most kids actually recover just fine, despite what a lot of headlines seem to be pushing, significantly reducing the actual benefit of the vaccine in that age group (not to say there is no benefit at all; there certainly is).

These are straight up antivaxx talking points, sorry.  MOST people in the world recover just fine from COVID.  The benefit of the vaccine at the individual level is reduced the younger you are, the healthier you are.  That's obvious.  But the benefit is still there.  There were still thousands of hospitalized children in the US.  Kids are still spreading the virus and fueling the pandemic, just like anyone else.  If the benefit wasn't there, the FDA/CDC wouldn't advise getting vaccinated.  Do you vaccinate your children for the flu?  If you're like most people, the answer is yes.  Why?  Most kids recover just fine from the flu, don't they?

&gt; While we don't know about longterm consequences of covid

Here is where the argument completely falls apart.  We already have tons of evidence of all sorts of things that COVID **does** cause in **some** people.  We're still in the infancy of figuring all of this out, it will take years to truly assess all of this.  What we do in fact know, is that the vaccine **doesn't** do any of those things.  Frankly it can't, because there is no virus in the vaccine.  The only thing that the vaccine can elicit is myocarditis, inflammation caused by the immune system.  The same exactl inflammation that is caused by the virus, except at a much reduced rate.  Further mitigated by a very small dose of the vaccine for the little ones.

&gt; vaccinated people still get covid (I sure did)

You're aware that the point of the vaccine is to make sure the virus your immune system is encountering is known to it, right?  Allowing production of antibodies swiftly and efficiently.  In a matter that doesn't give the virus enough time to cause any significant damage.  Hence why efficacy against bad outcomes is so great.  Not getting infected is a cherry on top of having high antibody count on hand.
&gt; waiting a bit for more data doesn't mean that their child will get covid during that period

Of course it doesn't.  But neither is not wearing your seatbelt on the next run to the grocery store.

Later examples like [Typhoid Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Mallon) simply confirmed this.

""Informed consent"", my [posterior]. 

We, the actually informed people of the world, have ever right to protect ourselves against delusional science deniers who refuse to participate in protecting the weaker members of society from a horrible death.

What you are really saying is this: ""One person's right to irrational and unjustified beliefs and actions is much more important than everyone else's right not to die horribly.""

This is just unreasonable. When covid isn't rampant everywhere, yes. But while there's constantly people around you with it, it's completely wrong to say people shouldn't boost to prevent the mild and moderate infections associated with waning immunity. Long covid risk is cut in half, but still present. We don't know the long term implications of some of the damage we're finding from even mild and moderate cases; if long covid can impact the vaccinated, this likely can too. It can still knock you on your ass for a week; how privileged to assume everyone can just miss work for that long without it being a problem severe enough to warrant boosters. It's also just unpleasant and worth avoiding when there's no serious downside to boosters. What about spread? There's very valid reasons to control spread by allowing boosters; especially for people living with vulnerable individuals.

Well all right I wouldn't have gone dancing because I've got a common cold and so am staying home, but you get the point.

I am most certainly not under the impression that we can eliminate COVID just by vaccinating everyone twice. Even though it's not yet official policy here in the Netherlands I fully expect to receive a booster next spring. The elderly and people with comorbidities/ immune system diseases will probably need a yearly or maybe even halfyearly booster for the foreseeable future. Although the judge is still out on whether the 3rd shot will provide more durable immunity, at least in the healthy, younger part of the population. Maybe it will and the 3rd shot will be the last one for me for the time being. What sufficient vaccination **does** do however (and this has been proven beyond a doubt) is massively reduce the chance of hospitalization and death. Even now that vaccine effectiveness in more vulnerable cohorts (elderly and people with comorbidities) is starting to wane. So the more you vaccinate, the more open society can remain because the strain on the healthcare system is lower, even during autumn and winter.

So yes, the only way to get a more or less normally functioning society back is get to that 90+% fully vaccinated one way or another, whether ""fully vaccinated"" means 2 or 3 shots for you (for me it's still 2 because I received my second shot at the end of july) at this point.",,,,1637340023,,{},hl9tjfv,False,t3_qxcmdk,False,False,t1_hl9h9fe,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qxcmdk/austria_enforces_mandatory_vaccination_starting/hl9tjfv/,1637681826.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

these pills seem good to avoid hospitalizations. their main goal is to keep unvaccinated and high risk people out of the hospital when they start experiencing covid symptoms (mild to moderate). however, USA (and many others) are still fixated on case counts rather than hospitalizations. my understanding is that these pills do not reduce spread/transmission.

what we're still missing is a treatment option, in pill form, when an individual ends up in the hospital (severe covid). something that is easy to administer. this is where rigel's fostamatinib is ahead of the game.
