[],,GreunLight,,,[],,,,text,t2_bz91eiwq,False,True,,"&gt; Most studies published recently show evidence of this. 

If that were true you would have linked ‘em by now. ;)

Vaccinated is better, stronger, or longer-lasting than “natural.”

&gt; Some people who get COVID-19 receive no protection from reinfection – their natural immunity is nonexistent. A recent study found that 36% of COVID-19 cases didn't result in development of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The people had different levels of illness – most had moderate disease, but some were asymptomatic and some experienced severe COVID-19. 

…

&gt; Natural immunity can decay within about 90 days. Immunity from COVID-19 vaccines has been shown to last longer. Both Pfizer and Moderna reported strong vaccine protection for at least six months. 

&gt; Studies are ongoing to evaluate the full duration of protective immunity, including the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.

&gt; Real-world studies also indicate natural immunity's short life. For example, 65% of people with a lower baseline antibody from infection to begin with completely lost their COVID-19 antibodies by 60 days.

…

&gt; What about that Israeli study suggesting natural immunity is stronger? Infectious diseases expert James Lawler, MD, MPH, FIDSA, carefully evaluates the study design of the retrospective Maccabi Health System study in his Aug. 31 briefing. **In the briefing, he identifies two concerning sources of error that were not corrected for: survivorship bias and selection bias.**

…

&gt; **Furthermore, there is no country on the globe in which natural infection and natural immunity has brought the pandemic under control. In countries like Iran or Brazil very high levels of natural infection have not prevented recurrent waves of infection.**

&gt; •	⁠Natural immunity fades faster than vaccine immunity

&gt; •	⁠Natural immunity alone is less than half as effective than natural immunity plus vaccination

&gt;""Notably, numerous doctors and some prominent experts who themselves received the J.&amp;J. vaccine have chosen to receive a follow-up Moderna or Pfizer vaccine. The list includes Bill Enright, a biotechnology C.E.O.; Zoë McLaren, a health economist; and Angela Rasmussen, a prominent virologist. The city of San Francisco also began offering a Moderna or Pfizer booster shot to J.&amp;J. recipients about a month ago.
There is little data on these vaccine combinations, which is probably the biggest reason to be cautious. But there is data on another relevant combination.
The AstraZeneca vaccine — which is being given in many countries but not the U.S. — is similar in design to the J.&amp;J. vaccine. Many people in Europe and Canada received AstraZeneca for their first shot and Pfizer for their second, and they appear to be faring well.
This approach is sometimes described as “mix and match,” and it makes some intuitive sense. People are receiving the immunity benefits of two different types of vaccines.

&gt;“I think I did the right thing to make sure I am as protected as possible from the Delta variant and thus am protecting others who only have one shot,” Rasmussen wrote in June. “Sometimes public health requires making tough decisions without a complete data set to support it.”
Dr. Leana Wen of George Washington University told us: “I feel strongly that the federal government needs to allow boosters for J.&amp;J. recipients.”
During a podcast interview this summer, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the C.D.C., declined to discourage J.&amp;J. recipients from seeking out a Moderna or Pfizer shot. She said there was not enough data to be sure about the benefits and risks. But when Andy Slavitt, the podcast host and a former Biden adviser, asked her whether she would describe it as a “huge mistake,” Walensky replied, “Not with what I’ve seen so far.”

No one had an anaphylactic reaction at the pharmacy during the half hour when I was vaccinated.  An ER nurse would have a different perspective because they would be exposed to patients with anaphylactic reactions multiple times since vaccinations started. 

Along the same lines, hospital workers haven't been infecting their patients the way nursing home workers did.  It's difficult to give them a rational reason why they need to vaccinate if they haven't caught COVID for the past 18 months, took care of the sickest COVID patients, saw patients with extreme negative vaccine side effects, and haven't clearly infected any of their patients.  To them, a vaccine mandate is an admission from the hospital that it is no longer going to implement the precautions that kept them safe during the pandemic.  

The logical argument to use with this group is to explain that their risks of catching COVID outside of the hospital have increased dramatically, and the point of the vaccine is to protect all of us from overloading the Healthcare system.  It's likely that they HAVE seen their own hospital become overloaded.  It's important to focus on this reasoning, and not ""bUt tHe PaTieNts aRe at Risk!!!"" because at this point it's well known that vaccinated people can spread COVID, and hospital workers are more frequently exposed to strains that break through the vaccine.  They're all trained in logic, but their background knowledge and experience of COVID is very different than most of ours.

The same thing applies to the flu. Now, the flu mutates more than most diseases, which is why they need to reformulate the vaccine every year. But strains often have certain similarities, where even a not-exact match provides at least partial protection. Every year you get a flu vaccine, you're basically adding to your index of overall flu resistance. It's not a guarantee, but if there's a bad match in the future or you miss out on that year's vaccine, you are more likely to have built up at least some resistance.

Until there's evidence that there's more flu than that going around, I don't think a flu shot is necessary if you're not high-risk.

With continuing social distancing happening (albeit much less than a year ago), the flu may not return for yet another year.

&gt; There are two distinct potential uses for an additional dose:

&gt; • Additional dose after an initial primary vaccine series: administration of an additional vaccine dose when the initial immune response following a primary vaccine series is likely to be insufficient.

&gt; • Booster dose: a dose of vaccine administered when the initial sufficient immune response to a primary vaccine series is likely to have waned over time

A 3rd shot for immune compromised, a month after dose 2 is an attempt to bring immunity up to what others get after 1 or 2 doses.

So far, the data we do have shows that an extra dose of JnJ after 6 months of the first dose will outperform Moderna/Pfizer! So these very smart people in your quote are potentially adopting a mixed vaccine method too early, and while it might not be dangerous, they could actually be making themselves less protected than they would be by just waiting for the proper booster. 

If there was any evidence at all that one dose of JnJ was dangerous I think the case would be different. But that evidence does not exist. In fact the robust nursing studies out of South Africa show that one dose of JnJ might actually be better than two doses of Moderna/Pfizer against Delta! 

There is no reason to rush a booster with JnJ, that's the point. 

Anyone rushing it is playing a game or looking for attention, simple as that! 

Additionally it can't be discounted that Pfizer and Moderna stand to make billions from booster shots and they are pushing them for more than scientific reasons.

With chronic diseases, medicine can treat symptoms / complications but most MDs don't have the knowledge to educate, or time to persuade patients, about the diet, exercise and lifestyle issues that underlie chronic disease. Easier to write scripts for statins and metformin, which insurance will cover, than to refer to a lifestyle medicine MD or competent RD, which insurance often won't.

Were it not for the income losses to the medical industry, I think we'd have general advice like 1) by all means, seek medical treatment for symptomatic issues, but 2) medicine won't save you from your shitty lifestyle choices: you need to fix that yourselves, and 3) screening is more likely to result in false positives or overtreatment than to improve your health outcomes.",,,,1632690856,{'gid_1': 1},hee8zlw,False,t3_pvzgxw,False,True,t1_hedz1ey,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pvzgxw/a_25yearold_who_had_to_get_a_double_lung/hee8zlw/,1632826794.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

And in a separate report that looked at Arizona’s two most populous counties, the agency found that schools without mask requirements were 3.5 times as likely to experience an outbreak than schools with them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Though polls show that a majority of parents support mask requirements — and despite recommendations from pediatricians and the CDC — schools remain bitterly divided over whether to implement them. Opponents of mask mandates say parents should get to decide whether their children wear them.  
&gt;  
&gt;The pandemic has already taken a toll on the new school year. In a third report, the CDC said more than 900,000 students in 44 states had been affected by closures between Aug. 1 and mid-September. Many schools are contending with challenges on multiple fronts, including outbreaks that force staff to quarantine and staff shortages that make it difficult to find replacements.  
&gt;  
&gt;The CDC looked at pediatric case data for about 17% of U.S. counties and found that, on average, pediatric cases rose after schools reopened. But counties without mask requirements saw larger increases — about 18 cases per 100,000 more — than those with them. Among the counties the CDC studied, a majority — about 62% — did not have school mask mandates.

The fact that there are parents out there that don't think children should be wearing masks is proof that parents shouldn't be making this decision for their kids.  Mask requirements save lives.

This is objectively false.  Here is a list of the most vaccinated countres:

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-vaccinations-tracker.html

Sort by ""fully vaccinated""

[Portugal](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/portugal/), very few deaths over the last few months.

[Malta](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/malta), 10% of their total deaths in the last 5 months

[UAE](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/united-arab-emirates/), chart speaks for itself

[Singapore](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) might be an exception but they have **13** deaths per million over the entire pandemic.  The last four months for them are equivalent to *one day* here in the US.

[Qatar](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/qatar), [Spain](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/spain), [Iceland](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/iceland).  The trend is clear.  Countries which actually have *the vast majority* vaccinated are doing great.

You might be thinking Israel, which is everyone's favorite anti-vax propaganda these days.  62% is not nearly enough for herd immunity vs Delta, which has a herd immunity threshold of 85% or so.  Even so, the *vast majority* of deaths there are among the unvaxxed.

Waning immunity is a red herring - the vax still stops almost all deaths after several months, and there are not many vaccine protocols which end after 2 shots.

The thing is they don't even think it's a risk.  Look at it this way, what does the vaccine offer?  Depending on the study and what vaccine you get it offers you anywhere from 80-95% immunity against covid.  If you do happen to get covid your chances of getting a serious infection go down significantly.  If you do get a serious infection your chances of needing to be hospitalized are greatly diminished.  If you do need hospitalization your chances of dying are next to zero.  Those are great benefits.  The problem is 90% of anti-vaxxers think they **already** have those benefits without getting vaxxed.  Why would you take a shot that isn't going to do anything at all for you?

From the article:

&gt; The American Association of Poison Control Centers reported **1,440 cases of ivermectin poisoning this year through Sept. 20**, which is more than triple the number during the same period in 2019 and 2020.

…

&gt; States across the country are reporting a staggering number of calls about the drug to poison control centers. **The health authorities in Mississippi reported last month that 70 percent of recent calls were about ivermectin. In Oregon, 25 people reported ivermectin poisoning between Aug. 1 and Sept. 14, Oregon Health &amp; Science University reported. Five of those people were hospitalized, including two who were admitted to an intensive care unit**.

…

&gt; New Mexico poison control centers have also seen a sharp increase in calls about the drug — 24 cases since November of 2020, compared to two between January and November of 2019, state health authorities said. **Fourteen of this year’s cases were hospitalized after taking the drug, and two of them died, the state reported on Wednesday**.

…

&gt; **Dr. Scrase said in an interview on Saturday that using ivermectin to treat Covid was like taking an antacid for a heart attack. “It’s the wrong medicine for something really serious,” he said.**

About me, I'm 36 right now, I got sick at the end of December of 2020, my first Symtomps started on 25 of december. 

Day 1 and 2 I felt bad, like a very strong flu but I could stand normally and do my things, I never left my home

Day 6 I could barely eat anything, the only thing I could take without making me sick was liquid supplements or very clear soups.

Day 10 and 11 I really felt bad, I was always on bed and it was very difficult to stand normally, I always kept an Oxymeter with me and on those day my oxygen levels were on 80 on day 10, and then on 70 on day 11.

Day 11 I didn't slept, I my breathing was irregular and I was very anxious, I knew I had to go to the hospital and I glad I did.

After being intubated 7 days, and then another 2 weeks on hospital,ICUs are not like the horror stories that some people think, is pretty boring not being able to move and being stuck with a lot of tubes on your body, I was never concious when I was intubated but being forced into a respitator to breath normally for 2 days feels awful, non stop noise while you force your mind to imagine other things to not get crazy.

My voice wasn't the same after that,  talking tired me a lot, and had to learn how to eat normal food again, took me 3 months to feel ""normal"" again after a lot of physical therapy.",,,,1632635259,{},hebbzso,False,t3_pv63uy,False,False,t1_heb5ni3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pv63uy/no_vaccinated_person_under_40_has_died_of_covid19/hebbzso/,1632772201.0,17,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,michaelthecoder,,,[],,,,text,t2_llftk,False,False,[],"I have a degree in math, your thought process is largely correct but you do have some numbers that are a bit off.

First, the US population is around 330 million, not sure why you got 450 million.

Second, using pre-Delta numbers your 99% is a bit low. The case fatality rate (CFR) is around 2%, but that only includes official cases. What you are after is the infection fatality rate (IFR), which pre-Delta was around 0.5%. Now I'm assuming that Delta doesn't change deaths, which quite possibly is a bad assumption, but for now that's the best I can do.

Third, not everyone is going to get COVID, despite what it seems. I've heard that the current estimate for its R0 is around 8 with Delta. This means that around 12.5% of the population will never be vaccinated or infected. This isn't much, but it's still something. If we assume that vaccines protect 50% of the population, then this leaves us with around 37.5% of the population that will eventually get infected. Note that this part is a bit handwavy, as plenty of people got infected before having a chance to be vaccinated but we'll end up with more than 50% of the population fully vaccinated, so I'm making a massive assumption that those two inaccuracies cancel each other out. 

Finally, we put this all together. 330 million \* .375 percent infected \* .005 infection fatality rate gives us 618,750 deaths. As we have already surpassed this, that means that either Delta is deadlier or we are pretty much towards the end of COVID. Unfortunately, the one bit I have seen about Delta is that it might be causing twice as many hospitalization risk in the unvaccinated, so if that causes twice as many deaths compared to Alpha, then that could be bad. Still, I don't really see a way that the number of deaths would go over a million let alone over 2 million unless we get a strain that significantly breaks through immunity.",,,,1632612525,{},hea3rdr,False,t3_puxrut,False,False,t1_he7xuat,/r/Coronavirus/comments/puxrut/when_will_the_pandemic_end_models_project_a/hea3rdr/,1632747434.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are a few issues with closing up too often here though. One is that we have very poor and very isolated populations, so there’s a major technology barrier and the fact that schools provide much needed food for some families.

But the time I got home, I was sweating profusely, my throat felt like it had glass in it, I couldn't breathe through my nose, had an awful deep wet cough, and body aches were intense. Went to the doctor and tested positive for the flu, bronchitis, and strep throat all at once with possible pneumonia. Second worse I've felt from being sick behind COVID-19 in my entire life. The doctor flippantly joked that they wonder how I'm still alive. 

My lungs never really recovered all of the way from that. I have always been really susceptible to URIs, but after that it's like a magnification effect.

Breakthrough infections are startlingly prevalent and quite dangerous and damaging, with only a bit north of 60% vaccine protection against hospitalization for seniors, and only about 42% protection against infection. That's similar to what Israel found, suggestion a sharp drop-off of immunity. The odds ratios of hospitalization are 2.5 at six months versus 3-4 months. That's with a mix of Pfizer-Moderna weighted a bit more to Moderna.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10659718/ Consequences of alcohol consumption on host defence 

Recently this gained media coverage due to this:

&gt; Above all, media reports about the top Russian medical officer had caused uncertainty. Anna Popowa is said to have advised citizens to abstain from alcohol for at least 56 days. Tatiana Golikova, Vice Prime Minister of Russia, set a somewhat shorter period. She recommended abstinence for 42 days after injecting the corona vaccine Sputnik V, reports Deutsche Welle.

&gt; Not all experts in the country agree with this long abstinence, as advised according to media reports in Russia. For example, medical expert Alexander Gintsburg contradicts these requirements on the Twitter account “Sputnik V”, even calling them “fake news”. He is one of the developers of the vaccine and emphasizes that moderate consumption is allowed and that it is advisable to do without it for a period of three days. 

Its also known that vaccines can cause reactions like joint pain, highened temperature, fatigue. Alcohol will increase those symptoms. Its generally advised to reduce any stress after vaccination.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4590612/ Alcohol and the Immune System

&gt; Clinicians have long observed an association between excessive alcohol consumption and adverse immune-related effects such as susceptibility to pneumonia,”  “Alcohol disrupts immune pathways in complex and seemingly paradoxical ways.”

&gt; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17922947/  Moderate alcohol consumption and the immune system: a review 

&gt; Alcohol can also impair key immune cells in the lungs and damage epithelial cells that line the lungs' surface (where COVID-19 can also attack). ”Often, the alcohol-provoked lung damage goes undetected until a second insult, such as a respiratory infection, leads to more severe lung diseases,”  “Alcohol consumption does not have to be chronic to have negative health consequences. In fact, research shows that acute binge drinking also affects the immune system.”

I don’t disagree with you, the Republican Party is racist; but not all Republicans are and while I don’t see the party splitting in two; there is definitely two contingents within the party the outright racist and the ones who tolerate / use them for their own gain.",,,,1632660301,{},hec9clp,False,t3_pvg7da,False,False,t1_hec41tv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pvg7da/idaho_morgues_are_running_out_of_space_for_bodies/hec9clp/,1632790192.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,True

But if they require it for students, I'm sure a counter argument would be ""what about requirements for teachers/staff?"" If not enough staff want the vaccine, then you increase the already significant teacher/staff shortage. 

I also agree that virtual learning should occur at least temporarily until school districts can get these decisions squared away. However, although many individuals still fail to realize this, our local economies (mostly) rely on schools being open. Close schools and businesses have to accommodate their employees. People stay home, watch their children, complete work, don't grab that AM coffee/muffin etc. Moreover, teachers had a tough time transitioning into virtual --- some are burnt out, some quit/retired because of it. 

In my opinion --- if districts decide to close and go virtual, it needs to be a coordinated effort with local businesses, hospitals, etc. That way when the decision is announced, it's not the school district receiving backlash.

Again, completely agree with you. As a vaccinated employee of a school district and a husband to a pregnant 2nd grade teacher --- I at least would prefer virtual until elementary aged students can receive the vaccine.

**If** they work as they would appear to, it probably is a pretty good idea for treating a relatively small space, although that many filters could get expensive. The one big doubt I have is whether or not an axial fan (that is, a ""normal"" fan in the style of a box fan or ceiling fan) could produce enough static pressure to force a reasonable amount of air through the box. Most air handlers use centrifugal fans for that exact reason: they produce a higher static pressure to force the air through filters, coils, and ducts.

I actually think it might be a better idea to use a single filter attached to a box fan, sealed tight with mastic or another strong tape. HOWEVER, I think the biggest factor to making it successful would be to use a four-inch or two-inch thick filter instead of the common one-inch thick filters.

We do have a lot of data on long-term consequences, and they are much more common with a more severe infection, which are well prevented by the 2 dose regime. 

It's unlikely there would be any substantial harm from getting a booster so go for it. But it's still important to know that the data supporting it weak/speculative, and accept that you might be need to get another booster if they find it's substantially effective at 12 months (a small harm from rushing a booster might mean you have to wait for the proper booster longer).

Both circumstances occur so rarely that it shouldn't be a financial burden to allocate funding to the ~5%-13% of people the vaccine isn't guaranteed to be effective for (Pfizer has an 87%-95% efficacy rate I believe), and the even smaller percentage of people who may suffer potential adverse reactions. I know we have a payout program for the latter group, but studies researching how many people actually receive money from the program are dismally small (something like 30 in 150-200 cases).


Considering how many people are vaccine hesitant because they want more studies to be done on the potential side effects of the vaccines before they take them, and considering the fact that while the vaccine is free, the treatment for an adverse reaction most certainly is not, I believe we could get vaccination up to at least 90% if we could guarantee free or reduced cost healthcare treatment to anyone who suffers an adverse reaction, as well as anyone who requires hospitalization because of a breakthrough case. After all, if you're running the risk of contracting COVID and being hospitalized anyways, I'm sure plenty of people would be willing to take the vaccine if it means the government would foot the bill for hospitalization rather than have to pay for their own treatment.

I just feel like so many people are on the fence because they don't want to put themselves in the hospital and pay exorbitant healthcare bills for taking the vaccine if they have an adverse reaction to it, so they're avoiding it because they don't feel confident it wouldn't happen to them. The reassurance of knowing their doctor visits and hospitalization would be covered is a BIG incentive that would ease a lot of their concerns. Even if we don't get through to enough people with that guarantee, the promise of covering healthcare costs for contracting COVID and requiring hospitalization after being vaccinated would financially incentivize even more holdouts because they know they're running the risk of getting sick and being hospitalized anyways, so having a string attached to free healthcare would seem very appealing.

The World Health Organization is reviving its stalled investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 virus as agency officials warn that time is running out to determine how the pandemic that has killed more than 4.7 million people world-wide began.

A new team of about 20 scientists—including specialists in laboratory safety and biosecurity and geneticists and animal-disease experts versed in how viruses spill over from nature—is being assembled with a mandate to hunt for new evidence in China and elsewhere.

Washington and its allies have been urging the WHO, the United Nations’ public-health arm, to push ahead with a probe. China has resisted, arguing that any new inquiry should focus on other countries, including the U.S.

The possibilities that the new team is charged with examining include whether the Covid-19 virus could have emerged from a lab, according to WHO officials, a hypothesis that has especially angered China.

The new effort comes months after another WHO-led inquiry visited Wuhan, the Chinese city that was the site of the first confirmed Covid-19 outbreak in December 2019. In a final report, the team said the data provided by Chinese scientists during the mission was insufficient to answer the critical questions of when, where and how the virus began spreading.

Biden administration officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have pressed WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus publicly and privately to renew the inquiry, which is likely to include at least one American.

The initiative, as described by WHO officials and Western diplomats and in WHO notices, represents a fresh attempt to advance an investigation that the agency’s own staff has said risks running out of time before evidence such as blood samples are thrown away. Antibodies in the earliest Covid-19 victims are fading to undetectable levels.

The new Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens will be a permanent panel that will help the WHO investigate future outbreaks and identify human activities that raise the risk of the emergence of new diseases.

As part of that mission, it will take charge of a probe into the origin of the current pandemic.

The previous WHO-selected team of about 10 foreign experts that visited Wuhan recommended that their Chinese counterparts analyze blood banks, test farmworkers and further scrutinize the earliest suspected cases. Since then, China hasn’t said whether it has undertaken such work. The original WHO team has been disbanded.

In a press conference last month, WHO officials said that they were aware of new studies being conducted in China, but weren’t informed about the specifics. It isn’t clear if those studies will be made available to the new team.

For months, China’s government has insisted both in public, and in private meetings with Dr. Tedros, that studies on the origins of the virus should now focus on other countries, such as Italy, or on a U.S. military bioresearch facility in Fort Detrick, Md. Dozens of governments aligned with China have sent Dr. Tedros letters in support of Beijing’s position, a person familiar with the letters said.

A spokeswoman for the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases didn’t respond to requests for comment. Few, if any, scientists outside China see the military base as a plausible ground zero for the pandemic. Dr. Tedros has resisted the idea of investigating Fort Detrick, a person with knowledge of those conversations said.

It isn’t clear if the new team, whose members WHO officials say will be chosen by the end of this week, will be able to fly experts into China or make significant progress in resolving the origins debate so long as that deadlock remains.

A WHO spokesman said that the new team’s “priority needs to be data and access in the country where the first reports were identified.”

The Chinese government declined to say whether it would allow a new team into the country. The foreign ministry said in a statement that China has “cooperated fully” with the previous inquiry.

On Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping told the U.N. General Assembly that “China will continue to support and engage in global science-based origins tracing and stands firmly opposed to political maneuvering in whatever form.”

China plans to closely monitor the WHO’s selection of a new team, the foreign ministry said, and Beijing has put forth a number of individuals to be part of it. Chinese authorities heavily conditioned the choice of the original WHO-led team and had to sign off on the final report.

The selection of a new and larger team, drawn from a wider range of countries and areas of expertise, could serve to isolate China diplomatically if its government continues to rebuff pressure, said Lawrence Gostin, faculty director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.

“The question is, will it be enough?” he said. “China still holds all the cards, the WHO lacks power and it’s inconceivable to me that a new committee will be able to negotiate access to China…This is building a beautiful committee with nowhere to go.”

The dispute over whether China should conduct more WHO-recommended research into the origins of the virus that causes Covid-19 has become a point of contention between Beijing and the Biden administration, which has tried to rally allies into supporting the new WHO effort. President Biden and Mr. Xi discussed the issue during a call ahead of last week’s U.N. General Assembly.

Dr. Tedros is seeking a second term as WHO’s director-general, and U.S. support is seen as critical to his chances.

The WHO’s new effort to investigate the origins of the pandemic comes as the U.N. agency is increasingly aligned with some of Washington’s top priorities since the Biden administration reversed President Donald Trump’s decision to leave it.

Those include a more concerted effort to determine whether a lab accident could have sparked the pandemic.

The first WHO-led team of scientists concluded that it was “extremely unlikely” that the virus escaped from a lab. But Dr. Tedros has since said the hypothesis requires more scrutiny than the team—which only spent a few hours in one of Wuhan’s many research centers working with coronaviruses—was able to muster.

Those scientists on that now-disbanded team are allowed to apply to be on the new team. However, they will be competing against hundreds of other applications, which were due by Sept. 17, including several of the world’s most prominent virologists.

Peter Ben Embarek, a Danish food-safety specialist who led the first WHO team, didn’t respond to text messages seeking comment.

It took more than a year after the pandemic began for that original team to get visas and permission to enter China, which repeatedly delayed a probe it saw as an attempt to assign blame.

Once there, scientists on the WHO-led team said that they weren’t given raw data into early suspected Covid-19 patients; that Chinese researchers had conducted antibody tests on those patients long after those tests would be reliable; and that Chinese researchers appeared to have concentrated their animal testing on species that aren’t very susceptible to the virus, such as chickens.

After that visit, the team recommended further testing of animals in China and traders there who deal with wild or farmed mammals that are susceptible to Covid-19. Yet China’s government has shut down such farms across large regions, making it much harder—perhaps even impossible—to establish whether the Covid-19 virus spread to humans via such species, many scientists say.",,,,1632666870,{},hecmrek,False,t3_pvsr0a,False,True,t3_pvsr0a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pvsr0a/who_seeks_to_revive_stalled_inquiry_into_origins/hecmrek/,1632797294.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[For perspective.](https://www.thedailybeast.com/sturgis-rally-is-what-a-vaccine-era-coronavirus-superspreader-event-looks-like)

&gt; But while Southern states have been the main drivers of this surge thus far, the recent spike in cases in South Dakota warrants special concern.

&gt; The state more broadly has witnessed a 686.8 percent increase in daily case counts over the past three weeks, currently more than 10 times the nationwide rate. Meade County’s post-Sturgis uptick is certainly a contributor to this state-level increase, but neighboring counties have experienced a sharp incline in cases, too—ranging from a 1,900 percent increase in the past three weeks in Butte to a 1,050 percent increase in Lawrence.

&gt; Those two counties are also key focal points for the rally, which is not, in reality, confined to Sturgis. And because the rally is widely attended by residents all across South Dakota, it’s not surprising that counties further away—like Charles Mix County, which saw a 1,500 percent increase—are experiencing an incline in cases, too. Indeed, the event could have a regional impact: As the Washington Post reported Thursday, early numbers from local health officials have already connected at least 121 cases in five different states to this year’s rally. It’s possible that these cases might prompt outbreaks of their own and thus should be monitored carefully.

I worked in a school and every winter we'd have flu, strep, Coxsackie, etc. hit in waves of misery and staff shortages that interrupted children's learning. Flu is a public health hazard and makes life very difficult for parents and school staff, especially for parents with little to no paid time off. 

 I work five days a week with the public; I'm vaxxed but I suspect I'll get COVID eventually, and I'm not sitting home biting my nails about it. But I firmly believe children should get the COVID vaccine to protect OTHER people and so that everyone can get back to work/regular life, especially single parents and grandparents who are raising their grandchildren on their own.

If a disease is not very dangerous at all, most people will not take the vaccine. Because their risk calculus uses the statistics you bring up.

For example, most parents don't give their children flu shots. Covid and influenza both kill children in 3 digit figures in a year. But parents don't vaccinate kids against influenza, especially not at 5, despite it being safe, studied for decades, and really only having side effects of a sore arm. Schools don't require kids to get an influenza vaccine, btw.

I don't think you get what I'm saying. I'm not saying the vaccine is dangerous. I've said repeatedly that it isn't. I'm saying that covid is also not notably dangerous to minors so parents have a hard time deciding which highly unlikely event to worry about, and indecision favors the status quo which is not vaccinating.
