Most restaurants operating like this don't need or utilize even 50% of their workers. Who will pay their rents, utilities, and other bills?

&gt; that would ruin the entire family if they folded.

Unemployment will ruin a lot more families than just one. Not saying we should do one or the other, but both.

&gt; There's also the fact that ""millenial restaurants"" have an extremely dysfunctional workplace culture and really deserve to fail so they can be built back into something better.

[citation needed] because most restaurants have highly dysfunctional workplace culture filled with massive amounts of ego. They don't really deserve to fail because you didn't like working at one restaurant, especially if they were doing well pre-COVID. Do the people who rely on that work to pay their bills deserve to sink too?

&gt; weeping and gnashing their teeth because their favourite yuppie restaurant or liberal hipster bar had to shut down.

? A lot of people who are upset are upset because it's an indication of life being fundamentally abnormal for years to come, plus the reality that many of their friends are statistically likely to work at those places and therefore have lost their jobs.

What is different in the new vaccination, is the mRNA, since the virus mutates and changes its proteins. 

This is the same with regular flu vaccines. We have the platform how to replicate the virus with chicken eggs and how to weaken or kill the virus that is produced with the eggs. Every year the flu virus mutates and every year you get a new vaccine with the mutated virus. The vaccine is not mass tested before the vaccination since the platform is considered as save.

This will be the same with the mRNA vaccinations. When the platform is save, you only change the mRNA, but that is the same mRNA that the regular virus also uses to produce its proteins. So it should not need extra heavy testing, since you get the same protein inside your body if you are infected with the normal virus.

They work during the day, their houses aren’t set up to properly care for a disabled adult, and old people with dementia can get violent or confused and present a danger to themselves and others. 

Caring for an elderly person is a draining, thankless job. You don’t get to go on vacation, you don’t get to have hobbies, you don’t get to spend time with your kids. In the last years of their life, all you’ll do is be a nurse and a babysitter. Historically this burden fell on women, which further increased the gender gap and kept women from participating in the workforce and in society as a whole. Nursing homes are part of the reason women can go to school and live their lives in the modern day - because they aren’t automatically expected to be caregivers for all of their aging relatives.  

I used to work in elder care, and nursing homes are an absolute necessity in our modern society. Not everyone has family who are willing and able to care for them, especially since people are having fewer kids and living longer than ever now. And why should we ask entire generations to give up the best years of their life to care for an elderly person in their home, when a properly run retirement community will be best for everyone? 

The key is “properly run,” because greed destroys everything.

What doesn't seem to work are lockdowns, mask mandates, and similar government NPIs.  If something isn't working, the answer isn't do it harder.  The answer is to try something else.

There are a lot of variables that play into covid death rates.  I think you are oversimplifying this to some degree.  Widespread testing of a pathogen is just not possible early on.  It's not like there are millions of generic tests just sitting somewhere waiting to be programmed.  The US is a big place.

Why weren't there outbreaks in Taiwan early on?  There's a ton of mixing from mainland china going on there and it would have been introduced well before any NPIs could have been introduced.  There's some other factor going on it seems.

That's what I've been wondering... if our strategies benefit the evolution of the virus.  I can't really think of a way we can totally beat this thing.  Viruses have been infecting humans and their ancestors for millions of years, they require a host to survive and still manage to persist during all that time while animals were pretty spread out.

It seems like we've got so many reservoirs of virus in the wild and in humans that they animals immune systems work is that a small number of individiual virions will be evasive and subsequently multiply.  Our strategy is to vaccinate so the human immune system can mount a rapid response upon exposure to the real thing.  This seems to be the way because if a vaccinated persons viral load hits say 10,000,000 and then drops and an infected persons is 10,000,000,000 then we are orders of magnitude further away from an evasive mutation.  

We haven't even gotten to the potential for terrorism yet.  An infected person could amplify their virus in cell culture and then mutate it themselves.  UV irradiation will randoly mutate the thing.

How long was the timeframe from final vaccine to end of trial? I’m also wondering about severity of cases and hospitalization with the participants, but I will try to find that into. What is concerning to me historically are several incidents. 
2017 Dengue fever vaccine that had to be pulled because it posed a risk to those without prior infection resulting in a more severe form of the disease.

A particular 1960’s Measles vaccine that made thousands of children get atypical measles after encountering the wild virus. This was characterized by high fever, severe abdominal pain and lung inflammation and often required hospitalization. Not surprising the mistrust now a days as many communities are still resisting this vaccine.

Another 1960’s attempt at a coronavirus vaccine for RSV: Children developed an enhanced form of the disease, often suffering from high fever, bronchopneumonia and wheezing. Dozens ended up being hospitalized and two died. 

And the polio vaccine in 1955 which accidentally deliver live polio in the batches of Cutter Labs vaccine even after testing, resulting in people getting actual polio.  
None of these issues were caught in trials or testing and it took people gradually getting sick to catch the problem and pull these vaccines or batches.

Did you read EVERYTHING that I wrote?

Covid is basically non existent here. Maybe 3 or 4 cases a day.  
I have asthma, so the chances of getting those allergic reactions are 8 times more than normal.  
Having an anaphylaxis shock is not ""safe"".  

The symptoms from covid you mentioned above are still not known if they are long-term or short-term, and also this is a very very small percentage of people who get covid that end up with those symptoms - plus remember those who never show symptoms of having covid, before during or after catching it, so those numbers are even lower.

At least 20 elderly people have died in Europe from having the vaccine - who knows what might happen to younger people in the future?

End of day: the only person who truly can make decisions on your own health and what you do or not do is yourself.

I *will* say that, aside from the holidays, a lot of problems seem to originate with the federal government.

And the feds have been delivering different amounts of vaccine every week, which makes it really hard to plan ahead and schedule people to come in.  And it didn't help that the states originally requested several billion to help plan and organize their vaccination responses, yet none of that money was allocated until mid-December and not disbursed until sometime later.

Part of the issue right now is California tries to focus on preventative measures; get people into the doctor early, and you won’t see as many hospitalizations. It generally works well.

Just not during the pandemic, because we don’t have as many beds per capita as most states.

The vast majority of the state has also been doing far better than the majority of the country. And that’s despite having some of the most densely populated cities in the country. Hell, even including LA, CA as a whole was around 31st for cases per capita last month. This past surge has changed that, but don’t pretend CA hasn’t done well for most of the past year.

D deficiency and high death rate from covid 19 because there is a clear confounding variable; lifestyle and good health. Vitamin d supplementation has been shown time and time again to have wild claims without any evidence. 

It has been shown they have NO EFFECT against cardiovascular disease, cancer, and even for bone health. Which is crazy considering that strengthened bones is the physiological outcome of vitamin d. Its due to the fact that the line for “deficiency” is entirely arbitrary considering that most of the world is “deficient” yet not suffering from any symptoms such as osteoporosis. So please think about this as a whole and question your beliefs, the high correlation of people dying from covid 19 and having low vit. D levels isn’t showing that taking vitamin d supplements is a preventative solution of covid mortality, it is instead showing that those who are old, frail, and have poor lifestyles are just at a greater risk of dying, and we already knew that. Just remember it is a marker of good health and your problems or fears wont be solved with a single nutrient supplement, your time is better spent exercising and improving your diet :).

And yes I’m fine with the reply that its cheap and there is no harm in it but don’t try to substantiate your claims and decisions without evidence and just try to understand that as of yet it is meaningless.

&gt;Banerjee and his colleagues have compiled data from various sources, including the genome study, and used it to create a kind of bio-defense plan to monitor animals

&gt;""And we built this framework, recommending a surveillance protocol. Because it's impossible to survey every animal species,"" explains Banerjee.

&gt;Their formula not only takes into account the animal's ACE-2 risk, but also their potential contact with humans.

&gt;Among the ideas:

&gt;Testing certain zoo animals and their handlers in environments like the San Diego Zoo, where several Gorillas have been diagnosed with the virus. Monitoring agricultural workers and certain animals on farms where populations such as Minks have already been heavily infected. Introducing strict hygiene protocols for transporting animals, and possibly asking veterinarians to routinely monitor cats under their care.

&gt;Since humans are now the most high-profile spreaders, Banerjee says the prospect of the virus being passed back and forth with animals could create new dangers.

&gt;""And the fallback is this virus could jump back into humans, and it could have adapted in this animal, and may become a variant that may escape vaccine mediated immunity,"" Banerjee believes.",,,1611220776,{},gk1n52k,True,t3_l1v0pv,False,False,t3_l1v0pv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l1v0pv/studies_suggest_expanding_precautions_against/gk1n52k/,1611351547,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Last December my state had 5 RSV cases a week.  This December it was over 100/week. Unlikely to be just an artifact of increased surveillance because it’s showing up in hospitalisations too.

Why we don't build immunity for Ad26 after the first shot? How the second shot is effective still?

would it mean that the Oxford vaccine would be ineffective for them due to immunity to the vector?

Of course there is a negligible overlap but you see my point. If it will be a yearly vaccine then how they will use the same vector every year? If they need a different vector I guess they need new trials...

Does it count as descending if you turn back before summit? Then perhaps there was a reason for you to turn back, like a health issue. I think this is not what the saying actually means but that exact wording doesn't rule this off and if this is the case it is true for sure.

Then, assuming you've reached the summit...

As the other comment pointed out, you're probably tired. You might put your guards down because what could go wrong on this happy day.

Climbing down technical parts might be tricky as you can't see where you're heading to. When you're tired and less concentrated it's easy to make mistakes. Tie the rope the wrong way and down you go.

There's this thing called summit fever. People who should go back can't resist the lure of the peak just a few hundred steps away, then they exhaust themselves.

The higher you go the higher is the chance of developing high altitude symptoms (brain / lung edema etc.) and to expose yourself to cold. By reaching the summit you ensure maximal harm to your body before going down.

Also, AFAIK (I just watch documentaries), people try to summit on the morning. In the evening sunlight will trigger more avalanches and that's when people are more likely heading down. The weather also becomes less unpredictable as day progresses.

I'm pretty sure the ""fact"" or legend is more or less true. You can take a look at climbing fatalities statistics (quite well documented) to get more information. Extreme sports people (such as B.A.S.E. jumpers) try to be quite open about what went wrong so that others can learn from these mistakes.

It's a coronavirus. Albeit not 100% impossible, it would be very, very unlikely for this to be true.

There have been variants around since inception, we started classifying those in march. Why the media has decided to focus on those now, it's a mystery.

As of now, there's 0 proof that those variants are more infectious or that can evade preexisting immunity. 

[Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l1u0b3/daily_discussion_thread_january_21_2021/gk2wmd5/) is a previous comment of mine that goes about how they decided that the uk variant is 70% more infectious. 

We have another 4 coronaviruses that are endemic and have been with us since millennia. None of them has mutated suddenly into a more infectious or deadly variant. Coronaviruses in general are very stable - say, much more than the flu.

Manaus, where now they're experiencing a new wave, is used as the proof that reinfection is a thing. They're assuming reinfections based on this study, which is flawed as it says in [this](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/study-estimates-76-percent-of-brazilian-city-exposed-to-sars-cov-2-68272) article. The initial 70% immunity estimate was made over a faulty sample (basically, people that donate blood are people that are in all ways separated from the ""brancos"", the rich people, where the current outbreak is happening) and the estimate was done on the basis of a model that turned out to be completely wrong.

That's a lot of assumptions that don't take into account just general exponential nature of infections, more contagious strains starting to spread, etc. It's also just been 8-9 days and we've had downturns of about that duration that turn around and hit record highs less than a week later.

It's just too soon to tell what's going to happen and all the calls of ""clear downward trend"" which started cropping up all over this sub even a few days ago are pure speculation.

Unfortunately, it's also likely the holiday surge damage is not so reversible and the general rising tide of basic exponential infection rates will quickly reverse the decline in case/death rates.

Despite the hate I got from one poster, I make sure every environment I step into has at least mask-wearing and social distancing to the maximum extent possible.

So I feel the locals are far more unsafe to be around then anyone I am likely to encounter elsewhere. But in a way, it has helped me step out into the world instead of being boxed in my house all the time.

Me and two other friends got together for a football watch party prior to Christmas and were socially distant the entire time (outside of where I reside). But that remained the only time I have gotten together with friends.

And yeah, I went to Universal Studios twice. But again, social distancing and mask compliance were commonplace. So I felt safe there.

I feel at a certain point, you have to assess the risk and not randomize what is considered a bad risk vs. good risk (i.e. it's ok to go to work but it's not ok to do an outdoor bike race). The virus does not care.

I would not want to be a 20 something year old right now. These are valuable years you all are losing right now, and you are only young once. Not to mention that weird time when all your friends are at different places. And it's hard to meet new friends at the moment. So I feel your pain.

On the surface, it is true that a short early lockdown allows to save lives and further on also to reopen the economy and let it recover at least partly.

But there are lots of ""buts"".

First, we live in a globalized world. Keeping things open might not save you from a sharp recession or a dampened recovery, especially when you are a small nation that relies on trade. Q4 GDP for New Zealand is forecasted at ""only"" +0,4% on the previous quarter, despite everything being open as normal.

Second, data from several European countries are already showing that as long as factories are open and the closures concern mostly the so called ""horeca"" (hotels-restaurant-cafes), economic losses can be contained. Germany's GDP has only gone down by -5% in 2020, which is even better than 2009, and around the same as countries that have had much fewer deaths (e.g. Finland). GDP figures do not necessarily show the short-term struggle of local businesses.

Third, different economies and societies will respond differently to different stresses. You can't just compare Germany to Peru like that.

Fourth, it's not necessarily about ""the economy"" in terms of GDP - as I wrote, GDP doesn't necessarily say much about the struggle of local businesses.

Fifth, it's not just economy - it's society. Sweden may have had more deaths than, I don't know, Slovakia, and maybe even a sharper economic downturn. But where would you have felt better in 2020, in a place with (nearly) everything open and life going on (nearly) as normal - at least compared to other countries in Europe - or in a place with repeated lockdowns, fear and uncertainty?

Instead, they tend to have a more generalized immune response, which is why young kids often get symptoms like large rashes and high fevers from viral illnesses. Also why we only see MSI-C in children.

However, if the disease is mainly transmitted by adults, which it seems to be, the selective pressure on the virus will be to escape the adults' targeted immune response. As long as we try to keep kids away from other kids when they are infected and we don't completely open up schools without testing, tracing and isolating, we should be ok. Mutations that make the virus more deadly will tend to present more obvious symptoms, possibly making it easier to stop the spread of those variants.

It's something to watch out for, but not something I'd be overly worried about at this point.

In fact, that is part of the released guidance:

&gt;Fairly compensating providers, and state and local governments for the costs of vaccine administration will be critical to expanding vaccination participation . President Biden will work with Congress to expand the Federal Medicaid Assistance Percentage (FMAP) to 100 percent for vaccinations of Medicaid enrollees - with the goal of alleviating state costs for administration of these vaccines and supporting states in their work to meet the needs of their communities. The Department of Health and Services will ask the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to consider whether current payment rates for vaccine administration are appropriate or whether a higher rate may more accurately compensate providers. The federal government will fund vaccine supply and will greatly expand funding for vaccine administration by allowing state and local governments to reimburse vaccination administration expenses through the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund and by ensuring that workforce and equipment expenses for state and local-run sites are also eligible.

If you as a normal worker really fucked up and the corporate wants to get rid of you immediately, they will still adhere to govt min termination period or the one mentioned in your contract. The best scenario is you get paid for a few months without having to work. If you have negotiated a ""departing"" ""bonus"" in your contract as a silencer, to not have you spill company secrets when you work at a management or development position, and you have not violated its terms, they will pay that to you too. And for CEO´s even if they violated them for various reasons, which are mostly public image or silence.

And herein lies the problem. A CEO has a ""normal"" work contract just like ours. Weakening these employment contract and their protections will also weaken the ones for normal workers. And without knowing what they violated, externals cannot do anything to force the company not to pay the bonus.

The only thing to resolve this issue is to have companies make smarter contracts but then the companies that won´t, will have a competitive advantage by getting the better-qualified Management. One way would be to have the govt forbid CEO´s to get paid on stock performance or in stock or disallow stock buybacks from companies all together like back in the day. This would change the Company Management relationship and a different kind of CEO will emerge again, who looks out for and gets paid by the longevity and future of the company.",,,1611250545,{},gk2yi01,False,t3_l1zxqr,False,True,t1_gk2lwdj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l1zxqr/departing_ceo_paid_52_million_retention_bonus_by/gk2yi01/,1611380286,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I'm curious if people are thinking of the interior of the US rather than rural counties, in general.

The impediment of high-speed access in both rural states and counties hinders remote learning. National and local politics has an effect on remote learning viability. Funding is a major consideration. In at least one rural community in CA the local elementary school is providing free lunches for any ""child"" 0-18 regardless of enrollment status, which has been reported to my research group as ""life saving.""

San Diego Unified, which has both urban and rural schools within the district, is planning to reopen with air quality monitors and barriers/spacing. I don't know how that will play out in the more densely populated schools, however. The universities are going to listen to the Chancellors and Regents, who in turn will be listening to the Governor and health officials, but I can at least speak directly to the Sheriffs in helping them develop plans for in-person education (wardens will adhere to policies established by Sac) even though they'll ultimately follow local health officials' directives.

The security issues for remote learning for incarcerated students are massive and expensively addressable. I've been advocating for pandemic *plans* instead of the responses administrators seem to be doing (reactive and only one semester at a time).

&gt; With the recent announcement that California vaccine guidelines were expanded to include everyone age 65 and older, we’ve received many inquiries regarding eligibility and access to the COVID-19 vaccine. We want to provide an update with the latest information on vaccine supply and distribution.  

&gt; **Vaccine supply**

&gt; Expanding California vaccine guidelines to include everyone age 65 and older increases eligibility by nearly 6 million people in the state. Unfortunately, the vaccine supply to distributors has not yet been increased to vaccinate that many people. Right now, vaccines are in extremely short supply for all vaccine distributors across the country, including Kaiser Permanente.

&gt; As a vaccine distributor, Kaiser Permanente is organized and prepared to distribute the vaccine as we receive supply. As of January 16, we have administered more than 170,000 vaccines in California. Each week, we receive a fraction of the vaccine required to meet our demand. Kaiser Permanente cares for more than 1.5 million members age 65 and older, and last week we received a vaccine supply of just 20,000 first doses. Our ability to expand and speed vaccine distribution depends on vaccine supply made available to our state. At the current rate, we’re looking at vaccine distribution that is much slower than any of us find acceptable. We’re doing all we can to get additional vaccine supply as soon as possible.

&gt; **Vaccine distribution**

&gt; Like many, consistent with state recommendations and due to the vaccine supply shortage, we’re currently continuing to vaccinate the following priority groups:

&gt; * Health care workers

&gt; * Long-term care patients

&gt; As supply becomes available, we’ll begin offering vaccine appointments to individuals age 75 and older in alignment with California Department of Public Health guidelines.

&gt; We’ll reach out to our members as vaccines and appointments become available for them. It’s not necessary to email, call us, or go online for appointments until we’ve contacted you first. Please note that primary care physicians can’t book appointments for vaccines.

&gt; **What to do now**

&gt; * If you’re a health care worker, please complete an e-visit

&gt; * If you’re age 75 or older, we’ll contact you directly as vaccine supply becomes available and we’ll provide you with instructions on how to make an appointment.

&gt; * For all Kaiser Permanente members, stay up to date — for the latest information on when other groups may be able to get the vaccine, visit kp.org/covidvaccine

&gt; **The pace of vaccination is dependent on supply**

&gt; We’re committed to getting COVID-19 vaccines to our members and communities as soon and as equitably as possible. We’ve added capacity so that as more supplies become available, we’ll be able to vaccinate many more members at additional locations.    

&gt; We anticipate vaccine supply to ramp up over the coming weeks — but vaccine supply and eligibility may vary across counties and cities. We’ll keep you updated on vaccine eligibility and availability.  

&gt; In the meantime, please continue to stay home, wear a mask, and protect yourself and your loved ones. Your health remains our top priority — today, tomorrow, and always.

Best of luck to you and your family.",,,1611268351,{},gk41wwf,False,t3_l1kv23,False,True,t1_gk2di9v,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l1kv23/come_with_me_if_you_want_to_live_schwarzenegger/gk41wwf/,1611401984,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;Your explanation for shareholder value makes zero sense as well. Shareholder value is based off of the FUTURE REVENUE of a company.

Securing contracts ASAP to distribute the vaccine causes people to invest in a company, which causes a company's stock price to go up, which increases the value for the shareholder.  Also, why do you think Pfizer and Moderna got into a press release battle to pimp the efficacy of their vaccines? It drove their stock price way up.

&gt;demand and supply is relatively the same down the line with only the supply side becoming more volatile as whiplash effect occurs

You're totally missing the point. Why give a contract to Amazon when he can give it to [BlueFlame Medical](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-gear-broker-used-political-ties-to-sell-goods-to-states-data-show-11594807200)? Trump ends up with his buddy getting money, and then there's STILL a problem to solve. So he can give a new contract to another friend.

As to why FL isn't seeing this huge surge, probably because they've infected or killed off all their vulnerable already during the Summer Surge.

Since the beginning, it has seemed to me that the largest variable in terms of covid spread was culture. The US has a huge individuality, personal freedoms culture, and is very against any sort of government mandates. We could've welded everyone's doors shut for a few weeks and tanked the virus like China did, but those sort of measures would not fly in the US. (Obviously hyperbolizing Chinese lockdowns). But the first month or so of the pandemic the roads were *empty*. Everyone stayed home. Once it became apparent the virus wasn't killing masses of people on the streets, people gradually began to push back against harsh lockdowns and such.

I really do think this virus has a perfect storm of transmissibility and lethality, where it was contagious enough and just lethal enough that it could overwhelm hospitals, yet wasn't deadly enough that people were that afraid of it. Personally, I think the severity of the virus has been overplayed on social media and the news, not necessarily individual posts by themselves, but the sum of all posts day after day only showing a growing number of deaths and everything ""skyrocketing'"" conflicted with what people actually saw in real life (mostly mild symptoms, if they knew anyone that had even had it) such that they believed the virus was overplayed and made the situation worse.

Stupidity at best. Its literally hilarious how you think you can somehow generalise what the general population means when they refer to a place.

My initial comment was solely based on your claims that CA cities were ""oh so big that its a miracle for everyone not to be dead at this point"" when no CA city is even the most pop dense in the USA. 

I never said population density is the only driver, obviously it isn't. You bring up other states when they has nothing to do with what i spoke of. You claimed that CA has two of the largest cities in the world, not even close. That has been proven endlessly. 

You pivoted the fact that the outbreak would have been much worse to lighten the blow that their response was garbage. New York as a whole is a smaller more pop dense state (62% more) and his managed exponentially better.

Did you actually read my comment? I didn't say regulatory authorities. This is the industry I specialise in, and I know it well. If this vaccine is as bogus as you say why have AstraZeneca partnered?

Or are you saying that the Indian authorities are just making it up as well? This is peer reviewed.

Companies like AZ and Dr.Reddys don't just piss around they are very tightly regulated and if they joined up for a shit vaccine with no data then it would blow up in their faces. Why would they do it?

Also your point about Serbia, you seem to actually have no knowledge of the industry. Serbia have some fantastic quality clinical trial sites and a good regulatory backing. Why are you being prejudice against certain countries?

Simple as that. As there's apparently no concern in giving them to the elderly and immunocompromised people and physically weak people, I don't sympathise with this concern amongst presumably physically healthy members of the medical community.

Should there have been a longer test period for the vaccines? Absolutely.

But they're rolling them out faster in part to deal with the dismal failure that was COVID containment or mitigation, particularly in countries dominated by libertarian and individualist societal tendencies.

When you can't even get enough people to comply with masking up or making minor societal sacrifices for the greater good during a pandemic, then it makes all the sense in the world to just be like ""let's just get the vaccines out there"".

She received her first dose of the Moderna vaccine 10 days ago.

Looking for insight from anyone who may have been in a similar situation (forced to wear KN95 instead of N95) or for thoughts on what to do.

From what I've seen the only figures that high are non peer reviewed studies and only looks at people who have been hospitalized.

&gt;”I just wanted to see and listen,” said Laura Lima, a nurse watching the inauguration on an iPhone propped on her work station. “It’s important stuff.”

&gt;Ms. Lima works at Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Hospital in South Los Angeles, and as she watched President Biden address the nation, a monitor beeped. She put on an isolation gown and gloves and entered the room of one of her patients, a man in his early 60s on a ventilator whose intravenous line needed to be adjusted.

&gt;Ms. Lima took note of the new president’s statements about hastening the rollout of vaccines.

&gt;”I think this community should be prioritized,” she said.

&gt;The neighborhood around the hospital, filled with low-income workers who often have poor access to health care, has been one of the hardest hit in Southern California’s surge.

&gt;Mario Torres Hernandez, a 63-year-old patient being treated with oxygen for Covid-19, had his television tuned to Telemundo during Mr. Biden’s visit to Arlington cemetery. “I hope he does more for us,” he said.

&gt;But it was another busy day at the I.C.U., and so the vast majority of its staff members were not watching the proceedings in Washington. One respiratory therapist said he had forgotten the inauguration was happening.

&gt;Some did think it was a day of hope.

&gt;”I’m so tired of zipping black body bags,” another I.C.U. nurse, Amanda Hamilton, said as the ceremony continued. “It’s exciting we have a president who actually cares and might do something about it.”",,,1611187468,{},gk06xv3,True,t3_l1m54q,False,False,t3_l1m54q,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l1m54q/a_new_president_takes_office_the_view_from_an_icu/gk06xv3/,1611317808,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There are also T-lymphocytes (so named for where they mature, the thymus) which have a complex life cycle. These cells also become targeted towards specific antigens and spend their time policing tissues in the body, responding to inflammation and looking for their marks, and tolerating harmless mimics. In fact, these cells and their relatives target virally infected cells, cancer cells (and sometimes innocent cells - autoimmunity) and, through a variety of cellular strategies, destroy them. 

To top it all off, the cells talk to one another in a rather intricate way that very smart scientists are still puzzled by. The T's direct the B's which get intel from the APC's, which release IL-thisandthat and InflammatoryMarkerXXX to direct neutrophils to seek complement, which causes endothelium to do something or other.... you get the idea. These, and many other immune cell types, negotiate what will be tolerated, what will be eliminated, and which cells will grow, where they will patrol, etc. It is beyond what I can describe here and, frankly, beyond my understanding.

Usually a stabilization/drop in cases supersedes the drop in seriously ill and deaths, but here it seems like the opposite is happened. Probably due to the vaccine.

What we have to look forward too:

Second dose administration really kicked in only a week ago (less than 1% vaccinated this time last week) but is now at 7.3-7.5% of the population. Most of those getting the 2cond dose are the elderly. Thus starting the next week large segments of the elderly population should get high immunity, take the usual lag between getting infected and getting seriously ill/death to 10-14 days, and in 2.5-3 weeks we should see deaths fall off very significantly.

It's really a combination of all of the above. But masks play a huge, huge role in flu - likely more so than in COVID. COVID seems to be spreadable with smaller aerosols whereas flu is believed to spread almost exclusively with larger droplets. Obviously masks reduce COVID spread some, but flu spread is likely almost completely eliminated in the case of two mask wearers. Studies in medical offices with flu-positive patients show very little spread to caretakers even with just surgical masks. 

Either way, it's not hard math. The R0 for the flu is much, much lower than the R0 for COVID. R0 for flu is maybe 1.5, R0 for COVID is closer to 3. The same things that stop the spread of COVID help reduce the spread of the flu (more or less). Even during surges (other than the initial one), Rt is typically kept down to 1.3-1.5. This means the Rt for the flu is &lt;1 (with some asterisks in small sub-populations that keep the flu ""alive"" so to speak). 

Agree on other viruses. Rhinovirus - interestingly - barely appear to be impacted at all by COVID measures based on surveillance data in Canada. It's truly fascinating as I would have assumed WFH, school from home, and general less social interaction would have impacted those rates more. Rhinoviruses do tend to spread more by contact, which means that distancing is less effective. Hand hygiene isn't marketed as much for COVID, so perhaps that is why.

The point is you must setup a plan since you need two doses per person.

So what is happening in italy is vaccination almost came to an halt not only because there are only 100k doses left, but also because it is not clear what is going to happen in the upcoming weeks availability-wise.
Some feel it is pointless to proceed if they have no guarantee the second dose can be administered as required since the law right now is quite strict on timings, at least in italy.

What started this was pfizer all of a sudden changing its mind: uh ok we are cutting deliveries 48 hours from now. Then after 48 hours oh sorry nothing today for you but will be fixed at the end of the week. Then oh we don't know about a nice way to tell you but you won't receive this week what has been promised.

In addition to this they also arbitrarily decided which centers would receive doses and which would not. So some areas were mostly unaffected and others were heavily affected, with no direct correlation with the spread of the virus. This poses another set of issues as you might have cuts where vaccines are more needed, moving these vaccines require special equipment and there are also political issues as healthcare is organized at a regional level and you need to convince these regions to give up their doses but as no region is covid free the government has an hard task moving vaccines around.

Gottlieb said that he thought that around 30% of the population would be infected by the end of the month, which is about 4x the current reported cases.

Even if a majority of the world were vaccinated, it still would linger. It wouldn't be raging to the point that it is, but it will be here, and it will continue to evolve as all viruses do. We know being vaccinated most likely decreases the likelihood of transmission, but we have no data yet as to how significantly. Yes the goal with herd immunity is to get enough of the world vaccinated to the point that even if the virus exists, it wouldn't result in death or severe disease but how long would that take and what would that cost to not just the country but the people in Australia and those stuck abroad.

&amp;#x200B;

With that in mind, that means the only sensible way forward is a containment system that allows us to stay on top of any outbreaks ASAP and minimise the risks as much as possible. There will never ever be a zero-risk approach. It's simply impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

People are stranded away from their homes as we speak, and the damage from the lockdowns since March 2020 is beyond what any of us can fathom. Yes, we should get the cases down to a manageable level should there be any outbreaks and we need to act, but we can't just shut international borders until we feel that it's basically risk-free. That's not to say general tourism should be open but the people who call it home should be allowed to return within reason of course. Leaks from hotel quarantine are bound to happen because we're only human, but the goal here is to ramp up measures to minimise the likelihood of that happening. Singapore is an excellent example of how this is completely possible. They've managed the entire pandemic as well as the best, if not better as I was there when it happened. They have a few cases in the community and from overseas travellers but they don't overreact and shut everything down. Instead, they contain them calmly. It would take years for enough people in the world to become vaccinated to the point that open international travel would be possible and the damage until then would be far worse than the inconvenience of having to contain a few outbreaks here and there. It benefits the people currently in Australia, yes as the disruption will be kept to a minimum, but it absolutely screws over any Australians or regular residents of Australia trying to come home.

&amp;#x200B;

I firmly believe that with a reasonable travel cap, hotel quarantine, the requirement to be vaccinated and provide a negative covid test before travelling to Australia will absolutely minimise the risks to a very manageable point considering community cases are low.

He finds that based on the most recent empirical data, the cost of lockdown measures widely exceeds their benefits.

“I was an initial proponent of lockdowns,” explains Dr. Joffe. However, as better information emerged, he re-examined the efficacy of such programs and found them harder to justify.

Dr. Joffe also notes that we have a much better understanding of who is at risk, arguing that “less than 10 percent of the population is at high-risk, accounting for more than 90 percent of potential deaths from COVID-19.”

Lockdowns have also resulted in a wide-range of unintended ramifications. Economic damage, delays in “non-urgent” surgeries, diagnoses, and treatments, and excess deaths arising from the “collateral effects” of lockdown measures should all be considered as policy-makers weigh future measures.

Dr. Joffe argues that Canadians have been essentially presented with a “false dichotomy” – between a choice of either economically-damaging lockdowns or lethal inaction. However, his analysis finds that the costs of the lockdown measures compare poorly against their purported benefits when measured by Quality Adjusted Life Years, or QALY.",,,1611229422,{},gk1vvvm,True,t3_l1wvlt,False,False,t3_l1wvlt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l1wvlt/rethinking_lockdowns_the_risks_and_tradeoffs_of/gk1vvvm/,1611357127,13,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

January 20

More than 4,300 suspected cases of reinfection have been recorded in South Africa as of January 6, according to Professor Koleka Mlisana of the National Health Laboratory Service. All of the cases had at least 90 days or longer between positive tests.

“A total of 4,326 potential re-infections have been recorded in the laboratory data analysis, including both the private and the public lab data,” Mlisana told BNO News. “This is laboratory data and no clinical or mortality data is available on these cases as yet.”

Mlisana provided the more specific figure after she talked about reinfection at a press conference on Monday night. She said there is currently no evidence to suggest that the South African coronavirus variant is causing a spike in reinfections.

“We are not necessarily seeing an increase in the risk of reinfection,” Mlisana said. “So far we are able to say there is no evidence that suggests that the risk of reinfection is increasing as a result of the new variant, but bear in mind that we are only talking a month so far (with data up until January 6), so this is an area that we need to look at very closely.”...",,,1611257024,{},gk3cy2r,True,t3_l25i51,False,True,t3_l25i51,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l25i51/covid19_reinfection_tracker/gk3cy2r/,1611388317,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

After not giving fast marketing approval EMA has apparently dealt another blow to the European vaccination campaign by making a legally binding statement on the numbers of doses that can be drawn from each vial. Good news for Americans I guess, as they will be able to get vaccinated faster. 

&gt;Because more doses can be taken from a vaccine vial than anticipated, manufacturers Pfizer and BioNTech are cutting back on vial shipments. At the same time, the supply of the Moderna vaccine is delayed.

&gt;U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech will deliver fewer ampoules of their Corona vaccine to ordering countries than announced. Pfizer justified this to the AFP news agency by citing a statement from the EU medicines agency EMA that up to six vaccine doses can be drawn from each vial instead of the originally calculated five.

&gt;""We are honoring our supply commitments to the states,"" Pfizer said. It said the orders had ""always been based on a total number of doses, not vials.""

&gt;In fact, EU supply contracts are based on a total number of doses of vaccine. The EMA had allowed EU states to draw six doses from each vaccine vial on Jan. 8. However, this requires special syringes, which not all countries have in sufficient numbers.

&gt;At the end of last week, BioNTech and Pfizer had already announced at short notice that they would have to limit production in order to increase the capacity of a plant in Belgium. In Germany, some vaccination centers are therefore at a standstill.

&gt;However, the EU Commission expressed confidence that the supply bottleneck caused by the reorganization would be overcome quickly. This week less will be delivered, but next week already 100 percent of the promised quantity will be delivered again, said a Commission spokesman. The supply shortfall from this week would then be made up quickly. That is what BioNTech and Pfizer had communicated, he said.

&gt;The commission spokesman also welcomed the fact that more doses would be available, at least in the short term, because of the EMA recommendation to be able to draw six instead of five doses of vaccine from each vial from Pfizer and BioNTech.

&gt;Meanwhile, it became known that the delivery of the also approved Corona vaccine of the US manufacturer Moderna is delayed. The doses scheduled for next week will not be delivered until the end of the week or the beginning of the week after next, the Federal Ministry of Health announced in response to an inquiry from NDR. The third delivery would also be delayed by a week. A spokeswoman of the ministry could not give reasons.

&gt;The number of doses of Moderna vaccine in prospect, however, remains the same, according to the Federal Ministry of Health. A total of four delivery dates are planned for the vaccine until the eighth calendar week.",,,1611253329,{},gk34oa8,True,t3_l246n7,False,True,t3_l246n7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l246n7/pfizer_is_going_to_deliver_less_vaccine_to/gk34oa8/,1611383759,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

And scientists are watching data shared by the country keenly, for signs of how effective the vaccine is when given to a whole population.

So there was understandable concern when the man coordinating Israel's Covid response reportedly suggested a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine might not be as effective as reported.

Thousands of people have tested positive after being jabbed. But are worries premature?

Addressing Prof Nachman Ash's quotes, the Israeli Ministry of Health said: ""The comments of the Israeli Covid-19 commissioner regarding the effect of the first dose of the vaccine were out of context and, therefore, inaccurate.

""The commissioner said we have yet to see a decrease in the number of severely ill patients.""

The ""full protective impact of the vaccine"" was expected to be seen soon, a spokesperson added.

After vaccination, the body needs time to recognise the virus's genetic material and mount an immune response - producing the antibodies and T-cells that block the virus from entering cells and killing off those cells that do become infected.

And it takes a minimum of two weeks - but probably more - to really take effect, immunologists including [**Prof Danny Altmann at Imperial College London, say**](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210114-covid-19-how-effective-is-a-single-vaccine-dose).

Some of the people who were hospitalised in recent weeks will have received a first dose of the vaccine. But that's not necessarily a sign it hasn't been effective.

Given the time it takes for immunity to build and unvaccinated people to become exposed to the virus, incubate it and develop symptoms, the national data would not be expected to reflect the impact of vaccination for at least a month.

&amp;#x200B;

## 'Early protection'

Clalit, Israel's largest healthcare provider, covering most of the population, compared the medical records of 200,000 vaccinated over-60s with the same number belonging to unvaccinated people.

For two weeks after the first dose, both groups tested positive for the virus at roughly the same rate.

But then those vaccinated started to show 33% fewer new infections than the others.

""This is very early protection,"" said Clalit chief innovation officer, Ran Balicher, who is also a public health professor advising the government.

And ""already there is a 33% fall"".

Infections continued to decline after that.

But there were too few for Prof Balicher to calculate by what percentage.

## Same trend

The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine's Prof Stephen Evans said: ""It is not sensible to compare efficacy derived from an observational study of this type, which is subject to many biases, with the efficacy derived from randomised trials \[such as those performed to test the vaccine in the first place\].""

But the early evidence does follow roughly the same trend seen in Pfizer's clinical trials, which involved tens of thousands of people.

In those trials, the rate of new infections in the vaccinated and control groups also diverged after two weeks.

And that gap kept widening for more than 100 days after the first dose.

## Severe Covid

Israel began vaccinating on 19 December, reaching 10% of its population by the end of 2020.

And now, about half a million of its nine million population have received two doses.

Prof Balicher suggests some impact on severe Covid illness across Israel could be expected to be seen later this week.

## Less effective

Pfizer hopes two doses of the vaccine will give up to 95% protection.

But even a much less effective vaccine could make the difference between a survivable illness and a fatal one.

The annual flu vaccine is about 40-60% effective.

And it stops hundreds of thousands of people from dying every year.

## Fatal disease

""Efficacy against detected Covid-19 may be less important... than efficacy against hospitalisation and death,"" Prof Evans said.

And more people were likely to be protected from a severity of illness requiring admission to hospital than infection rates alone suggested.

The Clalit data, for example, does not distinguish between mild or symptomless infections and more severe or even fatal disease.

The judgement made in the UK was more lives could be saved by giving a larger group one dose quicker than giving a smaller group the maximum protection conferred by two doses.

And Prof Evans said: ""The reports that have come from Israel are insufficient to provide any evidence that the current UK policy in regard to delaying the second dose of vaccines is in any way incorrect.""",,,1611236032,{},gk24l4q,True,t3_l1yho5,False,False,t3_l1yho5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l1yho5/covid_israel_vaccine_fears_out_of_context_and/gk24l4q/,1611362512,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,atealein,,,[],,,,text,t2_zj96m,False,False,[],"**In Sweden, a reduction in the number of cases of covid-19 is seen.** **The number of covid patients is also declining in healthcare.** **But the risk of a turnaround remains high, according to the Public Health Agency.**

**At Thursday's press conference** , Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of department at the Swedish Public Health Agency, will begin by reporting on the global pandemic situation.

\- There are a large number of cases on a global level, she says.

\- It is still a serious situation globally.

There are a large number of cases continuing both globally and in Europe, with an increase in some countries and a decrease in some countries. In Europe, the infection is increasing in Portugal and Ireland, among other places, says Tegmark Wisell.

\- We have a reduction at the national level, she says about the situation in Sweden, and the trend seems to be continuing.

\- But there are a large number of cases in the country, she says and therefore urges everyone to continue to adhere to and follow recommendations and restrictions.

**In Sweden,** another 124 deaths with confirmed covid-19 have been reported, the Public Health Agency announces.

In the country, a total of 10,921 infected people have now died. And a total of 542,952 people in Sweden have been confirmed infected with covid-19.

The new deaths in the authority's statistics have in most cases occurred several days earlier, and the deaths that have occurred in the near future are not included due to delays in the reporting. This means that the daily update shows reported death rates, not the death rate for that particular day.

**In terms of the incidence** of covid-19 per week and age group, a recent decline is seen for the age groups 20 to 29 and 40 to 49 years, says Tegmark Wisell.

\- We see a sharp decline in the age group 20 to 29 years.

They are the professionals who have the highest number of cases per 100,000 inhabitants, according to Tegmark Wisell.

As for death reporting, it lags behind more than IVA reporting. Additional cases will ""unfortunately"" be added, she says.

**She continues to** talk about the updated recommendations made earlier in the day on how school and leisure activities should be conducted.

\- It is important to have open schools, says Tegmark Wisell.

The Swedish Public Health Agency's recommendation applies not only to schools but also to other activities, she emphasizes.

\- It is important that children can participate in organized sports activities, this applies both indoors and outdoors.

**She concludes by** urging everyone to continue to follow the recommendations

\- There is a great risk that we will get a turnaround in the positive trend we have now with covid-19. It is very important to continue working from home, says Tegmark Wisell.

Iréne Nilsson Carlsson, public health advisor at the National Board of Health and Welfare, reports on the situation in healthcare.

Sweden has 760 IVA places, of which 588 are occupied. 315 are taken by patients cared for covid-19. This is a decrease of 54 people compared to last week.

\- This is a reduction in the number of IVA caregivers from last week, says Nilsson Carlsson.

**The** number of people in inpatient care outside IVA is also decreasing. Last week, 2,395 patients were cared for, this week the number is 1,954 - a decrease of 441 patients.

\- There are quite large improvements that are happening now, and it is very positive that things are going in the right direction. But we do not know if there are lasting improvements, and therefore it is now important to keep going, says Iréne Nilsson Carlsson at the National Board of Health and Welfare.

54 percent of all IVA patients are treated for covid-19.

**There is a** spare capacity of 23 percent, but there are large variations between regions.

She also talks about the situation in elderly care and in the country's elderly homes.

There is still a high spread in the housing, but even there there is a slight decline, according to the National Board of Health and Welfare.

Last week, 571 were found infected in nursing homes, which can be compared with 943 during week 50.

\- When the infection goes down in the community, it also affects the spread of the homes, says Iréne Nilsson Carlsson.

\- There is hope that it will look better in our homes in the future. This is far from over, but the vaccine will still make a difference, she says.

**When asked by** TT whether the Swedish Public Health Agency is investigating the effect of using masks in public transport, which is now a recommendation to do during rush hour, Tegmark Wisell answers:

\- We have not analyzed the effect of mouth protection in public transport. We do not have a specific evaluation and it will be difficult to evaluate. We do not intend to evaluate this for Sweden.

**DN asks the Swedish Public Health Agency** how they view the risk that Sweden will have a similar development and reversal of the situation as has been seen in Spain, among other places.

\- We see that there is a great risk that you do not follow and that there is a tiredness to follow the recommendations, based on what we see in Europe and that we see that we have a large number of cases in the country, we see that is a great risk that it can turn around, she says, but adds that provided you keep working from home and follow the recommendations, there are ""good conditions"" for the positive situation to continue.

**The virus mutations** seen in various parts of the world, including the United Kingdom, are also worrying factors, adds Karin Tegmark Wisell.

\- There are several different factors that make us really have to hold on now, she says and adds that they look ""with great concern"" at the British mutation.

When asked by P4 Jämtland whether the Public Health Agency knows if there are areas in Sweden that may have achieved some kind of herd immunity, Tegmark Wisell answers:

\- We have no evidence that there is any form of herd immunity. We hope that vaccines will eventually boost immunity.",,,1611244759,{},gk2ld0a,True,t3_l2161f,False,True,t3_l2161f,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l2161f/sweden_national_decrease_but_risk_of_new_increase/gk2ld0a/,1611372598,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

T*he number updates are on Tuesday-Friday's and press-briefings on Tuesdays and Thursdays.* ***Reporting of deaths over the holidays will have additional lag that hasn't subsided yet!***

*Last reported numbers at a glance 2021-01-20, Wednesday 537967 (+4702) confirmed cases and 10797 (+206) deaths* 

* Numbers at a glance (previously in the post title): 542952 (+4985) confirmed cases and 10921 (+124) deaths
* 14-day incidence rate in Sweden is now 588 per 100.000. This is continuous and quite sharp decrease now, and last time the 14-day incidence rate was so low in Sweden was in the middle of November 2020. 
* The total weekly tested numbers have been similar in the last 3 weeks, at around 200k per week, prior the holidays the average was more towards 270k. However, the positivity rate was increasing when the number of total tests shrank, and now is decreasing while the total test numbers are staying steady, which suggest a lowering of the overall infection rate in Sweden, not just deflation due to the lower number of tests.
* For week 2 the numbers are now [published by FHM](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/statistik-och-analyser/antalet-testade-for-covid-19/), 200844 unique individuals were tested and the resulting positivity ratio was 14.7%. When comparing to the previous weeks one can clearly see the positive development and decrease in the positivity ratio:

|Week|Unique tested ind.|Confirmed cases|Positivity rate (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|51|299 447|46185|15.4|
|52|232 114|37141|16.0|
|53|198 691|41337|20.8|
|1|207 432|39467|19.0|
|2|200 844|28969|14.4|

* Yesterday also the last 10 days R-number estimations were also updated [on FHM site](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/contentassets/4b4dd8c7e15d48d2be744248794d1438/riket-skattning-av-det-momentana-reproduktionstalet-2021-01-20.pdf) \- it shows that since the start of the new year there have been two small ""peaks"" in the R-number at around 1.01-1.04 but it has since dramatically dropped all the way to 0.76 by 18/1. 
* Today there are 124 new deaths added to the total. There are number of corrections performed today and it isn't exactly clear but I believe they are mostly due to corrections in the numbers from region Skåne - this region has recorded 70-80 deaths per day in the past week and today is only 9 and this could be explained if there were corrections overlaid with the new reports. The number of deaths without confirmed date are down to 29 now, two less than yesterday. There are few corrections in November and December where a death is removed from one day and added to the next/previous one. Only +6 deaths were added to week 53 and it can be considered relatively ""complete"" now as well. Due to the corrections, the most deadly day of the pandemic so far - 28/12 has dropped from 122 deaths to 121. +67 deaths were added to week 1 today resulting in 564 current total, and this week is now heading towards reaching 600 deaths as well with next week reports (weeks 51-53 are now all at around 640 deaths/week). 
* 1954 are the patients in hospital care with COVID-19 (excluding ICU), large decrease by 441 patients compared to the previous week's 2395. 315 is today's ICU patients with COVID-19, sharp decrease compared to last week, over 50 less patients. 760 is the total ICU capacity of beds with respirator (small decrease since last week), 588 are occupied, so there is about 22% free capacity.
* The number of sick in the 70+ age group in special housing is also decreasing - in week 50 it was at its peak of close to 950 cases and it has been dropping since. In week 2 there were less than 600 sick in that group and housing. In spring, the same statistic shows close to 700 cases in the two peak weeks.
* The number of dead per week in special housing with COVID-19 in the death certificate have plateaued at about 220 per week for the past 5 weeks. Since death certificates take a bit to be reported, week 2 results (which are really low) are likely incomplete because of that. As comparison, in spring the peak week had close to 400 death and the month around it had over 300 per week. 
* This week the government announced continuation of several measures - including continuation of the ban of serving alcohol after 20:00. Distance learning for secondary education is also extended but now there is a slight release of measures as specific activities will be allowed to be taught in person, but it is up to the principals to decide how to organize schedule so there aren't too many students at the same time in school.

====

**Please, remember there is lag in reporting and deaths reported on a certain day are usually mostly deaths that happened on previous days. On average it takes up to 11 days to report 90% of the deaths for a certain day (see in the links graphs about how that looks);** ***with the current holidays this lag has more than doubled.***

But this also halted all serious thought about what else they can do. Why don't they sequester the at-risk population which is only about 12-15% of people?  Or seriously ramp up testing for this group? Or require testing for certain people?

The truth is we don't know whether you can spread it yet.  You probably can't, but that's just assumption.  Testing this was one of the corners they cut to get the vaccine out as fast as they did.  

For those interested, the mechanism under which you could be immune but still spread it is mucus. Viral particles get stuck to your mucus in your nose and throat.  The ones that make it past that are killed by your immune system.  Just as viral particles have a difficult time getting past mucus (this is after all the purpose of mucus) so to do our immune cells have trouble getting virus stuck in mucus.  So these particles get stuck in your mucus then you sneeze, talk, breath, whatever and those particles get out and infect others.

Now just because this mechanism is plausible, doesn't mean its the case.  Most vaccines do cause enough immune response that viral particles in your mucus do die, and can't be shed in large enough numbers to contribute to significant spread.

I have wondered myself if we will see higher than average sick days for mild illnesses post-COVID for this reason. It is more surprising to see now impact to case loads for virus strains for regions that are still under COVID-precaution measures. 

I expect the impact to be greater in children given their less robust immune history to begin with. Most common cold (pico, rhino, etc) strain-specific immunity typically lasts at least a few years (usually several), so missing ""one"" year shouldn't make an outsized effect given the number of strains that regularly circulate. That said, I don't know how much impact cross-strain immunity has in terms of keeping infections minor/asymptomatic or if specific strains have shorter immunity windows. 

It's amazing how little we really know about common cold infection and transmission factors given how prevalent and life-impacting it is. I do hope that mRNA and other new vaccine methods offer a pathway to help create more generalized immunity to a broad swath of these nasty (even if more annoying than deadly) buggers. 

Regardless, it will be interesting to watch next year as things normalize. I've genuinely enjoyed not getting sick - and even more, not being *worried* about getting sick - given my degree of isolation (and hygiene behaviors the few times I am public).

&gt;Sure, “less talk, more shots” is a lovely sentiment, but who gets them?

The CDC already explained. They laid out all the tiers from day one. Here's troves of data about the ACIP recommendations - who should get the shots, in what order, and why:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;[The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/covid-19.html) that once vaccination is underway in the initial phase (Phase 1a) of the COVID-19 vaccination program, which includes healthcare personnel and residents of long-term care facilities, planning should begin for subsequent phases, including Phase 1b (frontline essential workers and individuals 75 years of age and older) and Phase 1c (other essential workers, persons 65–74 years of age, and individuals 16–64 years of age with underlying medical conditions). The following guide is intended to assist state, tribal, local, or territorial (STLT) immunization programs and other immunization partners in planning for vaccination of these populations. Using various strategies, some with commonality across groups, and others unique for specific populations. Using various strategies, some with commonality across groups, and others unique for specific populations, can be considered to reach these populations for COVID-19 vaccination. [CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccination Program Interim Playbook for Jurisdictionspdf icon](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/downloads/Covid-19-Vaccination-Program-Interim_Playbook.pdf) has additional operational considerations to consider for COVID-19 vaccination planning.

Why?

Because the world keeps turning. Most of the people are not informed about, even now, one year later. Failure of current society, failure of WHO, failure of leadership, failure of individuals. A toddler is potty trained in 1 year. Most of the people I see around me don't how to wear a mask after 1 year.

I'm not anti-vaccines, but I would not rush to a vaccination center at the moment. I simply don't trust the same system which allowed the pandemic to grow, to force me to be subjected to gene therapy experiments. And this is the fair labeling of the vaccination campaigns, at the moment.

Such a global problem should have a globally coordinated solution.

The majority of the current approaches at country level are failing. There are a few exceptions where the pandemic is under control: the countries which reacted fast and sometimes authoritarian or the countries where the society knows what personal hygiene or social distancing means (South Korea, China, Australia, New Zealand).

BioNTech is eligible to receive future milestone payments of up to $563 million for a potential total consideration of $748 million. Pfizer and BioNTech will share development costs equally. Initially, Pfizer will fund 100 percent of the development costs, and BioNTech will repay Pfizer its 50 percent share of these costs during the commercialization of the vaccine.

Your explanation for shareholder value makes zero sense as well. Shareholder value is based off of the FUTURE REVENUE of a company. The closer and closer we get to a majority of people being vaccinated, the lower each share of equity is because the revenue is now in the present and will be represent through a company's bottom line or dividend payments. That's why Tesla's equity value is booming, but always reports quarterly losses. It's based on the FUTURE, not the present.

First of all, not considering the 18th largest city in the world to be ""not close to the top"" is rather comical, but again *that's not the point here*.  The point is that Californian populations are, comparatively to all other US states, concentrated in cities.  Proportionally, more California's live in an urban area than any other state.

Your tirade about ""labeling areas"" demonstrates a black and white view of the world with a fundamental lack of understanding of how people communicate and use language.

When a layman refers to Phoenix, they do not mean *precisely Phoenix and in exclusion of the surrounding cities*, they mean, ""that big city in the middle of Arizona including but not limited to, Phoenix, Gilbert, Chandler, Scottsdale, and other smaller municipalities surrounding them"".  Interestingly enough, when someone says, ""Las Vegas"", the are almost *always* referring to Paradise, but making that correction is stupid because it's a technicality and not relevant to conversation.

Yes, population density is an important driver of spread, but it is obviously not the *only* driver.  The interconnectedness of that population is important as well, and given the Californian population is focused in a few, large cities as opposed to disparate, isolated towns spread across the state, their response will necessarily be different from more rural states.

I dont know where you got the idea that I thought the Californian response has been ""good"", since in this thread I have literally never said that (what were saying about basic comprehension?).  My initial reply was in response to the idea that CA's outbreak was one of the worst in the country.  While this is, at a first glance, true, the reality is more complicated.  Factors involving the population distribution of California mean that CA was going to have a difficult time containing the virus, and that the measures taken *did* mitigate spread, and that without those measures, the spread would have been significantly worse.",,,1611186480,{},gk050l7,False,t3_l0pgyi,False,True,t1_gk00hw4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l0pgyi/fauci_us_could_achieve_herd_immunity_by_fall_if/gk050l7/,1611316636,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

""Normal"" is not a meaningful standard for anything. It is vague and can be used to justify countless contradictions.

There are also serious problems with your claim about what most communication is. First, our mouth and nose is a small part of nonverbal communication. We also have how we use our voice. We also have our eyes and all the rest of our body. 

Second, we will use whatever data is available in our attempts to understand communication.  Sometimes the nonverbal part is actually just a distraction from communication, like when someone is trying to tell me something and all I can think about is their ugly shirt or their bad teeth. And nonverbal includes nodding. It includes eye contact. A mouth covering can improve eye contact since people aren't distracted by the movements of the mouth. What you do with your hands is included, also not impacted by masks. We will still be able to communicate fine. If we don't see mouths, we will get our cues more from the eyes and elsewhere.

Third, you might be alluding to 'the 7% rule,' which is very questionable as the study people based that on was not talking about conversations AFAIK. It is not something good for generalizations.

The biggest problem with facemasks is that looking at lips makes it easier to understand what people are saying as it is another channel confirming what we are hearing. Masks are also horrible for the deaf. Perhaps more transparent masks would help, but those would also be more unwieldy.

I also agree with the sentiment that some of our messages do get lost behind masks because we are accustomed to people seeing our faces. An example is silently smiling to someone as you pass by. We probably aren't sensitive enough to catch that through their eyes. People will adjust though as we develop new habits. We will use our words instead.

So 48% theoretical max vaccine antibodies + [10% estimated max natural antibodies](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2773576) = 58% of the population having antibodies, which is just short of the [estimated 60-80% needed for herd immunity](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.01.20242289v1).

Not necessarily praising “no-mask”, I should have chosen better wording. Certainly most folks in FL choose to wear their mask, which is fine with me. My point is that ultimately, it is up to the individual to mask, distance, isolate or not. Their choice, not the government’s. In recognizing that strategy, I’m simply pointing out that Governor Desantis has chosen a different path than Governors Newsom and Cuomo. Not hating, just trying to spur dialogue on how it’s possible for a large group of adults to choose their acceptable level of risk at their level.

Nope. Here's what they did.

They were expecting a certain x number of cases in the UK over a certain time period, based on ""projections"". The projections turned out to be wrong, by 60-70%. But no, it wasn't the projections being off - it was the new more infectious variant that caused those extra infections.

Like skin cancer and sunlight exposure. Wearing sunscreen is advised to minimize exposure, but any exposure carries the same risk individually. 

Personally, if I were you... hide for the next few weeks as the cases that are testing positive now and in the past are considered safe to leave quarantine then (if they voluntarily quarantined at all in the first place). 

In the beginning they were so varied in recovery times, but the state and CDC guidelines is that after 10 days you are in the clear 24 hours after any symptoms or fevers. I didn’t learn this until I got it and was so ill for about 2 weeks. I’m super cautious so I’m still planning on quarantining about 3 weeks after symptoms went away to ensure I’m over it before I’m out in public, but I know people who were exposed where everyone else tested positive, but refused to be a negative statistic and wouldn’t get tested for a “hoax.” So let them walk around the next few weeks for sure and stay safe.

Herd immunity numbers are so fuzzy because not everyone with Coronavirus gets tested or takes it seriously. A lot of the cases are asymptomatic or not severe enough to get tested (not necessarily a majority, but a large unaccounted for number). Also the vaccines are going to people who’ve also had the virus and have the natural antibodies. That overlap and the asymptomatic cases is why determining herd immunity will only be announced by the dropping of cases. But personally, let this spike infect people, then start to feel safer while adhering to the protective recommendations and you are much less likely to get it before you get vaccinated.

I imagine walking around in February will pose the same exposure risk as June. 

If you do get it, godspeed, it kicked my healthy ass.

Also, I do agree that the priority should have been 

65+ and no exposure + at risk.
65+ and no exposure
65+
Healthcare workers
Then 18-65 with no immunities. (Ramp up Antibody testing)
Then Everyone else.

1) People will often be infected when they get the vaccine already or get in the window before the vaccine develops antibodies. So, by saying ""the vaccine doesn't prevent you from spreading it"" helps prevent this.

2) Vaccines very very rarely spread the viruses they are meant to protect you against. So, while it's true that ""we should wait until we have evidence"", most scientists would be shocked if vaccinated people spread the virus. 

If they were really worried about the vaccine spreading the virus, then they would 100% be talking about it more.

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is likely to be effective  against the contagious variant strain of the virus that was discovered  in the United Kingdom, according [to a study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.426984v1) conducted by the two companies.

Posted  on the pre-print server bioRxiv on Tuesday, the study says there's ""no  biologically significant difference in neutralization activity"" between  lab tests on the variant and the original coronavirus strain.

""The ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 necessitates  continuous monitoring of the significance of changes for maintained  protection by currently authorized vaccines,"" the authors wrote.

The  variant, which is called B.1.1.7, has a large number of mutations and  is known to be more transmissible between humans. Public health  officials have voiced concerns about the spread of the variant and the  efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines against it. This is the first paper  published by a COVID-19 vaccine maker that tests the idea, and Moderna  and AstraZeneca have said they anticipate their vaccines to be effective  against the variant as well, according [to CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/20/covid-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-likely-to-be-effective-against-uk-variant.html).

In  this small study, the mutations associated with the variant were  neutralized by antibodies in the blood of 16 study participants who  participated in the original Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine trial in Germany.  Half of the group were between ages 18-55, and the other half were  56-85.

""Preserved neutralization is reassuring, and preparation  for potential COVID-19 vaccine strain change is prudent,"" they wrote in  the most recent study. ""Such an adaptation of the vaccine to a new virus  strain would be facilitated by the flexibility of mRNA-based vaccine  technology.""",,,1611252105,{},gk322a6,True,t3_l23snr,False,False,t3_l23snr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l23snr/pfizer_says_its_vaccine_likely_blocks_covid/gk322a6/,1611382298,5,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This needs to be substantiated but the science and limited data available thus far are supportive. It is also why the Sputnik vaccine utilises two different vectors for the 1st and 2nd dose.

There are concerns surrounding efficacy with viral vector vaccines (particularly Oxford/AZ) long-term and whether repeat use is viable. There are trials planned to test the effectiveness of a 'mix and match' approach of the Oxford/AZ and Sputnik vaccines.

In practice though we have a number of different vaccine types developed with additional ones in the pipeline so I can envisage a situation where people receive a different vaccine during 'round 2'. Once the pandemic is largely under control frequency of mutations reduces and by extension so does the possibility of immune escape so I expect vaccine-induced immunity from this point to be relatively long lasting (1-2 years).

As the pace of vaccination grows, state leaders in dentistry expect the statewide effort to become an all-hands-on-deck effort, and they’ve been preparing for months to ensure they could help. 

“Our objective was to have dentistry be part of the public health effort to get the vaccinations done. If the state is receiving thousands of doses of vaccine, but you don’t have people to administer them, you’re going to waste some doses,” said Dr. Gary Chiodo, the dean of the University of Washington School of Dentistry. “That becomes more critical as you move out of Seattle and King County and into rural areas.” 

Dentists in Washington cannot administer other vaccines. The dentistry school and the Washington State Dental Association led the effort to become approved to administer vaccines for COVID-19. 

Dentists will need to complete about three to four hours of training, including some hands-on training from health care providers who are currently performing COVID-19 vaccinations. The dentistry school is in the process of finalizing the development of the training sessions, which will be shared with dentists statewide. ",,,1611260665,{},gk3l270,True,t3_l26vfs,False,False,t3_l26vfs,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l26vfs/dentists_to_be_part_of_the_coronavirus/gk3l270/,1611392776,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Is the Chinese army occupying entire nations and directly administering them while mutilating and abusing their populations?

What a perfect encapsulation of this ridiculous argument. What you're stating is correct but it does not support your point at all.

 The Haitian debt was literally leveraged after Haiti gained de facto independence from France. In other words, it's a form of abuse that occurred on top of the centuries of outright colonial rule and slavery. 

France and other colonial powers have endeavored in similar efforts with their former African colonies.

So you're correct in comparing China's efforts to the French obtaining a huge debt from Haiti. That comparison doesn't hold up if you try to say it's similar to France's outright rule and abuse of Haiti in the decades prior.

Transposing the comparison to Africa, China's actions are comparable to those of former colonial powers leveraging their financial might and influence over the countries of Africa after decolonization in the 50s and 60s.

&gt;Tests with thresholds so high may detect not just live virus but also genetic fragments, leftovers from infection that pose no particular risk — akin to finding a hair in a room long after a person has left, Dr. Mina said.

&gt;Any test with a cycle threshold above 35 is too sensitive, agreed Juliet Morrison, a virologist at the University of California, Riverside. “I’m shocked that people would think that 40 could represent a positive,” she said.

Continuing to:

&gt; The C.D.C.’s own calculations suggest that it is extremely difficult to detect any live virus in a sample above a threshold of 33 cycles. Officials at some state labs said the C.D.C. had not asked them to note threshold values or to share them with contact-tracing organizations.

&gt; Officials at the Wadsworth Center, New York’s state lab, have access to C.T. values from tests they have processed, and analyzed their numbers at The Times’s request. In July, the lab identified 872 positive tests, based on a threshold of 40 cycles.

&gt;With a cutoff of 35, about 43 percent of those tests would no longer qualify as positive. About 63 percent would no longer be judged positive if the cycles were limited to 30.

The alternative, visiting my local grocery stores (which are also big box retailers) would place myself and other people in a congregate setting for the last step in the supply chain. The goods all get processed at a warehouse just like Amazon, and then they have to get loaded on to shelves and then you go into the store with other people, shop, and take them home. Whereas ordering from Amazon, they get processed at the warehouse and then a lone driver drops it at my door. It removes that last step in the process ergo creating more distancing overall.",,,1611245365,{},gk2mob2,False,t3_l1gyiu,False,True,t1_gk2l2fb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l1gyiu/amazon_sends_letter_to_president_biden_says_it_is/gk2mob2/,1611373384,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There's no evidence that the UK variant is any less susceptible to vaccines than the original variants, in fact scientists think this is unlikely.

T*he number updates are on Tuesday-Friday's and press-briefings on Tuesdays and Thursdays.* ***Reporting of deaths over the holidays will have additional lag that hasn't subsided yet!***

*Last reported numbers at a glance 2021-01-20, Wednesday 537967 (+4702) confirmed cases and 10797 (+206) deaths* 

* Numbers at a glance (previously in the post title): 542952 (+4985) confirmed cases and 10921 (+124) deaths
* 14-day incidence rate in Sweden is now 588 per 100.000. This is continuous and quite sharp decrease now, and last time the 14-day incidence rate was so low in Sweden was in the middle of November 2020. 
* The total weekly tested numbers have been similar in the last 3 weeks, at around 200k per week, prior the holidays the average was more towards 270k. However, the positivity rate was increasing when the number of total tests shrank, and now is decreasing while the total test numbers are staying steady, which suggest a lowering of the overall infection rate in Sweden, not just deflation due to the lower number of tests.
* For week 2 the numbers are now [published by FHM](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/statistik-och-analyser/antalet-testade-for-covid-19/), 200844 unique individuals were tested and the resulting positivity ratio was 14.7%. When comparing to the previous weeks one can clearly see the positive development and decrease in the positivity ratio:

|Week|Unique tested ind.|Confirmed cases|Positivity rate (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|51|299 447|46185|15.4|
|52|232 114|37141|16.0|
|53|198 691|41337|20.8|
|1|207 432|39467|19.0|
|2|200 844|28969|14.4|

* Yesterday also the last 10 days R-number estimations were also updated [on FHM site](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/contentassets/4b4dd8c7e15d48d2be744248794d1438/riket-skattning-av-det-momentana-reproduktionstalet-2021-01-20.pdf) \- it shows that since the start of the new year there have been two small ""peaks"" in the R-number at around 1.01-1.04 but it has since dramatically dropped all the way to 0.76 by 18/1. 
* Today there are 124 new deaths added to the total. There are number of corrections performed today and it isn't exactly clear but I believe they are mostly due to corrections in the numbers from region Skåne - this region has recorded 70-80 deaths per day in the past week and today is only 9 and this could be explained if there were corrections overlaid with the new reports. The number of deaths without confirmed date are down to 29 now, two less than yesterday. There are few corrections in November and December where a death is removed from one day and added to the next/previous one. Only +6 deaths were added to week 53 and it can be considered relatively ""complete"" now as well. Due to the corrections, the most deadly day of the pandemic so far - 28/12 has dropped from 122 deaths to 121. +67 deaths were added to week 1 today resulting in 564 current total, and this week is now heading towards reaching 600 deaths as well with next week reports (weeks 51-53 are now all at around 640 deaths/week). 
* 1954 are the patients in hospital care with COVID-19 (excluding ICU), large decrease by 441 patients compared to the previous week's 2395. 315 is today's ICU patients with COVID-19, sharp decrease compared to last week, over 50 less patients. 760 is the total ICU capacity of beds with respirator (small decrease since last week), 588 are occupied, so there is about 22% free capacity.
* The number of sick in the 70+ age group in special housing is also decreasing - in week 50 it was at its peak of close to 950 cases and it has been dropping since. In week 2 there were less than 600 sick in that group and housing. In spring, the same statistic shows close to 700 cases in the two peak weeks.
* The number of dead per week in special housing with COVID-19 in the death certificate have plateaued at about 220 per week for the past 5 weeks. Since death certificates take a bit to be reported, week 2 results (which are really low) are likely incomplete because of that. As comparison, in spring the peak week had close to 400 death and the month around it had over 300 per week. 
* This week the government announced continuation of several measures - including continuation of the ban of serving alcohol after 20:00. Distance learning for secondary education is also extended but now there is a slight release of measures as specific activities will be allowed to be taught in person, but it is up to the principals to decide how to organize schedule so there aren't too many students at the same time in school.

====

**Please, remember there is lag in reporting and deaths reported on a certain day are usually mostly deaths that happened on previous days. On average it takes up to 11 days to report 90% of the deaths for a certain day (see in the links graphs about how that looks);** ***with the current holidays this lag has more than doubled.***

So you plan accordingly. Let's say in a normal business you pay other companies to bring in trucks that week to dispatch the incoming orders. Let's say you already resold these items to customers and promised delivery by tuesday or wednesday.

Then the delivery company decides last minute you are not receiving the items but a little less. Then they add a delay so monday you get 0. Then they furtherly reduce the amount and you get 25% of the promised items. You are going to have a problem with the people you hired and the customers.

&gt;The WHO says the measures people and governments are taking to prevent the spread of Covid-19, such as wearing masks and limiting public gatherings, have probably helped keep the flu in check. Increased flu vaccination rates may also be contributing, it says.
Another hypothesis holds that the broad spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, in countries like the U.S. may play a role in blocking the flu by lifting people’s immunity against other viruses. One study in the spring of 2020 in New York City found that people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were far less likely to be carrying other common viruses such as influenza viruses. Still, research into that hypothesis is just beginning.
