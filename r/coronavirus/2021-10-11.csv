My impression (being Danish) is that Denmark attained such relatively high vaccination rates because there is a general high trust in the government. The trust is maintained because the government has attempted to provide the citizens with high quality honest information, rather than propaganda, and emphasized it being voluntary rather than force. The trust in the government has taken a hit during the Corona period though, due to what has been seen as heavy handed government restrictions.  
  
So if the Danish experience can be generalized (which of course is not a given at all), then 1) emphasize honest good quality information. Don't try to lecture or use propaganda and don't filter the information through politics and ideology, and don't censure what is perceived as false information (my belief is that the crack down on the lab origin theory has done a lot of damage to the trust in the media and public institutions. I personally certainly have lost almost all trust US media and institutions); 2) don't try to force or coerce people.

Selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) are essential trace elements needed for appropriate immune system responses, cell signalling and anti-viral defence. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted at two hospitals in Ghent, Belgium, to investigate whether Se and/or Zn deficiency upon hospital admission correlates to disease severity and mortality risk in COVID-19 patients with or without co-morbidities. Trace element concentrations along with additional biomarkers were determined in serum or plasma and associated to disease severity and outcome. An insufficient Se and/or Zn status upon hospital admission was associated with a higher mortality rate and a more severe disease course in the entire study group, especially in the senior population. In comparison to healthy European adults, the patients displayed strongly depressed total Se (mean ± SD: 59.2 ± 20.6 vs. 84.4 ± 23.4 µg L−1) and SELENOP (mean ± SD: 2.2 ± 1.9 vs. 4.3 ± 1.0 mg L−1) concentrations at hospital admission. Particularly strong associations were observed for death risk of cancer, diabetes and chronic cardiac disease patients with low Se status, and of diabetes and obese patients with Zn deficiency. A composite biomarker based on serum or plasma Se, SELENOP and Zn at hospital admission proved to be a reliable tool to predict severe COVID-19 course and death, or mild disease course. We conclude that trace element assessment at hospital admission may contribute to a better stratification of patients with COVID-19 and other similar infectious diseases, support clinical care, therapeutic interventions and adjuvant supplementation needs, and may prove of particular relevance for patients with relevant comorbidities.

On Feb 3 she reported to work at a different employer's office and proceeded to work without telling them of her positive test.

She settled the case under a combined charge and settlement agreement (basically she worked with the state board and said yeah I did it and let's negotiate a deal to settle this thing all at once before you release charges against me and then later have a hearing etc. She agreed to a five day license suspension, has to take 5 hours of continuing ed on infection control and pay the $100 fine.

I’m not trying to talk anyone out of the vaccine here, I think anyone that’s able to get it should, but the only cdc study he references in his statement that looks at real world infection data was the Kentucky study. This was widely refuted and if you read the entire study the cdc explains why in the limitations portion. This was pre delta before vaccine efficacy started to decline, the cdc couldn’t account for mild or asymptomatic infections that went unreported in the vaccinated which were later found out is common amongst the vaccinated (there was no research on it back then so people with cold or flu symptoms wouldn’t get tested because of vaccine reliance) a natural infection is common to pop positive up to 90 days later on a Covid test, leading someone with seasonal allergies to a false positive.

The fda actually put out that people both vaccinated shouldn’t use an antibody test as a measure of immunity or previous infection. https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/antibody-testing-not-currently-recommended-assess-immunity-after-covid-19-vaccination-fda-safety. While our system flushes antibodies fast, the cells that create those antibodies live in our bone marrow and are responsible for the actual immunity as they recognize the virus quickly and flood your system with antibodies, kinda like firefighters knowing what a fire looks like and turning their hoses on quickly when they need them and off when they don’t. Studies in the naturally infected have shown that these cells which are responsible for immunity are more than likely life long. I haven’t seen any studies on non naturally infected vaccinated folks but I would venture to guess that they do the same.

Also I would like to see what data he is using to discount the Israel study. They are pretty much the perfect testing ground for all things Covid and they are obviously pretty pro vaccine.

Just to reiterate I’m pro vaccination and nothing in this post is meant to talk people out of getting the vaccine. The article you posted is just very questionable at best, but I’m also not a doctor.

&gt;The damning assessment from a cross-party group of UK lawmakers found government planning was too focused on the flu and had failed to learn the lessons from previous outbreaks such as SARS, MERS and Ebola.
The government's ""gradual and incremental approach"" to interventions such as social distancing, isolation and lockdowns, had subsequently been proved ""wrong"" and cost lives, they noted.

&gt;”Decisions on lockdowns and social distancing during the early weeks of the pandemic — and the advice that led to them — rank as one of the most important public health failures the United Kingdom has ever experienced,"" they wrote.

&gt;The study, published by two parliamentary watchdog committees after months of hearings, comes ahead of an independent public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic, due to get underway next year.
Britain has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with nearly 138,000 deaths.

&gt;The exception was adults over 65 vaccinated with Pfizer and Moderna, who saw a very modest dip in efficacy against hospitalization. Among those 65 and older, Pfizer vaccine efficacy against hospitalization declined from 95 percent in May to 89.2 percent in August. Moderna vaccine efficacy against hospitalization for that same age group declined from 97.2 percent in May to 94.1 percent in August.

&gt;Boosters for those 65 and older and other specific groups are authorized for Pfizer's vaccine. The FDA and CDC are slated to weigh in on boosters for the Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines by late October.

&gt;While vaccines are holding strong against hospitalizations, all three vaccines lost some ability to protect against breakthrough infections across all age groups, the study said. People vaccinated with Pfizer saw the sharpest decline, though Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson also saw declines.

&gt;Some studies have suggested that as more time passes, vaccines will continue to lose their power to prevent infections along a gradual slope.

&gt;However, this new study suggested that the decline observed so far could have less to do with time passing and more to do with the emergence of new COVID-19 variants and changes in behavior, such as reduced mask wearing. For example, after the Delta variant became the overwhelmingly predominant variant, accounting for more than 85 percent of cases in New York, the declines seen in efficacy against infections plateaued.

&gt;This study reinforced a growing body of evidence suggesting that although breakthrough infections are becoming more common, people who are vaccinated generally speaking are not being hospitalized.

Okay, I see the edit now. As you can see from my link, you do have these systems of entry into the US, they are just not named colors, but just ""Presidential proclamations"". And those proclamations ban all non-resident travel from a large number of countries - it doesn't matter whether you're vaccinated, had covid, or whatever.

As for Denmark, as you can see from your links, there are no red countries - and red countries are the only countries where any rules apply to vaccinated individuals. So anyone from anywhere in the world can enter with a vaccine certificate, no restrictions at all. If you want to enter without proof of vaccination or previous infection, it does depend on the country.

I got my booster shot a little over 2 weeks ago. Initial studies by Pfizer show that a third shot more than 6 months after the initial sequence creates a much stronger immune response than after shot #2. This makes a lot of sense, because the body is prepped to crank out antibodies already.

Using the calibrated model, we evaluated the impact of enhanced vaccination rollout by scaling the daily vaccine doses distributed to achieve 74·0% coverage of fully vaccinated adults by July 31, 2021, and continued with the associated daily rates of vaccine rollout. We then simulated the epidemiological trajectories of outbreaks in Florida and Texas and compared them with the observed cases, hospital admissions, and deaths in these two states from Dec 12, 2020, to Aug 31, 2021.  
We found that enhanced vaccination would have markedly blunted the increase in cases, hospital admissions, and deaths in Florida and Texas (figure; appendix p 6). From the start of vaccination on Dec 12, 2020, until Aug 31, 2021, Florida had reported 2 221 520 COVID-19 cases and Texas had reported 2 142 833. Achieving 74·0% vaccination coverage by July 31 and continuing with the associated daily rate would have averted 664 007 additional cases (95% credible interval \[CrI\] 419 219–848 020) in Florida and 647 906 additional cases (507 298–789 885) in Texas (appendix p 7). By Aug 31, the enhanced vaccination in Florida would have reduced hospital admissions by 61 327 (95% CrI 49 723–73 501) and deaths by 16235 (13 243–19 473). The reduction in hospital admissions in Texas during the same period would have been 37 587 (95% CrI 31 575–44 659) and the reduction in deaths would have been 6353 (5227–7501). Collectively, these two states could have averted more than 95 000 hospital admissions and 22 000 deaths had they reached the vaccination coverage achieved by the top five states and continued at the same pace until Aug 31, 2021.",,,,,,,,,1634057465,,,{},hgdgqjy,True,t3_q6qfmq,False,False,t3_q6qfmq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q6qfmq/implications_of_suboptimal_covid19_vaccination/hgdgqjy/,,13,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1634178361.0,

""Mild"" covid is anything other than hospitalization and death, but it can include infecting others, as well as symptoms that absolutely don't feel ""mild"" at all, including long Covid and permanent debilitating effects. This was outgoing FDA scientists Marion Gruber and Philip Krause's doing -- and it seems to me they were basically just angered by Biden announcing too early the plan for Pfizer boosters, so their last act before quitting was to reject general population boosters as a big f--- you to Biden and the American public. 

I think the FDA is now in more of a position to make better decisions and has even indicated that they'd reconsider the issue for Pfizer boosters. However, in the case of Moderna the need for boosters is less clear, since efficacy against symptomatic illness is still holding up at 6 months at 90+% (which is not even 2x worse infection risk vs. the Phase 3 trial result).

Ultimately it seems clear as day, that the issue is equity.  The WHO are the only ones willing to be completely up front and transparent about this.  The FDA/CDC low key moved the goalpost real quick to discussing VE against severe disease only.  Pretending like that was the only original endpoint anyway.  It's no longer infection, it's no longer transmission.  This is quite ironic because some of their own policies were specifically based on VE against infection, such as the ability to unmask, and then later mask up once again.  Personally I find this disingenuous.  You can't hold the key to eliminating (or greatly reducing) spread, withhold it from me, yet ask me to mask up so I don't spread the virus or accidentally kill someone.  Worst of all, the lack of transparency regarding the real reason.  I'd rather them come out an parrot the WHO.

As far as the equity of it all, it's difficult to parse this.  The US already committed to donating 1 billion shots by mid 22.  AFAIK no one has **donated** nearly as much.  I haven't seen a single credible source that states withholding roughly 100 million boosters in the US would impact global vaccine equity.  1 shot withheld in the US does not equal 1 shot administered in Africa.  Not to mention that were were able to produce over 4 million shots a day 6 months ago.  I can only imagine capacity is up from that point.  So we're probably talking several weeks of capacity.  The administration says they can do both.  I've heard Scott G. discuss this topic as well, stating 1 less shot in the US does not equal 1 more shot in Africa, etc.

I am no sociologist, but to my personally equity only makes sense in a 1 for 1 scenario.  If you can prove that the shot you withheld from me resulted in someone in the developed world getting theirs, fine.  But if you can't, or worse you know that it doesn't work that way, yet you still insist on equity for the optics...

The myocarditis in younger people has drawn the most attention, but there seems to be a seperate sydrome of pericarditis in older people. The mechanism is obviously autoimmune, but the fine details have yet to be worked out. I quote here from [an article in Circulation](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.056135); 

&gt; Although the mechanisms for development of myocarditis are not clear, molecular mimicry between the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and self-antigens, trigger of preexisting dysregulated immune pathways in certain individuals, immune response to mRNA, and activation of immunologic pathways, and dysregulated cytokine expression have been proposed. The reasons for male predominance in myocarditis cases are unknown, but possible explanations relate to sex hormone differences in immune response and myocarditis, and also underdiagnosis of cardiac disease in women. Almost all patients had resolution of symptoms and signs and improvement in diagnostic markers and imaging with or without treatment. Despite rare cases of myocarditis, the benefit-risk assessment for COVID-19 vaccination shows a favorable balance for all age and sex groups; therefore, COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone ≥12 years of age.

Now let's do a comparison. The incidence of post-vaccination myocarditis has been reported to be about 12.6/million, and **almost all recover without treatment**. From the [Johns Hopkins tracking site](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality) the case fatality rate of covid19 itself is about 1.6% in the USA. So, with the disease itself 2016/million people will **die**, not be sick for a few days and recover. 

I'm sure there are many shady sites on anti-social media which will fail to inform the reader that the myocarditis/pericarditis is usually self limiting. The world has never lacked for liars. But give the devil his due and suspend belief (and laughter or disgust) for a moment. The odds are very much in favor of the vaccine, **160X** in fact. If this was a casino and the odds were 160 to one that you'd win the bet you'd be running out to borrow money to lay down on the table.

We'll see how the research develops given that the pandemic still has a long time to rage. Science is questions after all. Without the unknown and questions it isn't science. For now I think everyone should rest easy and take the vaccination.

Here's a very relevant excerpt:

The results of these studies support giving a booster at an interval between 2 and &gt;6 months after  
the first dose depending on several factors including the epidemiologic profile of COVID-19 in a  
given region, and perhaps most importantly, the benefit/risk assessment for individuals receiving  
the vaccine. For those at high risk, such as front-line workers and healthcare providers at high risk  
of exposure, the severely immunocompromised, and those with certain co-morbidities who may  
have not had a robust immune response to a single dose, our data support a booster administered  
2 months after dose 1. The clinical benefit of the booster is clear with higher efficacy against  
symptomatic and severe disease than that observed with a single dose, providing maximum  
protection for these high-risk individuals in a short timeframe with no accompanying increase in  
reactogenicity. For individuals at lower risk of COVID-19 from an occupational and/or health  
perspective, having a longer interval between doses may provide additional benefit. A booster  
administered 6 months after dose 1 induced even greater immune responses than those observed  
with the 2-month boost. A correlate of protection has not been defined; higher responses could  
lead to even longer lasting protection than that currently observed. Further, no additional safety  
signals have been observed in study COV3009 to date and this combined with the data from all  
the Ad26.COV2.S studies support the safety of the regimen. In summary, the benefits of a booster  
whether given 2 months or ≥6 months post-vaccination are clear. Our data support a schedule that  
provides the most benefit to individuals based on their risks associated with COVID-19, whether  
a single dose for efficient pandemic response, a 2-month boost for individuals at high risk of  
exposure or with specific health risks, or a ≥6-month boost to maximize durable protection.

By reaching out to a person who is positive and getting their contacts from them, the Health department can work much more proactively to track and prevent further spread by being the one to reach out to contacts. A lot of people might feel hesitant to reach out to their own contacts. With Contact tracing and the Health department we can keep you anonymous so that when we call we say it's a reliable source and due to HIPPA we cannot share the information of the person who tested positive. (That said if you limit who you spend time with, and are smart about it, you can probably figure out where you got exposed, but we aren't gonna say who it was unless given permission by the positive person.) This way your informed and we can inform your contacts for you without letting them know who you are. We can then make sure those people monitor and quarantine so that they limit spread to anyone else in their life. 

This also allows us to make sure to give them up to date guidance that we have set in place based off of CDC guidance. We are here to be a source of information on all things Covid so that you can be well informed. It took me about 8 hours of training, and even then we have weekly meetings to discuss any updates in guidance and other issues or feed back from contacts that fellow contact trackers had  with contacts so we can in turn reshape our guidance to best serve the community. Relying on the person who tested positive to do this is negligent.  They dont know all the proper information. They may have gotten information from a contact tracer but that doesnt mean they will be able to remember or retell all that information to their own contacts. They're probably too focused on themselves to really help their own contacts and be able to give the most reliable and accurate information. Plus the person who is positive could be facing serious illness so it would be impossible to for some to be reaching out to all their contacts. 

This just sounds pointless, and does not sound like the best way to come across as if your health department actually cares about you and the community.

&gt; This clause, sometimes referred to as the Guarantee Clause, has long been at the forefront of the debate about the rights of citizens vis-à-vis the government. The Guarantee Clause mandates that all U.S. states must be grounded in republican principles such as the consent of the governed.[17] By ensuring that all states must have the same basic republican philosophy, the Guarantee Clause is one of several portions of the Constitution which mandates symmetric federalism between the states. 

This would provide grounds for fighting the non-representative elections (gerrymandering, closing polling places, electors chosen by the state Senate) that the Republicans are fighting for.",,,,,,,,,1633998325,,,{},hgalq1v,False,t3_q67yka,False,False,t1_hgajh23,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q67yka/texas_gov_greg_abbott_bans_vaccine_mandates_by/hgalq1v/,,213,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1634121788.0,

There is some mitigation going on at least right now. People are a little more inclined to socially distance, and masks are in use by a lot (most?) people (I'm sure this varies by region). Kids are more likely to be asked to stay home with flu-like symptoms while getting tested.

However, last year's flu season was almost nonexistent. We have a lot of naive immune systems out there that haven't seen influenza in over 2 years and I don't know what flu vaccination rates are going to be like. I could see it being everything from a calm year to an explosive one.

This is very much not true in all studies.

A new, large, detailed [study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.08.21264595v1.full.pdf) out of NY shows effectiveness for those vaccinated in January through April is 78.4% (18-49)/82.9%(50-64)/84.3%(65+) in the month of August.

Some other studies have given us similar numbers. The key is to look at where waning immunity and delta intersect.

&gt;Since July, approximately one in five coronavirus patients who received an intensive lung-bypass treatment, or Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), were unvaccinated and pregnant.

&gt;”The disproportionate number of unvaccinated pregnant women in intensive care demonstrates that there is a significant risk of severe illness from Covid-19 in pregnancy,” said Dr. Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in a statement on the N.H.S. website.

&gt;The N.H.S. is now pleading with pregnant women to get vaccinated as soon as possible, pointing to mounting safety data that counters unfounded fears that the vaccine poses severe risks to their health.

&gt;The N.H.S. reports that “over 100,000 Covid vaccinations in England and Scotland, and a further 160,000 in the U.S., show there has been no subsequent harm to the fetus or infant.”

&gt;Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, the chief midwifery officer for England, called the announcement “another stark reminder that the Covid-19 jab can keep you, your baby and your loved ones safe and out of hospital.”

&gt;The vaccine was made available in December of last year and access was given to pregnant women at high risk of serious complications from Covid-19. But other pregnant women were advised against the vaccine while data surrounding its side effects was gathered.

&gt;British health regulators finally advised in April that pregnant women should receive the vaccine, citing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that showed about 90,000 pregnant vaccinated women in the United States had no emerging health issues. Now, more than 81,000 pregnant women have received their first dose of the vaccine, according to Public Health England.

&gt;”But there is still more to be done,” Britain’s health secretary, Sajid Javid, said in a statement Monday, adding that the Covid vaccine is generally considered safe for pregnant women. It is now recommended by the Royal College of Obstetricians, Royal College of Midwives and the U.K. Tetralogy Service.

&gt;Covid-19 poses a significantly higher risk to women who are pregnant, and outweighs the risks of women getting vaccinated, according to safety data released by the C.D.C. in August. In the United States, vaccination rates among pregnant individuals are far lower than the rest of the population, the C.D.C. reported last month, with only 31 percent of pregnant women having received both shots before or during pregnancy, as of Sept. 18.",,,,,,,,,1634009321,,,{},hgb9myt,True,t3_q6czy6,False,False,t3_q6czy6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q6czy6/one_in_five_of_englands_most_critically_ill_covid/hgb9myt/,,16,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1634134637.0,

On the eve of their debut, five players have already been sidelined by an implacable foe: the league’s Covid-19 protocols.

&gt;The team, which plays its first regular season game Tuesday night against the Las Vegas Golden Knights, did not release any details about precisely what caused the players to be deactivated, including whether they tested positive for Covid.

&gt;During a call with reporters on Monday, Dave Hakstol, the team’s head coach, was asked why it looked like the team was down four men during a practice. Mr. Hakstol said that four players — Marcus Johansson, Jared McCann, Jamie Oleksiak and Joonas Donskoi — were not on the ice because of Covid protocols. Calle Jarnkrok was already known to be out because of the protocols.

&gt;”Things happen quickly, and sometimes at inopportune times there’s different challenges as you go throughout the season,” Mr. Hakstol said. “This is one of them for us early on.”

&gt;The coach acknowledged the hurdles posed by the sidelined players. “We have decisions to make as we go through the day,” he said. “We’ll do that and we’ll be ready to play as we get into Vegas tonight and ready to go tomorrow.”

&gt;The league’s commissioner, Bill Daly, estimated in September that 98 percent of players will be vaccinated against the virus, leaving just a handful of the league’s 700 players without protection, The Associated Press reported. The Kraken’s general manager, Ron Francis, said at the start of training camp that the team’s entire roster had been vaccinated, according to The A.P.

&gt;The N.H.L. released detailed protocols in September that encouraged players to get vaccinated, ideally with a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine. “Quite simply,” the league said, “vaccination is the most effective measure to protect against infection with Covid-19.”

&gt;Clubs have the right to suspend an unvaccinated player who is unable to play because of the protocols or local regulations and also dock the player’s salary.",,,,,,,,,1634009092,,,{},hgb95kq,True,t3_q6ckc7,False,True,t3_q6ckc7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q6ckc7/five_members_of_the_nhls_newest_team_are/hgb95kq/,,5,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1634134373.0,

That said, I was making a statement in general on humanity and what is going on with mistrust in public health protocols because it is connected to the government or each nation  during a pandemic which effects the whole world.

I probably should have not used the situation on what is going on in Russia based on the article in this post as an example as what is going on the majority of the nations of the world right now that is affecting how the world is handling the pandemic based on mistrust of many governments.

We describe a long COVID patient with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, which seems important, specifically due to recent reports of gray matter volume loss in COVID-19 patients. Further studies of SARS-CoV2 RNA, markers of inflammation, and neuronal damage in the CSF of patients with long COVID would be useful and should address whether the CNS can serve as a reservoir of SARS-CoV-2, clarify the pathway by which COVID-19 contributes to CNS dysfunction, and how best to therapeutically address it.",,,,,,,,,1634054991,,,{},hgdap0l,True,t3_q6plds,False,False,t3_q6plds,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q6plds/sarscov2_rna_in_the_cerebrospinal_fluid_of_a/hgdap0l/,,17,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1634175170.0,

[],,,ExpertgamerHB,,,[],,,,text,t2_wcvsxte,False,False,"On Jan. 9, 2020, about a week after the world first learned of a mysterious cluster of pneumonia cases in central China, authorities announced that scientists had found the culprit: a novel coronavirus.  
It was a sobering announcement, and an unnervingly familiar one. Nearly two decades earlier, a different coronavirus had hurdled over the species barrier and sped around the world, causing a lethal new disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. The virus, which became known as SARS-CoV, killed 774 people before health officials contained it.  
But even as scientists worried that history might be repeating itself, there was one glimmer of hope. Although all viruses evolve, coronaviruses are known to be relatively stable, changing more slowly than the common flu.  
“There was, I think, a sense that would work in our favor, and that the nightmare scenario of it being like influenza — constantly changing and needing updated vaccines all the time — would probably not be the case,” said Dr. Adam Lauring, a virologist and infectious disease physician at the University of Michigan.  
What many scientists had not counted on was unchecked global spread. Over the following weeks, the new virus, SARS-CoV-2, skipped from Wuhan, China, to a cruise ship in Japan, a small town in northern Italy and a biotechnology conference in Boston. Country by country, global coronavirus trackers turned red.  
To date, more than 237 million people have been infected with the virus, and 4.8 million have died — 700,000 in the United States alone.  
With every infection come new opportunities for the virus to mutate. Now, nearly two years into the pandemic, we are working our way through an alphabet of new viral variants: fast-spreading Alpha, immune-evading Beta, and on through Gamma, Delta, Lambda and, most recently, Mu.  
“We just have uncontrolled infections in much of the world, and that’s going to lead to more chances for the virus to evolve,” Dr. Lauring said.  
Even for a virus, evolution is a long game, and our relationship with SARS-CoV-2 is still in its infancy. We are extremely unlikely to eradicate the virus, scientists say, and what the next few years — and decades — hold is difficult to predict.  
But the legacy of past epidemics, as well as some basic biological principles, provides clues to where we could be headed.

Ontop of that you can rewear them for that timeframe up to 3-5 times. Theres a guide from a german university i follow, copy pasting my old comment:

Yes they can. Those masks are usually used at work places, if you go grocery shopping for 20 minutes its reasonably understandable that this doesnt equal a shift of 8 hours. Of course you shouldnt wear them anymore once they show physical damages, different color/stains or get moist (let it dry). Look at them properly each time before putting them on. Avoid touching the surfaces of the mask.

the nk95s can be reused aswell, up to 5 times. how? hang them between each use for 7 days, at the 7th day they can be used again OR treat them with heat. how? put them in a plasticbag, get rid of the air inside, close it properly. put enough water in a cooking pot so the bag doesnt touch the ground. when it boils put the bag inside, close with a lid, wait 10 minutes. then get it out and hang it again (dont leave it in the bag). you can do this maximum of 3 times. alternatively you can put the mask in oven for 60 minutes at 80°C=175F. this can be done 5 times. this is based on a study of a german university, source in german https://www.fh-muenster.de/gesundheit/downloads/forschung/ffp2/02_ffp2_info25022021_doppelseiten.pdf Masks with filters or such ones that cant be folded flat shouldnt be treated in these heating processes.",,,,,,,,,1634059251,,,{},hgdkznf,False,t3_q6gbwu,False,True,t1_hgdekza,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q6gbwu/daily_discussion_thread_october_12_2021/hgdkznf/,,1,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1634180632.0,

I am italian, fully vaccinated, always wearing mask and always relied on what expert said.

i was directed towards this observation.

The basic idea that mask are effective in prevending covid started to be questioned when I read about almost equal rise and decline in covid cases in USA counties and states where mask are required or non required.

The basic hypiothesis of the efficacy of mask in preventint covid spread could be falsified (in regarding of Popper science theory) by a single fact or observation. In this case, it was observed that mask are quite useless in reducing Covid spread.

This is by design, public health officials are trained to develop messaging to change behaviors or policy. They are not unbiased arbiters of the science. Most of the time changing the public behavior is served by informing the public of risks, but we've seen during this pandemic they are not always correlated.

* Early mask recommendations to guard resources (""[Stop buying Masks, they are not effective](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/health/coronavirus-n95-face-masks.html)"")

* Claiming all vaccines are the same to encourage vaccine uptake ([despite clear difference in J&amp;J efficacy rates](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2101544))

 vaccinated people have already made antibodies to the coronavirus. Even if they don't prevent infection they still ""should be coating that virus with antibody and therefore helping prevent excessive downstream transmission,"" Kedl says. And a virus coated with antibodies won't be as infectious as a virus not coated in antibodies.

What Tal has found is that in addition to the circulating antibodies, there was a surprisingly large amount of antibodies in mucosal membranes in the nose and mouth, two of the primary entry points for the coronavirus.

If there are antibodies in the mucosal membranes, they would likely be coating any virus that gets into the nose or throat. So any virus that was exhaled by a sneeze or a cough would likely be less infectious.

""If you actually isolate virus from people who are getting a secondary infection after being vaccinated, that virus is less good at infecting cells,"" Pepper says. ""It's not known why. Is it covered with an antibody? Maybe. Has it been hit by some other kind of immune mediators, cytokines, things like that? Maybe. Nobody really knows.

The actual claim is from real-world data [from Israel](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.07.21264626v1.full.pdf) from a couple days ago.  Table 2 is the one.  Note that it shows a 10+ fold improvement in the booster vs nonbooster groups, but there may be confounding factors there since they're completely different demographics.  But there's a window of data right after the booster was given that still shows over 5-fold improvement and I would consider pretty incontrovertible.  The only caveat with this data is that it's from Pfizer only.

We have a causal explanation that makes complete sense for this, as well.  Moving over to moderna, we know that the third dose improves antibody titers (the primary driver against infection, though not after infection) by a really large factor even over where they were after the second dose in [slide 28+ here](https://investors.modernatx.com/static-files/c43de312-8273-4394-9a58-a7fc7d5ed098), or in a [larger sample here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.29.21264089v1).

Should I get Vaccinated or Not?

I can’t tell what’s real anymore. I can’t tell what’s misinformation or not. For starters, I live in America, and there’s quite a few different vaccine options to choose from. If you're wondering why I haven’t already gotten one by now, well there’s a few reasons. The biggest one is my dad. All the time he shows me all of these alternative news sources that seem to have some pretty legitimate sounding information on why I absolutely shouldn’t get the Covid vaccine. Understand that in living with him, I have no choice but to hear from these news sources on an almost daily basis. I’ve also searched for other sources specifically debunking the stuff he shows me and I can’t find much. It doesn't help that he’s a very sophisticated guy, meaning that sometimes I feel like maybe I should be listening to what he’s saying. But then at other times he holds some absolutely ignorant and destructive beliefs that I could never ever agree with. He’s extremely homophobic and sexist for example. On the other hand though, if the things he shows me about the vaccine are true, then once I get it there’s no turning back and no telling what’s gonna happen to my body and health down the line. Here are some of his sources of news on the subject: Glenn Beck, Steve Dace, James Corbit, and mainly a lot of information from a platform known as the Blaze. I’ve spent a lot of time listening to all of them, (involuntarily) and I honestly don’t know what to think. I want to get the vaccine if it means keeping the people around me safe. Here’s the other thing though, there’s a good chance I’ve already had it. About 5 ish months ago my dad got the virus from his girlfriend, but he never had any symptoms. Being that he had to have had it, and I was around him a ton during this time, there’s only two options. Either I’m immune to it, or I’ve already had it once before. I don’t know how a lot of medical science works, and I feel as though I can’t properly research this on my own as I can’t even tell what sources of information are valid anymore. I know this is a long post, but if anyone could help me get an understanding of this and what I should do that would be absolutely amazing. I’m open to all sorts of new ideas and suggestions. I just need help. 

Also btw, I thought this might be important. I’m 21, male, and in pretty decent shape.

Do you honestly think there is something hidden in that data that will make the FDA and the CDC not allow children to be vaccinated? 

I do not. 

These studies have been going on for months. If there was an unexpected side effect of the Pfizer vaccine (that over 100 million Americans over the age of 12 have already taken, plus tens of millions more in other countries) in children they would have seen it by now. 

Some people do not seem to see the urgency in this --- many families have people that are immune compromised, elderly or have diabetes and other risk factors. In many cases, under 12s are the only unvaccinated people in the household. 

The complications of this interminably long review process are quite serious for the parents of young children. 

I do not see any realistic chance that the FDA/CDC will not approve the Pfizer vaccine for children --- no chance whatsoever. There is no sign that there is any unknown danger either --- from all accounts, the trials have been a success. 

So they should at least allow parents who want to vaccinate their children ASAP do so under the condition that they sign a waiver acknowledging the review isn't complete but they understand the risks etc. 

But this ""process"" has serious real world consequences, and they need to start acting like it.",,,,,,,,,1634001521,,,{},hgasidw,False,t3_q5c9sc,False,True,t1_hg89fuh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q5c9sc/go_out_there_and_enjoy_halloween_dr_fauci_says/hgasidw/,,2,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1634125319.0,

	The vast majority of Americans subject to workplace vaccination mandates have complied with them, confounding predictions that such requirements would worsen labour shortages by prompting unvaccinated workers to resign en masse.

New York state’s mandate for healthcare workers was one of the first and strictest mandates enforced to date — it included no option for unvaccinated workers to opt-out with regular testing.

Some had predicted it would cause at least one hospital to pause elective procedures and force state governor Kathy Hochul to consider calling in the National Guard. In the end, 92 per cent of both hospital and nursing home staff were vaccinated before the deadline and no major interruptions to patient care were reported, according to the governor’s office.
