The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said that once the vaccines thawed, unopened vials could be kept in the fridge for up to a month.

The current limit is just five days.

The increased flexibility is expected to have a significant impact on the vaccine roll-out across the EU.

The need for transport and storage at very low temperatures has been one of the major disadvantages of the Pfizer jab.

The previous storage requirements for Pfizer vaccines have made them harder to use in some parts of the world.

In February, the United States approved storage and transport of the Pfizer vaccine at standard freezer temperatures of -15 to -25C for up to two weeks, as opposed to between -80 to -60C that it usually requires.

Turned out that all 3 of us, my mom, my brother &amp; I, had no antibodies. We all had to be re-vaccinated. Again, the antibodies didn’t develop. 
So, when it came time to vaccinate my own children, I decided to wait until they started 1st grade. I just figured that it could be something genetic, and so why rush to inject them before school. 

I will probably be down voted for this. It’s just my own experience. I just worry. I understand that vaccines and modern medicine is a miracle.

2.	⁠Considering what we know about COVID, it makes no sense that this was around for months  which no death.
3.	⁠They used a home made “proprietary” antibody test.

 Locally (Memphis, TN) we have nearly 70% vaccination rates for ages 65+, which represent 75% of deaths. 25% of our county population is under 18 and there have been 0 deaths. We've gone from a 7-day average of 17 deaths per day 3 months ago (Feb 6), down to 2 deaths per day 2 months ago (March 18) and we've maintained that level or below.

Daily 14-day average cases per 100k dropped from 90 in December down to 13 by late February and we've held that.

The June 15th date was picked April 6th. 

“What triggers our move Beyond the Blueprint?
On June 15, California will fully open its economy if two criteria are met:

1. Equitable vaccine availability: If vaccine supply is sufficient for Californians 16 years or older who wish to be inoculated. [i]
AND
2. Consistently low burden of disease: Hospitalizations are stable and low, and specifically, hospitalizations among fully vaccinated individuals are low.”

“[i] Vaccine supply is sufficient for eligible individuals wanting a vaccine to obtain an appointment to receive the inoculation within 2 weeks.”

1. We achieved that goal. There are walk up appointments at many places. If you want to make an appointment I’m sure you can find one a few miles away within the next week. 

2. Not clear. For “hospitalizations among fully vaccinated individuals are low.” I believe this is true. “Hospitalizations are stable and low” - this one doesn’t specify a threshold so it’s not clear if we are there. 

When Newson announced June 15th and several times since then (even last Thursday) he mentioned it was “by June 15th” keeping the door open to shift it sooner.

Edit: So yes it seems evidence points to ""I was talking out of my ass"" so good on you for asking for sources.  But I did find some interesting tidbits in the process that are worrying nonetheless.

Infants and fetuses seemed to be at a higher risk of developing issues as their cardiovascular system is still developing and can be vulnerable to covid.

I found that 2-6% of kids had multisystem inflammatory syndrome requiring intensive care.  It apparently doesn't kill them, but it's bad news.

The worst outcomes seemed to be reserved for kids that have existing cardiovascular issues, known or unknown.  And there's a good bit of kids, especially toddlers who are in this category.  Even my son, who seems perfectly healthy at the moment, had a cardiac anomaly when he was very young.

As for long term effects of exposure to the virus, I couldn't find much, probably because it's still too early.  It does have me worried though, not knowing if there are long term risks from exposure to the virus.  I think it's best to play it as safe as possible and not assume that just because it generally doesn't kill children that it's completely safe for them to come in contact with the virus.

There is a small but noticeable percentage of kids that have existing conditions that make them vulnerable to the virus, and some of these kids might now know they have these conditions if they are mild enough or undiagnosed.  Since asymptomatic kids can absolutely spread the disease like crazy, it puts those other kids at great risk.  But that takes some empathy and understanding that ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"" which seems to be sorely lacking in the US today.

People seem to assume that it's similar to other diseases like the flu, BUT IT ISN'T.  It's a novel thing and we don't know what to expect long term.  People jump from ""It doesn't kill children"" to ""It's totally safe for kids to get it"" rather easily.  The safest thing to do is to make sure as *few people contract it as possible*, but large chunks of the US population are too fucking stupid and short sighted to understand that.

I also don't want this to be an overtly-political comment. It may have those tones, but that's the reality of the situation.

My experience with Ohio is likely relatable to the target audience of this vaccine initiative. While I've certainly been to Cleveland more than a once (the change in Cleveland from the 90s to now is great), I was born/raised/and continue to have strong family ties to middle-of-nowhere, cobblestone main street, rural Ohio.

I love those towns, I love how quiet and peaceful they are, I love how ""slow"" it is, how friendly you can be with just about everyone in town. These aren't backhanded compliments, either. As someone who lived a good chunk of life before the internet became a thing, I have a real appreciation for the ""disconnected"" life (even if all of those rural towns have some form of high speed internet now).

But the quaintness and nostalgia of those towns doesn't end at the construction or the population density. The people in these areas were once in amazing economic situations and some of the smaller cities/bigger towns were actually pretty well-off at the time. But then the industries that built them up abandoned them, and a lot of ..... policies and .... decisions were made that pushed these people down and kept them there.

Unfortunately, these people were convinced that the cause of the downturn was... well, anyone and anything but the actual cause. So, there's a deep-seated hatred and anger and fear, and yeah, it sucks. Because you know these people on a personal level, and you know, in a one-on-one situation, they aren't bad people. They need help... Needed it, a long time ago, and it's never coming. 

So yeah, they'll all jump at getting a vaccine for a small hope of economic recovery, because being angry about masks and vaccines was never about masks and vaccines.

(and yeah, I know that you could sort of make this same kind of comment for so many other places in America, and it's true, there are these kinds of situations throughout the country, and each of them are as sad as the others, but this is specifically about Ohio, or, at least, my experiences in Ohio)",,,1621356614,{},gyl711t,False,t3_neycs8,False,True,t1_gykw6z3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/neycs8/ohio_sees_boost_in_shots_after_it_announces_1/gyl711t/,1621415179,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I'm not from the US, the CDC aren't a worldwide organisation. The WHO is. When pressure was put on the WHO to investigate the origins, they pandered to china and trusted the word of the CCP. In the past, pandemics have been recognised by the WHO when a few countries have infections. This time, they waited until the whole world were infected to call it. This influences countries decision making on travel and kills people by proxy. Why did they do this? Because China are a bully and use their influence (and bribes) to force the WHO's hand in protecting their reputation.

The WHO is much more involved in worldwide geopolitics than medicine, and is a worldwide organisation unlike the CDC.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Wouldn't a more plausible reason be that that's what the consensus medical advice globally was at the time?

No. As a person with a biomedical science degree, and somebody who literally worked with PCR machines (Which diagnose COVID-19 by identifying SARS-COV-2 DNA), we ALWAYS had to wear a mask and gloves even prior to the pandemic. It was well known that contaminants can aerosolize and cause infection, we knew this 10+ years ago during the swine flu epidemic. Perhaps the CDC copied the WHO, but the guidance they set was pandering to China. I can't comment on any bad advice given by the CDC, but I know the whole deal with ""Don't wear a mask, they don't work"" that the CDC and WHO set was to avoid a shortage in masks. This is TERRIBLE and caused a lot of people to lose faith in masks.

The WHO also set recommendations early on pandering to China. I am talking before it was a worldwide pandemic, while it was quietly spreading.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying the CDC is pro China (though they may well be). I'm explicitly talking about the WHO. If you really care, and are willing to have your mind changed, I will happily reference a timeline of all the shitty decisions the WHO made early on.

&gt;But by mid-March it was clear the virus could not be controlled with the standard pandemic flu action plan, one of New Zealand's top epidemiologists, Prof Michael Baker, told the BBC.  
&gt;  
&gt;A World Health Organization (WHO) report on the success of Wuhan's lockdown in late January made it clear the New Zealand approach should be to ""throw everything at it at the start"" and aim for total elimination, said Prof Baker.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We had to move away from the normal level of scientific certainty and say well, on balance of evidence, we know this has worked in China.""  
&gt;  
&gt;In late March, to prepare the public for a rapidly changing situation, New Zealand introduced a new four-stage alert system. Based on existing wildfire alerts, it would clearly indicate the current risk and the necessary social distancing measures.

Yes, yes. Please continue to shoot your mouth off despite New Zealand crushing the virus after shifting from Taiwan's model to the China model.

I’m not really buying it, though. I used about two years worth of good luck to get an appointment yesterday but really I got the appointment because of a computer error that gave away an extra 3,000 spots. Doesn’t matter, got impft but there are a ton of people in my eligibility group calling the booking service^1 and the people on the other end have zero clue when there will be new appointments available. This means that the vaccination center is fully booked through this week, maybe even through the end of the month. They haven’t even opened it up to 60-70 year olds yet, so they’re probably going to get the first week in June. Basically, there are going to be a ton of leftover people from these groups left to duke it out with the general public to somehow get an appointment before the vaccination center closes. 

1: if you want an appointment at the vaccination center, you have to use this really fiddly booking system that is a prime example of the state of technology in Germany.

Taiwan has already had an incident when a pilot got sick and he was caught going on a date with his mistress in a mall even though he was supposed to go to such places.  The recent outbreak happened because some of the airline workers decided not to follow the rules and decided to go visit the red light district right after their 3 day quarantine.

All this could have been avoided if the government made it their priority to vaccinate the airline workers and put tighter restrictions on their quarantine rules.

But in this case it looks like you are interpreting data yourself.  You are not a statistician.  You do not know if the data being collected is comprehensive enough or if you are reading it correctly though you yourself are so certain you are.  As I said before asymptomatics often get a negative result,  you do not know if that affected the numbers.  You do not know barely anything about the data collected.  

I'm not a science denier.  I've always supported global warming.  When the vast majority of experts believe in global warning I believe it's likely and would play it safe and follow their advice.  On the virus, the people that are supposed to share science with us outright lie and change their minds every second of the day.  And the way you are interpreting data may not be accurate.  I find it to be ego to assume you yourself are 100% right.  The risk versus reward is not there.  You are risking permanent damage to the kids or even death.  Even if the risk is low, the price is too high.

I'm actually a retired civil engineer and this type of catastrophic risk would not be taken (unless sadly people in power force it) in a situation like this.

Taipei population density: 9,700/km2

​Yes Taipei is far denser, but density alone doesn't cause massive spread. Here is a [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/population-density-does-not-doom-cities-to-pandemic-dangers/) article about the question of density in Covid spread.  The basic point is that density isn't the issue it is crowding.  Crowding may or may not be more common in dense urban areas.  A key data point: 

&gt;Even in hard-hit New York City, Manhattan has maintained the lowest COVID-19 rates among the city’s five boroughs, despite having the highest population density. Meanwhile some lower-density neighborhoods in Queens and the Bronx have seen higher rates of infection and death.

​Having higher density in Taipei didn't guarantee faster spread, but it may have increased the risk level.  Which simply means there was even greater need to have regular surveillance and community testing to catch any clusters before they could get out of control.  Density can't explain number jumping from 20-30 to 300 in a couple days unless the virus was already spreading.  

Contact tracing alone isn't enough because people lie, such as the case you mentioned.  In NZ the August and February clusters saw multiple people mislead the contact tracers, conceal meetings, act totally against the advice and visit churches and gyms and uni lectures while infectious.  That's why we have all the extra testing in NZ as a constant baseline.  

&gt;Context. In 2019, 8 million people travelled between China and Taiwan. 6 million to and fro HK, another 6 million for South Korea and Thailand combined. Warnings appeared right before lunar new year, when just about everybody here will be travelling.

I don't understand what this has to do with testing.  Why would high levels of movement before the borders closed in 2019 relate to testing within the community today?  I'm talking about having doctors regularly test anyone who presents with cold and flu symptoms and testing wastewater regularly for signs of Covid.",,,1621326934,{},gyjpgqq,False,t3_ne8fy9,False,True,t1_gyjnwye,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ne8fy9/taiwan_announces_record_333_new_local_cases/gyjpgqq/,1621384168,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I’m sure some have more of a right to complain than others depending on what’s going on in their own life and just where they are located geographically. I’m sure that contributes to how much more danger they are in but I just feel like a lot of people I have overblown Covid and a lot of people have equally under blown it if that’s even a phrase.  They are perfectly healthy people who claim they haven’t even been outside in the last year which is blows my mind. I could kind of understand it if they had certain ailments that would make them a higher risk group. I think some just have a little idea on how to put things in perspective.

Again I have no clue what you're talking about. There were plenty of reports about transit chaos worldwide and in Taiwan, but I don't know about your friend's mom. Sorry that happened?

I'm looking. Yes you are right there are many Youtube Public Health Experts from those places. What a jovial lot.

&gt;  
&gt;But by mid-March it was clear the virus could not be controlled with the standard pandemic flu action plan, one of New Zealand's top epidemiologists, Prof Michael Baker, told the BBC.A World Health Organization (WHO) report on the success of Wuhan's lockdown in late January made it clear the New Zealand approach should be to ""throw everything at it at the start"" and aim for total elimination, said Prof Baker.""We had to move away from the normal level of scientific certainty and say well, on balance of evidence, we know this has worked in China.""In late March, to prepare the public for a rapidly changing situation, New Zealand introduced a new four-stage alert system. Based on existing wildfire alerts, it would clearly indicate the current risk and the necessary social distancing measures.

Cool. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yes, yes. Please continue to shoot your mouth off despite New Zealand crushing the virus after shifting from Taiwan's model to the China model. If Taiwan's model is as effective as you claim it is, why did New Zealand ditch it?

Well that's just pure speculation.

&gt;In two weeks we may find ourselves absolutely fine. Or we may find ourselves in another period of uncontrolled rise. Modeling shows that we're not *quite* there with vaccination yet enough to support a massive surge of cases (the majority of deaths are in older people, but hospital admissions are a little more spread out). It's smart for the people in charge to at least consider both options. Unless you would rather they just ignore any problems going forward?

I wouldn't ignore problems going forward, I'd continue to plan to keep going as we are until we get some definitive information instead of 'oh but what if it's X more transmissive'.

But this is why the ""I LiSTEn tO SciEnCe"" meme has always made me cringe. Science without proper social context and appropriate, benifical application is useless.

One could easily look around at the disolving of trust the last four years have engendered, or the hostile, literally *militant* reaction anti-vaxxers and Covid Denialists - did we forget white supremacists tried to kidnap the Governor of Michgan over restrictions - and say ""Even if the data says those who are vaccinated will be safe removing their masks indoors, given the number of unvaccinated people and the pressure of anti-vaxxers,  it might be safer to keep mandates in place.""

Yes, they were worried about supply, considering it's pretty damn important for medical professionals to have steady access to masks, do you disagree? They also were not immediately aware of how likely asymptomatic transmission was. As the evidence accumulated, their recommendations changed. This seems completely reasonable to me. The science today might not have support their recommendations at the beginning, but science evolves as we learn more. 

Yes, there's public policy on top of science, again, like the idea that if the medical professionals who are taking care of COVID patients don't have access to masks, than we're all fucked. I was working in a COVID unit for a year. Well, except for the couple weeks that I was out sick, from COVID, probably in part because I didn't have a proper mask because the states supply ran out and they couldn't get us any more.

Like I said, I'm sure the CDC is fully aware of the flaws of the ""honor system,"" and despite that, felt comfortable enough to make this recommendation. So all the people who have criticized conservatives who refuse to accept to recommendations of experts this whole time, who are now refusing to agree with the CDC are just hypocrites in my eyes.

My arm at this point was very sore, but then I started to experience violent chills (no amount of blanket could have kept me warm). Almost bit my tongue off (well not literally, but it sure felt that close). This occurred for roughly 20 minutes straight and then I started to feel my body temperature slowly creep up. It was then I realized that my violent chills were actually the result of me actively developing a fever. So there I was, sweating in bed with a 103 degree F fever. I felt like Kilauea. I decided to take some Tylenol and try to go back to sleep after 2 hours of going through this. I'm now good with no fever (in fact, I actually have no headache or fatigue strangely enough), and my arm is actually feeling slightly less sore than before. 

In other words, for those of you who may be nervous about the second Moderna shot, I have given you (at least from my experience) a description of what it is like.

Ruling party spend millions on PR and Media like noone ever did in the country. Accordingly media was presenting them and their opinions. 

There is almost no minister which doesnt have any accusations or even mistrust from the people

And also they didnt pay or properly employ most of the workers. Donno if thats true

Then alot of evidence of corruption came to light with our financeminister and some companies and our chancellor proven lied to some questions that he wasnt invovled as chats leaked where he literally gave the orders for head position of ÖBAG which handles the finances of the austrian state at the stock exchange.

And our minister for interior affairs could have prevented the terror attack on vienna as they literally knew about it a year before it happened and that they got informations about the whole thing.

And guess what noone thinks about giving up their positions or resign their positions. Most of the information you get from independent Journalists or mostly from foreign media as our media is bought by most of them.

Not to mention of pushing laws to make them more powerfull and weakening our courts and constiution and and and

Every time we got curbside pickup we watched steady streams of unmasked customers going in and out of the buildings. Employees had masks, but customers didn't. And when there were windows to see in through, nobody was sitting at tables in masks. So restaurants were mainly mask free zones. In the small towns churches held in-person mask optional services and events like bazaars and holiday performances. We had parades, town fairs, holiday attractions like walk through light displays. Large festivals and fundraising concerts. Outdoors is safer, but plenty of mask optional events with people in close proximity happened on a regular basis.

Texas lifts mandate and everyone says ""you'll be sorry"" then when you aren't sorry they say ""Oh well businesses kept the mandates"" and just refuse to even entertain the idea that masks are pretty ineffective against covid.

The person you're replying to claims 99% adoption yet I doubt at any point they have wondered why they didn't just beat covid pre-vaccine with such a high compliance.

In 3-6 weeks these people won't be willing to admit they were wrong if cases continue to plummet. It'll either be silence or ""people kept wearing masks and that's why cases didn't explode""

I'll gladly admit I was wrong if the sky really does fall but after seeing what vaccines actually do to the pandemic it's pretty obvious to me that masks were barely doing anything.

It only looks linear over short timeframes, and the decay is not even truly exponential at the national level because it is driven by a mix of various states all with different curves. 

All that said, we are likely to see cases flatten in the coming months. Some states are well on the way to herd immunity and will continue to see declines, albeit slowly. Other states (e.g., the Deep South, and even rural areas within states that otherwise have immunity) will likely see fluctuating cases (at a low level) as the virus moves to just being endemic with the normal seasonality trends and random variations driving small growth and declines over time. 

I don't see the Indian variant driving much of an increase.

Autoimmune diseases start from an event, usually trauma, stress, or an infection, so basically any kind of stressor, and that leads to a chain reaction of inflammation. Stress stresses out the immune system and that can make it falsely recognize the bodies own cells as an invader. So when a vaccine bedriddens you for 2 days, bruises up your arm, and gives you a 102 fever, it’s like the exact stressor needed to set off an autoimmune disease. This is why people like me and others want to wait a couple years to see the effects because autoimmune diseases will take a long time to manifest after the stressor event. The only people I would tell not to get the vaccine would be the ones who have already had the virus, are immune, and had no major symptoms during the course of the virus.

Cases have been rapidly decreasing for weeks now, and that's as we ease mask mandates. Additionally, as more people receive their doses and more age groups become capable of being vaccinated, the virus will have an even harder time spreading, making a dramatic rise in cases even less likely as we cease wearing masks.

&gt; further mutations into vaccine-resistant strains

It is incredibly rare for pathogens to mutate in ways that fundamentally alter themselves in such a way and to the extent necessary to shield them from the effects of vaccines. With SARS-COV-2, the mutation rate is slightly slower than most viruses, lowering the chances further. And again, since the vaccine drive and natural heat of the spring and summer will force cases even further down, making the emergence of a vaccine-resistant strain even less likely.

&gt; The US is so screwed with this mentality.

In the US, around 132,000,000 Americans are fully vaccinated, meaning we are about 98,000,000 fully vaccinated Americans away from herd immunity. Today, we gave out 4,000,000 doses.

 That is what the data and science says.  And yet most of the health officials in charge of things and the media would have you believe that wearing a mask will keep you protected and have some huge effect on whether or not you get covid or not and it's simply a lie.  

 Sure if you are in a high risk area you should be wearing one regardless like a hospital or a nursing home just in case but otherwise there is zero data to show that it would actually make a difference elsewhere.

 Yes percentages do matter you are correct.  Which is why it's been a crime against humanity that we have been lied to and the average person has been brainwashed into thinking that they actually have a huge chance of getting covid if they don't have a mask on and they actually have some sort of legitimate chance of dying from it if they get it when the reality is the mortality rate is only like 0.001% according to the WHO.

 People have 0 perspective because  They have not been told any sort of objective truth and so they are living in fear of something that they shouldn't be  And are therefore incapable of making any sort of informed decision about any of it.

I've heard many people say that they didn't feel the Covid shot at all. And this is also true for the flu shot I got earlier this year – it didn't hurt at all.

2020.02.06: My friend's mother who is Chinese, had a transfer flight that originated from Bangkok that goes through Taiwan, who won't even set foot on Taiwan soil, was blocked from transferring flight and had to be stuck at the airport and rebook flights.

&gt;What you don't know is that I'm actually really a health expert. I said in 2020 April that social distancing and flatten the curve are shams. Wearing masks and stamping out the virus like China, Australia and NZ is the correct way and look where we are. Oh wait the contact tracing you mentioned always gave back 0 results. So much for contact tracing.

WOW ok... lol how many youtube hours did you log to earn that?

A storm descends on a small town, and the downpour soon turns into a flood. As the waters rise, the local preacher kneels in prayer on the church porch, surrounded by water. By and by, one of the townsfolk comes up the street in a canoe.

""Better get in, Preacher. The waters are rising fast.""

""No,"" says the preacher. ""I have faith in the Lord. He will save me.""

Still the waters rise. Now the preacher is up on the balcony, wringing his hands in supplication, when another guy zips up in a motorboat.

""Come on, Preacher. We need to get you out of here. The levee's gonna break any minute.""

Once again, the preacher is unmoved. ""I shall remain. The Lord will see me through.""

After a while the levee breaks, and the flood rushes over the church until only the steeple remains above water. The preacher is up there, clinging to the cross, when a helicopter descends out of the clouds, and a state trooper calls down to him through a megaphone.

""Grab the ladder, Preacher. This is your last chance.""

Once again, the preacher insists the Lord will deliver him.

And, predictably, he drowns.

A pious man, the preacher goes to heaven. After a while he gets an interview with God, and he asks the Almighty, ""Lord, I had unwavering faith in you. Why didn't you deliver me from that flood?""

God shakes his head. ""What did you want from me? I sent you two boats and a helicopter.""",,,1621289312,{},gyhypj2,False,t3_nefjup,False,True,t1_gyhdnhp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nefjup/target_lifts_face_mask_requirement_unless_local/gyhypj2/,1621344035,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

They weren't licensed for production for a number of reasons, but it wasn't because they didn't get through the trials.

The Spike proteins are the same proteins the body would encounter in the non-mRNA vaccines, or in an actual case of covid. It is not standard in vaccine trials to test each component separately - one of the reasons vaccines are designed the way they are is to make sure the part that stimulates immune response is around long enough to actually stimulate the response (this has been a big challenge in mRNA-based cancer treatment research - getting it to stick around long enough without just being destroyed by the body almost immediately). It is physically impossible for mRNA vaccines to alter your DNA or cause you to ""shed"" mRNA; that's simply not how it works.

The mRNA-based covid vaccines went through the full clinical trial process. The only reason they have emergency FDA authorization is because of a temporal lack of data due to the newness of both disease and vaccine. Now that these data are coming in because enough time has passed, the companies are applying for full approval and all signs point to that being extremely likely (nearly certain).

I think there are ethical arguments for and against mandatory vaccination in general, and I'm honestly not sure where I stand on that myself. (I am often very glad not to be a bioethicist, or making public health decisions.) 

But getting a covid vaccine, even an mRNA vaccine, outside of an actual clinical trial is not ""being in an experimental medical trial."" The vaccines have been fully trialled already.

I had a patient Friday- 18yo young man, admitted with pneumonia, Covid tested in the ER- negative. Came down to our floor on night shift. I come in and find his O2 sats have dropped to 86% from 97% on room air overnight, he is febrile, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, loss of smell that was not communicated to me in report. I place 3L on him and get him up to 94%. His fingers begin to turn progressively more purple, and while drawing blood from his foot (veins seemed flat regardless of IV hydration), his toes were too. I got a D-dimer and Covid swab, CBC w/D, CMP. D-dimer came back at 1.56, however platelets were 54. We gave Enoxaparin 70 mg SQ and sent to CT w/ w/o contrast. Negative for PE, positive for Covid. 

My question is- did we do the right thing by giving the lovenox? We shipped him to a bigger hospital, so i dont know the outcome, however I’m worried he may have been experiencing Thrombolytic Thrombocytopenia. Do you typically see elevated D-dimer, low platelets, purple fingers and toes with this type of complication? Thank you.

In the all-enrolled population of (total N=43,448), the proportions of participants who reported at least 1 SAE during the time period from Dose 1 to the data cutoff date (November 14, 2020) were 0.6% in the BNT162b2 vaccine group and 0.5% in the placebo group. The most common SAEs in the vaccine group which were numerically higher than in the placebo group were appendicitis (0.04%), acute myocardial infarction (0.02%), and cerebrovascular accident (0.02%), and in the placebo arm numerically higher than in the vaccine arm were pneumonia (0.03%), atrial fibrillation (0.02%), and syncope (0.02%). Occurrence of SAEs involving system organ classes and specific preferred terms were otherwise balanced between treatment groups, including no imbalance overall in cardiovascular serious adverse events.
Appendicitis was reported as a SAE for 12 participants, and numerically higher in the vaccine group: 8 vaccine participants ([appendicitis [n=7], appendicitis perforated [n=1]) and 4 placebo participants (appendicitis [n=2], appendicitis perforated [n=1], complicated appendicitis [n=1]). All of the vaccine participants (n=8) and 2 placebo participants were younger than 65 years of age. The cases were considered unrelated to vaccination by the study investigators and occurred no more frequently than expected in the given age groups. FDA agrees that there is no clear basis upon which to suspect that this imbalance represents a vaccine-related risk.
Three SAEs reported in the BNT162 group were considered by the investigator as related to vaccine or vaccine administration: shoulder injury, ventricular arrhythmia, and lymphadenopathy. The investigator and the sponsor thought that the shoulder injury was related to vaccine administration. Two SAEs in the BNT162b2 group and none in the placebo group were considered by the investigator, but not the Sponsor, as related to study vaccination: shoulder injury (n=1), ventricular arrhythmia in a participant with known cardiac conditions (n=1), and lymphadenopathy temporally following vaccination (n=1). In FDA’s opinion following review of the adverse event narratives, two of these events were considered as possibly related to vaccine: shoulder injury possibly related to vaccine administration or to the vaccine itself, and lymphadenopathy involving the axilla contralateral to the vaccine injection site. For lymphadenopathy, the event was temporally associated and biologically plausible.",,,1621294720,{},gyi9t9t,False,t3_nek77a,False,True,t1_gyi7g73,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nek77a/i_am_dr_alex_spyropoulos_a_blood_clot_expert_at/gyi9t9t/,1621351180,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

My bet is that this week's announcement will boost vaccination numbers in the coming month from their downward spiral. Already, the last 4 days have seen less of a drop than that from weeks before.

Ultimately the question we should be asking is, if we have truly reached herd immunity, why haven't we seen daily new cases sharply decline like it has in the UK and Israel?  Why are we still seeing daily new cases 3X larger than the UK, after normalizing for population size.   Against Israel, our daily new cases is 25X larger than Israel's, after normalizing for population. This tells us we haven't got there yet, else we'd have seen cases plummet just like the UK and Israel.

1.	General-purpose masks must be effective. It is necessary to identify and withdraw from the market those that are not and emphasize the need for a good fit. A poorly fitting mask (with gaps between the edge of the mask and the face) can see its effectiveness reduced by half . In shared interiors, including of course workplaces, it must always be carried, regardless of the distance between people.
2.	They are to promote activities abroad . This implies facilitating the use of parks and gardens and keeping an eye on 'false exteriors' such as enclosed terraces.
3.	Indoor spaces must be ventilated with outside air continuously and sufficiently, using natural or mechanical ventilation. It is about adding clean water to our pool continuously and gradually drawing colored water. How much? Enough so that the pool is never too dark, despite the fact that the spout with coloring does not stop. The criteria have to be clearly defined. Even the WHO has published recommendations on ventilation , although they do not yet explain clearly how infections occur.
4.	It is to measure the CO₂ indoors to check if ventilation is adequate. CO₂ is emitted together with aerosols when we breathe, so it is a very good indicator of how much used air is in a place. It is the best solution currently available to indicate the risk of contagion.
5.	Report on the effectiveness and potential risks of various air cleaning technologies . Filtering (known HEPA filters) is the preferred technology to effectively remove respiratory aerosols .
6.	Special attention must be paid to educational centers . They are spaces with the characteristics that propitiate super contagion events: many people, many hours a day and sometimes poor ventilation.
7.	Clear and effective criteria, procedures and regulations must be developed and applied to reduce the risk of contagion. The first can be a limit of 700-800 ppm CO₂ in shared interiors ( up to 1000 ppm if there is sufficient filtration ).
8.	The quality information is the best defense. Clear messages are needed about how the virus is transmitted and how to protect ourselves.

The same is true of overall population. That would mean something in a huge outbreak, but not in a local one.

My bad. Apples with apples then.

Auckland population density: 2,400/km2 

Taipei population density: 9,700/km2

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You make sound like Taiwan has fewer resources than NZ, so it can't do the same level of testing. But the two countries have a very similar level of wealth. There's no reason Taiwan should be limiting testing generally and only using it in large numbers after there is a possible outbreak.

Context. In 2019, 8 million people travelled between China and Taiwan. 6 million to and fro HK, another 6 million for South Korea and Thailand combined. Warnings appeared right before lunar new year, when just about everybody here will be travelling.

However, one concern some have raised here in the UK is the prospect of restrictions being reimposed every winter because of seasonal pressures, which in some years can be very severe. Previous to March 2020, the idea of imposing restrictions on individuals and businesses to prevent this from happening would have even occurred to anyone. Now, it is standard practice, and indeed NHS officials are incentivised to demand such action rather than increase the capacity themselves, or for the government to sort out the longstanding structural problems with the health service.

Soon a man in a rowboat came by and the fellow shouted to the man on the roof, ""Jump in, I can save you.""  
The stranded fellow shouted back, ""No, it's OK, I'm praying to God and he is going to save me.""  
So the rowboat went on.  
Then a motorboat came by. ""The fellow in the motorboat shouted, ""Jump in, I can save you.""  
To this the stranded man said, ""No thanks, I'm praying to God and he is going to save me. I have faith.""  
So the motorboat went on.  
Then a helicopter came by and the pilot shouted down, ""Grab this rope and I will lift you to safety.""  
To this the stranded man again replied, ""No thanks, I'm praying to God and he is going to save me. I have faith.""  
So the helicopter reluctantly flew away.  
Soon the water rose above the rooftop and the man drowned. He went to Heaven. He finally got his chance to discuss this whole situation with God, at which point he exclaimed, ""I had faith in you but you didn't save me, you let me drown. I don't understand why!""

No long term damage, we got off easy.

All that said, it was BRUTAL watching my newborn being so miserable, unable to eat, struggling to breathe, coughing like an old man. I was so worried her case WASN'T going to be one of the better outcomes.

Having been through THE MILDEST VERSION of watching my baby suffer, I never want to do that again if I can avoid it. There's no vaccine for RSV (there are some preventative treatments but they are usually reserved for NICU babies and babies with higher risk factors.) 

But there is a vaccine for Covid. So we will keep doing our best to reduce risks until our 4 and 6 year olds have been vaccinated because I'll be goddamned if I have to helplessly watch my kid struggle to breathe in the ER again if it's something that we could have easily avoided with a little extra caution.

But I admit I don't get the people saying they are masking all the time, every flu season, so they and their kids don't get sick. I don't know how it works elsewhere but I do not see younger kids wearing masks in school voluntarily. It's been a struggle as it is, and the only reason it's worked so well at our school is every single kid is doing it, no exceptions. As soon as it's down to one kid doing it, all bets are off. Older kids and teens, maybe? But not grade schoolers. And that's where most of the germs get into my house anyway. Me masking is not going to stop me getting everything my kid brings home. I can mask up at work sure, but again if everyone isn't doing it all the time when they are sick or might be, it won't work. Good on you if you want to, but I think there's a false sense of how much masks are really doing verses all the other precautions combined with masks. If you aren't also distancing and not going places and making sure everyone in your household, and everyone around you, is doing the same, how much is that mask going to do for you?

I look forward to a future study proving me wrong and maybe bringing about real change.

[],,el_empty,,,[],,,,text,t2_5xk66wln,False,False,[],"In conclusion, the point I'm trying to make:

1. Taipei sits very close to the epicenter in Wuhan, with lots of flights connecting it to other populous countries with frequent travel to China.
2. Taipei also has a large population, dense cities. 
3. \*Ideally\* Taiwan could test every single person. That's not possible because of the need to ensure that the system is not overwhelmed due to limited hospitals and medical professionals. 
4. So the strategy was to shut early and quickly. Test the existing cases that have already entered. Minimize risk of spread through aggressive quarantine and contact tracing. 
5. Because all cases were accounted for early on, it didn't make any sense to test the entire population. If there were individuals unaccounted for during this time, community transmission and widespread deaths would've happened last year. 
6. The goal is to preserve all capacities, readiness, and resources for when leaks happen, like what Taiwan is experiencing right now. 
7. A lot of Taiwan CDC's emphasis is on self-care and responsibility. Transparency and clear protocols allow the population to be relatively ready in the event of an outbreak. In the few days after the first announcement of local transmission, many companies immediately resorted to various measures like working from home, schools were shut down, all public buildings closed, etc. Streets of Taipei empty. 
8. Yesterday's cases peaked at 333 domestics. Today at 240. 

&amp;#x200B;

Specific points you raised:

&gt;density alone doesn't cause massive spread. Here is a Scientific American article about the question of density in Covid spread. The basic point is that density isn't the issue it is crowding

Thanks for the exposition. The context was on the size of Taiwan's cluster vis-à-vis resources. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Density can't explain number jumping from 20-30 to 300 in a couple days unless the virus was already spreading.

That's called community transmission. Density is simply one factor of many. Depending on the factors, speed of transmission varies. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Contact tracing alone isn't enough because people lie, such as the case you mentioned.  

That's right, people are selfish and they lie. So they resort to several other contact tracing tools like tracing apps, phone records, gps locations, transportation cards, name and number registrations at public buildings etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Context. In 2019, 8 million people travelled between China and Taiwan. 6 million to and fro HK, another 6 million for South Korea and Thailand combined. Warnings appeared right before lunar new year, when just about everybody here will be travelling.  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't understand what this has to do with testing.  Why would high levels of movement before the borders closed in 2019 relate to testing within the community today?  

A lot of travel = proximity to the epicenter and affected areas = the gravity of the situation that the CDC faces. If they were to test everyone including the domestic population, then they would've been severely overwhelmed. So the decision was made to be aggressive at the border instead. Since the early patients have all recovered, there was no need to aggressively test the entire population and instead save the ammunition for the next wave. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I'm talking about having doctors regularly test anyone who presents with cold and flu symptoms and testing wastewater regularly for signs of Covid.

Prof. MOORE: There's something that somehow they did wrong. I think it's important to recognize that that's wrong. Every scenario for the origin of HIV has it taking place during the period of colonial rule in Africa, and taking place as a result of ***colonial practices.***  
KNOX: Colonial practices like forced labor and well-intentioned medical campaigns.  
***Experts think it was around 1930 that HIV got its big chance, give or take a decade. We know that because there viruses mutate at a constant rate. So scientists can clock how long ago HIV diverged from its chimpanzee ancestor.***  
The date is important because of what was going on in West Africa then. The French and Belgians were hell-bent to extract rubber and ivory.

""Data from the world’s first reported trial to examine the level of immune protection after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in cancer patients, shows that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses at week three, following the first dose of the vaccine, were only 39% and 13% in the solid and blood cancers respectively, compared to 97% in those without cancer.  

The study, called SOAP, also reports that when the second dose of the vaccine was given three weeks after the first dose, the immune response improved significantly for solid cancer patients with 95% of them showing detectable antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus within just two weeks. By contrast, those who did not get a vaccine boost at three weeks did not see any real improvement, with only 43% of solid cancer patients and 8% of blood cancer patients developing antibodies to the Pfizer vaccine at five weeks compared to 100% of healthy controls.""

TLDR: the first shot give less protection to cancer patients, but the second dose give 95% of cancer patients antibodies. While antibodies are not a perfect indicator of immunty, the data we currently have is encouraging.

&gt;Public Health vs. Clinical Health Professions: What's the Difference?

&gt;The easiest way to explain public health is that it deals with health from the perspective of populations, not individuals. The clinical health care provider — your doctor, nurse, or dentist — helps you with your own personal healthcare issues. Let’s say you have asthma. It’s the clinical care provider who listens to you describe your symptoms. He or she does the necessary tests, makes the diagnosis, and prescribes the right medicines. You go home breathing better.

&gt;The public health approach is different. Public health takes a look at the whole neighborhood (or city, county, state, etc.) and figures out how many people have asthma and what’s putting them at risk. Then, public health professionals get to work figuring out how to reduce those exposures and cut down on the number of new asthma cases. Public health is also concerned with whether the people with asthma have access to doctors and are getting good care. If the folks on our side do their jobs right, the whole neighborhood breathes easier.",,,1621353663,{},gykztvx,False,t3_nefjup,False,True,t1_gykjbtt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nefjup/target_lifts_face_mask_requirement_unless_local/gykztvx/,1621411157,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,AnonymousWritings,,,[],,,,text,t2_itwof,False,False,[],"""Herd immunity"" number depends on how high R0 of covid really is. 

If it is around 3, then 70% of people being immune would work out. However, unfortunately the vaccines don't give 100% immunity to infection, particularly after a single dose (although they are incredibly effective at preventing serious cases, hospitilizations, and death).

Data from the UK suggests Pfizer reduces chances of infection by about 61% after the first dose (89% after second dose), but the risk of death is down 85% after only one dose. With an R0 of 3, you wouldn't reach true herd immunity after first doses alone in the absence of social distancing, although spread would be substantially reduced and hospitilizations/deaths would be dramatically reduced. 

After the second dose, you would expect to need 75% of the population vaccinated to achieve ""herd immunity"" with an R0 of 3. 

However, one other thing likely working in our favor is that it is probable that people who do get infected with covid after having a vaccine (first or second dose, are less likely to pass it on. This hasn't been well studied, but the fact that serious cases are so strongly mitigated suggests that viral loads are likely lower, meaning people would be less transmissible.

In summary, these vaccines are incredibly good, particularly at preventing deaths and hospitilizations. But I would be a bit wary of putting too much faith in the ""70% of population having first doses"" for herd immunity.

&gt;As of May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned from monitoring all reported vaccine breakthrough cases to focus on identifying and investigating only hospitalized or fatal cases due to any cause. This shift will help maximize the quality of the data collected on cases of greatest clinical and public health importance.

1. Not every parent can easily leave their kids at home and go get groceries. Some parents are single and can’t leave their child with a spouse. Some places don’t offer delivery or curbside, or charge an unreasonably high fee. This is especially true in rural areas. This would also be a concern for the immune compromised.

2. Children have sacrificed a LOT the last year. It doesn’t seem reasonable to tell them now that they basically have to return to lockdown or get exposed. It seems far more reasonable IMO to require adults to mask so that kids can safely go places.

3. Many states are dropping mandates at schools. Others have kept mandates at schools but are finding that once the mandates are gone everywhere else, the anti mask crowd starts pushing back hard on having them at schools. Once you drop mandates at schools, you are forcing kids with high risk conditions to choose between their education and their health. Once those high risk kids can access a vaccine, that isn’t as big a concern, but we aren’t quite there yet.

For me it really boils down to feeling that asking healthy adults to wear a mask is a much smaller burden than asking children to risk exposure every day. If we truly had a way to enforce that only vaccinated adults were going mask-free, I would be onboard with that, but we don’t. And the idea of someone getting really sick when we are this close is frustrating.

Part of it is, if you get a vaccine, and are still told to wear a mask, why get the vaccine with all the horror stories. But lifting the mask requirements and recommendations for vaccinated people encourages people to get vaccines, which is more important than masks right now.

You can typically find graphs of how many people die in a normal year and compare that against how many are dying in 2020 and 2021 to get a (reasonably) good idea of the true death toll from Corona.

I couldn't easily find one for India, but here is one for the US.

https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WTHR/images/6c2d3358-c07f-4eb7-8096-6ccbee9f245b/6c2d3358-c07f-4eb7-8096-6ccbee9f245b_1920x1080.png

I pulled that from this news article.

https://www.wthr.com/mobile/article/news/verify/verify-are-the-number-of-deaths-in-the-us-actually-falling-despite-the-covid-19-pandemic/531-dd1fe4ba-f686-4190-8734-bc9dde38b875

This image/article is outdated, so obviously don't pay any attention to anything after about week 38.  You can find more recent ones if you want, but my goal here is to give you some idea of what's going on in India so I wasn't concerned about getting updated US numbers.

But the main take away point is that you can see that previous years were generally *very* consistent and 2020 total deaths (and therefore also excess deaths) were *way* up.

The nice thing about using excess deaths is that you can't really hide behind claims that doctors or hospitals are lying.  It's very hard to hide anything when using excess deaths and in fact, almost and data manipulation will *undercount* excess deaths.  Meaning that using excess deaths will give us a conservative number of deaths and in reality there are actually almost certainly at least a little bit more Corona deaths than what excess deaths shows us.

2020 and 2021 have been SO far away from normal that it just isn't reasonable to assume that the extra deaths came from anything except for Corona.  And you would actually expect deaths to be *lower* in 2020 and 2021 because people are sitting in their home a lot more instead of going out and doing things.

Less going to bars and drinking, less drinking and driving, less sports, less travel, less driving to work, less deaths from other contagious diseases like the flu, etc.

So we can actually be highly certain that the excess deaths is *still* undercounting the true deaths from Corona.

Ok, so all of that was to explain the concept of excess deaths and why it's a good measure.  Next question, what does India's excess deaths situation look like?

Here is an article that talks about excess deaths in India (and in other countries).

http://www.healthdata.org/special-analysis/estimation-excess-mortality-due-covid-19-and-scalars-reported-covid-19-deaths

Use Ctrl f ""India"" to skip to the relevant parts. But the tl:dr is that based on total mortality/excess deaths, India is most likely reporting only 1/3 of the true Corona death count.

And, if you read up, we actually don’t know whether vaccinated people may be able to spread the virus, although the likelihood seems low. This could change as variants develop. My point is that it takes very little to protect vulnerable people, so why not just require them in essential businesses? https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/health/coronavirus-vaccine-walensky.amp.html",,,1621367504,{},gylxy7z,True,t3_nfimaw,False,False,t1_gylwuwv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nfimaw/coronavirus_vaccines_may_not_work_in_some_people/gylxy7z/,1621431625,39,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The peak daily case load in the August cluster was 13 and very quickly fell off to 2 to 4 cases a day.  The only other outbreak of a community cluster in NZ was the February one and that never had more than 4 cases in a single day and was limited to 3 families in the end.  
&gt;  
&gt;Taiwan has just had more cases in a single day than the entire August and February outbreaks combined in NZ.  

NZ population: 5,128,650  
Greater Taipei (only) population: 7,047,559 people

NZ population density: 19.0/km2  
Greater Taipei (only) population density: 2,862.7/km2  
Taipei (only) population density: 9,700/km2

&gt;That means it has been spreading silently within Taiwan for a lengthy period of time, probably several weeks.  Regular surveillance testing as we do in NZ would have caught it earlier.  

And so some escaped the system. If you must know, an individual was not contact-traced because of visitations to some prostitute. It triggered massive test sites overnight in relevant districts. Meanwhile, everybody exercise extra caution, mask up, and stay at home if possible. That's it. Nobody's trying to compare.

&gt;They will really struggle to shut this down now.  Melbourne took months of severe lockdown to get hundreds of cases a day down to zero.

However, the focus is still the elderly and the general adult population. And a major issue with approving the vaccine for kids too soon has to do more with perception than with safety. If parents perceive the risk of the virus to their children to be extremely low (which is statistically validated), and they perceive the risk from the vaccine to be higher (which has not been shown, but pushing it at an earlier time makes many in the general public think there hasn’t been enough time to discover the true risk to kids), then they simply won’t get their kids vaccinated anyways and the rates will remain low. 

Also, (and this is just me throwing it out there with nothing to really back it up, so take it with a huge grain of salt) I think if kids could have gotten it earlier, then those parents choosing not to vaccinate their kids would be more resistant to changing their minds later when more time had passed and safety were assured (almost like not wanting to admit to being wrong—I know it sounds petty, but a lot people do kinda work like that even if they aren’t thinking it consciously).

I'm not from the US, the CDC aren't a worldwide organisation. The WHO is. When pressure was put on the WHO to investigate the origins, they pandered to china and trusted their word. In the past, pandemics have been recognised by the WHO when a few countries have infections. This time, they waited until the whole world were infected to call it. This influences countries decision making on travel and kills people by proxy. Why did they do this? Because China are a bully and use their influence (and bribes) to force the WHO's hand in protecting their reputation.  
&gt;  
&gt;The WHO is much more involved in worldwide geopolitics than medicine, and is a worldwide organisation unlike the CDC.

Are you suggesting that the CDC has no influence with the WHO? That the WHO does not consider what the CDC does, even though the CDC is probably the most influential of all of the national health agencies on the world stage?  


My point is, you can't analyze the WHO in a global vacuum, especially in the world of geopolitics. National health agencies most definitely play a part in what advice the WHO gives. At the very least, they form a baseline or a comparison. Dialogue goes both ways.  


You can argue that the WHO was pandering to China, but masks would be a poor example of such. China was probably one of the highest rates of mask adherence; the WHO's advice of not needing a mask is least likely to be heeded by the East Asian countries, since mask wearing is part of their culture. Western countries on the other hand, bought into that advice before the advice changed. Once again, not sure how you can use that as an example as pandering to China.  


I'm not defending China's actions here, to be clear, they most definitely blocked access for the world to conduct proper investigations into the coronavirus.

 There have already been numerous findings and analyses that show plenty of mandates and regulations didn't end up doing what people thought they did.  

 For example, heres a very in depth analysis of all mandates and restrictions of all the counties in the country over the period of the lockdowns and whether you like it or not they found that masks almost make no difference compared to other measures like closing certain areas or restricting travel etc.   They found that they could statistically attribute masks with a 1% difference in cases and deaths which in any study is completely within the margin of error.

Let me remind you that US officials who already brought the virus to Canada and Japan before were allowed to enter Taiwan without quarantine in August. That's the kind of measures in place.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt;That's what everyone is doing everywhere now. What's your problem?

No problem lol. But you're pointing to a well made plan and suggesting Taiwan made sweeping effective changes, when they've been just doing what they used to do.

&gt;I don't know what you're trying to say or prove.

If you believe an infectious disease that get caught multiple times by other countries, only manifests after the plane leaves Taiwan just so Taiwan can boast about 1xx days of no new infections, then obviously you wouldn't know all sorts of things.

&gt;Yo, public health expert... show me where that's the narrative? The point has always been containment without jeopardizing the health system and the economy. That is why contact tracing is given high priority.

What you don't know is that I'm actually really a health expert. I said in 2020 April that social distancing and flatten the curve are shams. Wearing masks and stamping out the virus like China, Australia and NZ is the correct way and look where we are. Oh wait the contact tracing you mentioned always gave back 0 results. So much for contact tracing.

&gt;Your faulty reasoning results in faulty conclusions. You trying to justify China's block of a health contributors in the name of politics is simply middle-school grade.

Really not sure how Taiwan who has problems with water, electricity, testing, and vaccines can claim to be the model for the world, but if you're so supportive maybe your country can copy Taiwan's method. The rest of the world didn't invite Taiwan only because of China lol, other than the anti-China group of countries everyone knows what's up.",,,1621318589,{},gyjftu1,False,t3_ne8fy9,False,False,t1_gyj4jjo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ne8fy9/taiwan_announces_record_333_new_local_cases/gyjftu1/,1621378353,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I'm talking about geopolitics. The fact that the WHOs job is to let people know about new diseases, investigate said diseases, and call a pandemic in order to give advice.

The CDC is not involved in this. They just relay some information that the WHO say and let people in the USA know.

I don't know why you have this focus on the CDC, it is not their job to put pressure on countries when new diseases emerge. It's the WHOs job to try get information out of countries, to prevent spread, and to give the world advice.

Children are already at far lower risk of negative outcomes due to their immune systems being younger and better equipped to fight off any immunio-attack vector.

That’s why why public health officials screamed open the schools and close the bars at the height of the pandemic?

You’re a blithering idiot if you think “what about the children” is a cogent argument in an America where 48% of voters only give a fuck about “kids” until they exit the womb.

Do you make the same argument against Marijuana legalization?  Do you believe stoners give away $20 edibles on Halloween to kids too?

[],,OpenStars,,,[],,,,text,t2_15xds7yf,False,False,[],"Not just WILL, but HAVE, in places like LA, and all across the nation as ""fear"" (legitimate) of going to the hospital is directly responsible for an otherwise preventable death. This is why ""excess deaths"" is going to be so important to understand the full impact of the pandemic, not just those directly attributable to the disease as in the viral load exceeded some detection threshold. e.g., including suicides too.

I should mention that I respect the Amish: if you choose to live life without electricity, like alarm clocks, and even without medicine, I don't have to agree but I can respect the personal choice, so long as it isn't forced upon anyone else (unlike the Unibomber who had similar ideals, but took the aspect of choice away from people). (Full disclosure, I've heard that even many Amish actually make an exception and go ahead and accept many medicines and even vaccines - though that's somewhat beside the point). What gets me is the two-faced nature of someone who makes one decision - like to turn their back on what modern medicine offers - but then when things get so bad that it's all of a sudden obvious to them to the point where they can't just comfortably ignore it anymore, then they all of a sudden change their minds. Then too people who understand psychology and KNOW that that is what is going to happen, just...let it. Though what else are they supposed to do? Give people the vaccine by force? Tell them to stop coming to hospitals, if they didn't first make an effort by taking the vaccine?

It's *almost* like we are all in this together, like it or not, and one person's actions affects another person's outcome. I am no longer ""free"" to do as I please, bc there are so many nutjobs running around taking my own choices away from me. Like kids who go to school and get shot there - in the ""land of the free"", they are remarkably not free to not die (and worse, suffer horribly prior to that - even the survivors are utterly changed for life).

I feel for your situation about your family, but more than that, it's not just a one-off situation, but instead is playing out across the entire nation. Nurses can't afford to stay home, bc their pay is so low, and rent prices across the country have gone up so much, outstripping wages. It's merely one more example of how the disappearing middle class is going to turn around and affect us ALL, regardless of our own personal incomes (well, okay, if you can own an entire hospital wing then you might be less affected than most) - e.g., how so many mothers can't afford daycare and have to stay home to watch their kids doing school at home, that there is a rash of businesses across the country (Chipotle, McDonald's, etc.) that can't get enough workers to even stay open (though part of that is a choice: e.g. Chipotle somehow manages to keep their online app ordering going, where you pay more money for less food, and it requires the same if not a greater number of workers, like delivery drivers - so it's primarily people who pay more that remain unaffected, and once again those who can least afford it who bear the brunt of the disruption).

I'm saying: we are all vulnerable. Our nation's systems were not ""robust"", and instead were just waiting for any slight stress to throw things into major chaos. It's like owning a car that is 30 years old and has never once been taken to be checked out by a mechanic: you might not want to *depend* on it to get you to your job, or any important event (your own wedding? imagine standing someone up at the alter bc your car wouldn't start!). Or a real life example: more than half the gas stations in North Carolina are completely out of fuel, not because of the pipeline hack - directly - but bc of panic buying.

We NEED to WAKE UP, and realize the systemic problems around us. Like any zombie movie ever. And also like those movies: we aren't all going to make it. And yet one more from them: it's never the disease that you have to most fear, it's the stupidity of people. Like someone who got bit saying ""it's nothing - I'm fine"", and then proceeds to kill everyone around them when it turns out that they are not, in fact, fine after all. How is covid any different? Someone tweeting ""hey this virus is like the flu - give it to me on purpose and I'll show you"", then their next tweet is from their deathbed. Which, you know some people are crazy - a couple people in Kansas literally drank bleach when told to by the man on TV - but when it happens SO OFTEN, affecting SO MANY people, and they turn around and kill off or at least endanger their entire family - it becomes not just a one time thing, but an actual PATTERN.

I don't have much faith in democracy these days, bc people are so stupid, and therefore the worst bosses imaginable. It also doesn't help that just about every student I've ever talked to from universities in rural states, are there for the expressly stated intention of leaving that state. I've argued back - traffic is less, and with computers you can work anywhere, etc... - but this kind of brain drain effect has been going on for DECADES, and is leaving rural areas quite ah...""vulnerable"" to deception, when anyone who knows anything is run out of town, sometimes literally. And sometimes with outright death threats, like the story of the man who started a medical college in Missouri, bringing in grants even to fund it, but then people didn't like his talking to the community that you should wear masks, so his daughter said that their whole family was going to leave - even though they STARTED the college, and it was SUCCESSFUL, and bringing in MONEY to the area. And there are SO MANY stories like that - another was a mayor or such in iirc Dodge in Kansas (some famous cowboy town anyway), who actually stepped down bc she was receiving death threats for similarly saying that people should wear masks. And that's not even getting into worse things like the governor that was nearly kidnapped.

How do you help people, who actively fight your efforts to aid them? I wish I knew...bc as I mentioned earlier, we're all in this together.

People really just don't understand how exponential growth works and we're finally meeting an existential threat that doesn't follow the too-familiar linear trends we're so intuitively used to.

Also, the fun thought experiment: At the beginning of the pandemic (let's say this was unhindered death rate increase and would have remained this way if everyone just went on with life), we jumped from 10k deaths/week (4/4/2020) to 16k deaths/week (4/11/2020). With a 160% increase, we would be sitting at an equation that has a growth rate of 1.6. I wrote up a simple little script take this and extrapolate how many weeks it would have taken for 15 million people to die:

`week 1:  16001`  
`week 2:  16003`  
`week 3:  16005`  
`week 4:  16009`  
`week 5:  16016`  
`week 6:  16026`  
`week 7:  16043`  
`week 8:  16070`  
`week 9:  16113`

Granted, this is entirely unhindered and should probably assume a logistic growth instead to account for herd immunity, the frequency of novel contact between individuals, etc.. but all those combined wouldn't have been enough to drop this to simple linear growth.

If they were to test everyone including the domestic population, then they would've been severely overwhelmed. So the decision was made to be aggressive at the border instead. Since the early patients have all recovered, there was no need to aggressively test the entire population and instead save the ammunition for the next wave.

You are misunderstanding what I am suggesting.  I'm not saying to test the whole population, we never did that in NZ either.  I'm also not talking about the first wave. Taiwan did handle that very well and succeeded for over a year at keeping it out.  

The proximity of Wuhan is irrelevant to the current outbreak though.  

Again what I am saying is that Taiwan should have been testing everyone who presents to a doctor with cold and flu symptoms.  

&gt;Oh that's already being done for those with symptoms.

No it hasn't been.  Dr Chiou Shu-ti, the former Health Commissioner just said: 

&gt;She said Taiwan had been “stupid” in focusing testing on people who presented with symptoms and also had a travel history or connection to a confirmed case, rather than one or the other. As of Monday, rapid testing was only established in Wanhua, meaning there were potentially many more cases undetected.

“Everyone knows that Covid-19 can spread before the onset of symptoms,” she said.

That comes from this [article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/17/how-did-covid-slip-through-taiwans-gold-standard-defences), which also goes on to say:

&gt;Chiou pointed to three recent mass travel events that could contribute to a spread but would not be detected yet: the 8-9 May mother’s day weekend, last weekend’s high school entrance exams, and students returning to their home towns after universities switched to remote learning on Sunday.

When it comes to testing, Australia has done 684,000 per million, NZ has done 416,000 per million. South Korea has done 184,000 per million.  Even much poorer Vietnam has done 31,000 per million.  All those countries are zero-covid countries with the same border strategy as Taiwan.  Yet Taiwan's testing rate is 25,000 per million.  That is nowhere close to high enough to provide a warning about community transmission before it's too late, as we have now seen.  

It doesn't have to be the whole populace, as you can see NZ has only tested 41% of the population over 15 months of pandemic.

??? That doesn't make sense at all. If something mostly works, you should probably be getting it.

Anyway, I've had no trouble comprehending the claim that it's to encourage people to go get vaccinated so they can stop wearing a mask, but the end result is, as we're seeing in the topic of this very thread, chaotic mixed messages about where and when you are required to wear a mask (""single grocery store corp lifts requirement unless local rules override it""). And with no one verifying who actually got vaccinated at the door at any given public place (it'd be absurd to try), only people who got enough of a hall monitor conscience going on will bother if they didn't want to get it before.

The people who never believed in this are now going to use this as an excuse to go out unmasked and potentially cause an upswing in the virus yet again. Meantime, there are people who are inbetween doses or waiting on an appointment time, and people who are immunocompromised.

Plus, the State had already announced it would be reopening June 15, and schools, businesses, etc have been using that as a target, so it doesn't seem unreasonable to just keep that date and drop the mask mandate then as well.

The downtrend will naturally occur as more become vaccinated, and more get their second doses. 

As anti-Vaxers continue to not want the dose, the pool of unvaccinated people decreases, so downtrend continues.

(BNT162b2is Pfizer)

A first dose of Pfizer is 85% efective at preventing death from COVID. Astra zeneca was similar.

That is very good effectiveness with just the single dose, so I think Canada can be happy in its current strategy of getting as many people first doses as possible. 

If you had 20 people who would be getting COVID and dieing, and gave 10 of them first and second doses, and 10 nothing, you'd expect 10 deaths. If you instead gave all 20 of them first doses, you'd expect 3 deaths.

Canada is rolling the dice by opting to vaccinate everyone with one dose ASAP while pushing second doses out months past 'recommended' gap periods to achieve their goal.

Of course hes going to be more cautious. Its a smart move. Lets be done with this once and for all and do it right to the end instead of prematurely celebrating.

Throwing on/taking off a mask takes seconds.

The only people upset are mostly the people who baby raged over masks for a year straight. A lot of them will pretend they got vaccinated even if they didnt and thats whats slowing things down.

The CDC used their statements thinking itd be dangling a carrot to give people an incentive to get vaccinated. Its pretty gullible of them to not know theres a chunk of the population who will pretend to be vaccinated when they arent. A lot of medical experts were puzzled by the CDC announcing this. The timing was poor. A lot of states just opened vaccines for everyone a month ago. You could have been there week 1 and you'd still be waiting on your second shot. Plus teens, childret, pregnant women, people with certain health conditions cant get vaccinated yet. Theres still a large number of people who arent vaxxed. Some of these people will get vaxxed soon, but could be at risk while antivax weirdos are breathing their pandemic everywhere. Yes at risk people can wear a mask, but their mask by itself isnt 100% protection. Others around them being wearing masks or veing vaxxed will mitigate the risk more.

Dont tell me ""kids dont die from covid so who cares"" because long term health issues are a thing with covid.

Since theres no easy way to tell who is vaccinated or not and the fact that theres a percentage of people who will lie about it means lets protect the vulnerable or give them a bit more time to get vaccinated. Lets get closer to herd immunity.

You want to be mad at someone? Go get mad at the anti vaxxer weirdos. You want things normal? Start getting on the case of people on the fence and convince them to go get vaccinated.

Not even half our country is fully vaxxed... Its like people are trying to fuck this up and it blows my mind.

Oh, and the CDC has been way off on things this entire pandemic.

This pandemic really showed me how selfish and uncaring people are. Truly digusting. A very minor inconvenience that takes literally seconds can save lives.

Can we agree that Covid is bad? Lets start there, because if we can't than this post is moot, but lets say we agree. Covid is bad. So lets also say for arguments sake your immune system is stellar, lets say you don't want the vaccine, lets imagine you got Covid, and it barely effected you. Lets say you're a Covid survivor. Now do you think there is a slight chance you may have exposed someone else to Covid while you were sick? A loved one? A stranger? What if that person's immune system is terrible? What if that person died? Or what if they didn't die, but they went to a party and spread Covid to tens of other people? 

Now I know, this is a lot of assumptions, but what I'm getting at is Covid can be spread incredibly easily, and it effects everyone differently. If you don't want to get the shot, its your choice, personally I think its a selfish choice, but its your choice. But getting the vaccine is harmless for most and helps everyone equally not. get. covid. which I'm hoping we can agree is a good thing. So what I'm getting at is people who go online and spread the word that not only are they not going to get vaccinated, but they are proud of not getting vaccinated, it inspires others to not get vaccinated, which means Covid is going to stick around and kill more people, which again, I'm making a wild assumption, but I assuming helping people live is a good thing. So yes, I think we are getting to the point where we are banning photos that say I trust my immune system, because its not about that....... Its about protecting OTHERS who may have weak immune systems, its about protecting others who can't get the vaccine its about not being selfish and doing what's best for humanity.",,,1621357220,{},gyl8jh8,False,t3_neu3i4,False,True,t1_gyjh2ag,/r/Coronavirus/comments/neu3i4/facebook_races_to_remove_antivaccine_profile/gyl8jh8/,1621416054,-2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The expectation of required vaccines is already affecting many people's decisions. Full authorization and then vaccine requirements won't cause a skyrocket, workplaces and schools are likely to implement those restrictions slowly.

Vaccine side-effects almost never emerge after two months.

The core difference between an EUA and full FDA-approval is four additional months of observation after already-completed trials.”

Full article here (more about the young child shots, but it goes in depth about EUAs).

I sometimes feel like I should've cheated back in Feb/March or something &amp; said I have condition x or y just to get the vaccine earlier than I was really eligible for, but I really wanted to give the seniors/EWs/medical workers time to get theirs 1st. I really was not technically eligible till 19 April. I have noticed the attitude around here switched right around the 1-year anniversary of the 1st shutdowns to 'BAU at all costs'. If I still decide to continue to just wait to get my 1st dose on the 4th &amp; live my near-but-not-totally-hermit lifestyle through that time &amp; beyond, am I at big risk that those few days will be the difference between catching vs avoiding the virus?

Background  
Several aquatic organisms such as loaches have evolved unique intestinal breathing mechanisms to survive under extensive hypoxia. To date, it is highly controversial whether such capability can be adapted in mammalian species as another site for gas exchange. Here, we report the advent of the intestinal breathing phenomenon in mammalians by exploiting EVA (enteral ventilation via anus).  
Methods  
Two different modes of EVA were investigated in an experimental model of respiratory failure: intra-rectal oxygen O2 gas ventilation (g-EVA) or liquid ventilation (l-EVA) with oxygenated perfluorocarbon. After induction of type 1 respiratory failure, we analyzed the effectiveness of g-EVA and I-EVA in mouse and pig, followed by preclinical safety analysis in rat.  
Findings  
Both intra-rectal O2 gas and oxygenated liquid delivery were shown to provide vital rescue of experimental models of respiratory failure, improving survival, behavior, and systemic O2 level. A rodent and porcine model study confirmed the tolerable and repeatable features of an enema-like l-EVA procedure with no major signs of complications.  
Conclusions  
EVA has proven effective in mammalians such that it oxygenated systemic circulation and ameliorated respiratory failure. Due to the proven safety of perfluorochemicals in clinics, EVA potentially provides an adjunctive means of oxygenation for patients under respiratory distress conditions.
