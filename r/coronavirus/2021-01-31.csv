Taxi's are hard to come by too.  I remember a snow storm (not huge, just 5-10 inches) fell in ny around 2003.  Going to work that day via taxi cause I wasn't going to be able to walk to the train station.  Worked. Took the train home.  All good.  It kept snowing all day and throughout the night.

The following day?  Not snowing, but NO ONE could be reached.  There were no taxi's.  Walking to the bus stop was endless and the bus were running 1 bus every hour.  The train was MIA.  After attempting to get to the train (I think they closed it or no R train), I went to the bus stop.  The bus never came.  No taxi's at all.  Had been calling from 5:30AM to 8AM.  Ended up staying home cause work was way to far to walk to and there were no buses/trains/taxi.

&amp;nbsp;

My manager got to work late.  We didn't get there to open up.  He was ""mad at us"" cause he said we should have done what he did.  He couldn't get the train nor bus.  He ended up walking miles and miles all the way ot work while waiting to see if a bus showed up (it did not show up).  He literally walked the whole bus route all the way to work.  Took him 2 hours.  I didn't even consider that.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, the whole point is that everything slows to a crawl.  No cars because they're snowed in.  No taxi's cause they're snowed in.  no trains cause of outside portions having a ton a snow.  No bus cause they only send out like 1 per hour (if we're lucky).  

&amp;nbsp;

It sucks that they stopped vaccinations but the cancellations were going to be huge.  Especially since it is older people getting them right now.  Those older people won't walk there.

Sigh. 

- Without the UK, the EU is a smaller market than the US. Free trade with the US wasn't possible as an EU member. Same for a bunch of other trade partners.
- Even as an EU member, the UK traded more with the rest of the world than it did with the rest of the EU. (Quite a bit more, and the gap had been steadily increasing for years.) It was the *only* EU member in this position.
- We ran a healthy surplus in rest-of-world trade, and an unhealthy deficit in rest-of-EU trade.
- As it turns out, we ended up with fairly free (no tariffs or quotas) trade with the EU anyway. Which shouldn't be too much of a surprise since (per the above) they do better out of that trade than we do.

There are plenty of excellent reasons to be wary of Brexit, but ""astronomically stupid"" requires a very selective reading of the arguments.

&gt; This investment was made on the basis of China's promises to open up its economy on accession to the WTO, which it still has not honoured. 

Yea no. China fulfilled vast majority of its WTO obligations and it never promised letting foreign capital come in uncontrolled. Regardless, stripping away all the political trash in the narratives, just take a look at [complaints filed in the WTO](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/dispu_by_country_e.htm). Last time I checked, China has 44 cases against them, with 52% coming from the United States. While United States has a whopping 167 cases against them, with &lt;10% coming from China. I wonder which country is actually interested in compliant to WTO rules, and which one has a clear agenda here? 

Taking a step back, the proponent of “free trade” conveniently forget that the Western nations have been colonizing most of the world for centuries, destroying and looting them of natural and human resources, infrastructure, political system, social order, etc… while they are able to build infrastructure and advanced technologies, raise generations of highly educated populace, and establish massive corporations with all the money and resources in the world at their disposal. Then the “free-market social-justice human-rights loving” Westerners now take those corporations into the developing lands that their ancestors destroyed, and ask to compete one-on-one with the local business. Then they cry “unfair!” if the local people does anything short of handing over the market on a silver plater. Yea, cry me a river.

   
 

&gt;Equally, it is China's autocratic tendencies that are now at risk of sabotaging its business deals with the world at large (Australia, India, America, the UK), along with technology theft this is what precipitated the trade war with America and is guiding other countries to try and move manufacturing away from China (in other words, China was enriched because it promised to be less autocratic, now that it is lapsing back into autocracy it risks selling itself short and failing to achieve its potential. Admittedly Xi Jinping has already gotten what he wanted out of this relationship, however illicitly, and can now likely snowball China under its own momentum, but that does not really do anything to recommend authoritarianism now does it?): 

Technology theft is another Western attempt at twisting the narrative to misrepresent China. I don't want to write another 3-pager but, I wouldn't be that worried about China's trading. Just in most recent months it was able to sign EU-China deal as well as the RCEP (which includes Australia btw). The ""manufacturer moving away from China"" is mostly due the capitalists wanting to find cheaper labors elsewhere as China's economy develops. Of course there are international pressure from US-led allies, and China's economy has its own challenges to sort out, but again, i don't see how there's a clear argument for China to become an ""openly democratic"" capitalistic country, at least not in the interest of Chinese for sure. 

   
 

&gt;China has shown no real ambition to do anything other than pay lip service to socialism in recent decades (inequality continues to grow, wealth redistribution exists but is not to the degree that you would expect of a truly socialist or communist country). 

wait...are you blaming CCP for not being hardcore communist enough? Anyhow, CCP has a socialist/communist philosophy at heart and the policies and plans they put out and executed over the years (how many are you aware of? probably 0) to eliminate absolute poverty, reduce urban-rural gap, control of skyrocketing real estate prices, etc are all indications that at the very top, the leaders do not want the rich to be able abuse the poor. You can look up some of the poverty alleviation documentaries yourself (ironically, PBS was doing one but it wasn't allow to air because it's ""Chinese propaganda) and see the extent of the effort of the local CCP officials. I simply do not see the same kind of commitment in other countries. Also, scale matters. Running a socialist country of 1.4 billion with the legacy of poverty still affecting many people, is not the same as running a tiny socialist Nordic nation that's already well-off economically. The size of pie needed to feed 1.4 billion people in a socialist country is impossibly huge, and the only realistic option is to first grow the pie through state-led capitalism and then redistribute when the pie/system is large/stable enough. I personally do not see that happening anytime soon but as long as the government sticks to its principle and looks out for the little guys when they could, I see no reason to fret.",,,1612141208,,{},gljk3rp,False,t3_kpmh37,False,True,t1_glik0rs,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kpmh37/chinese_web_users_remember_wrong_done_to/gljk3rp/,1612455545.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Has the EU been receiving it's supply and then from that supply sending out vaccines to other countries?

I keep seeing Israel and Canada mentioned along with the statement of EU exporting, but it is really Pfizer filling it's contracts, a private company.

* Canada was the third country to make an agreement with Novavax (after US and UK)
* UK phase 3 clinical trials ended recently showing good vaccine efficacy 89.3% and no severe cases with 15K participants
* There is a US/Mexico phase 3 clinical trial that has started with 16K enrollments out of 30K. That trial should be finished by the end of April.
* Moderna/Pfizer both had over 40K participants in their phase 3 trail
* It is unclear if Health Canada will wait for their US/Mexico trial to be over before finalizing their approval
* Canada will not get any Novavax doses in Q1
* Novavax is planning on making 2B doses in 2021 and 150M per month starting in May or June.  India will be making 1B of those doses.
* Canada will only get doses from Moderna (2M) and Pfizer (4M) in Q1

I couldn’t care less about the Belgium plant, the key issue is the EU wrongly claiming ownership over vaccines produced in the UK, to cover up the shambles of their vaccine procurement. 

Reason why Matt Hancock wanted the AZ vaccine produced in the UK, was to ensure that we are completely self sufficient in the production of this particular vaccine. Given what has transpired, I think that was an inspired move.

What the EU seems to lose sight of is that this is a brand new vaccine and there has been issues in “growing” the culture that’s used in this vaccine at the Belgium plant. That’s what’s causing the delay, not because of some false narrative that AZ is favouritising the UK. In fact we were due to have 20 million vaccines by the end of last year but only had 5 million due to similar supply issues. Because the EU ordered / approved this vaccine later, they’re encountering these same issues later, that’s all.

Fact is, the EU has messed up big time and there must surely be an immense amount of pressure on the EU Commission after this and also the recent Northern Ireland fiasco.

I think what Dr. Li did is fine, he was not intentionally spreading misinformation. But he's also not familiar with virology (he's an ophthalmologist) and, suppose in an alternative timeline, he was wrong about the disease and or, some other doctor is intentionally spreading (fake)news about a SARS outbreak, should there be any mechanism to control that? If not, when people panic, buy up supplies, flee cities due to an unconfirmed rumor, who's to take responsibility? I do not know if there's an easy answer. I personally think it's okay he got a slap on the wrist. What the real issue was the Hubei government was too bureaucratic, incompetent and dragging their feet at the onset of the pandemic. 

 

&gt;I suppose you would have to reckon with whether the great firewall is a good idea in principle. Would you choose to live under it (to never really know the outside world, whether the information you are consuming is real or not, living in a bubble according to your governments designs and prescriptions?). 

You're completely wrong to assume that people who's under ""the great firewall"" do not know about the outside world. The firewall is easy to bypass for people who really wants to do so, no one ever got into trouble for simply doing that. In fact, many departments in various universities and companies, and state enterprises have official greenlights to go outside of firewall due to nature of work. Not to mention that one of China's biggest exports to the outside world is millions of students and tourists annually, vast majority of which willingly return to China. The nature of the firewall at this point is more of a rite of passage, i.e. ""if you're not capable of bypassing it then you're not qualified to see the outside world"". Those in China who actually cares to learn about outside world knows quite a lot, much more than Western ""China watchers"" know about China that's for sure.

   
 

&gt;because in recent decades Chinese civil society has been hollowed out by attacks on religious practicioners, rival politicians, journalists, human rights advocates, lawyers, free thinkers, artists, influencers, foreigners, minorities etc. etc. (social, cultural, intellectual and artistic gains have lagged behind economic gains over recent decades) 

And you are aware of this because you watch Chinese shows, movies, participate in the vibrant Chinese internet communities and do religious activities in China? Or because the Epoch Times tells you Falun Gong practitioners have their organ harvested or some bullshit? The Westerners are so privileged that they think a society where economic development is too fast for social/artistic development is ""hollow"". When a country went through hundred of years of colonization abuses, foreign invasion, and brutal civil war, when people are so poor their average life expectancy is slightly above 30 yrs back in the beginning of 20th century, those people gets to decide what are most important to them and what are not, not the Western imperialists. Sovereignty, peace, stability, and economic prosperity are the the core priorities to Chinese people and everything takes a backseat until those are assured. There's zero tolerance for anything or anyone threatening those principles. You may not understand it from your perspective, but you have no right to tell them otherwise. 

You're correct however t that pure artistic and intellectual appreciation still has a lot of room to grow in the society. But, that's not because of ""CCP control"" , ""no freedom"" or whatever shallow diagnosis Westerners come up with. Rather its the big media companies chasing profit at expense of quality/depth, while the smaller, independent groups that produce quality contents do not make enough money because they're not willing to cater to consumerism and materialism. But in recent years there's a pushback against this kinds of practice as people demand for more. 

   
 

&gt;Second, *you frequently point to the fact that China has become a lot richer and cite this as a sign that the Chinese government has done something right*, but broadly speaking this is the result of foreign financial investment   
&gt;  
&gt;China would have done well economically whether it was capitalist, socialist, democratic or autocratic 

Foreign investment plays a big part no doubt. But the strategic directions like focusing on infrastructure, education, poverty alleviation programs, are due to CCP leadership. These programs would just waste away in gridlock if China was a American-style ""democracy"", especially if China ""opens up"" where foreign capitalists could then influence its politics. If Western capitalists had their way, China would end up having a couple of vibrant coastal cities (Shanghai for example) with wealth concentrated in the hands of 0.01% while the rest of the country can eat shit. This kind of capitalistic government was exactly what KMT was back before CCP took over, and the China was exactly as what I just described. 

In addition, many 3rd world countries in Africa and South America gets plenty of foreign investments and yet they continue to stay poor. The difference between those countries and China is that the CCP forces foreign investments to not only make money in China, but to give something in return to the Chinese people at the same time. The leaders in those other countries either are not in a position to do so, assassinated/toppled by CIA's regime-changing operations, or straight-up invasion by NATO.",,,1612140955,,{},gljjl1n,False,t3_kpmh37,False,False,t1_glik0rs,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kpmh37/chinese_web_users_remember_wrong_done_to/gljjl1n/,1612455272.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,reallydudewhytho,,,[],,,,text,t2_8qk2bmsl,False,True,[],"&gt; I'd like to try to have a proper discussion with you so I'll bite - I will admit that my first post in response to the guy complaining about lockdowns was relatively kneejerk and did not comprehensively outline my position on lockdowns.

Totally fair. I'll extend the courtesy. Just understand, not every lockdown skeptic is a 5G Bill Gates Nazi type, but right now we are facing that stereotype no matter how lightly we push back on any measure, and for us its limiting for conversation and we are reactive to it. I don't live in the US, I currently live in an EU country with a very improper vaccine roll-out and because of **their** mistakes, my life is being up-ended, and it is making us feel hopeless.

&gt; My reply to you stated that the lockdown should not be a 100% stop to all economic activity, but to restrict the movements of people working in non-essential industries. Food, shipping, utilities - these need to continue but under strict supervision to ensure that there isn't any further spread of the virus. Your point on my buying something online forcing others to ""work for me"" has no leg to stand on - that's the entire purpose of the lockdown. For people like me to work at home while essential industries continue under proper health protocols to ensure the spread of the virus is halted.

I'm sorry, but did you buy something essential? In one of your examples, you used India as a country that did 'improper' lockdowning. This is a country that does heavy IT and manufacturing for the comfort of Western countries, and it is a country that has poor sanitation, an expectation of multigenerational households, poor health infrastructure, high levels of low education, and destitute poverty. There would be no lockdown response that could have saved these people, because for millions in India, a basic task like gathering clean water is a communal activity. Its not just in their homes. Save for shooting them or rounding them up in camps, COVID was destined to be endemic for them. My point is, using terminology like 'selfishness' does not work here, and locking down is not a one-size-fits-all solution for all societies. It cannot globally work.  

&gt; I'm well aware of the costs that SMEs and F&amp;B businesses incur and I agree that these are the people hardest hit by lockdowns. I'm of the opinion that governments should have set aside aid for these smaller businesses and declare moratoriums on loans for those under a specific tax bracket. Countries like Canada have got it right by ensuring that their population receives adequate and sustained aid throughout the pandemic.

Again, these aid packages are not applicable for literally billions of people, and the expectation of endless money printing for an undefined time until COVID is eradicated is a threat for austerity for coming generations. Western governments have been continuously cutting their social safety nets, particularly in health and disability service sectors. Why am I to expect that the accumulating costs in, say, a country like the UK won't lead to this? They have been hacking away at the NHS for decades. It is partially what is causing this mess. The citizens of these countries know this, and have no faith that this won't happen, so why would they support lockdowns and aid packages that may come at a threat to their welfare state?

&gt; My take on lockdowns is that if you're going to implement it, you have to do it properly and ensure you have sufficient enforcement protocols thought through and prepared for. There's no point forcing small businesses, eateries, and bars to close if you don't penalize those that render lockdowns inefficient by flouting social distancing and proper mask protocols. Lockdowns are useless and do more harm than good when you're not prepared to do what's necessary.

Many of these countries had the good fortune of 'doing it properly' because they also did it incredibly quickly. The rest of us do not have that luxury anymore, and now the countries who **did** do it quickly are at the mercy of other countries for vaccine distribution so they can do the bare minimum in opening their borders. Not to mention the clusterfuck of literally tens of thousands of their citizens stuck abroad waiting for repatriation flights. Its still hovering around **40,000** for Australians stranded, last I checked. Yes, they saved lives, and should be applauded for that and I won't take that away from them. But again, this is now a myopic approach that is causing financial and emotional stress for thousands of families, and there is no certainty on when it will get better. Canada is, belatedly, following in their footsteps with $2,000 for 4 night minimum quarantine hotels for travelers after two PCR tests that must be approved by the government. They are heading for a family separation crisis because of this when COVID is already **in** the country, and have essentially created a wealth tax on the poor while the rich will have no trouble forking over that kind of money. The tests alone should be sufficient.

&gt; My take on lockdowns is that if you're going to implement it, you have to do it properly and ensure you have sufficient enforcement protocols thought through and prepared for. There's no point forcing small businesses, eateries, and bars to close if you don't penalize those that render lockdowns inefficient by flouting social distancing and proper mask protocols. Lockdowns are useless and do more harm than good when you're not prepared to do what's necessary.

But at what point is it 'people flouting the rules' and not basic science that if a country like Germany or France did not lock down **soon** enough, and are close bordering neighbors to Italy, it would inevitably spread into their countries and exist and propogate anyway? COVID is highly transmissible, the EU has the duty of the Schengen Zone which would be very difficult to decide to just close without properly explaining to the populace the facts on COVID. After it is in your country enough to be detected, it likely is too late for lockdowns regardless, no matter how much people comply because work has not stopped and essential services have not stopped. These lockdowns here were doomed to fail, and I think it is a fool's game to blame the average person on this.",,,1612184148,,{},glldadc,False,t3_l9xvnc,False,False,t1_gllbdni,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l9xvnc/lebanese_protesters_break_lockdown_death_by/glldadc/,1612492275.0,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

My guess is for Q2 deliveries

* Oxford: 1-6M in Q2, Canada ordered 20M
   * Rationale: AstraZeneca seems to be doling out doses more on a per capita basis. EU (population of 447M) is getting 40M doses in Q1 and 80M doses in Q2.  Canada is near the back of the line for this but we should get some early doses but not a lot.  Europe should be getting more because they manufacture it and they signed earlier. If you look at [this](https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/dam/az/covid-19/media/56498_AZ_Map_Update_SS_Media.pdf) you will see Canada is way down the list, but notice that we are a part of COVEX so that is why we could be seeing some early doses. 
* J&amp;J 1-5M in Q2, Canada ordered 10M
   * Rationale: J&amp;J is months behind on their production and will only be delivering single digit doses to US in February.  They will ramp up and have 100M doses to US by June and are scheduled to produce 2B doses in 2021.  Canada was the third country to sign a deal with them.  We will be getting some doses but don't expect a lot. 
* Novavax: 1-11M in Q2, Canada ordered 52M
   * Rationale: Novavax is getting ready to ramp up production and is scheduled to produce 150M doses by May or June. 2B doses in 2021 with 1B being made in India.  US should have enough doses by the end of May or early June for their entire population. I think we could see 1M doses coming to Canada in May and up to 10M doses coming to Canada in June.  I don't think we will approve Novavax any time soon for multiple reasons.  Every company that has submitted a rolling review was done a month before they phase 3 trial concluded.  If Novavax thought they could be approved with their UK trial why didn't they start the review process earlier? Novavax will be done their US phase 3 clinical trial by late April so expect approval to come mid-May.",,,1612166356,,{},glkrl4y,False,t3_l9l3yl,False,True,t1_glk00ua,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l9l3yl/novavax_submits_coronavirus_vaccine_to_health/glkrl4y/,1612480192.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inherent instability of RNA, not to mention its habit of deteriorating or being targeted by any number of immune responses, has left us looking for other paths. 

One of the most interesting divisions in scientific history occurred immediately after WWII. The Western world had antibiotics and our scientists thought that any bacterial resistance would be answered with more research that would lead to more “perfect” antibiotics. They were not naive or ignorant; they just lived in a time where MRSA wasn’t as big a deal because the life-saving medical advances that make drug-resistant bacteria so dangerous didn’t exist yet. 

And for everything viral, we would magically create a new vaccine. 

On the other hand, Eastern Europe continued to focus on bacteriophages. Had our warlords and profiteers here in the US not gone on a bullshit colonial defense-contract spending spree we would not have lost those precious decades of research. 

Maybe we would already have overcome the massive hurdles that set such a powerful tool so far beyond what seems currently possible.

I work in an industry that mandates my senses be in tip-top shape.  I have regained probably 60-65 pct of my taste but my smell has changed in what seems to be a permanent fashion.  When I'm around things like Cheerios, all I smell is a very strong ""nuttiness.""  Chemicals smell very different to me and I can hardly smell anything when my wife is cooking my favorite meals that used to overwhelm my senses with joy.  

I'm worried these will never return.  I bought the abscent products and they worked pretty well though now all I smell is the chemical nature of them though the lemon, clove, etc are very obvious.

A couple of months ago my wife and I found out we were pregnant (yay) so I had no choice but to snap out of my depression/funk.  I was the heaviest I had ever been (235lbs or so at 6ft tall) and decided I needed to get my shit together.  I started drinking green juice every morning and eating really healthy and actually put my peloton to work.  For the last two months, I have ridden 30-60 minutes a day without fail.  The issue that I am finding though is that I have to clear my throat literally every 15-20 seconds.  Its one of the most annoying things ever but it feels like my lungs are trying to expel shit that's been there for years.  I was also a smoker for about 20 years though the last year was more of a ""smoke a few cigs when I drink and throw the pack away"" kind of smoker.  

Does anyone else have any experience with this clearing of the throat months after having COVID?  I know its literally the bottom of the totem pole for the devastation that this virus has had on people across the world and I feel pretty awful even asking about it considering that.

&gt;**An estimated half of the number of newly established coronavirus infections concerns the British variant, Minister Hugo de Jonge reported on Sunday evening in a letter to Parliament. This confirms the image that the British variant is advancing in the Netherlands.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The RIVM previously reported that the mutation is gaining ground and estimated that of the people who were infected last week (20 to 26 January), more than a third were infected with the British variant.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;However, estimates now indicate that half of the people who had the first day of illness on Jan. 26 are infected with the British mutation.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The RIVM previously estimated that by mid-February at least half of all people who test positive will have contracted the British corona variant. However, the virus variant appears to be spreading faster than initially expected.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;At the beginning of this month, the cabinet introduced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the corona virus. The experts are particularly concerned about the British mutation, which is much more contagious.

When you double up two bad masks you create more pressure and air will take the path of least resistance, which means it will rush in through the open sides or loose-fitting top/bottom of surgical or cloth masks.

You want \_one\_ good mask with a real NIOSH rating, like a KF94, KN95, or N95 mask.  These masks are built with multiple layers, and in particular a negatively charged plastic layer which attracts virus particles that are far, far smaller than the holes in the mask.  This is part of how these masks work so well and what you don't get by doubling up two bad masks.  In addition these more form-fitting masks greatly reduce the gaps on the sides and top, so there's no way for air to bypass the filter media.

If you don't believe me, very carefully watch and review this engineer's videos (Aaron Collins): [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3fF\_rzkmZD0ufN685YE7lg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3fF_rzkmZD0ufN685YE7lg)  His masters thesis was on mask efficiency and he has all of the tools and expertise to test masks (which he has done on his channel).

The CDC [estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html) that 1 out of every 4.6 Covid cases was reported in 2020. 

California has reported 3.3-million confirmed cases.  If that same metric was true for California through today, that would mean about 15.2-million Californians had contracted Covid. 

Add in the 3.4 million who have been vaccinated, and you're at 18.6 million Californians who have *some kind* of immunity to Covid. 

With a population of 39.51-million, that'd mean 47% of the state's population. 

NOW, before you run off and say ""Half of California is Immune!!"" -it's very likely that the precentage of Covid cases in California reported in, say, December and January, was significantly higher than the national average for 2020.  We're doing far more testing than we were earlier in the pandemic, and I expect California is doing more testing per capita than some other parts of the country.  

Also, obviously a percentage of those vaccinated already contracted Covid.  

So, if I were guessing, I'd say that 4.6 multiplier is probably high for California, and there's definitely some overlap in the two numbers.  How much overlap? How ""too high"" is the multiplier? I have no idea.

The policy of the us was always titration.

You’re wrong to think anything else is possible at this point.

I am as distanced as possible.

I do contactless grocery store pick up now, wash my produce in the butlers pantry, wear a legit N95 on the rare occasion I have to go into a building (just a handful of times in the past year).

I eat healthy, workout, get fresh air and sunshine and have very happy homeschooled children.

I also have a wife who is fully vaccinated and wears a PAPR at work.

I also have the ability to buy whatever I need and have it delivered in less than a week (except for more workout gear, that is on back order, really want a new treadmill).

As an engineer I can fix anything that is to go wrong with my house, and if I were to need medical treatment I could call any number of friends from my wife’s medical school, residency, or fellowship cohorts.

If I want to set up an elaborate rock climbing wall in my garage for my kids it is of no financial concern.

If I want to go all out and buy any number of things for a date night or a stay cation it is no big deal.

I have almost unlimited entertainment and leisure options at my disposal.

But that’s not the case for the country as a whole. People can’t stay indefinitely packed away, they can’t tolerate it and the economy can’t support it.

It’s a balance now.

Sure if we would have acted quickly we could have had a true lock down for just a few weeks, and we could have quarantined incoming people to the country, and it would have been cheap as chips compared to what we are spending now, but we didn’t, and now it’s been a year.

The notion that schools going back and forth wasn't my main argument. My argument is we don't know FOR SURE if kids can bring the virus home, then we shouldn't open the schools. It doesn't matter if the kids are getting sick or not when we're a) all viruses spread, regardless of what your age is and b) this particular virus spreads, even when the infected person NEVER shows symptoms.

For both Moderna and Pfizer it was around 1 month (EMA was a bit slow, so it was more like 1,5 month). So if CureVac releases interim data in March, it will be approved somewhere around April (beginning of Q2).

So Q2 approval for CureVac is expected. Q3 approval is very unlikely, but if we are unlucky and something goes wrong during the phase 3 trials, it might be later Q2 or Q3.

&gt;Japan is the only nation in the Group of Seven economic powers still waiting to start vaccinations, but it is not alone among wealthy nations. Australia and South Korea are among nations still waiting to start vaccine programs.

&gt;Nor is Japan the only country to have its lack of pandemic preparedness exposed by the global crisis.

&gt;But Japan — often ranked as the third-largest pharmaceutical market after the United States and China — stands as a vivid example of how the pandemic has forced nations to reexamine public health priorities, global cooperation and readiness.

&gt;Out of 63 vaccines undergoing clinical trials around the world, just one is from Japan, according to the World Health Organization. And even that one, from start-up AnGes in Osaka, will not enter Phase III trials until much later this year, Japan’s Health Ministry said.

&gt;Meanwhile, Japan’s failure to swiftly obtain vaccines from abroad points to other problems: deeply ingrained bureaucratic caution and a distrust of foreign pharmaceuticals. Japan requires vaccine trials to be inside the country, a demand that has significantly slowed down the approval process for the Pfizer, Moderna and Astra Zeneca vaccines it wants.

&gt;It is not expected to begin giving Pfizer jabs to health workers for at least another month.

His dad, who was also abusive, was in prison.

One time there was a drug deal that went bad in his house and he hid in the crawl space above his closet.

His brother got into dealing drugs, some fucked up shit went down, and he ended up killing himself. Since then his mom has been in and out of mental hospitals non stop.

Stories about the apple friend.

She would tutor kids in exchange for food.

Her house actually had food in it but her mother didn't allow her to eat any of it and she would get beat if something went missing.

She also lived with a basically broken leg for a week because her mom refused to take her to the hospital and insisted she was lying about the pain.

These are just a couple stories and just a couple people I knew. I also had a friend that was one of 9 kids living in a 2 bedroom apartment with her mom, her mom's girlfriend, and her mom's boyfriend.

The goal was to start production months ago, had 6 months to prepare to reach a goal that had to be achieved 8 months since the deal was signed. 330 million euros were invested in making sure this happens. What more could you ask more. The order was 3 months later, but still pretty early and enough time to prepare a couple with the funds. AZ was meant to start production for the EU around October 2020. So they had lots of time to discover problems.

I have read a lot about it, seen arguments from all side, and as a European, I still see it as AZ faults. I see they are trying to push the blame to the EC, by creating a false narrative of first-come-first-served and that the cuts are due to the late EU order.

This is why I have doughts by the false narrative created. First off, AZ cannot blame the EC for a late order if they agreed to it. If AZ realistically should've needed the extra 3 months to get everything ready, they knew they could not have accepted the order. But they did agree to it. They would do their best reasonable effort to supply 120 million AZ doses by the end of Q1 2021. Secondly, I put in dought if it really would have mattered signing a contract 3 months earlier. The UK signed their contract 3 months earlier, but by the end of 2020, the UK still ironically relied on EU facilities that funnily enough will supply the EU with vaccines too. So the EU signed 3 months later, but it was EU funded facilities that deliver AZ vaccines for the EU that supplied the UK with their AZ vaccines in the beginning. How many was it? I don't know, but it is known that only 80 million of the 100 million ordered AZ vaccines are made in the EU, so we could potentially talk about 20 million vaccines. So who's facilities were not ready? The one that ordered 3 months earlier or 3 months later? It doesn't make sense, and thus there probably is no correlation between the vaccine order date and getting production-ready. Lastly what puts dought into the narrative is Moderna and Pfizer. They managed to do it, without any problems. Is AZ just bad or unlucky?

To government overreach, I think I agree with the general point, but there are grave health concerns, and a large number of anti maskers do not wear masks. I think with civil liberties and freedoms being so prevalent in the American psyche, most governments would rather that people just wear masks without a mandate, but that clearly wasn't happening. Freedom of Americans is such a big thing in your schools, socialism being the enemy and how free Americans are is engrained from a young age, so government interference is always viewed with hostility.

If a vulnerable person wears a mask, but someone with covid does not, they're at a much higher risk of catching it than if both persons wore masks.

[],,newkiwiguy,,,[],,,,text,t2_y78jf,False,False,[],"&gt;Canada is another poor comparison for many reasons, overall population density being the main one

The population density thing is a poor measure because it does not take into account the vast areas of totally uninhabited land in both Canada and NZ (and Australia for that matter).  Taking averages makes it seem like we are all living on nice socially distanced farms when we are actually crammed into quite densely populated urban areas with vast nothingness in between.  

What really matters is how urban the population is and how densely populated the urban areas they live in are.  Both Canada and the US are 81% urban in population and Canadian urban areas (I'm not talking just city centres but suburbs includes as most people actually live in the suburbs) are marginally more densely populated than US urban areas.  NZ urban areas are also all denser than US ones because we don't have sprawling suburbs with McMansions on half an acre each like so many US cities.  

&gt;Any way you want to slice it, America's outcomes are not unique. Zeroing in only on the countries that you feel compare favorably rather than the aggregate data suggests you've got a bit of an axe to grind

No Europe has been equally incompetent.  Although the US is still at the bottom of the pack when you consider it did have some advantages over Europe. Most US urban areas are much lower density than most European ones and large sections of the US were spared the first wave and had the chance to prevent widespread transmission but failed.  

I would add that China was obviously even more incompetent at the start and only rectified that later.  And Japan has also done a shockingly bad job as well thanks to their restricted testing.  Yes the large majority of countries have proven their governments to be utterly incompetent.  I can't blame the developing nations because they lacked the resources to do much about it, but the failure of 90% of developed nations is disappointing.  

&gt;At least some parts of the US did lock down very hard and for a long time, and they still failed

Lockdowns only work in combination with travel restrictions.  Once you eliminate the virus you have to keep it from getting back in. It takes just one or two cases to seed a new epidemic in a matter of weeks.  Just this week Canada has finally understood that and is implementing hotel quarantine for all intl arrivals on the Australia/NZ model.  The UK is also just now considering real, total border restrictions to stop the new strains.  Part of the problem was the WHO gave totally inept, totally wrong advice to not close borders. 

In the US states which succeeded had to implement managed quarantine systems for new arrivals.  They could have used electronic monitoring like Taiwan and Hong Kong if hotel capacity would have been an issue.  They could see such systems succeeded around the world.  But no US states did this, so their lockdowns were for nothing.",,,1612148804,,{},gljzydb,False,t3_l8s3dl,False,True,t1_gljmmv3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8s3dl/lockdowns_do_not_work_gov_desantis_says_state/gljzydb/,1612464173.0,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,MoralVolta,,,[],,,,text,t2_12v22m,False,False,[],"Evidence, State and Local Health Department Directors, and experience in counties around us all points to it being safe with proper precautions. I'll let you look it up, because it has been cited numerous times here and in our state by local and state officials.

I am not choosing my daughters health over that of the teachers. In the case of my daughter, they have chosen to provide an education that isn't accessible to someone with a disability like hers. They are choosing to keep getting paid for a job and service that they aren't providing. Again, mounting evidence, some of which has been cited on this subreddit, shows that this can be done safely. It is unrealistic to ask all students to go back, but in my county, teachers are refusing to educate disadvantaged, vulnerable, and underprivileged children even though in doing so it would allow for all basic universal precautions and mitigation.

 ""Sounds like we are aligned, i just would wait until teachers have both vaccines + 14 days."" It actually depends on the vaccine based on what I have read. Pfizer is 7 days and Moderna says 14 days after second shot. That's pedantic, but I wanted to mention it. I did agree to those terms a few weeks ago - that teachers shouldn't have to go back until 14 days after their second shot. The problem in my district is that now teachers are saying they shouldn't have to go back until all kids are vaccinated because the vaccine isn't 100% effective. That is unacceptable.  


In our county, teachers expect to continue to be paid for a job they aren't doing at a time when evidence shows that it can be done. If they don't want to take on that risk, they should do as your wife did and take FMLA which guarantees that the job will be there waiting for them for up to 2 years.  


Finally, I appreciate what you are saying regarding two incomes. I wasn't clear about that and I'd like to clarify. My wife has not been employed for 4 years now, specifically to take care of my daughter. What is frustrating is that she spends 16 hours a week working as a one-on-one aide to facilitate virtual learning. If she didn't work for free, the school system would not be able to provide my daughter ANY education, because of her disability. We do not at all fall in to the two income trap. That said, for so many people with disabled children it isn't a trap they set for themselves, but one society has set with it's priorities - bars, restaurants, theatres are open. There are many situations where both parents have to work because they are not as privileged as you and I. I wonder what has happened to them throughout this? No one is listening to their cries or giving them any support throughout this. If it is this unreasonable for me in my privileged situation, one can only imagine how much suffering is going on in their situation.  


Regarding IDEA, you're not wrong BUT it needs to be said because it is true. The school system is not upholding their legal obligation to provide children with disabilities a free appropriate public education. ""Appropriate"" has always been the contentious word in that law, even before COVID. The reason I feel so strongly about this is because the community of disabled children and the parents who care for them has been willfully disregarded and ignored. That isn't unlike your wife's situation. Honestly, the hardest part about this isn't working 20+ extra hours to do a job that teachers used to do. The hardest part has been realizing how little our culture and society care about the disabled.   


You and I agree on much more than we disagree. I'm sorry that your wife's health and wellbeing with disregarded where you live. More than anything, we need to be listening to each other right now.

The first dose of both vaccines give around 70% protection, to put that into perspective it's the higher end of the flu vaccine. Oxford and AZ support the move.

""We continue to work on increasing shipments from the week of 15 February to ensure the contracted delivery of the full volume of vaccine doses in the first quarter,"" said Sierk Poetting, CFO and COO of Biontech. ""We could also deliver up to 75 million more doses to the European Union in the second quarter.""

According to the current EU distribution key, 18.6 per cent of this is allocated to Germany. The Federal Republic can therefore expect an additional 13.95 million vaccine doses.

The delivery comes from the EU's most recent repeat order with Biontech for 200 million doses. Of these, 75 million are now expected to arrive in the second quarter, earlier than expected.

E484K, the possible new strain of coronavirus that may have been found in Mexico


The general director of the National Center for Preventive Programs and Disease Control of Mexico, Ruy Lopez Ridaura, informed this past Sunday at a press conference of the discovery of a mutation in the state of Jalisco (Mexico), specifically, manifested in four cases.

The latest investigations are focused on determining whether it is a new strain of the coronavirus, which would join those already detected in the United Kingdom or South Africa. López Ridaura himself confirmed that there are already many variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the country, but what makes it possible to classify them as strains is whether they have sufficient epidemiological weight, like they are more contagious.


""It is not that it is a Mexican variant, surely there are mutations of the virus circulating in the Mexican population, it is not that there is a Mexican variant, to describe it as such, its importance has to be investigated"", he explained, in statements reported by the local media Milenio.


Evaluations to be able to confirm the seriousness

This past weekend, four cases of coronavirus different from the normal were found, and at first it was thought that it could be the strain found in South Africa. However, with the first analyses this option was ruled out, and the next hypothesis is that it could be an original strain from Mexico, which has already been named E484K.

This mutation is new; it is the only thing that has been confirmed. That is, it has never been seen before in Mexico. One of the four cases, in addition, was in contact with a foreign person in Puerto Vallarta, while the rest of the cases claim not to have been in contact with anyone who has traveled abroad.

The Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE) has been working hard to be able to announce something with precision in the shortest period of time possible. It is in collaboration and contact with the laboratory of the University of Guadalajara.

""What must be defined is what characteristics it has, if this strain has something different and the priority is to look for if they are more virulent, if the disease is more serious, it requires a serious study,"" Ridaura points out.

Current situation in Mexico

The latest data recorded in the Mexican country are some 462 new deaths due to coronavirus, for a total of 158,563 since the beginning of the pandemic, and 7,030 new infections out of a total of 1,864,260.

Not quite. There was certainly the fear that the US would go down that route, but in practice what everyone else has said is ""you can't have our preordered capacity"". The UK bought the first 100m doses of AstraZeneca's production in it's UK supply chain built up especially for the pandemic to serve UK needs. There's a similar line of thinking in Pfizer's US production. There wasn't a strict no export line there, if another country had paid for AZ to build-up more capacity in the UK, or to build up more Pfizer capacity in the US I don't believe there's any outright restriction there (although in the case of Pfizer and the US I don't think they really had the capability to scale capacity further so it's a moot point).

In the case of the EU's production facilities all the countries involved with ordering from AZ/Pfizer's EU  supply chains were paying for scaling up capacity in the EU to allow for shipping _outside_ of the EU.

In Melbourne they began a true lockdown at about 500 cases a day and it took around 4 months before they could begin a return to relative normal.  So to say it would take 4 to 6 weeks is not honest.  

Another thing is that the US would have to close borders to most travellers and should really also close most state borders and institute 2 week quarantine monitored by electronic surveillance and not just the honour system.  

My view is that the chance for the US to do this has come and gone.  Most of the country had a chance in March-April 2020, areas that got hit hard in the first wave had a chance when cases dropped very low in the summer.

My reply to you stated that the lockdown should not be a 100% stop to all economic activity, but to restrict the movements of people working in non-essential industries. Food, shipping, utilities - these need to continue but under strict supervision to ensure that there isn't any further spread of the virus. Your point on my buying something online forcing others to ""work for me"" has no leg to stand on - that's the entire **purpose** of the lockdown. For people like me to work at home while essential industries continue under proper health protocols to ensure the spread of the virus is halted. 

The point about a mask was to illustrate that sometimes we need to give up some creature comforts for the good of the many. I find it extremely disingenuous to call a 5 day lockdown inhumane. Unless if you meant that it'd be inhumane in how it would affect small retail businesses and restaurant owners. Otherwise, complaining of a 5 day lockdown is so first world problem and a sign of being out of touch with real world issues. 

I'm well aware of the costs that SMEs and F&amp;B businesses incur and I agree that these are the people hardest hit by lockdowns. I'm of the opinion that governments should have set aside aid for these smaller businesses and declare moratoriums on loans for those under a specific tax bracket. Countries like Canada have got it right by ensuring that their population receives adequate and sustained aid throughout the pandemic.

My take on lockdowns is that if you're going to implement it, you have to do it properly and ensure you have sufficient enforcement protocols thought through and prepared for. There's no point forcing small businesses, eateries, and bars to close if you don't penalize those that render lockdowns inefficient by flouting social distancing and proper mask protocols.  Lockdowns are useless and do more harm than good when you're not prepared to do what's necessary.

Basically I'm unhappy with *how* lockdowns have been imposed and definitely do not see it as a cure-all for this pandemic.",,,1612182893,,{},gllbdni,False,t3_l9xvnc,False,False,t1_gll8jjt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l9xvnc/lebanese_protesters_break_lockdown_death_by/gllbdni/,1612491254.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This seems to have come up a few times, but I don't believe it's true. I think the misunderstanding has come from some UK vaccine being sent to EU for fill and finish while the bottling plant in UK was finished, which is not the supply bottleneck we face in the EU. If Astrazeneca did export ready vaccines from the EU, then there would rightly be some outrage, but that level of accusation (and something the CEO of Astra has denied and would be career ending for him if he'd lied) needs credible evidence, or we're no better than Trump.

I think that they asked themselves in March, given the problems that happened with supply of everything else, what can we do to ensure a vaccine is there as soon as possible. And the answer was, make it in country if possible, throw money at it, move fast, and work like fiends to get everything else ready.

I think the charge at the UK, and US at being 'selfish' could perhaps stick, they put themselves first, but they are not being hypocritical I think.

I think concerts, though, are unlikely to require vaccination cards.

Your below post is incredibly myopic.  We don't have to go straight to a 20k indoor packed venue.

1500 at red rocks with masks on should be allowed before we pack 20k unmasked patrons into the Pepsi Center.  The margins might be slim enough that it ends up not mattering (IE, they start issuing permits for Option 1 for events starting March 15th and announce it on March 1st so no one can really scramble that fast, but up that to Option 2 on April 1st so everyone just opts for Option 2), but there definitely exists a world in which we open up smaller and outdoor concert venues before large indoor stadiums.  Could also see indoor stadiums with below capacity crowds to start.

I also think your assessment on maks is a bit off.  Masks are still great policy alongside social distancing.  Put everyone 6 feet away from other groups AND have them wear masks is better than just 6 feet away.  Yes, shoulder to shoulder with masks on isn't going to block all transmission so it shouldn't be utilized while we are deep into this, but it could be used as a way to kickstart the industry a month earlier than waiting until all risk of overloading hospitals is gone.",,,1612192569,,{},gllv12e,False,t3_l9cu2t,False,True,t1_glhr0zb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l9cu2t/dont_post_covid_vaccination_card_photos_on_social/gllv12e/,1612501272.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reason we haven't needed masks is because EVERY single COVID case is tracked and EVERY single contact is tracked, notified and told to self-isolate. 


When things become untrackable that's when you see our states fully lock down, e.g. the Melbourne/Victoria huge lockdown. But those lock downs work. And it's why the latest minor outbreak in WA won't be an isuse because the whole state has locked down, until they see 0 community transfer and have every case tracked.

The US now has the Brazil variant, the South Africa variant, the UK variant, and several others including homespun variants (Columbus, etc).

My guess is they're using this type of filler, and did throughput analysis and determined they could move more doses by increasing fill volume.  However, knowing how these machines operate, they could have needed an upgrade on the filling pumps to enable this new volumes, which took time to manufacture, deliver, test, and qualify (especially when you're trying to churn out as much as possible).

Depending on their sampling method, it could very well be that we touch much, much more surface area than that. But even with 10 times a sampling area touched per day, the infection risk per year would be 15%. So surfaces could explain nearly all cases.

The main factor driving the pandemic is that people lie about symptoms, but second to that, it's that no one knows the importance of transmission routes.

I'll push back on a couple of things you said. I do think supply remains a very major barrier. And you have to remember that the dosages get broken down to smaller sets of reserves which, I think, increases the need for reserves. 

What some states didn't realize, and got slowed down by was how many health professionals would decline the vaccine. I think that's something being corrected. That is also a reason for the delay and WV didn't get hit by it bc they started with a wider range of eligibility.

All the models that claim variants have higher transmission are vanilla SEIR models without dispersion (modelling of superspreading).  [The only one that I've seen that used a dispersion model found that random chance can account for the variants success](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.07.21249353v1).

So the variant got lucky in London and was involved in initial superspreading events there as the epidemic took off in the late Fall and after taking over the expanding set of superspreading events it was amplified and used that advantage (""I have the high ground"") took over London and should be favored to take over all of England all other things being the same.

Withough being lucky like that it is having difficulty breaking into the existing backbone of concentrated superspreading events in SF/LA so the existing regional variants exclude it from colonization there.

It would also be VERY surprising if evolution didn't like this kind of spread of genetic diversity and instead favored a situation where the dominant variant worldwide would construct barriers to entry so high that without any advantage no other genetic material would get amplified.

Vaccine nationalism is something the EU was considering, but since these sort of dirty tactics are not European it won't happen. It's something the US does with the DPA, or the UK has baked vaccine nationalism into their contract according to the AZ CEO. You have to be honest that the EU has done the most good for its allies and poorer countries when it comes to vaccines in the west. And I think it is important for the EU to keep that huge lead.

And I'm not saying there is no guilt in the European Commission and they did things well. But in my view the main guilty party here is AstraZeneca. But as a European I am happy European production capacity is still ensuring their allies can get vaccines (unlike some other allies ehum). 

And yes the EU saying that the best reasonable effort doesn't count when the vaccine proved to work and could be delivered is shady. It might be true, but then it should be sitting in the blackened out part of the contract (which mostly seem to be ordered by AZ). There were clear delivery quantities discussed in the contract. For Q1 it is 80-120 million I think. Also, they claimed  AstraZeneca has expressly assured us in this contract that no other obligations will stand in the way of fulfilling the contract. Which turned out to be true. Something the AZ CEO might have lied about in the interviews he did.

Due to lower average incomes and much higher rate of poverty than many states, both states have very limited exceptions to required vaccines and have a much more coordinated response specifically because they cannot rely on it happening via private industry.  Their citizens are at the highest risk, so they have a more coordinated response.

Its similar to how anti-vax attitudes tend to corolate with income: more general safety in their life, more ability to rely on herd immunity.  Basically its a position of privilege.  Meanwhile you have people in Africa walking over 100 miles carrying their kids to get vaccines.

\- Canada is another poor comparison for many reasons, overall population density being the main one

\- Any way you want to slice it, America's outcomes are not unique. Zeroing in only on the countries that you feel compare favorably rather than the aggregate data suggests you've got a bit of an axe to grind

AIFA's decision comes a day after the European Union gave the green light for the jab, but Germany's vaccine commission recommended against using it on older people amid questions over its effectiveness that have been rejected by the company.

""AIFA authorises the AstraZeneca vaccine for the prevention of Covid-19 disease in individuals over the age of 18, as per European Medicines Agency guidance,"" it said.

But it noted ""a level of uncertainty"" about claims of the jab's effectiveness in people over the age of 55, because the age group was ""poorly represented"" in trials.

To help with the best use of the vaccine, it recommended ""preferential use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, pending further data, in subjects between 18 and 55 years old, for whom more solid evidence is available"".

It urged the ""preferential use of messenger RNA vaccines in older and/or more frail subjects"".

So-called mRNA vaccines include Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna jabs, and are based on a new technology previously untested in a real-world situation.

They use an inert snippet of genetic code from the coronavirus to trigger an immune response in the body that can repel the active virus.

Many of the other vaccines - including Oxford/AstraZeneca - are variants of the method used for flu jabs, based on a virus that has been killed and rendered harmless.

AstraZeneca earlier rejected German media questioning the vaccine's effectiveness in over 65s.

""Reports that the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine efficacy is as low as eight percent in adults over 65 years are completely incorrect,"" the firm said in a statement last Monday.

""In November, we published data in The Lancet demonstrating that older adults showed strong immune responses to the vaccine, with 100 percent of older adults generating spike-specific antibodies after the second dose,"" it added.",,,1612186084,,{},gllggf2,True,t3_la311x,False,False,t3_la311x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/la311x/italy_cautious_on_astrazeneca_vaccine_for_over55s/gllggf2/,1612493983.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.chop.edu/news/chop-researchers-find-elevated-biomarker-related-blood-vessel-damage-all-children-sars-cov-2
&gt;Researchers at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) have found elevated levels of a biomarker related to blood vessel damage in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, even if the children had minimal or no symptoms of COVID-19. They also found that a high proportion of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection met clinical and diagnostic criteria for thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). TMA is a syndrome that involves clotting in the small blood vessels and has been identified as a potential cause for severe manifestations of COVID-19 in adults.

&gt;Nearly one-in-three children tested for the new coronavirus in Florida has been positive, and a South Florida health official is concerned the disease could cause lifelong damage even for children with mild illness.

&gt;A medical examiner in Florida has warned that individuals who contract the novel coronavirus and are asymptomatic still appear to have lung damage.
&gt;""My gosh, I really don't know how to say it without being gruesome, it just destroys the lungs,"" Dr. Jon Thogmartin, the medical examiner for Pinellas and Pasco County said, WTVT-TV reported on Monday. ""Let me just say that.""

&gt;All of the patients included in our study had neurologic complications, and the majority were not critically ill, suggesting that these complications are not limited just to those patients who require ICU care or a ventilator.
&gt;Although neurologic complications may be more common in older patients, particularly those with predisposing conditions, some studies have found that even younger adults with COVID-19 are at risk for severe neurologic complications such as stroke.

It's great news that the vaccine roll out is going well, and the government is to be commended. Everything else has been a disorganised, tumultuous set of contradicting actions, starting with them doing nothing in the crucial early months that let this get out of control; the shouldn't be forgotten.

Essentially it was a political decision that the economy had to be kept running and just hope things didn't get too bad. That (along with the seeming inability of the government to take action on quarantining international travellers) was just a dangerous thing to gamble. 

I'm fortunate enough to live in Australia, in a state that actually took this very seriously from March. Now we are essentially back open for business, and while there will be economic hardship the only inconvenience to us now is no international travel, occasional clusters forming around quarantine hotels and having to scan a barcode to enter most businesses. If the rest of the world had followed this model there would have been significantly fewer cases and deaths. We did make mistakes, but we gambled on hurting the economy to protect the people and it seems to have paid off.

The original point is the US is hoarding by having a blanket export ban. They have not given or exported a single dose to anyone else despite having production abilities. No other country has done this. That is by definition hoarding.

Look every country does something shitty at some point. No need to turn a patriotic blind eye to it. You'd have gotten a lot more respect if you admitted the US was hoarding but did play a big part in developing two major vaccines, but no you double down on insisting it's not hoarding by using terms you don't understand and trying to compare the US to a country that has donated the most doses in the world.

The US is at about maybe 30% perhaps 35% perhaps 25%... That will reduce the effect of the new strain by 50% relatively... So if it was 50% more transmissible in the UK I'd expect it to be maybe 30 to 35 in the US... And that's not counting vaccination...

Ireland is an interesting case because I'm certain their restrictions after September were inspired by Melbourne specifically and yes, you guys have done the hard yards too but just not at the level of what Melbourne endured.

Are you dense?

So the UK contract is blocking EU contract, because it says one factory will produced only for UK - yet AZ is breaching EU contract? So only EU contract is breachable lol

&gt;UK faced similar cuts with pfizer and Biontech, they didn't blame Europe, UK haven't even received even 1 Moderna either despite some in Europe have and uk signed contract early

Blame EU for what? EU doesn't addered to vaccine nationalism like USA and UK - the difference is that one was from executive order by Trump, the other is ""per contract"", which we have to take the word of politicians that are trying to proof that Brexit fuck up was the best deal of the century.

Funny problems started to be solved after the EU released the contract to the public, suddenly production yields started to increase.

If pharmaceuticals didn't like the unsual funding, shouldn't they have said so?

&gt;And stop distracting from the EU failures in procurement playing the blame game

Ah but I'm not shifting the blame from EU, they were naive and got fucked hard by big pharma - they simply should have followed the same steps of vaccine nationalism and limit all EU production to EU - the whole ""lead by moral example"" that keeps lagging the EU behind, simply they should have said the same as UK and USA - until we get our vaccines nothing moves out of here.

&gt;I suspect no pharma company will ever make such non profit deals again with EU based on this horrible, childish over reaction to manafacturing delays delays that have impacted everyone.

Non profit deals?

Proof? The contract doesn't say anything about that. The pricing part of the contract was even blackened out, and still, if you had it, you had nothing to compare it with, and you wouldn't know from the contract if the price is the thing they disagreed about. Maybe the reason they signed later is completely external. So show me proof that the EU delayed the signing if the AZ contract explicitly due to negotiations about the price. 

Also that argument about we had 3 months more to get things ready argument sounds like an excuse from the AZ CEO. Why weren't the UK plants ready by the end of 2020, and had to import from the Netherlands. So supposedly the Dutch facility, which is mostly meant for EU supply was mostly ready, and supplied the UK, all the while the UK facilities supposedly had 3 more months to prepare and the Dutch facility 3 months less. 80 million of the 100 million AZ doses will be made in the UK.

I don't believe that a simple lockdown is the definite answer - **properly imposed** lockdowns, yes. The problem, just like with any good/bad law, is enforcement and the public's willingness to comply. This is definitely a nuanced scenario for different countries as Asian cultures are on average more willing to sacrifice personal comforts for the benefit of the many.

Korea didn't even lockdown their country that strictly - but they made sure they tested the heck out of their population and got everyone to wear masks. Since there already was a culture of mask-wearing when feeling unwell, it didn't feel like too much of a departure from the norm and real life could keep going on for most everyone anyway.

When you look at countries like US, UK, France, Brazil, Germany, India - you have large numbers of people disregarding social distancing, causing the lockdown to be ineffective.

We have slightly different prices from one geographic to the other because the cost of goods may be different. We have a supply chain in Brazil, we have another one in Latin America, another one in South Asia. We have one in Japan. Of course, you know, local costs are different.

[https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2021/01/26/news/interview\_pascal\_soriot\_ceo\_astrazeneca\_coronavirus\_covid\_vaccines-284349628/](https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2021/01/26/news/interview_pascal_soriot_ceo_astrazeneca_coronavirus_covid_vaccines-284349628/)

It might also be that the EU has more efficient logistics, more production capacity ready, lower cost of goods and a larger order than other regions that can lower the price. It is at cost for all regions. The EU probably just has a lower cost that has to be made per vaccine produced there.

There is a reason why the EU paid less for the BioNTech vaccine, and a reason why it paid more for the Moderna vaccine:

&gt; The EU financially supported the development of the BioNTech and Pfizer vaccine and has obtained a lower price per dose ($14.70 than the US ($19.50). The Moderna vaccine’s development was subsidised by the US government, and it will cost the US about $15 a dose, while the EU is paying $18. 

[https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n281](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n281)

And the in the EU developed Janssen vaccine is not for profit too: 

&gt;**Janssen Vaccine Candidate Access and Distribution**  
The Company is committed to bringing an affordable COVID-19 vaccine on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use, pending regulatory authorizations.

[https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-single-shot-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-met-primary-endpoints-in-interim-analysis-of-its-phase-3-ensemble-trial](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-single-shot-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-met-primary-endpoints-in-interim-analysis-of-its-phase-3-ensemble-trial)

For which the EU also paid less:

&gt; The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, expected to announce phase III results imminently, is also much cheaper, costing the EU $8.50, with each dose going twice as far as the other brands, since it is a single shot vaccine. 

[https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n281](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n281)

So it seems like the EU paid less for the not for profit vaccines. Probably because the ""costs"" for production are lower for the EU. Because the for profit vaccines have a specific reason to be more/less expensive in the EU (BNT/MRNA).",,,1612187327,,{},gllir62,False,t3_l9jfwi,False,False,t1_gllgmcu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l9jfwi/eus_von_der_leyen_says_astrazeneca_will_deliver_9/gllir62/,1612495216.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s just trying to scare you into clicking. 

There is no hidden “brutal truth”. Young people aren’t dying from corona. Period. The title is a lie. There is no “brutal truth”.  

In the Uk, average age of death for corona is over 80 years old. Only 0.64% of all deaths are ages 20-40. 0.64% of all deaths isn’t a lot. It’s about 300 people. That includes 20-40 year olds with pre existing conditions. Just 300 people. 

It’s obviously horrible they died, but it’s not a lot of people. There is no “brutal truth” like the article claims.

You make very valid points on how they do nothing to protect the population - however, I disagree in saying that early lockdowns would not have been effective.

Obviously hindsight is 20/20, but when you consider the incubation period of two weeks prior to development of symptoms and the fact that many countries were implementing temperature checks as a screening method, it was obvious that lockdowns were going to fail. That's why I cited Korea and proper protocols - the lockdown was merely to stop a mass outbreak, once it was under control everything went back to 'normal' but with social distancing and masks everywhere.

There was a case in Korea where a large cluster of people contracted COVID from a Starbucks - the only people in close contact who tested negative were the employees who always had their masks on. Which brings me to a recent study by the NFL on the transmission of COVID - they found that proximity and time of exposure were less determining factors as opposed to the use of masks. I'll link it: https://www.wsj.com/articles/super-bowl-nfl-covid-cdc-11612104460?mod=djemalertNEWS

Basically my point is this - the lockdowns should have been seen as a means to keep the virus under control while gearing up for a 'new normal' as we worked towards a vaccine. Indefinite lockdowns should not be considered at all. If proper lockdowns and social distancing + mask protocol were performed and observed in March, the virus would not be as widespread as it is now with new mutations in tow. 

Oh and my Black Friday purchase was made in late November, when there **wasn't** any lockdown anymore. I'm complaining about how other people acted during lockdowns because **I** stocked up with more than two weeks worth of food,did not order anything non-essential and stayed inside for the month long lockdown.

I'll finish with this - I don't think *lengthy* lockdowns are needed anymore.

It's shocking how seemingly, Heart Attacks and cancer related deaths have practically decreased over night and everyone is just dying of COVID. 

Plus it's ""Flu Season"" at the moment where poorly and elderly people die in huge numbers, which I don't think has been taken into account or isn't very well reported. If you're elderly or sick, January to March is the most likely months you will die in this country. We often were booked for funerals so much this time of the year that we had to either turn people away or outsource. 

I would personally like to analyse the numbers in a few years, especially the excess deaths, and see the population of the elderly and sick. I'd be willing to bet we've been also hit so hard because of our overall age demographics. I think at the end, our numbers will be well in line and on par with a lot of other countries (I think we'll be mid table personally).",,,1612191620,,{},gllshi9,False,t3_l9fmlm,False,True,t1_gliojoy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l9fmlm/uk_reaches_record_number_of_daily_vaccinations/gllshi9/,1612500042.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

There’s also some compounds you need to both stabilize the rna and help encourage cell to take it in that are newer to the vaccine game. it‘s actually really cool since rna is temporary, so you turn you cells into temporary machines to chug out the viral proteins to train your immune system, and then the mRNA disappears, which is why you need a second shot. But the “it’s new” and hasn’t been used for a released vaccine before,  journalists  are covering even  minor allergies as a major event, terrifying people into avoiding a fairly safe vaccine. New = unknown = fear-based reporting and click bait.

astrazeneca does something similar, but it inserts the dna into your cell. DNA is less delicate than rna so it takes less fanciness to keep it stable, and because dna lasts in a cell you don’t need a booster shot as it’ll help cells keep chugging out “training” viral proteins to teach immune system, though it does permanently alter some of your cells in a relatively harmless way. The rna vaccines don’t permanently alter cells. However people aren’t freaking out about dna tech since it’s similar tech to the Ebola vaccine that was used without issue a few years ago.

this novavax uses similar tech to the very established hpv vaccine, and it uses protein so it’s just dumping the pre-made viral protein into your body to train it. protein is far more stable than either rna or dna, so that’s a huge advantage for storage. So kinda it’s kinda like pfizer in that the stuff injected is temporary and doesn’t alter your cells permanently, and you’ll need a booster.

&gt;Abstract  
&gt;  
&gt;Invasion or damage of the male reproductive system is one of the reported outcomes of viral infection. Current studies have documented that SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, can damage the male reproductive system in large part by inflammatory damage caused by a cytokine storm. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can infect the human testis directly and enter semen is controversial. Other adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproduction are also of concern and require comprehensive evaluation. Here, we analyze the invasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 in the testis and examine reported mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 interferes with male reproduction. Long-term implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male reproduction are also discussed. **It should be emphasized that although COVID-19 may induce testicular damage, a substantial decrease in male reproductive capacity awaits clinical evidence. We propose that there is an urgent need to track male COVID-19 patients during their recovery.** The development of suitable experimental models, including human reproductive organoids, will be valuable to further investigate the viral impact on reproduction for current and future pandemics.

Which brings up the question, this pandemics been going on since March in large numbers. There have been a large number of papers speculating on ways viruses can cause fertility issues and some providing evidence of testicular tissues changes (often in autopsies of deceased patients) but I've seen very little studying the actual effects on fertility despite the fact that a number of couples must have tried to conceive since March. Has somebody studied whether they are having measurable increases in difficulties conceiving.",,,1612191248,,{},gllrh2i,False,t3_la4j1t,False,True,t3_la4j1t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/la4j1t/study_finds_that_covid19_reduces_fertility_in_men/gllrh2i/,1612499560.0,9,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

What took them so long to commit to purchase their own vaccine? That commitment (and money) from the UK in July meant that Pfizer could start scaling production in Europe months earlier than if the EU commission had been the sole customer. Just imagine the awful situation in that scenario with Pfizer not having had enough time to get over teething trouble the way Astrazeneca is having with the EU factories. The UK could have insisted that Pfizer produced it's order there, then months later in November the EU would have to start from scratch building it's production.

The article you link is interesting. Though it cites a number of instances where France and other EU countries have restricted exports of medicines and personal protective equipment. I certainly don't support the UK government doing the same.

I AM happy that the UK is getting some Biontech vaccine. I am also thankful and grateful to Germany for developing it. The UKs not getting as much of it as it needs and was hoped for, but I'm not throwing a Karen and threatening to destabilise a peace agreement because of it. 

Being first in line doesn't mean others don't have fair access. The UK didn't stop or delay the EU commission from agreeing to the Astrazeneca or Pfizer contracts. The EU SHOULD have been at the front of the queue for their own vaccine. You sound angry and frustrated, and you should be. The people of Europe should be angry at the commission because they deserve better. Delays have consequences, and those vital months are sadly going to cost lives. The commission is trying to deflect blame. In doing so they have managed to unite almost every party in northern Ireland (perhaps for the first time ever) in condemning the commissions actions.

I'm not saying that the UK is whiter than white, but it's certainly unfair to cast it as the villain. The commission needs to take responsibility for badly mishandling the situation.

I've seen patients as young as 20 with no comorbidities and not being overweight die and most of what I see is the worst cases. Most people are older and have other health issues. Some are just very unlucky.

The article is using click baity title. There's nothing in there we don't know. We know healthcare workers were exhausted almost exactly a year ago when the whole pandemic really began to kick off. We knew it mostly kills older people and those most vulnerable but there were a small percentage of youth who were also dying. Ideally both those numbers should be 0, typically for younger people too.

But it does nobody any good scaring people and causing anxiety like that. one of the challenges healthcare workers also face is people who need help trying to leave before they receive the help/full recovery they need because they are just outright anxious about staying in the hospital and want to gtfo. I think I've seen too many covid negative patients trying to get out of bed and fall causing their stay at the hospital to be longer and causing their risk to get infected by covid even higher.

For sure the side that blows covid out of proportion is better than those who thought it's a joke/the flu/etc. But it doesn't always have to be this binary hyperpolarized ends' circle jerking where you can ONLY think covid is the new black plague otherwise you ONLY think it's a hoax/are a selfish anti masker.

Truth is no one still knows just how bad it is and we're still collecting the large sample data. See how Fauci often says ""I don't know"" when asked questions he genuinely doesn't know.

The domestic cases, patients 1820-1849, are in Hanoi (four cases); the nothern provinces of Hai Duong (17), Quang Ninh (five) and Bac Giang (one); the Central Hinglands province of Gia Lai (two); and southern Binh Duong Province (1).

The new Covid-19 cases in Hanoi were detected in Me Linh, Nam Tu Liem and Dong Anh districts.

All five patients recorded in Quang Ninh were F1 cases, with two linked to ""patient 1553"", a 31-year-old employee at Van Don International Airport in Quang Ninh Province. The other F1 patients were related to Chi Linh Town of northern Hai Duong Province, the country's biggest Covid-19 hotspot.

Binh Duong has recorded the second patient, ""Patient 1843"", a 19-year-old female. She came in close contact with ""patient 1644"".

Of the 17 new patients in Hai Duong, those tagged from 1827-1842 are workers at Vietnam Poyun Electronics Co. Ltd. in Chi Linh and the remaining one was related to the outbreak in its Ninh Giang District.

Patients 1845 and 1846, one 31-year-old male and one 38-year-old female, in Gia Lai were related to the outbreak of Chi Linh.

Ho Chi Minh City recorded one imported case, ""patient 1850"", a 24-year-old foreign expert from South Africa.

Earlier on Monday, the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City announced that ""patient 1660"" in Hai Duong contracted the U.K. Covid-19 variant, which is considered 70 percent more contagious than previous strains, which possiblly caused the huge surge in cases in the northern province.

Vietnam has recorded a total of 270 community transmissions in 10 provinces since its latest outbreak began last Thursday. Hai Duong topped the list with 205 cases, followed by Quang Ninh (30), Hanoi (19), Gia Lai (6), Bac Ninh (3), Hoa Binh (2), Binh Duong (2) and HCMC and Hai Phong have one each.

Authorities of 26 localities nationwide have allowed students to begin their Tet break early or switch to online classes starting Tuesday.

Hanoi authorities on Monday afternoon decided to shut down game and internet service outlets in the city as measures to contain the spreading novel coronavirus from February 2. Previously, on Sunday they announced all bars, karaoke parlors, and discotheques must close and residents have to avoid 'non-essential' gatherings from February 1.

Vietnam has recorded 1,850 cases, with 393 currently active. A total of more 26,000 peoople are being quarantined at hospitals, centralized facilities and at home.

AstraZeneca PLC on Monday signed a deal to supply Vietnam 30 million doses in the first half of this year for domestic inoculation. No further details on the price per dose and when the first batch of vaccine will be delivered. The Health Ministry has stepped up negotiations with Pfizer, Moderna and other vaccine manufacturers.""

It’s so easy to focus on the efficacy part - whether you get the disease in any form or not. And on that front, these vaccines are still really good. We might even see the spread of the virus slowly die out with the vaccines. But if we could make it less dangerous than the flu, that’s still really good. That’s enough to get us back to normal.

In a sense social media is just additional communication, and institutions are struggling to figure out how to control that communication. In the past things like radio, television, or publishing were expensive, so gatekeeping was relatively easy. Now anyone can communicate with anyone else at any time. 

In a sense that’s dangerous because it can allow groups to form and undergo shifts toward extremism through things like escalation of commitment and other psychological effects. Less extreme people will leave groups, more extreme rhetoric will be rewarded by likes, shares, upvotes, and retweets, etc. All of the major social media platforms have ways of keeping you from seeing things that will make you too uncomfortable. 

Reddit subdivides into subreddits, and those are moderated by people, and bots with specific ideas what is or isn’t acceptable content. Facebook allows you to unfriend, block, hide, or hide. It’s algorithm decides for you what will drive the most engagement-- things that draw out strong emotions like outrage, or disgust. Twitter encourages you to congregate online with people who believe the things you believe, and share the things you share. 

Social media companies have been experimenting with different ways of slowing disinformation, but they’re very slow to respond and usually easy to subvert. Governments could regulate social media, but that represents a host of other problems that should give us pause.

That being said, I think the most effective kind of conversation is to wait for them to bring it up, and then ask 
“Why do you believe that?” Try to redirect them into a two way conversation where they get to lay out *why*, not *what* they believe, and you also share *why* you believe what you believe.

Cognitive biases make it very easy for people to adopt beliefs and very hard to give them up, especially when giving up those beliefs would also mean giving up friendships or social support networks.

Because if youre an American youre not locked in your house and can follow your own risk assessment. Science provides guidance with the information at hand.

The two reasons are:
1) Uncertainty that vaccines mitigate transmission
2) The mutated variants may cause issues

We'll learn these things in time, but the jest of the article is- it's wise to be cautious (for now) because you may still be able to transmit the virus to a loved one in your household + the mutated variants are just starting to emerge in the US so we don't know exactly how it will impact even those who are vaccinated.

Nobody gives a shit anymore. Our gov pretty much refuses to buy vaccines. People tried to start a ""movement"" on twitter to beg the gov to buy vaccines, and then the gov called the twitter crowd traitors for wanting the evil US made vaccine. It's not funny, but the delusion is hilarious. 

So we're not getting ANY vaccines. 
Our own joke of a vaccine is being made in Cuba... WHAT
And it's been tested on 37 people and already they're gonna do mass manufacturing. Because 37 is a large enough sample. 

They also tried to shut us up buying Sputnik V vaccine. The biggest joke? None of our health officials are willing to take that vaccine, stating it's not been approved yet by any international organization. They're absolutely right. So who bought it then? politicians. And now there's fighting between one group of curropt assholes with another group and they're calling each other names. You know what this accomplishes? NOTHING. more people will die, they make more moeny, all is good for them.  

So here we are... completely fucked. Sanctions from left and right. Stupid government who cares about NOTHING but killing people and getting fatter and fatter and richer and richer.

](https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/23/put-straw-man-pandemic-denial-out-of-its-misery/) &lt;--good article that touches on these topics

&gt;Listen to the chorus and you’d come to think that our biggest problem in responding to the pandemic comes from Americans who think Covid-19 is a hoax — the so-called Covid denialists.

&gt;But the claim is a straw man: there is no epidemic of pandemic denial. Polls since March have shown that Americans overwhelmingly aren’t in denial: They believe the threat of Covid-19 is real, they are reasonably good at identifying medical misinformation, and they are largely complying with public health recommendations. Compared to their peers in Europe, Americans are more willing to get vaccinated against Covid-19, similarly likely to wear masks, and no more prone to believe common conspiracy theories about the pandemic’s origins.

&gt;The U.S.’s response to Covid-19 has been bungled in many respects, but widespread public denial doesn’t explain why.

&gt;The obsession with denialism isn’t just inaccurate. It’s corrosive for at least three reasons. First, it needlessly alienates the interested public with false accusations. Second, by conflating reasonable dissent with unreasonable misinformation, it stifles debate, even about issues that genuinely warrant discussion. Third, the myth of denial deflects blame from the policy failures of politicians, who use it to claim they’ve done all they could, leaving only the denialists (and cheesecake eaters) to blame.",,,1612207500,,{},glmyf8d,False,t3_l9y3ca,False,False,t1_glmvxmd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l9y3ca/daily_discussion_thread_february_01_2021/glmyf8d/,1612519536.0,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not really, the benefits are not dying or ending up in hospital. We don't have the data on long term protection or how they work for blocking transmission. The primary benefits of using different vaccines are unknown. Transmission matters way more in countries where not everyone is being vaccinated at the same rate.

&gt;People are rightfully concerned about getting COVID-19 themselves, and they rightfully want to receive the higher-efficacy treatments. A mass rollout of the lower efficacy options is going to create a mess: people will be calling around to find the higher efficacy options and refusing vaccines once they arrive at appointments if they “lose the lottery”. And when the inevitable cases occur in people who received the lower efficacy vaccines, word will spread and anti-vaccine proponents will just have more ammunition.

&gt;The propaganda campaign we’re seeing right now to pump up the AZ and J+J shots is precisely because public officials realize they are selling a tough bill of goods. The announcements from public figures like Dr. Fauci are intended to reduce hesitation to receive the lower efficacy vaccines, and are akin to the initial inaccurate information provided to the public asking them to not wear masks to conserve supply - a well intended falsehood that goes against individual interests.

I am not American so I don't know the story you're talking about, but again mass coverage of a vaccine that stops covid being more the a running noise is not a bad thing. All these vaccines stop serious illness. That's not disinformation, it's data.

&gt;This campaign is just going to encourage anti-vaccine sentiment unless officials start acknowledging the elephant in the room: they are asking people to sacrifice their own personal well-being to accelerate the societal recovery by a few months

This is now true for comments like yours. All the vaccines give protection. Trying to discredit the ""weaker"" ones based off a single out of context statistics are exactly what anti vaccination people tend to do. ""Oh, 1 in 1000 died and we aren't sure why, everyone panic"".

Because you said you didn't trust American and European health agencies, which approved the vaccines. So, you *do* trust the health agencies, just not about ""containment"". That's fine, just clarifying.  
  
&gt; No, I do not trust health agencies who failed to contain the virus on containment strategies. Do you? If so, why?  
  
I trust scientists to identify what's dangerous and what isn't, and I don't see any reason to think that scientists from Taiwan, Australia, or New Zealand are somehow more credible than those from the US or Europe just because *their countries* are faring better. Moreover, I don't see that the scientists in Taiwan, Australia, or New Zealand think differently than those in the US and Europe. It's just that those countries were able to implement different policies under different circumstances; policies that, unfortunately, would never happen across the US.  
  
&gt; With regards to Marin County ""only two cases from schools."" Please provide a breakdown of how the rest of the cases were transmitted and why they cannot be linked to schools.  
  
That's not really how it works. I don't have to prove where every case in my city came from to demonstrate that they didn't come from my house.  
  
&gt; 530 teachers in the US have died of COVID, per NYT (linked below.)  
  
&gt; https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/us/the-impact-of-teacher-deaths.html  
  
I'm sure the number is higher than 530, because the US has **3.2 million** teachers.  However, from the article: ""There is no indication that teachers are being infected or dying at a higher rate than people in other professions.""  
  
I'm sure a number of those teachers got COVID from schools, and I'm also sure that a number of schools aren't doing well at implementing or following COVID precautions. What hasn't been demonstrated is that schools (for younger students) which take proper precautions are significant vectors for COVID transmission.

There is as Potter Stewart said a degree of ""I'll know it when I see it,"" to ""just asking"" type questions. Usually if there isn't something else to make me think a question is being asked in bad faith I engage, but there are definitely red flags I've noticed over time that are difficult to quantify. 

For example it's very common for some reason for anti-vaxxers to start inquires with a story of how they were ""pro-vaccine"" until their child was vaccinated and then developed seizures or became ""vaccine injured."" For whatever reason that phrasing tends to be idiosyncratic to people who spend a lot of time in anti-vaccine groups. I know that makes it hard to do things like come up with regex for a computer to filter genuine curiosity from bad faith, but it might just be something that needs human eyes.

The normal timeline for vaccine development is about ten years, so a lot of people are concern about how quickly these vaccines were developed and approved. 

However a few things went into the rapid development and testing that sped it up. 

First the long time for development of a vaccine is usually not a delay in basic research, but regulatory delays, time spent writing grants, waiting for reviews, trying to raise money or find volunteers. 

A ton of money was thrown at the problem, which sped up a lot of those processes. Much of the basic research for most of the vaccine types was complete before the pandemic for other coronaviruses like MERS-CoV, or because mRNA vaccines have a lot promise in general for other diseases. 

Certain trial phases were conducted in parallel (at the same time) instead of in series. The trials were able to recruit people quickly and because the disease is common enough people in the control groups became sick out in the world that the data could be analyzed quickly. 

Really in terms of the number of people in the trials (which is a much better measure than the length of the trials) these are *very* well tested vaccines. 

It's true that we don't have specific long-term data for them, but:

* It's a pandemic and we have to make our best decision about what's safest given what we know
* We have long term data from other mRNA vaccines from prior animal studies that are strongly suggestive of long term safety.",,,1612203001,,{},glmmka3,True,t3_la6ftg,False,False,t1_glmk6qd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/la6ftg/i_wrote_antivaxxers_how_to_challenge_a/glmmka3/,1612514183.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

You watch this group for say 3 months. 5 people in the vaccinated group get sick and test positive for covid19. 100 people in the placebo group get sick and test positive for covid19. The effectiveness is then 100/(5+100) = 95.2%.  

The math gets a little more complicated when the groups aren't the same size, but that's the basic idea of how the effectiveness is calculated. 

To return to your specific question, its not really easy to say if a vaccine is 100% effective in 95% of people, or 95% effective in all people because there's multiple arbitrary ways to categorize the ""people"" in this question. If there is an answer to that question, it'll probably take a while to find out unless there's some smoking gun like the vaccine doesn't work in 50% of african-americans or 5% of vaccine receivers just don't make antibodies to the vaccine.

Merkel expects to be finished before the end of summer without J&amp;J and CureVac. Earlier with those vaccines of course. So end of summer is more like the worst-case scenario now for the EU.

“Immediately” doesn’t mean “as soon as the AP calls the election.” By my count, democrats have had the senate for eight business days. They’ve been working on a covid relief package in those eight days, as well as confirming cabinet picks so Biden has a functioning government. 

The reality Is they’ll pass covid relief as soon as they humanly can, and that’s pretty immediate. They’re even looking at using reconciliation to pass this without GOP support, which is pretty huge given that you have limited opportunities to do that in any given congressional cycle.

In our case, the trial we're talking about was conducted by Oxford University. We AZ are conducting the US trial, which we think is going to be ready very soon. Oxford University conducted the so-called Oxford trial in UK and Brazil, and we have data for patients who received the vaccine in one-month interval, 2 or 3 months interval. First of all, we believe that the efficacy of one dose is sufficient: 100 percent protection against severe disease and hospitalisation, and 71-73 percent of efficacy overall. The second dose is needed for long term protection. But you get a better efficiency if you get the 2nd dose later than earlier. We are going to do a study in the US and globally to use two-month dose interval to confirm that this is indeed the case, there are many reasons to believe it is the case with our vaccine.

If the UK had the choice of buying vaccines at a later date at a much cheaper price, considering the the current rates of infection and COVID related deaths, it would chose to go for the more immediate but expensive route because it has no other choice. Countries like France and Germany can afford to wait longer to get vaccines, especially considering both countries has a hospital bed per 1000 people ratio double that of the UK: [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_hospital_beds) .

Look I'm not much aware of EU schemes in general, so I won't argue with your position on that, mainly because if I wanted to, I would have to do extra research I haven't already done and it's getting late here. But please feel free to enlighten me as to why EU schemes in general are slow and penny pinching (hopefully with sources this time as opposed to emotive rhetoric). Look, I think we agree on some areas, where we disagree is that I think the reason why the UK's vaccine rollout has been successful so far is not Brexit. I have provided evidence as to why and I am willing to have my mind changed.

I completely disagree with the last point you made because of reasons, but I feel like the last point is a tangent to the original topic so I'm going to leave the last one, mainly because I have online lessons in 8 hours and I sadly need sleep (but knowing that the rest of the world should be hailing me for my invaluable contribution to fighting off COVID makes the sleeping part easier).

(28th Jan).. So it would appear EU *haven't even paid up* yet for their order of this (cheap non-profit) vaccine, despite that seems to be in breach the contract stipulations on payment windows and of 'reasonable best effort' in support from EU.. that's some r/choosingbeggars type behavior. 

Whereas UK signed contract months earlier and invested (and provided) far more than EU in vaccine development per capita https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Esr3kECXcAkF0Lo?format=jpg&amp;name=large 

they also approved and rolled out earlier, despite all that early AZ shipments were also cut to UK (by almost 90%) -- far more than they were cut to the EU! 

 Of course nobody in EU cared at those AZ shortages in UK (or the Biontech/pfizer shortages), until shortages occured to EU, then there's outrage about 'unfair treatment' even though it's nothing intentional or personal and EU still going to get the full order amount-- plus it's been reported the problem is now mostly solved going forward.

&gt;During his 154-day illness — one of the longest on record — the patient’s body became a crucible of riotous viral mutation. He offered the world one of the first sightings of a key mutation in the virus’ spike protein that set off alarm bells when it was later found in strains in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil.

&gt;In the U.K. strain, the genetic change known as N501Y is thought to help enhance the virus’ transmissibility by about 50 percent. In the South Africa strain, it may reduce the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. Tests of its effect on the Brazil variant are still in progress.

He’s either scaring people to the point where they can’t think straight, or pissing people off to where they tune out and ignore him — neither is a good way to manage a public health situation.)

&gt; When college athletes recover from COVID-19 and are ready to return to sports, it might be wise to first make sure the new coronavirus has not left them with myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart that has turned up in some patients even after only mild or asymptomatic illness.

&gt; At Ohio State University, doctors performed cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on 26 student athletes, women and men, who had recovered from COVID-19. None had been hospitalized, and 12 reported having only mild symptoms.

&gt; Their electrocardiograms looked normal, and ultrasound examinations showed no heart abnormalities. But the MRIs detected myocarditis in four of the athletes - two of whom had no symptoms.

&gt; And 12 athletes had heart tissue scarring, although they had not had any of the typical signs of a heart attack.

I recommend you take a look back and graph school closures against peaks in the virus. Schools are at the heart of ""the hammer and the dance"" (a horrible concept and policy.) There is certainly correlation between school closings and reduced cases the following month.

With regards to ""how evidence works,"" I have never seen a breakdown of a statistically-significant source of transmissions in a given community specifically identified. I have seen studies where ""evidence does not show schools are a significant source of transmission,"" whereby less than 25% of total community transmissions have been accurately traced. For me, that doesn't pass the minimum threshold of data science. Evidence does not show intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. That is not due to lack of intelligent life, but rather due to lack of evidence either way.

Now, about ""trusting experts."" You're mixing up a lot of things within that framework. I'm in the sciences and trust good science. As with any profession, 25% suck at their job. Moreover, many scientists have been wrong and unintended consequences are the story of many-a-calamity. Tom Dowd, as an example, spent the rest of his life regretting his early work in nuclear. Nobel is another of many examples.

What is the CDC's job with respect to COVID? Where are they trusted experts, and where have they lost the ability to hold that title?

**Vaccines** - FDA (not CDC) reviews applications and approves. I trust what I have seen of that process enough to take it. CDC is tasked with helping with distribution. There was not a comprehensive COVID distribution plan as of January 19, 2020. That's a big fail.

**Containment outside of country** - The CDC kicked butt on Ebola a few years ago. It made it stateside, but was contained mostly thanks to efforts by US doctors overseas and other measures. In the case of COVID, the CDC failed to see the problem early enough and failed to make moves before community spread in the United States. I was flying home from Thailand when I first heard of COVID on Jan 6. I should've been screened in the airport. I was not.

**Containment within country.** - By the time we admitted it was airborne we had already ""moved from containment to mitigation."" The CDC was unsuccessful. When we shutdown in March, we had the chance to try to re-contain the virus. We did not. CDC guidance has not helped. Our death toll is above the worst estimates from spring last  year. My County health department is a joke, recommendations are all over the place, and there is no enforcement of containment or mitigation strategies.

Listen containment isn't just about raw biology. There is a large system involved and thorough planning required. Psychology, Supply Chain, Economics, Building Sciences, and nearly all other fields must come together cohesively to have success. A variety of tools (over 200) can be leveraged to contain a virus. Some countries succeeded while most failed. The US is the exemplar of abject failure in this instance. It is completely within reason for me to question the CDC about their containment and mitigation strategies due to 14 months of failure to contain the virus. Any other study or resource holds more weight, in my opinion, than the CDC with respect to containment of COVID-19. They have no credibility on this topic.

The NZ Ministry of Health deserves the most credibility on this matter. What I read in the following statement sounds inconclusive - ""In keeping with some international findings, children appeared to have had a lesser role in household transmission and outbreaks—even at a school—in New Zealand, despite intensive testing of asymptomatic contacts.2,  21 However, with lower national testing rates in children, detection bias cannot be excluded.""",,,1612206303,,{},glmvb5w,False,t3_l9gmmt,False,False,t1_glmntap,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l9gmmt/lightfoot_demands_chicago_schools_reopen_monday/glmvb5w/,1612518112.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Story:

My daughters friend tested positive for Covid on Jan 25th. As her sister is on a basketball team and she had it (tested positive 22nd) and so did a few others. My daughter saw her friend on the 13th and they rode together in the car (maskless) as that's one of her two ""safe"" friends.

My daughter showed symptons with a cold the week of the 17th and she was very sleepy one of the days. She also commented once that she couldn't taste much but she also had a cold which normally she can't taste anything when that happens. Well we finally thought the best option is to get her tested because she was going back and forth on her words (she normally never says the right thing and always misuses words) + we just found her friend had COVID. Appointments were booked so the only availability in the area was the 31st, which she came back negative which could be due to taking the test so late.

Now my wife had her test today, January 1 as she started feeling like she was coming down with a cold on Jan 29, and on Jan 30 she couldn't smell anything. She thought her taste buds were gone but that was a false sign. Today Jan 1 she said she couldn't taste her lunch and when she had her  test she came back positive just now.

So I am seeing that my daughter got it from her friend (who didn't know she had it obviously) and my wife got it from my daughter (there were 3 occasions where my daughter drank from her cup of water). So since my wife first started getting symptoms on the 30th with the no smell, how long ago do we trace back to warn people?

My parents came over that Thursday (28th) and she saw 5 other women for their small group on 26th (she had a mask on as always, but they didn't + chairs are spaced out in a circle).

We are telling my parents + the small group ladies aregardless but should they be worried is what I am trying to gauge.

Dr Fetzer said ‘This strongly suggests that the link between ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ and new COVID-19 infections is causal: when people were not dining out as part of the scheme there were fewer new cases of the virus. ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ may in the end have been a false economy: one that subsidised the spread of the pandemic into Autumn and contributed to the start of the second wave. Alternative policy measures, such as extending the furlough scheme, increasing statutory sick pay and supporting low income households through expanding free school meals may well prove to be far more cost effective than demand-stimulating measures that encourage economic activities which actively cause COVID-19 to spread.’

**Notes to editors**

The Government’s Eat Out to Help Out scheme was conceived to shore up demand for the hard hit restaurant sector in the UK, which employs around 1 million people directly. The scheme cut the cost of meals and non-alcoholic drinks by up to 50% across tens of thousands of participating restaurants in the UK from 3 to 31 August 2020. The discount was capped at a maximum of £10 per person, but there was no limit on how often it could be claimed per individual. Early release statistics suggest that during the four weeks in which the program was active, a total of nearly 100 million covers were claimed, at a total cost to the taxpayer of around £500 million.

The government initiative, which cost around £500 million, caused a significant rise in new infections in August and early September accelerating the pandemic into its current second wave. The economic benefits of the scheme, meanwhile, were short-lived.

In a new paper, ‘Subsidizing the spread of COVID-19: Evidence from the UK's Eat Out to Help Out scheme’, Dr Thiemo Fetzer of the CAGE Research Centre in the Economics Department at the University of Warwick analyses the causal impact of ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ on COVID-19 infections. Key findings are:

· Participating restaurants saw an increase in visits of between 10 and 200% compared to 2019.

· Areas with a higher rate of uptake (both from restaurants and consumers) experienced a sharp increase in the emergence of new COVID-19 infection clusters a week after the scheme began.

· Between 8 and 17% of the newly detected COVID-19 infection clusters can be attributed to the scheme.

· Areas with high uptake saw a decline in new infections a week after the scheme ended.

· As the ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ scheme ended, visits to restaurants started to decline – indicating that its positive economic impact was short-lived.

The research leverages data from HMRC’s own restaurant finder app which was the go-to platform for people searching for participating restaurants in their neighbourhood, together with weekly data on new COVID-19 infections measured at the level of Middle Layer Super Output Areas.

To demonstrate the causal connection between ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ and increased infections in areas of high uptake, Dr Fetzer analyses rainfall data and granular mobility data from Google’s Community Mobility Reports. He finds that higher rainfall around lunch and dinner time during the scheme’s period of operation (Monday to Wednesday throughout August) saw both a drop in visits to restaurants and subsequently lower new infection rates compared to areas that enjoyed good weather. Rainfall during lunch and dinner hours did not drastically affect time spent in other locations.",,,1612211160,,{},gln7rn9,True,t3_lad4j7,False,True,t3_lad4j7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lad4j7/eat_out_to_help_out_scheme_drove_new_covid19/gln7rn9/,1612523955.0,13,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The elections are over and they are still freaking out about it so there is something else to it. Many said the concerns over the virus would disappear on Nov 4 or Jan 20 but if anything concerns are greater now, even though the data is better. All the same Democrat-leaning media outlets like CNN, MSNBC, NYT and WPO are still beating the same drum even though the elections are over and they are comfortably in charge.

The media has no incentive to report facts or common sense.

If you imagine your cells to be lots of tiny houses with little doors and locks on them, the Covid virus only has one key: it's protein spike can unlock the ACE2 receptor, and none other. If it can find an ACE2 receptor, it can enter your cell, hijack it, start multiplying, and take over your body. The ACE2 receptors are located mostly on the cells in your airway and lungs, which is why direct inhalation is the most risky route, but there are some ACE2 receptors on the inside of your mouth. If you touch your mouth and the virus get in, it stays in your oral chamber and maybe bind to one of those receptors. If you eat food, chances are pretty good that the food bolus would envelop the virus particle and it never touch your mucus membrane at all, or it gets washed down with saliva, so it is unlikely to linger in your mouth long enough to find an ACE2 receptor to bind to.

Kids and teachers are more likely to catch covid outside of school than in a school that follows proper precautions. It therefore follows that schools could only decrease deaths on net when safety precautions are followed (as they are in Chicago).

Furthermore, life years lost do to school closures has been shown to be higher than life years lost due to school reopening. This is among an entire community, not just students. Therefore, it follows that if we want to save lives, schools must be opened.

In fact, those demanding social distancing post-vaccine may end up prolonging the pandemic. Returning to a normal life is the best incentive we can give people to take the vaccine.

[We can probably assume something roughly similar will happen with the other vaccines.](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/pfizer-moderna-covid-19-vaccines-may-not-be-as-effective-against-new-variants-fauci-says.html)

 [Moderna reported a sixfold drop in neutralization against the South African variant](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-retains-neutralizing-activity-against), and [Pfizer reported a 2.5fold drop](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.07.425740v1).

It may be that this matters, but hopefully, it doesn't matter!

Anyway, back when I was on Zoloft, after 6 months of often intense therapy I typically had a YBOCS score of around 10 on my good days and 20 on my bad days, and I had about half good days and half bad days. Now on Luvox I'm around a 6 on my good days and 13 on my bad days, and I have about 70% good days to 30% bad days. Absolutely worth it.

I think the reasons the directives are so sweeping is exactly this reason: every person sees themselves as the exception to the rules so the lockdown is constantly tightened and made more restrictive because people aren’t abiding by less restrictive guidelines and community spread is getting out of control. Look at the case of thanksgiving and Christmas. The guidance was not to travel, and yet millions of people travelled just by airplane, and there was the expected spike in deaths and cases following. 

People do need socialization, but spreading the virus in a pandemic to vulnerable people who will then get very,very ill is probably much worse for your mental health than not seeing them. 

Pandemic fatigue is a real thing, I feel it too. The saddest thing is that if everyone had just gone in to a real lockdown for 2-3 weeks at the beginning, no travel, no work, no visiting friends, we could have avoided having a painful and prolonged year of this shit.

When Pfizer and Moderna underwent their clinical trials, they did so *prior* to the emergence of these new variants. The full-length spike sequence in the insert of these vaccines largely matched the virus circulating at that time - hence their stellar efficacy data.

J&amp;J and NovaVax, by way of contrast, had a *far* higher bar to clear. By the time their trials rolled out, they had to contend not just with the Wuhan variant, but with at least half a dozen other variants, some of which are structurally very different from the original virus. This reduced the efficacy of those vaccines, especially in preventing mild disease. J&amp;J was especially thorough in staging sites globally against many different variants.

Of note, Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines are *also* impacted by these variants - but because they read before the emergence of the variants, we don't know how much they are impacted. It would be naive to assume that they are still 95% effective against all variants - NovaVax's readout (\~90% effective in the US, &lt;50% effective in South Africa) strongly suggests this. We just don't know *how* much they're impacted because they haven't been formally tested in a clinical setting.

But J&amp;J's data suggest that, hopefully, it may not matter. They didn't have anyone even hospitalized in their South African cohort *despite* lower efficacy. This may mean that, even with a dent in their efficacy, the vaccine is still effective enough. We hope this is also true of Pfizer and Moderna.

tl;dr: J&amp;J/Nvax and Pfizer/Moderna trials occurred under **very** different conditions and their efficacy can't be compared directly (Pfizer and Moderna's data is fantastic against OG COVID but outdated).

We know that the vaccines prevent symptoms 95% of the time. We know that people who are infected and never develop symptoms are extremely bad at spreading :[One study](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/iccj85/contact_settings_and_risk_for_transmission_in/) found that they infected only 0.3% of their close contacts, [another](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kd6930/household_transmission_of_sarscov2_a_systematic/) showed that they infected 0.7% of their household members. We know that those 5% who did develop symptoms probably had vaccine mediated reduction in symptoms, because there have been no hospitalizations in any of the vaccinated volunteers so far. We are pretty confident that those who get mild symptoms are far less likely to transmit than those who get severe symptoms. ""The secondary attack rate increased with the severity of index cases, from 0.3% (CI, 0.0 to 1.0%) for asymptomatic to 3.3% (CI, 1.8% to 4.8%) for mild, 5.6% (CI, 4.4% to 6.8%) for moderate, and 6.2% (CI, 3.2% to 9.1%) for severe or critical cases.""

Yeah, but we didn't, so we need to behave like we didn't.

This is just absolute nonsense. There are millions of people with pre-existing conditions that put them at higher risk for this virus than others, and those conditions are outside of their control. I have asthma; I don't do that to myself. I take care of my health, take medicines to manage my symptoms, and work out regularly, but I just have shitty lungs. Yeah, society is asking you to make sacrifices for people like me. Get over it. Part of living in a society means taking care of people other than yourself sometimes. (And by the way, the sacrifices healthy people are being asked to make could have lasted just a few weeks or months, but thanks to people like you, this has dragged on for damn near a year because you won't listen to public health officials about the objective facts of this virus and its spread.) 

&gt; I’ve ignored the virus since day 1 and it doesn’t seem to be doing me any wrong

You have no idea how many vulnerable people you've spread the virus to. You're just enormously selfish in your thinking. Like, it's awesome that *you* have escaped unscathed, but who knows how many people could have spent weeks or months ill because of you? How many people might have died because of your actions that further spread the virus around? How do you not care about that?

&gt; and if I was actually carrying the virus around shouldn’t I have smoked my grandparents awhile ago?

No, that's not how this virus works. There's always an element to chance with it, which means there's no absolute guarantee that being around someone vulnerable means you'll immediately get them sick. You could get them sick at any time while this virus is rampant. There's also an element of luck; maybe your grandparents had asymptomatic infections, which would be great, but that would be atypical for elderly people, and it still wouldn't change the fact that A) you would have taken a massive risk that could have killed them, and B) your behaviors could *still* be getting other people sick without your knowledge and contributing to the strain on an already overwhelmed healthcare system.

Like, people are getting new infections every day. It's not like everybody who was going to get sick automatically did so in the beginning.

look, ""WizeGuy"", it is literally impossible to scientifically study, in real-time, all possible risks. there will constantly be new variants popping up (this virus will never disappear), and there will always be new questions to answer. if you are expecting studies that verify that new mutated variants are protected against by vaccines every time there's a new variant, you are literally **never going to have a normal life again, full stop.** there have been thousands of variants already, and studying them takes funding, procedural red tape, and *time*. 

&amp;#x200B;

studies about the side effects of medication, the safety of vaccines, the long term effects of treatment and of getting the virus, etc - these things all take *time*.

&amp;#x200B;

as far as uncertainty that vaccines mitigate transmission, this is malarky. we already know that the principle method of transmission, as with all upper respiratory infections, is infected droplet and aerosol spread, and we know that your infectiousness is correlated with your viral load, and so a vaccine that prevents infection with 95% effectiveness to begin with, will by definition prevent you from even having that viral load that would be used to spread the virus.

there are some people, seemingly you are one of them, who are simply never going to be pleased because the goalposts keep moving and it's impossible to satisfy every ""what-if"".

For most of January, Arizona has had the highest rate of new COVID-19 cases in a nation that has led the world in its number of positive cases and deaths.

And Arizona has also had one of the highest weekly rates of new COVID-19 deaths in the country, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days).

During the first wave of the pandemic, Arizona also briefly topped the nation and the world for its COVID-19 case rate.

A second surge of illness is normal for the course of pandemic, but some critics argue it was not inevitable for Arizona to lead the nation in case rates for most of the past month. Known COVID-19 deaths in Arizona as of Friday had eclipsed 13,000.

Why Arizona has led the country during the latter part of the latest U.S. surge? Here are seven possible reasons: [https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2021/02/01/why-arizona-is-worst-nationwide-us-rate-new-coronavirus-cases/4281247001/](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2021/02/01/why-arizona-is-worst-nationwide-us-rate-new-coronavirus-cases/4281247001/)",,,1612208146,,{},gln02sv,True,t3_labvl7,False,True,t3_labvl7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/labvl7/why_is_arizona_worst_for_covid19_nationwide_here/gln02sv/,1612520303.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fortunately vaccines are much safer and effective.

Stopping the circulation of the virus is important as much as stopping deaths and hospitalisation.

In fact, if the virus keeps to circulate, we will see more and more variants. Moreover the vaccine is an evolutionary pressure, as Darwin could teach, so these variants will emerge even faster and “stronger” in term of “vaccine-escaping”. So we will see many variants in the next years that will escape the current vaccines; yes there will be for sure new vaccines, but we can’t always run behind the virus, we have to be one step forward.
So it’s really important stopping the circulating if we don’t want to be at the beginning of this nightmare every few years. 

Viral vector vaccines are a good “bridge” solution for limiting the damage until we will have a full availability of better vaccines. But they will contribute to make new variants which will escape from current rna vaccines too.


Note: also a slow vaccination program can help escaping variants.

[],,ganner,,,[],,,,text,t2_63y5x,False,False,[],"Part of the problem is that you're casually throwing out words that have precise scientific definitions in an imprecise manner. What does ""in the family of"" mean when you say ""SARS-CoV-2 is not in the 'family' of these other viruses?"" Clearly not taxonomical family, since all coronaviruses are in the same taxonomical family. It's a vague statement that lets you move the goalposts to wherever you want them to be later.

You're right that we have not been exposed to a ""SARS coronavirus"" on a large scale, but you're now making a very specific distinction that goes much much finer than ""in the same family."" [Yes, a coronavirus from subgroup B of the genus betacoronavirus has never been widespread.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Phylogenetic_tree_of_coronaviruses.jpg) But plenty of other viruses from the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, including others from the genus betacoronavirus, have been widespread. These are similar viruses, and there is scientific inquiry into whether these viruses, when they crossed over into human populations, were the cause of past epidemics similar to what we're experiencing now.

Coming back to flu, covid is NOT worse than influenza. Influenza as we encounter it has just been around a long time and our bodies are used to dealing with it. Novel influenza viruses have caused pandemics similar to and worse than this one. But they spread through the population, kill a lot of people, and the rest of our bodies get used to fighting them. Even when they mutate, they're still *similar* enough that our bodies are better at fighting them than they were at fighting the novel virus. The 4 endemic human coronaviruses may have behaved similarly - really bad when they first pop up, fading in importance after the whole human population has been exposed.

There's simply no basis for speculating that this is going to behave differently than every other viral disease like this we know of. It's baseless fearmongering to speculate that once the majority of humanity has antibodies for this, through natural infection or through vaccination, that mutant variants are going to keep killing people on a large scale like this.

&gt; Unexpected dosing deviation

&gt;AstraZeneca attributed the surprise deviation in trial dosing (ie, the half-dose/standard dose regimen) in the 1,367-participant subset to a manufacturing error in the quantification methods used between batches, resulting in some vials having 50% less vaccine than the others.

&gt;Why this regimen would be much more effective than the intended dose has not been explained, although the researchers have theorized that the lower first dose more closely mimicked that of an infection, while other experts saying that it could have been the result of the different size and type of participants in the subgroup.

&gt;The subset receiving the lower first dose didn't include participants older than 55 years—who tend to mount a weaker immune response than their younger counterparts—because the different dosage was given early in the trial, before older adults were recruited.

Some people are going to be very hard to convince.

Have you ever convinced someone from Buffalo to root for the Patriots? 

&gt;What percentage of people who believe in conspiracy theories do you believe are like this?

There is a fuzzy line that delineates the vaccine hesitant from anti-vaxxers. Looking at the data for vaccination rates as compared to vaccine hesitancy-- a lot of people who are vaccine hesitant are getting vaccinated. 

A lot of people have just heard some things positive and negative are don't know which to believe. I've run into a lot of people who said something to the effect that ""I heard this vaccine was developed faster than normal, I want a vaccine, but I don't want one that's rushed!"" 

Usually I can discuss the vaccine development process with those people and convince them. The people who are hard core and tend to go to protests, and actively post on discussion groups is ultimately relatively small.

They literally are producing so much vaccine that they've identified the doses per bottle (the fill stage) is causing bottlenecks - this is well known as a bottleneck across multiple manufacturers. It's what other manufacturers are helping with.

""[Moderna](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MRNA) has asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for permission to fill its Covid-19 vaccine vials with up to five additional doses to ease a bottleneck in manufacturing, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The change would allow Moderna to put 15 doses in the same size vials now cleared to hold 10, alleviating pressure on the part of the manufacturing process known as fill/finish, said the person, who declined to be named because the application isn’t yet public.

The bottleneck isn’t the vials themselves, according to the person familiar, it’s the manufacturing capacity to fill the vials. The fill/finish process in manufacturing must be done under aseptic conditions to assure no contamination, and capacity is at a premium.

Companies have begun to strike manufacturing partnerships focused on this step in the process to increase output.
