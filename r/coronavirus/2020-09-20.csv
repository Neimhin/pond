[],,PunnyCatapult,,,,,,[],"Hi! So actually I have been on 4 flights in the last month and have a pre-existing condition so I wore an N-95 mask throughout my airport and flight experience (and still quarantined for 14 days after). I did a lot of research beforehand and it’s not likely on the flights themselves where you can get Covid because airplanes filter the air in cabin aircraft at least 20-30x an hour (please see the Bloomberg article on this research). Additionally, a lot of airlines try to seat people apart. My hesitation is the airports themselves, which remain crowded but everyone is still required to wear masks and usually on the move to get to their gate. The only thing I would’ve planned differently is to wear a face shield or goggles or something to protect the eyes but that’s just cause I am a complete germaphobe nut. 

Additionally, “exposed” is a vague term. If someone with Covid walks into a grocery store at the same time as me, does that mean I have been exposed? Likely yes, but since we were both, say, wearing face masks and only momentarily within 6 ft of each other and the infected person didn’t cough or sneeze or talk during that time, I’d say your chances of catching Covid are less than 1% despite being “exposed”. 

These are just the educated and informed conclusions I drew based on my own knowledge.

Anything that happened before they were born, often anything that happened when they were children, does not register as “this is life”. Life is what is experienced right now, this year. Maybe last year.

When one looks at human history from a slightly wider perspective, considering even as brief a time-span as a century, one will find that epidemics happened relatively often among humans. Take polio for example: by 1910, frequent polio epidemics became regular events throughout the developed world primarily in cities during the summer months. At its peak in the 1940s and 1950s, polio would paralyze or kill over half a million people worldwide every year.

The fear and the collective response to these epidemics would give rise to extraordinary public reaction and mobilization spurring the development of new methods to prevent and treat the disease and revolutionizing medical philanthropy. Although the development of two polio vaccines has eliminated poliomyelitis in all but three countries (Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria).
What happened before will likely happen again: a disease will emerge, everyone will be scared but humans will mobilize, invent new forms of therapy, new medication, a new vaccine and, eventually, the disease will be managed and controlled.

There have been many studies that television makes us more intelligent.  Try watching any of the old black and white tv shows.  They are incredibly slow.  At least some of our ability to rapidly absorb information and think critically about it comes from our media consumption.

The comments about Fluoride are bull.  I have gone deep into the studies on this topic and my father in law is a dentist.  In very high quantities in the water supply it has effected children’s brain development.  But those studies were on many many multiples of what is put in the water supply in the U.S.  My town’s water doesn’t have fluoride.  My kids take fluoride vitamins daily.

Some of these things about masks may be true.  I have also thought about how my son might be learning less at school because everyone is wearing masks.

But this grand conspiracy theory is just a conspiracy theory.  The point of a mask is to limit the viral load of virus, both what you might breath in and what you might exhale.  In fact, breathing in only a small amount of virus because you are wearing a mask could allow you to get the virus without the high viral load that could kill you, allowing you to develops antibodies based in limited exposure.

We are in a pandemic.  Quit with the conspiracy theories and protect your family and your community.  Wear your damn mask and protect yourself and those you care about.

What?  No.  Definitely not.  The number of tests means almost nothing without accounting for population, distribution of testing, and accompanying protocols.

Ok, let’s imagine a country with a population of 1000 people, and they’re able to test their entire population weekly for 26 weeks (26 tests per capita). That would be an enormous amount of testing for this population, and would certainly be enough to annihilate the virus if implemented with appropriate travel restrictions and quarantine protocols.  But the absolute number of tests is only 26,000. 

Contrast that with a country of, let’s say 330 million people.  They manage to complete 100 million tests in 26 weeks (wow big number!) but that’s still only 0.3 tests per capita.  Also, a substantial number of those tests are from frequently testing and retesting government staff and certain populations (hospital staff, etc) that are at high risk of exposure.  So the majority of the population has never been tested at all, many people spread the virus before they know that they’re sick (if ever), and after 6 months 200,000 people have died so far with no end in sight.

I am suggesting that it is a question of capacity to perform its necessary functions--not how jam-packed it is with people. A school doesn't look very crowded except during class changes. If they are coming by EMT, there won't that many cars. Without visitors, they'll be half as many cars (or fewer) as normal. My local hospital has been difficult to find parking; until COVID--because no visitors and people are doing electronic visits.

There are times when multiple local hospitals are so over capacity that they can't offload their patients somewhere else. That was happening in Houston in July. It happened in NY earlier this year. Parts of CA are sending patients over 100 miles away. They are trying to prevent that kind of overload. If that happens--it is too late. Everything to try to keep the load under control has failed. When they are that overwhelmed, people aren't standing in line. They are leaving to go somewhere else on their own or dispatch isn't sending ambulances there. It won't look like Black Friday or a summer blockbuster at the cinema.

As-is, many communities do not have a lot of ""extra"" hospital beds. They were ""busy"" before Corona. Some were so deficient ACA rules made them expand or modernize. Almost every hospital near me was expanding prior to COVID. Sometimes ER wait times can be 4-8 hours, depending on your condition and beds. Corona is happening on top of all of the other normal medical needs of the community; and by being infectious, it takes much more space and testing.  You can stack injuries and certain kinds of cases in rooms or even hallways. You can't do that with transmissible diseases; especially around elderly people or people with chronic health conditions, who are the most likely to come into a hospital. Even if two random people come in with a broken arms, you can't assume that they don't have COVID.

I've been in a hospital that was locked down because of a suspected shooter. There were zero people in the hallways. The hospital was still very busy. 

People are fighting for their life. Hospitals are doing a lot of it with inadequate resources and insufficient personnel. Stays are taking longer than they need be because of lab delays.

And if people don't want to be infected, they are free to continue practicing social distaning, wearing masks etc. and get vaccinated. I won't. People who don't want to get vaccinated I have no sympathy for, if they don't want to be infected, they'll get a vaccine as soon as they can.

Since then, testing has been routed through dozens of intermediary private businesses, as far as I've seen, and results in some improvement, but there's basically nothing coming from the Governer's office about strategy and deployment or where the fastest routes are between centers and results.


Some labs are over capacity and can't get any state or federal help, and others are basically twittling their thumbs because they built up capacity earlier in the year but haven't had tests directed to them.

I heard on NPR (can't find the article at the moment) that labs with capacity to test hundreds of thousands daily are basically just empty at the moment because no one is sending them tests:  hospitals, local jurisdictions, and federal mandates are all routing them elsewhere due to previous arrangements. There's no one at the federal level overseeing anything so nothing gets done.

It can still take more than a week to get your test results back at this point. Sometimes it's a day, sometimes it's seven. It's a hodge-podge clusterfuck of administrative hot potato.

The Pandemic is based on this Test and its entirely possible, that the number of Covid deaths are inflated, because of the Test.

Besides that, the PCR Test is not suited to diagnose, does not say whether someone is infected, infectious, and is no indicator for hospitalizations or deaths.

Here is an example from the past:

You know, deaths doesnt happen instantly....
It takes time for the initial hit to spread.
This is an issue, because we could not have a lockdown...

&gt;Based on actual statistics.

No...

&gt;It's almost as though Finland's lockdown prevented all those deaths.

Maybe it did, was stuill not an option for Sweden...

&gt;Just fyi, 2019 being less than 90k doesn't matter because excess deaths are not counted against 2019 only. It uses the average of the past 10 years, which means your 'under morality' argument isn't a relevant factor.

&gt;[(92k*9) + (89k)]/10 = 91.7k. The average death count that the excess deaths are being counted against is no where close to your 2019 numbers for 'under mortality' to be anything but a trivial factor.

If we have a a few thousand deaths less one year, one could assume that we will have a higher deathtoll next year...

&gt;When did I say that New Zealand's economy was hit less hard? Again, if I did, you're free to quote me and I'll admit to being wrong. Why can't you?

You're going on about a lockdown not hurtig the economy, why has the UK dropped 20% Q2, they had a lockdown.

&gt;Even your links show that both are relatively similar, albeit slightly higher for Sweden. It's also a difference that's smaller than the difference in GDP losses in Q2 2020.

Could it be that Finland has a more redundant economy (i dont know), because have clearly seen that having a lockdown hurt ones economy.
Look at italy, spain, UK etc. They have taken massive economics hits, because they had a lockdown.

&gt;That being said, none of the data you're linked comes close to showing that a lockdown damages the economy. So really, what's your point?

It does, Finland is obviously a outlier.
Otherwise when you look at nation who have had a lockdown you'll clearly see that a lockdown hurt their economy 

&gt;You're using trade in services which actually involves domestic trade and is irrelevant.

&gt;Let's use the actual breakdown from 2019:

Internal trade is not hurt, foreign trade is hurt in a trade stop.
Why is that so hard to understand? XD

&gt;They all rely on their service industry on similar levels. New Zealand, whose tourism sector makes up a bigger % of its service industry, should be the hardest hit. We see this trend reflected in the GDP drop in Q2 2020. Again, you're deflecting from the main point - how exactly do these figures show that lockdowns hurt the economy?

Because people can't work...
If you can't make/sell stuff you can't earn any money...
Are you saying that the UK, italy or spain made it out fine?
They didnt....

&gt;As with every other disease, it would still be a COVID death with those factors listed as co-morbidities. That's how it's counted in every part of the world and Sweden isn't some outlier.

Yes, and Sweden obvious have over counted because we couldn't test to a large extent....

&gt;Source for this? I know your health agency frequently adjusts the numbers, quite often downwards, to be more accurate.

Haha
And you complain when i make statments xD
Sweden havent adjusted numbers.
Seems you have a bone to pick with Sweden? Have a Swede hurt you before?

https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/tegnell-pandemin-kan-paga-i-tva-ar-till/

&gt;Who's saying it's the same? The study isn't wrong, but your interpretation of why that 70% doesn't count as a COVID death is wrong. I've given you a link to explain why that is.

That's why im saying we should not throw stones and make idiotic statments before the pandemic is over and everyone have done their adjustments when all the facts are in...

&gt;Do you make the same complaints when people use Sweden as a comparison of why lockdowns don't work? I'm just clarifying the misinformation about them. 

Again, Sweden didnt have the option to do a lockdown...
And lockdowns obviously work, the question is how effective they really are...

&gt;Lockdowns don't damage your economy. They only temporarily restrict your movements, but many post-lockdown countries can and have enjoyed the same, if not more, freedoms than countries that didn't do so. They also absolute work at minimizing cases/deaths (NY is a very good example), but they have to be followed up with a population that complies with social distancing guidelines and/or mask mandates. Which part of this do you disagree with?

So telling people that they can't work is not hurtig the economy?...
What loopy world so you live in.

I mean, we are free to do whatever we want in Sweden so that statment that you're more free seems odd...

&gt;Sweden didn't lockdown and has to deal with the fact that it caused them to have higher cases/deaths per capita. On the other hand, the social distancing requirements were enforced well, and that has helped contained their outbreak. Good for your country for that, but I don't agree that Sweden's strategy could have worked in most countries because we've seen how non-compliant a larger segment of their population are with following social distancing or wearing masks.

Again, we didnt have the option.
Unless our goverment would have made a coup and rewritten our constitution...
Why are you ignoring this fact.

That that is a fact supported only by fairy wishes and delusion is *my* point. 

As well as the point your mind apprently rejects and ignores. That while young, healthy people may *survive* infection at high rates, that doesn't say anything about the rate of other potential outcomes beyond death and survival. Or what the longterm consequences of even an asymptomatic infection today might be on a healthy, young body may emerge in a year, or 5, or 20.

You don't have any clue if this virus may damage young people's DNA in a way that any kids they concieve in the future will be deformed. Or if it might damage your hearts in a way that won't become apparent for a decade. Or damage your brains so you are far more likely to develop dementia or alzheimers when you're 40. Or if it might make young people more susceptible to flu complications, which hit young people especially hard last year by itself.

You have no clue, because no one does yet. We're still focused entirely on keeping people alive and stopping it spreading to healthy people. Cleaning up it's mess is going to secondary until that happens.

Assuming this Novel virus is ""basicly the flu"" because some orange idiot said so and not something young people need be concerned with, is not just a faksehood that has already sickened, maimed and killed human beings needlessly,  but it's an utter lie that can only be swallowed by those who desperately want it to true to the point if complete self-delusion.

Also, you do know that young people who do get it can pass it to others at higher risk? And are more likely to be an asymptomatic superspreader and infect huge populations of people?

So earlier in the interview he says we should assume the vaccine is only effective in 75% of the cases.  Then he goes on the talk about how we will still have to wear masks for several years and a lot of people -in fact **25%**  of people will still get moderately to severely ill with covid even after the vaccine has been administered . But he's making completely unsupported assumptions. 

First, he assumes that everyone in that 25% group for whom the vaccine isn't effective will actually contact covid. Thats simply not true. there is zero data to suggest that. Even now (the vast majority of Americans have not caught covid-even though its not hindered by a vaccine-and post vaccine the risk of exposure will be significantly less than today if we have 75% (his number) of our people' immune' and therefore not 'carriers'  who could infect that 25%.  There is zero data or logic supporting this point.

Then he assumes that the people within that 25% will necessarily get a moderate to severe case-why? Most people dont get a moderate to severe case. Most people get a mild case.  Why would he assume that all of the people in that subset would get at last a moderate case.  And although we dont know about covid yet there is some reason to speculate that if you have had a vaccine but still get covid you will have a milder case.

We are the ""richest"" and ""most powerful"" country in the world according to our rulers and yet every country in the world is dusting us on this. They had 24hr test results in SK in April. We don't and its nearly October.

Why? Because our government, at all levels, is incompetant.

* We have labs all over the country, many with capacity on a given day, but is there a national organization load balacing tests to the right places, handling logistics and planning to ensure every lab runs at 100% capacity? No.

* Do you know we have a law authorizing the president to mandate factories alter their production lines in a time of crisis. Trump has invoked it hundreds of times for defense contractors but **not fucking once for covid.**

* We have been at this for 6 months now, has the federal government brought any labs online? No, they rely on the private sector. Tell me, why as a private business would you invest in expensive PCR machines which take years to pay off for an event that will be gone (dear god I hope) in 8 months. You wouldn't, so they don't. Is the government giving them grants to online more machines? No.

* Is the government providing contact tracers to every community to prevent 50 cases a day from becoming 500 cases a day, and thus at an untracable level. At a local level, some places. At a national level? No.

* Is the government even actively providing free tests? Sorta, and its complicated. Yet its not in every other modern country. They had drive up tests in SK in April. We still don't have free, easy to use, drive up tests in my community. I had to stick the fucking thing up my own nose, and I'm sure I did a fantastic job as I tried not to gag.

None of this has to be this way. None of it. But our politicians are fucking dogshit and our media spends more time focusing polling numbers than focusing on 200k dead fucking bodies. This is a 9/11 almost daily and its not even the number one headline each day. ""Today 2000 more people died of covid and the president* still doesn't have a strategy."" Should lead every news program every fucking day.

In any sort of manufacturing, you don't make a lot of items under speculation.  There are a few companies who are making X amount of vaccines, because they have been ordered by the government, under the speculation that most will be approved.  So it's not the private companies who are speculating at the sales.  It's the government.  Private companies can't take that risk. 

But we know that there is demand out there for trillions of doses in the world.  Once a company gets their vaccine approved, they know they can produce a lot more, because it is so likely that they will be sold and profitable.  

So basically, my idea is that these companies aren't going to spend millions and millions of dollars making 100 or 200 million doses, that may have to be thrown out.  But they likely have a plan to ramp up production quickly once they know they can sell 100s of millions of doses.  Also, keep in mind, they are competing with other companies.

[],,SatsumaSeller,,,,,,[],"&gt; and how could it have been over? New Zealand showed us that no matter how hard and long you lockdown you can't erradicate the virus, it's only possible with a vaccine. 

Until the vaccine comes, though, you can buy yourself a lot of time by locking down. NZ went over 100 days without a single new case. That’s over three months of economic activity that didn’t have to be restricted. And the latest outbreak is looking fairly under control.

&gt; The only viable strategy which is now clear is Sweden's they've just recorded their lowest rate of cases even though they're testing more than ever

You mean the Sweden with the [eleventh-highest death rate per capita of any nation](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants)? 574 deaths per million? That Sweden? Yeah definitely sounds like their strategy worked...

&gt; Sweden, Belarus, Japan, South Korea never had a lockdown, they didn't collapse.

“Never had a lockdown” is a bit reductive in some of those cases, and several have fatality rates many times that of New Zealand.

&gt; My home Switzerland opened up back in May and we're absolutely fine.

238 deaths per million people (compared to 5 for New Zealand) doesn’t sound “fine”. But I guess as long as businesses are still making lots of money it’s ok.

&gt; Besides how are you going to get infected if you isolate and keep your distance? Are you saying masks and social distancing don't work?

They only work if enough of the population make the effort.

&gt; To the hundreds of thousands of people will die, have you ever had a look at the studies regarding the fatality of Covid?

200,000 people are dead in the US already. 961,000 worldwide.

&gt; your own institution the CDC

I’m a kiwi, btw.

&gt; The median of people dying in the US is 79 years.

Is that meant to be reassuring?

&gt; we get 184'000-380'000 deaths which is a way too low number to destroy your economy for.

You can prevent most of those deaths without destroying the economy, as places like New Zealand have demonstrated.

&gt;

&gt; Eradication of COVID is not happening. Anyone who thinks it is is misinformed.

So clearly, your point at that time, as much as you had one, was that Spanish flu HAS been functionally eradicated (""evolved into something else and ceased to exist""), but that somehow it's a totally different story with COVID.

But now you're insisting that we DIDN'T eradicate Spanish flu, and blaming the mix-up on my reading comprehension? Overlooking how you blatantly ontradicted yourself, your present argument:

&gt; Because we didn't eradicate Spanish Flu, which you'd know if you'd read my comment for content. The descendants of Spanish Flu are still in circulation.

...is about as ridiculous as me claiming you need to lock your doors because of all the dinosaurs outside, because I saw a chickadee. For any reasonable purpose of our discussion, Spanish flu was ""eradicated"", just like the dinosaurs (cassowaries notwithstanding!).

I'll end by noting that my understanding is that Spanish flu was at least as transmissible as COVID, and had more hosts per capita. And you've still given me no reason to believe we should expect to be less successful against the latter than the former, in the long run.

[],,the_latest_greatest,,,,,,[],"It's what my Vietnamese friends tell me when I visit them. And the air from when fields burn is bad, same as California. But same-same in Cambodia, and they aren't burning fields like that there. In Phnom Penh, it's also beauty and then, some pollution from construction. 

But Vietnamese wear them SO much more than Cambodians, and also, Thai don't wear them much at all (maybe some Americans don't catch this because they see Asian tourists and think they are also Thai, dunno), and I've never seen a single person wear them in Myanmar (which is hazy) or in Laos, where I've been a whole bunch and which is my favorite place of all. Even on the back of a motorcycle, on a dusty rust red red up a mountain, I've never seen masks worn in Laos. 

Didn't see them a whole lot in Japan when I was there in summer. Snapped photos all over on the trains, and nope, if I shared them, you'd see almost no one in a mask. Ditto Taiwan. I've been to Taiwan for like, a day, two days, six times now. People are chewing betel nut and spitting red. They aren't usually wearing masks unless ill. 

I saw them in Hong Kong much more. More than in Japan in summer. I assume the pollution. 

I am personally a fan of masks on some level. My immune system is shot from having had cancer, so I will always gladly wear a mask to avoid getting sick on planes. I categorically don't expect other people to wear them though to keep me from getting ill. If I thought that way, I'd have to get mad at every single student coughing through every single class for decades now, giving me yet another flu, even though I had the flu shot (which is apparently pretty ineffective -- I get the shot diligently and get the flu just as diligently -- getting my flu shot this week with full knowledge I will likely get the flu again this year because I've managed four substantive colds already while seeing zero human beings because I'm staying home 100% due to work right now and have left the house 2x since late July and only live with a partner who orders in food; otherwise, I mainly eat what I grow in my garden plus we have a hefty pantry, well-stocked). 

I just am mystified every time someone says ""Asians wear masks!"" Well yes, it's like, they do, but there are no such thing as ""Asians."" There are people from countries in Asia, and all have very different cultures, and each culture looks at wearing masks differently, so homogenizing it to ""Asians wear masks!"" is touchy and a little... I don't want to use the word, but yeah, it's problematic. All ""Asians"" are not the same, all do not wear masks, and probably none are on the Red-Blue spectrum of American politics either. 

Sorry to ramble! I'm falling asleep. 

You'd think there would be more sunscreen in Vietnam if skin was the concern? It's hard to buy, except the lightening one, and even that's hard to buy, like, outside of Hanoi, Hoi An, Halong Bay, DaNang, and Ho Chi Minh City. I'd love to go back again. Inland is best.

Compare that to Canada's CERB payment, which, to date, are 77.99 billion CAD (~59.16 billion USD).    

It doesn't keep up with the population difference, but it does come close.    
We have 9.09 times your population.    
We have spent 7.27 times the amount (and, as mentioned, that's actually in addition to standard state unemployment.)

&gt; I went into the wrong building at first since they were both labeled suite 101 and I wasn't paying enough attention.

&gt; Anyway, this place was super crowded, broken A/C on a hot summer day, there were kids screaming, I heard someone asking about her 9:15 appointment ETA at 10:30, pretty much everyone was a minority, and likely poor, people were waiting outside in 100+ degree heat because it was so crowded inside.

&gt; They were probably there for free tests or other care, COVID or not.

&gt; I then walked across the street to the building where I had an appointment. Everyone was friendly, not crowded at all, A/C was working. Even though I was 15 minutes late due to going to the wrong building, I only had to wait about 5 minutes. I paid $99. $99 shouldn't be that big a deal for most people, but it is. I've read stories about car lines miles long for a free COVID test, sitting in 100-110 degree sun, baking for hours.

&gt; And I got my results back within 12 hours. For most people, it goes into a system where they can only test half the results each day, creating a massive backlog (at least from what I've read, it probably varies from town to town).

It might be a coincidence but we don’t know, and seriously anyone at the developer claiming that they know for sure that it’s not related must be lying.

Sweden's big spike was in late May. The data is easily accessible to you. The incubation isn't 3 months.

&gt;No... How did you come to that twisted conclution? Finland got hit less hard because they didnt have a large portion of the population out and traveling in februari...

Based on actual statistics.

&gt;Makes the comparison less relevant, not more relevant. You can't compare two increadibly flawed data sources... Compare deaths per capita and you'll see that Finland ha där breeze compared to Sweden.

It's almost as though Finland's lockdown prevented all those deaths.

&gt;I did.

Already disproven.

&gt;Our average deaths per year is a bit over 90,000... Therefor when we have less than 90,000 deaths per year we have under mortality...

Just fyi, 2019 being less than 90k doesn't matter because excess deaths are not counted against 2019 only. It uses the average of the past 10 years, which means your 'under morality' argument isn't a relevant factor.

[(92k*9) + (89k)]/10 = 91.7k. The average death count that the excess deaths are being counted against is no where close to your 2019 numbers for 'under mortality' to be anything but a trivial factor.

How is this hard for you to understand?

&gt;Why are you spouting shit about new Zealand being hit less hard then?...

I said New Zealand had far fewer cases/deaths.

When did I say that New Zealand's economy was hit less hard? Again, if I did, you're free to quote me and I'll admit to being wrong. Why can't you?

&gt;Yeah... No... https://tradingeconomics.com/finland/trade-in-services-percent-of-gdp-wb-data.html https://tradingeconomics.com/sweden/trade-in-services-percent-of-gdp-wb-data.html

Even your links show that both are relatively similar, albeit slightly higher for Sweden. It's also a difference that's smaller than the difference in GDP losses in Q2 2020.

That being said, none of the data you're linked comes close to showing that a lockdown damages the economy. So really, what's your point?

&gt;Sweden clearly have a larger (not much larger) trade of services than Finland and a much larger then new Zealand (percentage wise).

You're using trade in services which actually involves domestic trade and is irrelevant.

Let's use the actual breakdown from 2019:

https://www.statista.com/statistics/375611/sweden-gdp-distribution-across-economic-sectors/

https://www.statista.com/statistics/375601/new-zealand-gdp-distribution-across-economic-sectors/

https://www.statista.com/statistics/327513/share-of-economic-sectors-in-the-gdp-in-finland/

They all rely on their service industry on similar levels. New Zealand, whose tourism sector makes up a bigger % of its service industry, should be the hardest hit. We see this trend reflected in the GDP drop in Q2 2020. Again, you're deflecting from the main point - how exactly do these figures show that lockdowns hurt the economy?

&gt;If someone is on their deathbed and happen have covid in their system when they pass, does the person die from covid or the casues that put them in this situation, age, cancer etc?

As with **every other disease**, it would still be a COVID death with those factors listed as co-morbidities. That's how it's counted in every part of the world and Sweden isn't some outlier.

&gt;No our goverment have made it clear that counting it this way (over counting) is the propper way to do it untill we can finalize a propper report once this pandemic is ""over"". Our helath authority speculates that this will likely be some time early 2022.

Source for this? I know your health agency frequently adjusts the numbers, quite often downwards, to be more accurate.

&gt;You should know that a conspiracy from social media isnt exactly the same as a paper/study from a local health authority.... Thinking so is beyond ludicrous.

Who's saying it's the same? The study isn't wrong, but your interpretation of why that 70% doesn't count as a COVID death is wrong. I've given you a link to explain why that is.

&gt;But comparing Sweden to its neighbours or New Zealand is just short sighted, none of the Swedish neighbours had the same options as of a lockdown or how we were hit in the beginning. And new Zealand is a small island country in the middle of nowhere. No wonder they managed this pandemic as good as they have done.

Do you make the same complaints when people use Sweden as a comparison of why lockdowns don't work? I'm just clarifying the misinformation about them. 

Lockdowns don't damage your economy. They only temporarily restrict your movements, but many post-lockdown countries can and have enjoyed the same, if not more, freedoms than countries that didn't do so. They also absolute work at minimizing cases/deaths (NY is a very good example), but they have to be followed up with a population that complies with social distancing guidelines and/or mask mandates. Which part of this do you disagree with?

Sweden didn't lockdown and has to deal with the fact that it caused them to have higher cases/deaths per capita. On the other hand, the social distancing requirements were enforced well, and that has helped contained their outbreak. Good for your country for that, but I don't agree that Sweden's strategy could have worked in most countries because we've seen how non-compliant a larger segment of their population are with following social distancing or wearing masks.",,,1600682719,{},g631s4i,False,t3_iw3hwv,False,True,t1_g630cux,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iw3hwv/they_sacrificed_the_elderly_how_covid19_spread_in/g631s4i/,1600752792,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_c4wiu,False,False,,,

There may very well be a common link between TM and MS given that infections can also cause MS flare-ups (= new inflammation and a new lesion). That's why it's for example not recommended to give live or live-attenuated vaccines to people with MS.

&gt; Clotting is normally a good thing. When a blood vessel is injured, cell fragments called platelets rush to plug the leak. Proteins in the blood called clotting factors switch from dormant to active states in a chain reaction, and build a fibrous mesh. As Covid-19 patients filled hospital wards, it became apparent that their clotting was more frequent, more widespread and more severe than in other infections. Clots filled needles used to draw blood, or the tubing connecting patients to medication drips and machines. Clotting can lead to problems such as breathing difficulties, heart attack, stroke and death.

The University of São Paulo (USP) confirmed one of them, which occurred in a patient from Ribeirão Preto, in the interior of São Paulo. The data were published this week in an international scientific journal.

&gt;Infectologist Fernando Bellissimo is the coordinator of the research carried out by the institution's Faculty of Medicine. On CNN , he explained that the cause of reinfection following unknown, as it may indicate mutation of the virus or something related to the immune system of the infected.

&gt;""In this second phase of the research, we are studying the immunity of these people to see if they reinfected themselves because the virus mutated and tricked their immune system, or if the immune system did not react sufficiently before the first infection and, therefore, would be getting infected now, ""he said.

&gt;Bellissimo said there are indications that some people, even if exposed to the virus, do not have a robust antibody production and may remain susceptible to the new coronavirus.

&gt;The patient who had the case of reinfection confirmed by USP had an interval of 38 days between the appearance of the first symptoms and their return after the new exposure to the virus. In both cases, the infectologist pointed out, the person tested positive on the PCR test.

&gt;""In the other cases, it has been around 45 to 60 days, apparently it is the most common time between one episode and another [the return of symptoms],"" said Bellissimo.

&gt;The doctor said it was not yet possible to say whether Covid-19 reinfection could have more severe symptoms or more serious consequences for the patient.

&gt;""In the case of this patient, she had more intense symptoms the second time than in the first, but it was not serious at any time. A case published by a hospital in Ceará documented that a patient had a moderate form the second time. In another case , in the United States, the patient died. That is, it is not yet possible to draw a general picture because we do not know.

Not sure if it was the smartest move to go to be honest, but if cases are low and you have a P3/n95/kn95 mask, I think the risk would be minimum, especially if you go early and don't plan on not eating anything.

I really do feel bad for the cinema industry, they did there best to make everyone safe, but honestly the best thing to would be banning people eating, so they don't take there masks off. Also, they should sell kn95/n95 masks if possible.

## ABSTRACT

**Background** The COVID-19 pandemic is an enormous threat for healthcare systems and economies worldwide that urgently demands effective preventive and therapeutic strategies. Unlike the development of vaccines and new drugs specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2, repurposing of approved or clinically tested drugs can provide an immediate solution.

**Methods** We applied a novel computational approach to search among approved and clinically tested drugs from the DrugBank database. Candidates were selected based on Shannon entropy homology and predefined activity profiles of three small molecules with proven anti-SARS-CoV activity and a published data set. Antiviral activity of a predicted drug, azelastine, was tested *in vitro* in SARS-CoV-2 infection assays with Vero E6 monkey kidney epithelial cells and reconstituted human nasal tissue. The effect on viral replication was assessed by quantification of viral genomes by droplet digital PCR.

**Findings** The computational approach with four independent queries identified major drug families, most often and in overlapping fashion anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, anti-histamine and neuroactive drugs. Azelastine, an histamine 1 receptor-blocker, was predicted in multiple screens, and based on its attractive safety profile and availability in nasal formulation, was selected for experimental testing. Azelastine significantly reduced cytopathic effect and SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of ∼6 μM both in a preventive and treatment setting. Furthermore, azelastine in a commercially available nasal spray tested at 5-fold dilution was highly potent in inhibiting viral propagation in SARS-CoV-2 infected reconstituted human nasal tissue.

**Interpretations** Azelastine, an anti-histamine, available in nasal sprays developed against allergic rhinitis may be considered as a topical prevention or treatment of nasal colonization with SARS-CoV-2. As such, it could be useful in reducing viral spread and prophylaxis of COVID-19. Ultimately, its potential benefit should be proven in clinical studies.",,,1600645774,{},g61p5tx,True,t3_iwp6r8,False,False,t3_iwp6r8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iwp6r8/the_antihistamine_azelastine_identified_by/g61p5tx/,1600726637,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,,

&gt;It’s too early to know how long antibodies will persist in patients recovering from COVID-19. However, in both mild and severe disease, antibodies specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus lack certain hallmarks characteristically seen in antibodies that lead to long-lived immune responses. We sought to understand why antibodies in COVID-19 may lack the same durability.

&gt;One unique feature of our study is that we examined both the blood of COVID-19 patients, and the specific sites in the body where immune responses are initiated.

&gt;**The SARS-CoV-2 virus disrupts the memory-making process by preventing the development of the T cells that help B cells form germinal centers. If the body cannot form germinal centers, it cannot create the memory B cells that remember how to fight the disease.**

&gt;We believe that the culprit is likely the COVID-19 cytokine storms—large influxes of immune signaling molecules that can disrupt the immune system’s normal processes.

&gt;As a result, if a person is infected for a second time, the immune system may not remember how best to fight it, leading to “immune amnesia.” This unusual phenomenon vastly reduces the chances of developing robust and long-lived herd immunity after natural infection.

&gt;If we relied on natural infection alone to clear this virus in the population at large, there would likely be some immunity in recovered patients for a few months but there could be a chance of reinfection in perhaps six months or a year later. We have studied this phenomenon in most detail in severe COVID-19 infections, but so far there is no evidence that mild infections create memory B cells.

&gt;  
&gt;with applicable state or local law. Additionally, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic  
&gt;  
&gt;Security (CARES) Act (CARES Act Section 18115) and its implementation guidance require every  
&gt;  
&gt;laboratory to report every test it performs to detect SARS-CoV-2 or to diagnose a possible case  
&gt;  
&gt;of COVID-19 (e.g., viral, serology). On June 4, 2020, additional HHS guidance was issued that  
&gt;  
&gt;required specific data elements to be collected and reported. Under the new guidance, testing  
&gt;  
&gt;data should be sent to state health departments, which will then deidentify the data and report

We had a few days of no community transmission back in around June. Then Melbourne (in the state of Victoria) had a second wave (partly because they failed to contract trace properly and partly because people weren't following the rules properly). The virus spread over state borders but right now, it's only really two states (NSW and Victoria) that have any community transmission (Queensland has almost eliminated it for the second time).

NSW is using a strategy of suppression and contract tracing but case numbers are very low. Victoria is aiming for elimination. They were averaging over 400 cases a day (some days were over 700) in early August and the whole state was locked down for 6 weeks. It's only Melbourne that's still locked down.

### Summary

**What is already known about this topic?**

Residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are at risk for severe COVID-19. Facility-wide testing, even in the absence of a reported COVID-19 case, can identify asymptomatic and presymptomatic infection in LTCFs.

**What is added by this report?**

LTCFs in which testing was conducted after a confirmed case of COVID-19 were found to have significantly higher proportions of infected residents and staff members at initial testing and after 4 weeks of follow-up compared with those testing as a preventive measure. The majority of LTCFs testing as a preventive measure identified an infection, although initial prevalence was significantly lower and fewer cases occurred during follow-up.

**What are the implications for public health practice?**

Proactive testing of LTCF residents and staff members might prevent large COVID-19 outbreaks in LTCFs through early identification and timely infection prevention and control response.",,,1600660699,{},g62e2mm,True,t3_iwt341,False,True,t3_iwt341,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iwt341/preventing_covid19_outbreaks_in_longterm_care/g62e2mm/,1600740460,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,,

Go fucking do something about it, Bill. Clearly yelling about it on TV is just keeping the image of you relevant.

  


Instead of funneling cash through your foundation to continue accruing massive tax benefits, why not just directly help people in the smallest town next to you? Make sure every kid in the town has access to education, healthcare and a real future. Pay the parents to complete online classwork to be better parents and give incentives for people to follow all the guidelines.

  


Hell, pick the smallest county in Washington and only give these benefits for the people that live there as of the day you announce this.

  


It'd be an almost minuscule amount of your money, you could offload 90% of the duties to an employee and you'd do more good for the world than you getting on TV and just pointing out again, what we're ALL angry about. That'd be..2,256 people in Garfield county as of 2013, people whose futures you'd almost certainly permanently improve.

  


Did you know if you gave every resident in Kelso 100k this year, itd cost you less than 12 million dollars?

  


Your yearly income is speculated at around 4 billion. So about 0.3% of what you're estimated to make this year. You could literally pay off the debt of an entire town, take care of all their housing needs and likely short term medical needs. You could even make it come with requirements of financial classes, basic metrics to help ensure lasting change, etc. And with access to any of the best minds on the planet, you can come up with better long term solutions than I can, I'm sure of it

  


So why do you keep yammering on media? I'm done listening. If you want my attention, go and do something.

&gt; Three scenarios can occur if a person is vaccinated with two versions of vaccines against the same disease, particularly close in time:

&gt; * They get a stronger immune response. An example of this was when children got inactivated polio vaccine and later got oral polio vaccine.    
&gt; * The second vaccine causes immunity that would be similar to receiving a second dose of the original vaccine. Using a different brand of hepatitis B vaccine for one or more doses would be an example of this.    
&gt; * The immune response generated by the first vaccine interferes with components of the response to the second vaccine, in some cases causing lower immunity.  For example, when people got a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) followed by a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine with a harmless helper protein attached to it, called pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), they had lower antibody responses to one part of the PCV vaccine than people who got the two vaccines in the opposite order (PCV followed by PPSV).

&gt; For these reasons, studies will need to be done to determine the effects of getting a second type of COVID-19 vaccine shortly after receiving a different one.

Biology is complicated... there will be many success stories, along with notable - but hopefully less-frequent - nightmare scenarios.

I don't know the specifics for all the Covid vaccines being rushed, but I can say that many immunosuppressant drugs currently on the market do cause cancer.  Humira is a good example, since it inhibits a biological process that regulates cellular apoptosis.. aka, killing of cells like cancerous growths (Humira targets Tumor Necrosis Factor.. TNF).

I know... Humira isn't a vaccine, but the mechanism is similar to some therapeutics.  And it's why patients are frequently monitored for health issues caused by the drug itself.  BTW, Humira has killed tens of thousands of patients, and is still on the market because it's better than nothing I guess.

Full disclosure: I am pro-vaccine, but anti-rush, although I can understand the need to do so.  That said, there's a reason why EVERY OTHER DRUG takes years to get through human clinical trials.  (sorry for yelling briefly)

Also worth mentioning, SARS 1 is related to this story.  Vaccine trials were under-way, but the pandemic ended, so the work was halted.

Here are some proof:

Tegnell in Aftonbladet March 15:

""However, we are beginning to reach an understanding that the virus will not stop spreading until we reach herd immunity.  But it must be done calmly, slowly and in a controlled manner so that the healthcare system has time to deal with it, we must not rush it.""

Tegnell in Aftonbladet March 16:

""Anders Tegnell praises British idea of ​​herd immunity: 'Where we need to go'""

Tegnell in Aftonbladet February 1:

""- My feeling is that this will be close to a common flu in danger and duration.""

Tegnell in Expressen February 21:

""It is not far from ordinary flu,"" thinks Anders Tegnell.

Tegnell in Norwegian public service TV April 17:

Sweden's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell says that there are many indications that they will achieve flock immunity against the corona in Stockholm during May.


And not Tegnell desperately tries to defend his failed herd immunity strategy by even citing Ivor ""The Fat Emperor"" Cummings and the dry tinder hypothesis. Ridicilous.

And BTW: I am Swedish and have been following this closely here from inside Sweden. Ten times as many deaths as our neighbors are nothing but a failure but the lasting problem might be all the Swedish long haulers who does not recover fully from Covid.

Personally I wouldn't encourage anyone to fly for any reason unless they can guarantee they won't remove their properly fitting KN95 masks even for a moment to drink water. Pretty hard to do when the shortest flights are from here to CA and take 5ish hours in time actually on the plane. On our inter-island (20-40 minute) flights they serve everyone drinks which results in most of the plane having masks off at the same time. They allow non-masks on passengers, including face shields, nose out, poor seal, and bandanas on our main airline, which is crazy to me. 

However, some are comfortable with such risks. Pre-testing will eliminate some, but not all actively infectious passengers. Given that, and that recently Hawaii has been one of the worst off states, it means 100 random passengers would have fewer infectious people than 100 random residents. Our residents have done a perfectly good job of spreading it out of control since July, which resulted in a 2nd shelter in place order on the main island with 70% of the population, where most tourists go anyway, and after a few weeks of that we're seeing major drops in new cases and the positive rate.

We have the highest unemployment in the nation and the highest cost of living and virtually no economic activity outside of military, government, and tourism. 1/3 of all employees lost their jobs in March and very few have returned. I got laid off for the first time in my 35 years of working and my husband is also out of work, both due to COVID, as is virtually everyone we know. 

The only downside is that those who don't get a negative test within 72 hours of their flight, which isn't easy in many places, are supposed to quarantine 100% for 14 days and very few have actually done that in the past 6 months and there is virtually no monitoring of that nor contact tracing.

When I started therapy I looked into the differences of both, and yeah Cognitive Therapy has a lot of good studies to show it works, but apparently it only works fo a few months for some people.

If it worked for you that's awesome, but it has helped me so much because I didn't know why I was feeling bad or what was going on.

At the end of the day, our issues may be super complex and harder to understand than we think, and unraveling them can take a lot of time.

At least for me, identify and analyzing all those thoughts and feelings has helped me a lot (and I'm not paying thousands of dollars cause I don't live in the US, so that's good too)

And it's not just analyzing where they started, is analyzing everything about them, how they have evolved and how they affect you, and how they make you do or think things that make you feel bad.

Globally, people die of air pollution at a higher rate than covid. We don’t shut down the world for those people because that would have a far larger negative effect than not doing anything about the air pollution. I’d argue that the same is true of lockdown. It is estimated that the lockdowns have thrust [100 million](https://apnews.com/727c2dea29daed6e226b964f8caadfcf) people worldwide into extreme poverty. A decade of progress on this issue has been lost. Poverty is the cause of many deaths as well because people living under it are not able to afford proper healthcare and sanitation. Here in the US, the wealth and educational gap between the upper class and lower class has risen. The shutdowns primarily affected jobs being done by lower class people and the children of these people have fallen behind in their education. Wealthy children can afford private tutors and it’s easier for them to attend online school meeting. This is not the case for lower class children. [Here’s](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-13/online-learning-fails-low-income-students-covid-19-left-behind-project%3f_amp=true) an article on this topic.

It’s estimated that current K-12 students can expect to make [3% less](https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2020-09-14/report-coronavirus-school-closures-could-cost-us-economy-14-trillion) over the course of their lifetimes due to educational disruption by the lockdowns. Keep in mind that this percentage will be higher for lower income students. The effect of educational disruption alone on the US economy is expected to be 14 trillion dollars. [60% ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/yelp-60-coronavirus-businesses-closures-permanent.amp) of the businesses that have closed for covid are to close permanently. This will put numerous people out of jobs and have a massive ripple effect on the economy. 

I support mask mandates and some mitigation measures, such as isolation of the elderly and immunocompromised. Will we have more deaths due to covid than if we locked everything down? Most likely, but it will be manageable. Sweden didn’t lock down and their death rate was higher than their neighbors but they never overwhelmed their neighbors and their economy wasn’t as hard hit as the other countries in Europe.

Thailand went the same way in attempting to eliminate cases and now their tourist industry (20% of GDP) is in shambles and their government has no real exit plan to remove such tight restrictions and open international borders. Though one might argue Australia is much less reliant on international travel than Thailand, of course. 

I understand the want to manage and reduce cases but elimination at any cost necessary seems like an extremely short sighted and lazy strategy. Focus on the numbers and on nothing else seems to cause more problems because it means you are forced to close borders indefinitely with no solution to opening them and keeping the case numbers low. 

Completely understand the desire to keep low case counts but elimination as a goal seems really bad strategy for any country that wants any form of open travel in the future. Management and just keeping hospitals running well seems much more optimal from a political strategy perspective (not necessarily considering the morals of allowing more people to die since this is kind of separate from political policy when it comes to economic crisis management).

[What causes Acute Kidney Tubular Necrosis?](https://www.healthline.com/health/acute-tubular-necrosis#symptoms)

From the weblink:

* *The most common cause of ATN is* ***a lack of oxygen reaching the cells of  your kidneys***\*. If blood can’t reach your kidneys due to a blockage or decreased flow, your kidneys can be damaged or destroyed.\*
* ***Harmful substances in your blood*** *can also damage tubules. Toxins may change the way cells in the tubules function.*
* *Certain chemicals and medications such as* ***antibiotics, anesthetics, and radiology dyes*** *may cause ATN, if your body reacts negatively to them.*

From the weblink:

* *Glomerulonephritis: An* ***overactive immune system*** *may attack the kidney, causing inflammation and some damage.*
* *Chronic renal failure: A permanent partial loss of how well your kidneys work.* ***Diabetes and high blood pressure*** *are the most common causes.*

* *Hypertensive nephropathy: Kidney damage caused by* ***high blood pressure***\*. Chronic renal failure may eventually result.\*

China's goal has been always to cut off entirely as much as possible transmission routes of the virus. And the virus will not infect anyone without anyone for it to infect. Hence the slogan, ""stay home, starve the virus"". Hence the entire Chinese society shut down in late Jan - early Feb, and everyone who travelled from Hubei or even across provincial boundaries were strongly urged to self-quarantine for 14 days and support systems were set up across China to help them with groceries and rubbish, etc. Hence the internal border checks and refusals of unjustified entry in many parts of China during that time. Hence the ""closed community"" approach. The plan has always been to block all possible routes of any new transmissions while taking care of those already infected. This is why the entirety of Hubei had a city-by-city border closure, and why contact tracing has been done to incredible detail. Once the virus runs its course in people it's already infected, we'd be safe from the threat of it infecting any more people.

Also, this is far from a government-led event. It's pretty much common sense for most Chinese people that they wouldn't want to live in a society where a SARS-like epidemic runs rampant. So most people takes care of themselves and there were massive efforts online and offline to inform people of important (technical) information, such as what masks work how or how long the virus lasts where or how the virus may be killed or what cases have been where &amp; when, and to persuade people (especially friends and family members) to take all necessary precautions such as masking and disinfection.

&gt;Yeah, so stop making excuses. Finland was also hit just as hard at the start of March, yet they never let it get as bad.

No...
How did you come to that twisted conclution?
Finland got hit less hard because they didnt have a large portion of the population out and traveling in februari...

&gt;Finland only rolled out nationwide testing in April after their lockdown. Again, this is an irrelevant excuse.

Makes the comparison less relevant, not more relevant.
You can't compare two increadibly flawed data sources...
Compare deaths per capita and you'll see that Finland ha där breeze compared to Sweden.

&gt;Again, give an official source for this. Stop making unsubstantiated claims.

I did.

&gt;Sorry, but I have to question your intelligence here.

&gt;Do you understand that they didn't compare all deaths in 2019 to all deaths in 2020? They combined all reported yearly deaths from 2009-2019 then averaged it out before comparing it to 2020. This means your 'under morality' theory is largely irrelevant because the excess deaths numbers from 2020 is not simply derived from being counted against the low death total in 2019 alone.

Our average deaths per year is a bit over 90,000...
Therefor when we have less than 90,000 deaths per year we have under mortality...

&gt;I've always said New Zealand's was 12.2%. Where have I said otherwise?

Why are you spouting shit about new Zealand being hit less hard then?...

&gt;You do realize that the service industry comprises a bigger % of Finland's GDP than it does Sweden's, right? Why do you keep spreading misinformation despite already being given sources that contradict your claims?

Yeah... No...

&gt;NY, with its much bigger spike, was able to contain their outbreak in the same timeframe as Sweden. Do you think they could have achieved that without a lockdown?

Maybe, provavly not.

Again, lockdown was never an option for the Swedish goverment...

&gt;Stop being disingenuous - lockdowns work effectively at the job they were meant to - to flatten a curve or prevent an explosion of cases. Social distancing and masks are far more important at actually keeping the outbreak under control. The idea that a single measure is the end all and be all is a false narrative that no one's pushing.

Yeah sure, they obviously work.
Again, not an option for Sweden...

&gt;Uh, New Zealand is more reliant on its service (especially tourism) industry than Sweden. So is Finland. What's your excuse now?

Obviously not, because your trade in services way less than Swedens...

https://tradingeconomics.com/new-zealand/trade-in-services-percent-of-gdp-wb-data.html

&gt;Right, because oil is the only goods relevant in industrial trade. Oh wait, it isn't.

&gt;Sweden: agriculture: 1.6% industry: 33% services: 65.4%

&gt;Finland: agriculture: 2.7% industry: 28.2% services: 69.1%

&gt;Were you born yesterday?

Internal services is irrlevant when we're discussing a trade stop...

Trade of services % of GDP is relevant, nothing else....

https://tradingeconomics.com/sweden/trade-in-services-percent-of-gdp-wb-data.html

Sweden clearly have a larger (not much larger) trade of services than Finland and a much larger then new Zealand (percentage wise).

&gt;15% the direct cause, *70% a contributing cause (which is still counted a COVID death in every country, Sweden included) and 15% deaths non-attributable to COVID.

If someone is on their deathbed and happen have covid in their system when they pass, does the person die from covid or the casues that put them in this situation, age, cancer etc?

&gt;Not sure what your point is. Do you think your government is unaware of this before reporting the number of COVID deaths?

No our goverment have made it clear that counting it this way (over counting) is the propper way to do it untill we can finalize a propper report once this pandemic is ""over"".
Our helath authority speculates that this will likely be some time early 2022.

&gt;*https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-comorbidities.html. Read this before skewing the data involving comorbidities for your biases.

You should know that a conspiracy from social media isnt exactly the same as a paper/study from a local health authority....
Thinking so is beyond ludicrous.

And even putting the Swedish goverment at the same level of trust as the current US goverment is beyond ludicrous, atleast in regards how we report data and trust...

I get it that new Zealand have done a good job, they obviously have.
But comparing Sweden to its neighbours or New Zealand is just short sighted, none of the Swedish neighbours had the same options as of a lockdown or how we were hit in the beginning.

3rd trials last for 25 months.  That means that it won't be till Sept 2022, till the trials are completed for the first vaccines.  So obviously vaccines will be given to the general population even before trials are completed.  No one knows when that will be.

I went and was in thyroid storm, it was a terrible experience.  I wanna say that medication you are on was what I was on inbetween diagnosis and the surgery. I had to take like 12 pills 3 times a day or something like that. 

I’ll tell you my experience with the surgery was great. I was out of work for a month but I was honestly fine after a couple weeks.  My surgeon was great and there is barely any scar, and I am sure they have gotten better in the past 15 years. I believe I had to take calcium supplements for a couple months because there is a chance of damage to the parathyroid glands when they remove it, but that didn’t happen to me. 

It took a year or so to get the correct dosage on the synthroid but the symptoms were not  crazy and it was amazing compared to the graves symptoms.  I had to follow up with an endocrinologist for a few years but after the dose was stable for a while they said I could just be followed by my PCP. 

Now i get my levels checked once a year and they adjust it up or down 25mcg some years.  Another plus is the synthroid is only 10 dollars for 3 months at Wal Mart even without insurance. 

The reason they just took it out was because I was 18 at the time and the prognosis was best for my eyes if they just take it out opposed to using radioactive iodine to kill it.

2. This point is valid but doesn't really do anything for testing.

3. These aren't simple machines. They take months to build. The industry leader is Roche, which is a Swiss company. We can't just use Ford's plants to start cranking Cobas 8800s off the assembly line. Additionally, they _have_ to come from Roche if you're using Roche reagents and such. You have to make sure everything is validated, which is a lengthy process, and trying to validate some random ass machine produced by people who don't know what they're doing is a massive gamble, both financially and in terms of accuracy and reliability.

5. You absolutely do not want to inject a bunch of randos into a secure testing facility. For one, they aren't trained and probably would be an active detriment to the scientists for several months. For another, it would create a chain of custody nightmare, and litigation would be a serious problem. 

The issue is that a million tests per day capacity should be fine. If demand exceeds that, the failure is on the population and the fed, state and local governments for prioritizing the wrong things.

&gt;	On 13th January Thailand reported the first case of Coronavirus outside China. On 20th of January Zong Nanshan the scientist named by China to lead the battle against the virus stated ” Now we can say that it is certain that it is a human to human transmission phenomenon”.

&gt;	On January 22 at a meeting to decide the measures to be taken, WHO was not able warn the world of the severity of COVID-19 apparently because of resistance from Beijing. (WHO referred to it as “divergent views”) On January 23 Wuhan city was placed under quarantine and two days later the entire Hubei province was locked down. The Chinese state machinery was harnessed to enforce an unprecedented quarantine on 50 million people across 15 cities. In the last week of January domestic flights from Hubei to other parts of China was stopped and restrictions on traffic movement in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai were initiated. This was the time of the Chinese New Year when offices and schools are normally closed and it is also the prime tourism season for the Chinese. On the 31st January Italy fearing a major outbreak of Coronavirus from hundreds of tourists arriving from China closed all flights to and from China.

&gt;	China’s vice-minister of foreign affairs Qin Gang met Italy’s ambassador to China Luca Ferrari in Beijing following the flight ban. “Italy’s decision to stop flights without contacting China in advance caused great inconvenience to citizens of both countries. Many Chinese are still stranded in Italy,” the foreign ministry said on its website the following day.

&gt;	China’s assertion that all was well for international travel was supported by the WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the opening of the agency’s Executive Board meet on the 3rd February. He said ” There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. We call on all countries to implement decisions that are evidence-based and consistent. WHO stands ready to provide advice to any country that is considering which measures to take,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying criticised the US advisories saying “The U.S. government hasn’t provided any substantial assistance to us, but it was the first to evacuate personnel from its consulate in Wuhan, the first to suggest partial withdrawal of its embassy staff, and the first to impose a comprehensive travel ban on Chinese travellers”",,,1600657151,{},g628ojv,False,t3_iw2csc,False,True,t1_g61l889,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iw2csc/hundreds_of_thousands_have_been_given_chinese/g628ojv/,1600737469,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_9gfwu,False,False,,,

You are clueless. And before you attempt to attack me for insulting you personally, I will remind you that I am merely echoing the language you have chosen to use yourself.  

You are here interjecting your personal uninformed, uneducated and politically motivated opinions on a topic you have just demonstrated you have no understanding of whatsoever.  If you find this assessment personally offensive you are more then welcome to demonstrate otherwise.  

First and foremost you are directly implying that Xi Jinping himself along with the entirety of the Chinese State propaganda apparatus does not know what their mission is.

&gt;“They must love the party, protect the party, and closely align themselves with the party leadership in thought, politics and action,” [Xi told newsroom staff ](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/19/xi-jinping-tours-chinas-top-state-media-outlets-to-boost-loyalty)during a highly choreographed tour of the three outlets last Friday after which he set out his blueprint for the media.  
&gt;  
&gt;In case Xi’s message had been missed, an editorial [in the People’s Daily](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-02/19/c_135114305.htm) informed news reporters their key role was not as speakers of truth to power but “disseminators of the Party’s policies and propositions”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Guiding public opinion for the Party is crucial to governance of the country,” the newspaper said. \[[1](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/28/absolute-loyalty-how-xi-jinping-is-bringing-chinas-media-to-heel)\]

**Summary** 

* The role of media in china is:  “**Love, protect, align** themselves with the party leadership in **thought, politics and action.**
* ***Not*** **speakers of truth to power**
* **Disseminate** Party’s policies and proposition
* **Guide Public opinion.** 

**So XiJinping has just directly refuted your statement.**

We work around the clock but there's only so much we can do to get results out. We have to process and result non-Covid samples as well. It wouldn't be fair for us to just forget about our patients who need HIV or Hep C testing. 

We're pushing so much testing volume through the lab that the automation equipment is being overworked and breaks down at least weekly. Then everything gets backed up as we wait for the machines to be fixed. We have a shortage of almost all of our supplies, especially cleaning supplies and PPE. Our lab is literally overflowing with samples. We've had to find ways to cram them all in somewhere, and literally everywhere you turn is another rack full of Covid samples. There isn't enough room in the main lab to hold everything, so we've had to convert some of our conference rooms into temporary holding space.

We used to pride ourselves on having an 8-12 hour turnaround time for getting test results out to clients, but now we're lucky to get them in 24-48 hours. We shoot for 95% of our tests having an 8-12 hour TAT, but since March, that number has fallen to 72%. Everyone is exhausted and we're all pushed to our limits. I work overnights and more often than not end up putting in overtime to try and get a jump start on things. It's exhausting. All I do in my life right now is work, feed my pets, and sleep. And I have it easy. I don't have kids or family to take care of. 

I promise we're doing the best we can to get your results to you, but its physically impossible to move any faster with the amount of tests we're dealing with. Please please wear a mask when you go out, and continue social distancing and thorough hand washing. Nothing is going to improve until everyone starts doing their part to be responsible and stop the spread. And please have some sympathy for your local healthcare, retail, and food service workers.

Upwards of 200,000 people having lost their lives and apart from weekends still around 1,000 people losing their lives on a daily basis and around 30,000 to 50,000 cases. So, in the United States there is no sign of it being brought under control. That doesn't bring me any pleasure, and I don't see it as some sort of game complete with 'sides', but the fact remains that this virus has caused a lot of damage in the United States and the government/people remain unable to rein it in.

I'm not sure which parts of Europe you're visiting so I can't comment on what you've seen, but it surely can't be England. Here in England, most people are concerned and compliant and most people didn't become complacent. 

We have four problems: a test and trace system that is not fit for purpose, a large minority who don't care and never did (nothing has changed there), a leisure industry on its knees due to the lock down which has led to town and city centre pubs being opened up and allowed to stay open and social distancing being relaxed as the idea was that test and trace could prevent local outbreaks. 

New found complacency among the people doesn't explain what is happening in England at the moment, although we do have a lot of people who are to put it mildly idiotic. One example: I stopped off for a pint in a beer garden on Saturday, it's all outdoor service, they take your order outside, they bring your beer to you outside and you pay outside, I got talking to the landlord who is complying with the recent guidance around different households socialising and numbers of people being able to sit together, he has punters coming in not happy that he is complying with the guidelines because they were able to sit with however many people they wanted wherever they wanted in some pizza place the night before. These are some of the people we're dealing with here: they're like children who don't see that a landlord is trying to keep them safe, they just want to do whatever they want to do regardless of the context.

My response was to a commenter who, rather than address the substance of an argument by providing sources in good faith, instead chose to pivot the conversation in bad faith by injecting an irrelevant red herring. I simply chose to indulge them with a 2 second google search. 

With that said, I think it's worthwhile pointing our why your response is problematic. 

&gt;as if those organizations themselves are not putting forward an agenda of their own?  

""An agenda of their own,"" is *not* the same as carefully structured unadulterated disinformation and information warfare campaigns propagated at the state sponsored level.  And while not condoning their agenda's these are not one in the same and to imply as such is a clear and obvious false equivalency.  Furthermore if they all lack credibility this is simply the destruction of  epistemology to the point where there is no such thing as science, fact, systematic analysis  and we in turn divulge into a sea of mere personal opinions (which is what social media and figures like Trump are indeed a cause of this).

&gt;And to this day still support the Iraq war which killed 500k civilians, based on total lies. 

Attacking the source. Also the supporting ratings provided in response to that comment are widely accepted in the developed democratic world. There are international versions from non-US entities that come to similar conclusions. Also, not everything is about US politics. Also, do a google search, not everything by heritage is in support of the Iraq war. 

&gt; you’re simply trying to distinguish between state and corporate-sourced propaganda.  

Correct. Generally most all forms of propaganda are bad. However some forms, (like state propaganda) are magnitudes worse due to their magnitude, veil of credibility &amp; deniability, funding and end goals. 

&gt; Huge structural differences yes, but in the end it’s all the same. 

No. It is not as clearly explained above. 

&gt;Look what happened to Edward Snowden. Clear consensus said he did us a solid by telling us about govt surveillance, yet the majority of the corporate media agree that he should be prosecuted as a “traitor”. Let me ask you, do you believe Snowden should be prosecuted for being a whistleblower?

This is a Red Herring.

They are different clades and sub-clades of the same strain of SARS-COV-2. If it were producing different stable strains that would truly be a disaster for vaccination. However it isn't doing that, its actually pretty stable. 

The different mutations have been pretty similar, the most important was when Clade S mutated into Clade G (main Euro strain). It became more contagious optimizing its ability to bind to ACE2 receptors. Since then it created Clade GR (main one in US, but we have all G variants) and Clade GS. But all the G variants are pretty similar genetically. 

Its not that people are getting infected by different strains (they are getting infected by different clades, but that's a given) due to being immune to one but not to the other. Immunity gained should give an undetermined level of immunity against all the clades out there, they're very similar genetics. We are seeing reinfections because immune systems aren't perfect, some people don't even have an antibody response (over 90% do). While a lot of research points to tcell memory likely making reinfection unlikely and also likely preventing severe disease of those reinfected, this isn't going to be 100% There will definitely be those infected multiple times, how common it will be is yet to be seen. But you can assume immune systems exposed to the virus will only get better at preventing infections and disease progression. So don't let these reinfection stories make you fear our immune systems being useless against the virus. That's not the case at all, there was never any question that reinfections at some level would occur again. But if we learned anything from SARS-1, its genetic relative, its that these novel coronaviruses induce long term immunity at some level.

[],,ceddya,,,,,,[],"&gt; You know, deaths doesnt happen instantly.... It takes time for the initial hit to spread. This is an issue, because we could not have a lockdown...

Deaths do lag behind cases, but I'm talking about the spike in cases, no deaths. You're talking about a 3.5 month delay between February and your spike in late May. That's just not a valid excuse.

&gt;No...

Yes.

&gt;If we have a a few thousand deaths less one year, one could assume that we will have a higher deathtoll next year...

Yeah, sorry, but are you being intentionally obtuse? The benchmark for your excess deaths in 2020 would be the 91.7k figure, so comparing directly to 2019 would put that excess deaths much higher at (91.7k-89k) + 6k.

&gt;You're going on about a lockdown not hurtig the economy, why has the UK dropped 20% Q2, they had a lockdown.

That's because they weren't decisive about it? Or that they didn't properly implement mask mandates and social distancing guidelines along with the fact that their population might not be as compliant?

It's almost as though there actually exists a direct correlation between how an economy does and how a country handles the outbreak.

&gt;It does, Finland is obviously a outlier. Otherwise when you look at nation who have had a lockdown you'll clearly see that a lockdown hurt their economy

Okay, so how do you explain other countries like South Korea, Hong Kong or even Singapore?

&gt;Because people can't work... If you can't make/sell stuff you can't earn any money... Are you saying that the UK, italy or spain made it out fine? They didnt....

Most people can work from home, which is what those countries did. The manufacturing and agricultural industries were largely exempt from the lockdown. The domestic service and retail sectors were always going to be affected due to travel restrictions globally, lockdown or otherwise.

Do you actually know what a lockdown entails?

&gt;Yes, and Sweden obvious have over counted because we couldn't test to a large extent....

Let's set the record straight: testing on a wide scale **has always** resulted in more cases/deaths detected.

&gt;Haha And you complain when i make statments xD Sweden havent adjusted numbers. Seems you have a bone to pick with Sweden? Have a Swede hurt you before?

'""It's nothing strange. We recently carried out a quality control of our numbers and saw that three deaths should not be counted. They had Covid-19 so long ago that it wasn't the cause of death,"" Theresa Granqvist, press officer for Region Dalarna, told Aftonbladet.'

https://www.thelocal.se/20200807/no-new-coronavirus-deaths-reported-in-sweden

Uh, it's literally in your news? They're already conducting QC for their numbers, so your narrative that the numbers are so inaccurate speaks more about the lack of trust you have in your government.

&gt;https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/tegnell-pandemin-kan-paga-i-tva-ar-till/

How does him saying that it will be 1-2 years before the situation is stabilized even support your narrative?

&gt;That's why im saying we should not throw stones and make idiotic statments before the pandemic is over and everyone have done their adjustments when all the facts are in...

Who's throwing stones? Again, do you just lack the ability to comprehend what is being said? You're making a completely uninformed and idiotic statement about the 15% figure. Clearly your government counts that 70% as COVID deaths even if co-morbidities are involved, or you know, the same thing EVERY other country does.

**Remember that you accused me of lying**. Why can't you back that accusation up? If you can't, then you damn well should be apologizing for your lie.

&gt;So telling people that they can't work is not hurtig the economy?... What loopy world so you live in.

Who's saying that? At its core, the Q2 GDP reports don't show how a lockdown hurts the economy anymore than having an explosion of cases like Sweden's. Do you have actual data to contradict this?

&gt;Again, Sweden didnt have the option to do a lockdown... And lockdowns obviously work, the question is how effective they really are...

The question is also how effective not having a lockdown is, no?

&gt;I mean, we are free to do whatever we want in Sweden so that statment that you're more free seems odd...

Are you uninformed? Finland has basically the same restrictions. NZ actually has looser restrictions - they've mostly been on level 1/2 alerts for the past 4.5 months which means either no restrictions on group sizes for level 1 to a group size limit of 100 for level 2. NZ has also announced that most of the country will be returning to level 1 today. What's the group size limit for Sweden again?

&gt;Again, we didnt have the option. Unless our goverment would have made a coup and rewritten our constitution... Why are you ignoring this fact.

My best friend is a hospital internist. He sent an email back in March warning friends and family that COVID-19 was much more dangerous than the flu, and that we should avoid getting it at all costs.  

As we've learned about the ""long-hauler"" syndrome, his advice has looked better and better. Avoid getting this, because people can be left with permanent organ damage. We still don't know how bad it can be, or why -- but we know some asymptomatic patients can still be left with heart, lung, and neurological damage.  

These people who are advocating herd immunity... that's just fatalism, nihilism, giving up. It's scary to see that in people in the health care field.  My friend says he's not flying on planes until there's a vaccine and most people have received it.  In March he said this disease was going to re-boot society, and that here in the U.S., we're simply not willing to change.  He's become so disillusioned with the response here in the U.S., he's decided to emigrate to Canada.  Maybe that's an arguably healthier way to respond to the poor response here in the U.S.: instead of accepting infection is inevitable, flee to country that actually believes in *following science-based measures* -- like widespread masking.

You're right to avoid this, and making sure your kid avoids it.

[],,Rhodie114,,,,,,[],"A vaccine doesn't guarantee 100% immunity. They aren't perfect shields at the individual level. Where they really excel is at the population level. 

Say you've got a hypothetical disease with an R0 of 4, in other words each infected individual infects on average 4 new individuals. You undertake some precautions like masks, distancing, etc, and you lower the R0 down to 2. The disease is still spreading through the population, but much slower. Now lets say you invent a vaccine that decreases an individuals risk of contracting the disease post-exposure by 75%. That doesn't give me much confidence as an individual. A 25% chance to fail doesn't make for a great mechanism of personal protection. But If you vaccinate the entire population (and good luck with that), and continue distancing, the R0 falls to 0.5. On average, only 1 in 2 infected individuals will go on to infect somebody new. The prevalence of the disease in the population will steadily drop. After a while, everybody can safely go back to normal, not because they're totally immune to the virus, but because their odds of exposure are much lower. 

However, if you relax all your distancing practices as soon as the vaccine is rolled out, the R0 only falls to 1, and the prevalence of the disease holds steady, neither rising nor falling. Your odds of exposure to the virus are the same on the day you're vaccinate as they are 3 months later. Instead of being reasonably certain that you won't be encountering the virus at all, you have to hope that you fall into the 75% of instances where the vaccine prevents an infection, and not the 25% where it doesn't.

Obviously the situation in practice gets much more complicated in reality. But that's the grossly simplified version.

&gt; ###Narrative 2: Sweden has a herd immunity strategy
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;    Now they talk about Sweden, but Sweden is suffering very greatly. You know that, right? Sweden did that, The herd. They call it the herd. Sweden is suffering very very badly, it’s a way of doing it. -Donald Trump [23]
&gt; 
&gt; During this month, several Swedish researchers who disagreed with the government’s approach stated, both in national and international media, that the governments was following a herd immunity strategy. The herd immunity theory also forms a large part of the “Russian Roulette” article, which served as a basis for much of the English-language reporting, and the concept came up in most international reporting [16]. On the 9th of April, Vox published an article with the title and subtitle:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;    Sweden’s government has tried a risky coronavirus strategy. It could backfire. Critics say the government seeks “herd immunity” from the coronavirus. That could lead to more deaths.
&gt; 
&gt; The author tweeted the article with the text: It sure looks like Sweden is trying to achieve #herd immunity.”
&gt; 
&gt; The government and FHM denied multiple times that they were following a herd immunity strategy, with the Foreign Minister Ann Linde discussing this on Swedish television and CNN [2]. The herd immunity rumor has a complicated history. Mathematician Marcus Carlsson forwarded this theory in a series of YouTube videos and Annika Linde, the former state epidemiologist also promoted the theory that FHM’s strategy was based on herd immunity; she did this in a Facebook post which was picked up in the media [5, 24, 25]. State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell also mentioned the term often on television which further led to public confusion [26]. At other times his quotes were taken out of context. In an article in Svenska Dagbladet, which was re-quoted in international media, Tegnell stated that the main strategy was to have a slow transmission of COVID-19 so that the healthcare system could manage, but that herd immunity was “not contradictory” with this. He also said that herd immunity was a “great concept.” [24]
&gt; 
&gt; Part of the herd immunity rumor had to do with how Swedish implementation was described in international media as being drastically different than other countries. Anders Tegnell argued that critics were emphasizing the differences, rather than similarities of the approach [27, 28]. That is, Sweden was also trying to flatten the curve but without draconian measures. The government took this line not in order to promote herd immunity but because they did not think it realistic or healthy “to keep people inside for 4 or 5 months.” [29] That is, the government and FHM considered the level of restrictions put in place in the first month of the pandemic to be sustainable over the long term. Similarly, schools remained open in part because of the negative impact of closure on mental and physical health, and also because it would create a childcare problem, not least for key workers [30].
&gt; 
&gt; There was no evidence that FHM had a “secret” herd immunity plan, and it was never the ‘deliberate strategy’ of the government to ‘let the virus spread its course and spread through the population [31].’It is more accurate to state that there was a hope that some level of herd immunity would be a side effect of the approach, but it was not the main strategy.",,,1600646923,{},g61r3nd,False,t3_iwofrv,False,True,t1_g61l2sq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iwofrv/sweden_tried_herd_immunity_to_deal_with/g61r3nd/,1600727777,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5cxb2,False,False,,,

[],,Rhodie114,,,,,,[],"&gt; Do you get the point I’m try to make?

Yeah. That you view risk as a binary thing and think that so long as somebody accepts one risk they should accept all risks.

I assume you've driven or ridden in a car before, right? Cool. So you'd be alright with some casual Russian Roulette later? After that, the winners can get blasted on some of the local methhead's bathtub moonshine and do some free-climbing down in the quarry. 

There's an unspoken risk vs reward calculation that goes into everything we do. Automobile accidents accounted for 1.5% of all deaths in 2017, so lets say if you choose to drive, you acknowledge that there is a 1.5% chance that you experience a fatal crash at some point in the future. That's the risk. The reward is that you're able to work further from home than you can walk. You can transport far more than you can carry on your back. You can visit people more than a few miles from your house. You can easily travel between cities on your own schedule. Most people who do drive would not be able to live the life they do if they had to stop. Compare that to fully opening up a movie theater to 225 people in an environment where even 1% of the population is infected with a potentially deadly virus. The reward is that 225 people get to see a movie, and the movie theater makes a little money. The risk is a roughly 90% chance that one of the audience members was infected, and the single movie showing sets off a cluster on infections. 

And even when we do accept risks in our daily lives, we take precautions. For cars, we have seatbelts, airbags, crumple zones, and myriad traffic laws.

From the perspective of the healthcare workers, it's 100% logical to limit the number of people who can infect them and the other mothers/babies/patients who are in the hospital. It's not ideal for *anyone* and I know restrictions are annoying, but it's absolutely not security theater or ""being performative"". It's pure math. Fewer potentially infected people entering an enclosed space means fewer opportunities for the virus to spread within it. Our priorities are protecting the health and life of people and that's 100% what they should be even if it means a mother's preferred person isn't standing next to them giving support.

[],,albasili,,,,,,[],"That's a misconception. To understand to which level your number of testing is limiting visibility on the true number of cases, you have to look at percentage of positive vs number of tests. If it's in the few percent it means you are sampling enough people to get the picture, as the percentage starts to rise it means you're population of infected is rising and you have to tighten up the distancing measures (masks, distance, allowed number of people in gatherings, etc.). Increasing testing is not the point, cause more testing will not increase the number of cases, it will simply decrease the percentage of positive which is not what you truly want to do since you may be lured into thinking that the infection is ""receding"".

What Gates defines outrageous is not the amount of testing, but rather the time it takes to get an answer. The more it takes, the more difficult will be to contain the spread, especially if people who are waiting for the results are still going out at work and shopping as if nothing happened. 

&gt;They don't want people to get tests.

This is, again, a piece of a larger puzzle. Tests cost, a lot, and the more you do the more it costs short term so the needs to be a ""return"" that justifies this expenditure, no matter who pays for it. And this is where the strategy of a country may fail or succeed. In federal governments this is a big problem, cause in order to have a central strategy you need to have a coordinated effort, which the U.S. is clearly failing at (and similar examples of lack of coordination are visible elsewhere).

Considering the R0, you can see how several states (and countries in general) are hovering worryingly above 1 and that's an indicator of how ineffective your measures are, or how bad people abide to those measures.

So, the problem is not about testing more, the problem is doing it fast, trace quickly, and enforce measures.

Is Sweden *far lower* than these other 10? Sweden is at 580.74 per million. Adding 25% to that would be 725.93. Only Peru and Belgium are higher.

Italy and Spain were hit early, so didn't know what to expect before it was too late for many of their older people. Sweden (and UK and Belgium) had less of an excuse.

Tangent: why is so much of South America doing so poorly? I figure because the past several months have been late fall and winter in the southern hemisphere.
