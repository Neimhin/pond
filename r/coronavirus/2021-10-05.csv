Not only is that not far-fetched, but it's being done in some other countries. In particular, you can buy a mask like that for a quarter in South Korea. I would urge you to go to YouTube and click on any recently recorded Seoul Walking Tour video (city walking tours is an actual genre on YouTube). You'll see that almost every single person is wearing an n95 mask. It doesn't matter what month it was recorded in, it was made in the last year you're going to see thousands of people wearing high-grade masks.

That's because the ROK
 government got involved early and said, ""If cloth masks are good, n95 masks must be better!"" and they got it done. They started giving those things away like crazy and making them available in literally every store in the country. No one wears a crappy cloth mask if they can avoid it 

In case you're wondering about the quality of their masks, the New York Times recently called Korean n95 masks the gold standard for such masks. 

Now, obviously Trump was never going to take any proactive steps, and to give Biden the benefit of the doubt that he doesn't really deserve, he was probably banking on the idea that the vaccination was going to solve everyone's problems. Korea didn't have that option.

However, I’m also questioning the numbers, because the Governor Memaw made it so every death has to be evaluated to be a confirmed COVID death. I would bet that the above average death rate will be quite larger than what is classified by the state as a COVID death. Also, the deaths take on average 25 days to be reported, then have to go through the review. This will mean that there are the three months left, plus most of last month yet to be added. I would also think that the more rural areas suffered at a disproportionate rate than the urban ones.

This study did not involve Pfizer but the implication would be that at Pfizer dosage, immune response at 6 months should be good.

I believe you're talking about [this study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21\)02183-8/fulltext) that only involved Pfizer. This study that looked at infections as registered positive tests, and the results from the study shared now point to the reading that the observed dip against infection is not due to lower immune response, but other factors. These could include population changes (e.g. immunity in the unvaccinated population is growing naturally, so the difference in immunity levels are changing, which results in apparent change in immunity) or behavioral changes (e.g. fully vaccinated people may be dropping their protective behaviors now in ways that are systematically different to unvaccinated).

Overall, it is incredibly important now to remember that a study about one vaccine does not imply the results with another vaccine would be different, if they did not include those vaccines. This thread is full of people thinking that Moderna with Pfizer dosage working great is bad for Pfizer, where it's the opposite.

[],,danysdragons,,,[],,,,text,t2_36453,False,False,[],"To me, the most important standard for success would be reduction in transmission of the illness. This study doesn't tell us enough to establish that.

The only thing the study seems to tell us is that these high touch, frequently cleaned surfaces didn't show the presence of COVID. To judge whether fanatical surface-cleaning represents a success at reducing *transmission* *of the illness*, we would also need to know:

1. What would the level of fomites be with the use of only normal cleaning procedures (i.e. the level of cleaning that would have been typical pre-pandemic)?
2. Would that level of fomites have posed a significant risk of infection if touched?

There’s actually significant doubt that touching a surface that does have some level of COVID present actually poses a meaningful risk of infection: [https://www.wired.com/story/its-time-to-talk-about-covid-19-and-surfaces-again/](https://www.wired.com/story/its-time-to-talk-about-covid-19-and-surfaces-again/)

&gt;Consider, Wyllie says, the extraordinary chain of events that would need to happen to successfully spread SARS-CoV-2 on a surface. A sufficiently large amount of the virus would need to be sprayed by an infected person onto a surface. The surface would need to be the right kind of material, exposed to the right levels of light, temperature, and humidity so that the virus does not quickly degrade. Then the virus would need to be picked up—which you would most likely do with your hands. But the virus is vulnerable there. (“Enveloped” viruses like SARS-CoV-2 do not fare well on porous surfaces like skin and clothing.) And then it needs to find a way inside you—usually through your nose or your eye—in a concentration big enough to get past your mucosal defenses and establish itself in your cells. The risk, Wyllie concludes, is low. “I’ve not once washed my groceries or disinfected my bags or even thought twice about my mail,” she says.

So yes, it seems likely that what some people deride as ""hygiene theatre"" probably does lead to a very low likelihood of Covid being present on a surface. Whether that's actually a big decrease compared to normal cleaning, and whether that would matter anyways, has not yet been established.

I think the term ""hygiene theatre"" is more than just an expression of skepticism about the value of fanatical surface cleaning. People using the term are often thinking something like: 

&gt;There are all kinds of less conspicuous things a business could do that would be ***very*** effective at reducing the risk of transmission -- most notably improving their *ventilation systems*, given the huge role aerosols play in transmission. But they tend to not bother with these practices since they're not highly conspicuous to customers the way surface cleaning is, and instead focus a lot energy on something that probably produces only a minor benefit at best. They're doing a better job at *looking* safe rather than actually *being* safe.",,,,1633509983,{},hfkzsqa,False,t3_q27v7e,False,False,t1_hfkrxh7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q27v7e/testing_hightouch_surfaces_in_grocery_stores_for/hfkzsqa/,1633637039.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Broadly neutralizing antibodies are an important treatment for individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Antibody-based therapeutics are also essential for pandemic preparedness against future Sarbecovirus outbreaks. Camelid-derived single domain antibodies (VHHs) exhibit potent anti-microbial activity and are being developed as SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody-like therapeutics. Here, we identified VHHs that neutralize both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, including currently circulating variants. We observed that the VHHs bound to a highly conserved epitope in the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein that is difficult to access for human antibodies. Structure-guided molecular modeling, combined with rapid yeast-based prototyping, resulted in an affinity enhanced VHH-human IgG1 Fc fusion molecule with subnanomolar neutralizing activity. This VHH-Fc fusion protein, produced in and purified from cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, controlled SARS-CoV-2 replication in prophylactic and therapeutic settings in mice expressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and in hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2. These data led to affinity-enhanced selection of the VHH, XVR011, a stable anti-COVID-19 biologic that is currently being evaluated in the clinic.",,,,1633530088,{},hflus0d,True,t3_q2lgnm,False,False,t3_q2lgnm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q2lgnm/an_affinityenhanced_broadly_neutralizing_heavy/hflus0d/,1633653869.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has to do with how exposed people have been, how vulnerable people are, and what you're doing.

What will my family do? We'll get together, but wear masks when we're not eating (including N95/Kn95 for anyone older or vulnerable or worried), open the windows, limit exposures in the days before the meal. Tests may be much more widely available then, and we might encourage anyone who's had a lot of exposures (e.g., college kids) to test beforehand. If they're using antigen tests, which are less sensitive, we might encourage them to test several days running up to Thanksgiving. It's really about risks and benefits, and the benefit of this holiday is very high in my family.

However, I haven't been vaccinated with any of the COVID-19 vaccine and would be considered in the vaccine hesitant group.

My question is, how concerned is the scientific community from not knowing the root causes for side effects from the mRNA vaccines like drastic changes to the cycles of women, and not knowing the root cause or even the actual rates of myocarditis in young males?


Sweden and Denmark just paused the distribution of Moderna vaccine to young males because of internal data they have that shows a soke kind of relationship between myocarditis and pericarditis, and I've seen dozens of studies that estimate the rates for these diseases to be 1 in 3000 to 1 in 100,000 in similar populations.

I also understand that there is an increased risk of these conditions that's quite high from actual covid infection.

You can see people not doing what exactly for religious reasons? 

What specifically are you suggesting would make someone “be considered second class”? 

Why would “natural defects such as aging sooner” have any relevance to a person’s social class? 

Some people age quicker than others. There are many reasons why that is (ie: genetic factors, environmental factors, societal factors, cultural factors, economic factors, lifestyle choices, etc.) and the combination of those contributing factors is going to be different for every person. 

What exactly do you mean by “altered ones” vs “regular people” vs “natural ones”? 

Can you explain the difference between an “altered one” and a “natural one”? 

What is an “altered one” altered by/with? 

Why would doctors only be allowed to interact with the poor? 

Are you suggesting, in this bizarre, hypothetical, alternate reality, future-state prediction you’ve cooked up, that only poor people would be getting sick, injured, or otherwise require medical treatment/care from a physician? 

So upper class people will never accidentally trip and break an ankle, or get injured by a vehicle, or fall victim to violence, or suffer from genetic diseases?

Cases were coming in, but Queensland was able to contain them. Though the broader factor that the entire Southeast of the US has been run incompetently is certainly a valid one, but that just shifts the scale to national responses.

And if you want to bring in population density, Brisbane's metropolitan population is 2.6 million; adding in the areas of Queensland accounting for low population isn't relevant for disease transmission if half the population is clustered together in one metropolitan area. So Brisbane alone is larger population than, say, Idaho or West Virignia, and significantly higher population densities than either, and Idaho had 1800 cases yesterday (nearly as many as Queensland's had the whole time), and West Virginia had about 850 yesterday, so slightly less than half. And that's with Brisbane's population density being 160 per sq km, well above West Virginia (29 per sq km) or Idaho (7 per sq km). Alaska's got a population of less than 1, and under 1 million people, yet they have substantially more cases than Queensland, too.

So a lot of US states that are doing poorly have a lot fewer people living close together than Queensland does, and yet they're doing worse.

Their persecution complex, I strongly believe, comes from the fact that their ancestors came in second in a two-country war. 

As for their poverty, they continue to do that to themselves. There are so many positive changes - and I’m not talking incremental shit, I’m talking significant changes - that many southern states could make TODAY. Like, right now. 

Southern states could, collectively, have 10,000,000 more of their citizens insured within a month. Probably sooner. Wouldn’t even be difficult. But they won’t do it. They could reduce maternal and infant mortality, where they absolutely lead the nation, significantly. And they won’t freaking do it.

Correct.

The CDC answers your question here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html

&gt;Do any of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States shed or release any of their components?

&gt;**No.** Vaccine shedding is the term used to describe the release or discharge of any of the vaccine components in or outside of the body. Vaccine shedding can only occur when a vaccine contains a weakened version of the virus. None of the vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. contain a live virus. mRNA and viral vector vaccines are the two types of currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines available.",,,,1633471174,{},hfj61cu,False,t3_pol10r,False,True,t1_hfj2ew9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pol10r/daily_discussion_thread_september_15_2021/hfj61cu/,1633600235.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,ddman9998,,,[],,,,text,t2_2imfewja,False,False,[],"This isn't quite right, actually.

Even if previous infection gave ZERO protection against reinfection, the reinfection numbers would be dramatically lower than infection levels.

&gt;North Carolina has had over 1.4 million cases of covid, and 10,812 of them have been reinfections.

The population of  NC is 10.5 million.  So, over the entire pandemic, there have been 1.4 million confirmed infections out of 10.5 million people since March 2020.

For reinfections, you have to have already been infected.  So that's a bit under 11k infections out of 1.4M people.  And it's actually lower than 1.4 million people because of the passage of time (see below).  But even without taking time into consideration, if 13% of people have been infected since the start of the pandemic, then reinfections (if it was at the same rate) would be 13% of 13%, and again, that's BEFORE considering how the passage of time factors into this with means that even with zero immunity from reinfections, we would expect the number to be even lower still.

1. Possible reinfections have had a shorter time frame than initial infections. Reinfections obviously don't go all the way back to March 2020, because you have to have been infected and then reinfection 90 days later.  The time difference is further exacerbated by a few things:

a) A portion of those 1.4M people have had it so recently that there isn't even technically enough time for a reinfection to count in these numbers (you have to have 90+ days between positive tests).  Anyone who got infected in the recent wave counts in that 1.4M number, but can't even in theory count for that 11k number.

b) Immunity wears off over time.

* The earliest infections were when there was less testing. That impacts both numbers, but likely disproportionately reinfections compared to infections because of the time factor;
* A LOT of people have been infected fairly recently, like over the last two waves. But people infected that late would have less chance of a reinfection due to there being less time for immunity to wear off.
* Most people who have been infected are infected during large waves. There is at least 1 fewer wave in which you could have been reinfected compared to infected, because you have to have had it before and that was likely during a wave.
* Reinfections would be most likely later in the pandemic than earlier. The ratio of  reinfections to infections would be lower early on, but later on we have had vaccines to prevent the ratio from going up.

1. A lot of cases are asymptomatic or so light that people don't get tested.  If one of the two times a person was infected falls under that, then they wouldn't count as reinfected but could STILL count as infected once so some reinfections actually make the infection/reinfection ratio look like fewer relative reinfections (if they didn't get tested one of the times).",,,,1633483062,{},hfjuv35,False,t3_q21f2q,False,False,t1_hfig1kg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q21f2q/nc_reports_10000_reinfected_with_coronavirus/hfjuv35/,1633613159.0,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My experience at my place of work, food production, describing entire staff:

1 person has had 3 different 1+ day rashes on fingers, separated by weeks, each described similar to touching stinging nettles... He went to doctor today, doctor said vast surplus of histamines and prescribed antihistamines... some sort of allergic reaction. 2 covid vaccine shots, never had covid

1 person had some sort of reaction to normal soap at work that only seemed to start after her vaccine shots, brought her own soap, *seemed more sensitive to spice after*\* 2 covid vaccination shots, never had covid

1 person *seemed more sensitive to spice after*\*  2 covid vaccination shots, then got covid (caught from weekend with friends), never at worked  after that (fell behind at university so not doing planned part time).

1 person - 2 covid shots, no evidence of any allergy problems, never got covid.

1 person - 0 covid shots, no evidence of any allergy problems, never got covid.

\**they seemed to sneeze more and much more likely wear big masks with double filters/cartridges when making even milder spices after covid shots, but that observation may be biased/subjective.*

Obviously with such small data sets, both the story above and my our experience at work, hard to draw conclusions, both are boosted by a bias to only talk about unusual situations and ignore situations where nothing is wrong.

&gt; Multiples studies show that covid-19 is especially deadly for recipients of kidney transplants. Weaver said the mortality rate observed for transplant patients who develop covid-19 ranges from about 20 percent to more than 30 percent — far higher than the 1.6 percent fatality rate observed generally in the United States.

&gt; “An organ transplant is a unique surgery that leads to a lifetime of specialized management to ensure an organ is not rejected, which can lead to serious complications, the need for a subsequent transplant surgery, or even death,” Weaver wrote in an email. “Physicians must consider the short- and long-term health risks for patients as they consider whether to recommend an organ transplant.”

&gt; Living donors could also pass a coronavirus infection to an organ recipient, threatening the patient’s life, Weaver said.

In other words, there are concerns that a transplant would be unduly risky for an unvaccinated person.

Presumably, these concerns would remain even for someone who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons, so it isn’t about enforcing compliance. It’s fundamentally a risk assessment issue.

Yes. The principle applies. This is an easy call to make, if you weigh the greater good and assuming safety and lack of side-affects.

However, it is a slippery slope. E.g., would this principle justify euthanasia,  incarceration or exclusion of people that are more likely to propogate disease, whether genetically or because they were infected? Think lepers.

TBF, I suspect that societies will always seek to defend themselves from these risks. It is more an attribute of societies and their respect for human rights than a principle.

&gt;When my daughter returned to school this fall, I sent a care package that was perfect for a college student living through a pandemic. It included cookies, a coffee mug — and a pulse oximeter.

&gt;A pulse oximeter is a small device that clips on your finger and measures your blood oxygen levels. Even though my daughter and her friends are all vaccinated against Covid-19, I wanted her to have the device handy just in case she got a breakthrough infection.

&gt;Many people first learned about a pulse oximeter in the early days of the pandemic, after doctors warned that some patients with Covid-19 develop a form of oxygen deprivation called “silent hypoxia,” which occurs when blood oxygen levels drop so slowly that a patient doesn’t notice anything is wrong. Often these patients are so ill by the time they get to the hospital that they need to be put on a ventilator.

&gt;New research from South Africa shows that using a pulse oximeter to check oxygen levels after a Covid diagnosis really does save lives. For the study, 8,115 high-risk patients were given a pulse oximeter to use at home after Covid-19 was diagnosed. The study focused on the highest-risk patients, including older people, those who were pregnant or those with chronic illnesses like heart disease, hypertension or diabetes.

&gt;After a Covid diagnosis, the patients were given a pulse oximeter and received a follow-up call to make sure they were using it correctly. They were asked to record their oxygen saturation and heart rate twice a day, and instructed to call a doctor if the reading started to drop below 95 percent.

&gt;If the reading fell below 90 percent, they were instructed to go to the emergency room. And all the patients were told to seek emergency care if they had difficulty breathing, regardless of the number on the device.

&gt;The study group was then compared with about 30,000 patients in the general population who were seen by doctors across the country between March and October of 2020. During the study period, 544 people (out of 38,660 patients) died from Covid-19, including 49 in the study group.

&gt;But the risk of dying was 52 percent lower among the patients who had been instructed to monitor their oxygen at home. Based on the overall mortality rate, it was expected that 95 people in the study group would have died. But using a pulse oximeter appears to have saved the lives of 46 people.

&gt;”I think it’s important to know that a pulse oximeter makes a difference,” said Shirley Collie, an author of the new study and chief health analytics actuary at Discovery Health, a large managed care administrator in South Africa. “You’re monitoring your oxygen because the timing of when you get to the hospital makes a huge difference on your clinical outcome.”

&gt;The magnitude of the benefit startled even some of the staunchest supporters of home oxygen monitoring. Dr. Richard Levitan, an emergency room doctor who sounded the alarm about silent hypoxia in a guest essay for The Times, called the findings “astounding.”

&gt;”It’s exceedingly rare in medicine to show such a huge difference in treatment, particularly with such a complicated disease,” said Dr. Levitan, who practices at Littleton Regional Healthcare in New Hampshire. “All of this happened with different management, in different hospitals, while the pandemic was unfolding. To have a 50 percent mortality difference is phenomenal. We almost never see a benefit as large as that.”

&gt;Vaccinations likely prevented some 265,000 infections, 107,000 hospitalizations and 39,000 deaths of Medicare beneficiaries from the virus in the first five months of this year, according to the research released Tuesday that used individual claims and county vaccination rates to estimate the impact to the country’s 62.7 million recipients.

&gt;The study, which used a sample of 25.3 million people, found reductions in deaths nationally, for all racial and ethnic groups, and across all 48 states — though the biggest impact of the shots appeared to be for American Indians and Alaska Natives, groups that were particularly hard hit by the pandemic.

&gt;In Georgia, where vaccination rates were the lowest in the country at the end of May, vaccines had still reduced infections by 290, hospitalizations by 120 and deaths by 40 per 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries, the study estimates. In Rhode Island, where vaccination rates were among the highest in the country, vaccines prevented 440 infections, 170 hospitalizations, and 70 deaths per 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries in the state.",,,,1633516502,{},hfl6vaz,True,t3_q2hovq,False,False,t3_q2hovq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q2hovq/covid19_live_updates_vaccines_likely_kept_100000/hfl6vaz/,1633641053.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My grade-school-level understanding is that the mRNA vaccines contain mRNA ""plans"" that cause your body to produce the spike proteins that coronaviruses use to invade your cells.

Your immune system then develops a response that's effective against those spike proteins, and thus against the coronaviruses that use them, without ever encountering any real coronavirus.

That immune response is the reason the vaccine can make you feel sick. Naturally, the immune response is stronger after the second dose of the two-dose vaccines, which is why so many people report that the second dose feels so much worse. (It sure was for me.)

And the fact that the vaccine contains no actual virus at all is the reason that, unlike older vaccines that are based on ""inactivated"" viruses, it should be completely impossible to acquire a coronavirus infection from an mRNA vaccine.

1. Anywhere I have ever been to with a mask mandate during this round of mask mandates did not only make you wear a mask. Even though businesses were just required to enforce masks, that did not actually happen in practice. Many voluntarily reduced hours, closed dressing rooms, limited capacity a bit or maybe reduced bar seating etc. All when they were not required to do that. I can’t vouch for every situation but that has been my experience. I am sure others has different experiences on that.

2. If you let your mask mandate lose public buy in, you have lost your teeth for any future mask mandates you might need. I saw this in Kentucky and I saw this in my home state for the cities that had one last year. Now those places haven’t even bothered implementing another one. The Northeast and other similar areas did not experience this last year as most people made the right choice and complied all through 2020. But I am already hearing anecdotal reports on here that this is no longer the case. 

Also I am pro mask when they are needed (during high transmission and low vaccinated areas like schools) and definitely pro vaccine!

The boosters are a safety precaution as Delta broke through and this vaccine was modeled on Alpha Covid. They're being very careful.

It's been shown via data that Covid immunity after infection is not only notoriously low amount of antibodies in most people (compared to other infections) but that by the 6-7 month point (so already vaccine has 4 months + on that), the antibodies are almost gone if not undetectable. A fair amount of Covid survivors HAVE LITTLE TO NO ANTIBODIES even immediately after infection. See also: the incidence of covid re-infection, which is rather common, unfortunately.

The vaccine may weaken after 10+ months in terms of circulating antibodies (data is still not available in large quantities for this so it could be longer) but the immune response is stronger, more reliable, and lasts longer than infection immunity. With a booster, this immunity rises again to very strong levels. The vaxx is so new, data is not readily available on how long booster immunity will last. Could be years, could be less. Also depends on emerging variants.

Also, vaccination is far preferable and better for your system than covid infection, which can kill or incapacitate you.

Take a look at this from the UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium:

That's very much an ""in a nutshell"" summary. The takeaway, though, is that it's not nearly as straight forward as you're making it sound.

On top of this, OSHA is required to follow a number of procedural rules that would delay this thing so long it wouldn't be practical. For example, they're supposed to have a ""comment period"" when they enact a new protocol where industry, unions, the public, etc. can comment. Then they're supposed to review those comments for X days and respond, and so forth.

&gt;
&gt;If we discovered a way (gattaca-style) to make some genetic tweaks that ensured a person would be at a much reduced chance for disease transfer in the future -- would that be okay to mandate (or deny services to that person if they didn't receive the genetic tweak)? 

I agree it's an uncomfortable conversation but that we need to have it now. As much as I hate to say it I've started believing we can no longer afford to push back other treatments and prevention because of unvaccinated covid patients - but the logical extension of that argument is that you need to establish guiding principles so it doesn't get out of hand. 

If something is so established and permanent (i.e.: I do not believe that getting a vaccine/booster every 6 months to 5 years is the same as telling an obese person to lose weight) that it's essentially step 1 of any treatment or prevention, I think it essentially becomes refusing treatment not to get it and it does make sense to put people like that at the back of the line if needed. The analogy I use is that covid is like a natural disaster and the vaccine is the last Coast Guard helicopter. You don't have to take the helicopter, but we will not be able to come back for you. People need their other medical procedures lest we accumulate a backlog of 2+ years of undiagnosed and unprevented illnesses. I already know 3 people with cancer or other serious illnesses which got worse before detection solely because routine appointments and screenings were delayed. This isn't about picking on anti vaxxers, it's that they are displacing people who can't just go get a vaccine for their problems. 

That said, I agree with you that it has to have some kind of limit. If it's an easy, safe, effective treatment and you decline it, I think too bad for you. But as the treatment becomes harder to follow, or less proven, we need to be very aware of not dividing our medical system based on some nebulous idea of merit. Is obesity or alcoholism easily preventable? Depends who you are. What about car accidents? What about accidents from reckless behavior? The good thing is that our healthcare system is essentially already built for a ""normal"" degree of these, but I can see how limited resources and an aging population might force a slow motion version of the same conversation.",,,,1633542000,{},hfmnhki,False,t3_q2ckda,False,True,t1_hfkfxux,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q2ckda/hospital_system_says_it_will_deny_transplants_to/hfmnhki/,1633669018.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/9/21-1042_article - 36% of natural infections do not result in antibodies and therefore do not confer future protection.  Vaccination is consistently more reliable.

https://echo360.org/media/df6327b6-1e39-401e-affb-5220eaedef8e/public - the first ‘myth’ they bust is regarding natural immunity vs vaccination specifically in regards to Delta and directly refutes the exact same study you linked

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/why-measure-effectiveness/breakthrough-cases.html#:~:text=Most%20people%20who%20get%20COVID,“breakthrough%20infection.”  - helps explain why vaccinated people might show “higher” infection rates.  In particular this line “Because vaccines are not 100% effective, as the number of people who are fully vaccinated goes up, the number of vaccine breakthrough infections will also increase”.  This is why I initially thought your study might be making a false assumption which I understand now it wasn’t but it’s not the first time I’ve seen this claim made so I assumed it was the same.

One likely scenario is that we see flares and outbreaks, especially in places like nursing homes, prisons, homeless shelters, and camps, but with vaccines and, to a much lesser degree, treatments, the virus is tamed and doesn't cause nearly the death and destruction it causes now.

I'm absolutely no expert but memory cells come into play when fresh antibodies need to be generated.  My understanding that comes into play after an ""infection"" actually occurs.  In other words this isn't what going to keep you from catching the virus.  This isn't why some are getting boosters.  To stop an infection, you need sky high antibodies already present.  All that said, as far as I understand, this has ramifications on your body generating the antibodies post infection, keeping the infection mild, and keeping you out of the hospital.  As such both Pfizer and Moderna are excellent in that regard.  The edge that we've seen with Moderna is that it simply produces more antibodies, that last longer.  Yet they still wane, just the same.  So if anything it might mean you won't need a booster as often for example.  But this isn't what this headline is about.  Again this is my layman interpretation.

1. Assume you got 2 doses Pfizer, then chose to get a third with Moderna. That's not recommended, but it's understandable.
2. If you're immunosuppressed, especially if you've had an organ transplant, then your protection is much less, both for yourself and for others. A third vaccine probably helps that somewhat, but it doesn't change the reality.
3. If you're around people who are older or immunosuppressed, you can still spread the virus to them, even if you're vaccinated and even if you don't have symptoms, but it's much less likely.
4. In terms of your own safety, unless you're over (we don't know what age, maybe 75 or 80) or have health problems, you're unlikely to get seriously ill from Covid. On the other hand, even ""mild"" Covid is no picnic for many people, and long Covid is a real risk.

Generally speaking, colleges that are requiring masks are in locations where county/state immunity levels aren't high enough (gotta be about 88% for Delta, based on a combination of fully vaxxed and previously infected individuals).

[https://popimmunity.biosci.gatech.edu/](https://popimmunity.biosci.gatech.edu/) might help you make a more informed guess; select an ascertainment bias of 3, and click the fully vaxxed checkbox to get the data that your college is likely working from. 

If you are comfortable sharing, I'm glad to provide a finer-grained guesstimate of overall immunity in your state... maybe list 3 states and I'll share data for each?

If most of that data was gathered during that period of relaxed restrictions (which was before Delta was a concern to most) then it could also be explained by the fact that no one was wearing masks for a while and there were just MORE vaccinated people to be infected by a more contagious version.

Because when its at 37C in the human body, it doesn't *have* to survive hours, it will find and infect a cell in a matter of minutes or less.  In an infection, your cells spit out new virions and they more or less immediately infect another cell.  In transmission, your cells spit out virions that are transferred relatively quickly through droplets or whatever other methods a virus is capable of surviving through, get into someone else's body, and immediately infect it for the same reasons it replicates within your own body; namely ""there are cells here that think they want me so they'll pick me up long before I have a chance to decay"".

While there is definitely a benefit to a virus that survives longer at higher temperatures because it'd increase transmissibility and so you'd think there'd be selection pressure that would make it inevitable, it's probable that coronaviruses never developed that trait because whatever changes necessary for it would come at the cost of some other trait that's far more beneficial to them, such as their ability to masquerade undetected or infiltrate victim cells.",,,,1633542993,{},hfmpvum,False,t3_q2ckda,False,True,t1_hfkvf6s,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q2ckda/hospital_system_says_it_will_deny_transplants_to/hfmpvum/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,4bfa1629d39e4c4b1fefd9607f1cb4f73e40aea6,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1633543006.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Organs are a precious, precious resource, and they have to be given to whoever has the best chance of survival, and of keeping the organ functional. An alcoholic doesn’t get the kidney over someone who quit drinking. An active smoker isn’t getting a lung, and a 400 lbs diabetic that hasn’t shown any sign of lifestyle change isn’t getting a new heart. 

When you get an organ transplant, you’re put on immunosuppressive drugs, so your body is less likely to reject the organ. This makes any infection you acquire much, much more deadly. Flu vaccines, up to date immunization, these were already requirements for most transplant lists.

You can see the impact of Flu Season, if you look closely, and you can also see the impact of social distancing by comparing Flu Season 2019/202 to 2020/2021. Flu Season is from Oct 1 to April 1.

The 2020/2021 flue season is as close as I can easily get numbers for to matching the time frame when the COVID vaccine has been available. Granted, it was not widely available in this time frame, but was available to many at-risk groups. The 2021/2022 flu season will offer a better comparison, but this is the best I can get at this point.

The downside? Slightly lower antibodies and AZ is somewhat less effective against virus that hasn't fused with a cell yet.

In all cases though, the weak point in breakthroughs is that IgA responses to the vaccines are generally weak and IgA is your respiratory system's first line of defence (well... second line.. mucus is the first line).

Their argument for a religious exception is laughable, both the recipient and donor will be taking multiple medications to facilitate the transplant.

&gt; Do you object to that? No rational person would.

Liver transplants for alcoholics actually have fairly good/similar outcomes, source: https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/53/2/157/4774987

Some hospitals will give a liver transplant to someone facing alcohol-related liver failure if there is a willing donor. It's a hospital-by-hospital policy. Many won't give a transplant to a patient unless they've been sober for 6 months. This policy is controversial because of the data that is showing not much difference in prognosis and because many facing alcoholic liver failure won't survive 6 months. My ex lost her brother to this because by the time they found a hospital that didn't have this policy it was too late, even though she was a match for donation and was willing.

Vaccinations are a whole different thing, though. You really should get vaccinated before going on the immunosuppressive drugs that could make the vaccine less effective and make you way more susceptible to bad outcomes in the case of infection. If you're facing death due to organ failure then there's absolutely no reason you would ever avoid getting the vaccine.

-Individuals who had been previously infected 
-Individuals who had been previously infected AND  vaccinated. 
The results are therefore irrelevant in a discussion about the protection provided by vaccination ALONE compared to previous infection ALONE. 

As none of the other sources are comparative studies that look at the protection provided by vaccination or previous infection, with relevant controls for comorbidities etc, they do not provide evidence that vaccination alone provides greater protection than previous infection.

To the study authors:

As an epidemiologist, if I was reviewing this paper for publication I would send it back to you for major revisions or reject it outright. I would not even bother looking at the results.

The major issue is that you have conditioned study group entry by an event that happens at the end of the study. I.e. you have created a cohort of unvaccinated persons who must remain unvaccinated throughout the study. This is guaranteed to introduce selection bias, more specifically immortal-time bias. This further guarantees a biased estimate. This topic has been written about many times. Cf any of many articles by Sammie Souza at McGill.

Imagine someone in your unvaccinated cohort. Soon after the initial study date they develop an infection. 5 weeks later they have recovered and decided they should have had the vaccine, so they get one. Because you have insisted this group remain vaccine free you throw them out of the group and you lose their data. You have just thrown out an infection. Do this just a few times and it is guaranteed that your ‘vaccinated’ group is not reporting as many infections as it actually experienced. This easily accounts for the effect you report.

Note that this does NOT happen with the fully vaccinated/boosted group who must receive all vaccinations prior to study entry. You capture each and every infection with no drop out. Thus you’ve created a situation where you have non-random drop-out between the groups. That is selection bias.

To get around this problem you MUST use methods such as Cox proportional hazards modeling with time-varying exposure variables so that persons can move between cohorts based on exposure to the vaccine during the study period.

Hope this helps.

In Denmark the general medical consensus is that risk of any vaccine has to be outweighed by the reward for the person getting the vaccine *only*, and not on any sort of societal reward, so a lower risk of COVID transfer from a young healthy person to a vulnerable person would not be counted as a reward to offset the risk for that young healthy person.

So you would have the risk of contracting COVID and the risk of serious injury or death from COVID if contracted in the time between stopping this vaccine and being able to give another one, compared to the risk of serious side effects from the vaccine.

Since the risk of contracting COVID is low (very low case rate in Denmark), the risk of serious injury and mortality is low (no deaths in that age range), and Pfizer can be given pretty much immediately instead, that means even the tiniest increase in risk of serious injury from the vaccine compared to a competitor is too high a risk. This is the same reason why AZ and J&amp;J was pulled from the general vaccine programme.

Meanwhile if you're in a country that is primarily relying on Moderna and where Pfizer is not available, where the case rate is higher, or where children are especially susceptible, the benefits of the vaccine would outweigh the risks and you should absolutely accept Moderna vaccines.

The actual numbers haven't yet been released and I assume that's because the research paper the decision was made on hasn't been published yet. They did it for the J&amp;J and AZ vaccine pull (these are how many people would avoid hospitalisation/death, these are how many people would be hospitalised for serious side effects, the risk/reward doesn't make sense), so I'd expect them to do the same for this.",,,,1633530967,{},hflwsn1,True,t3_q2kf7f,False,True,t1_hflu9io,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q2kf7f/denmark_pauses_use_of_moderna_covid_vaccine_for/hflwsn1/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,d133293185f64229a64ff7cfad21bddd40b11394,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1633530979.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

First off, the reason you need a flu shot every year is that there are many kinds of flu viruses and researchers have to try to predict what the most common ones will be that year. That’s why the flu shot is [only 40–60% effective against illness](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/vaccineeffect.htm).

Second and more importantly, this isn’t laser tag where you’re either hit or not hit, end of story. An infection can have effects along the whole spectrum from asymptomatic to landing in the ICU or dead. The statistics are very clear that vaccinated persons have a lower rate of serious illness or death as a result. [Take this study on hospitalisation.](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-10-05/study-pfizer-vaccine-90-effective-against-hospitalization-for-6-months) 90% effectiveness (i.e. reduction in rate compared to unvaccinated persons) against hospitalization for at least 6 months? Sure sounds like meaningful protection to me.

Third, you’re mistaken if you think that prior infection means the vaccine is useless for you. [Vaccination after infection is markedly more effective at preventing reinfection than infection alone.](https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/covid-19-studies-natural-immunity-versus-vaccination)
