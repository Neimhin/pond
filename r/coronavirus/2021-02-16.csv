They've already said if you get either the first dose of Pfizer or Moderna you need the second dose from the same vaccine. It's something I've thought about and made me question if I want JnJ. It's probably fine, but do we know the answer if I can get JnJ first and then get mRNA a few months later safely and they won't interact negatively in some way? Someone smarter than me, feel free to explain. Because dismissing OP's fears doesn't help and it's something others are thinking about.

If Moderna &amp; Pfizer have to make boosters, is the young population privy to those or do we not get a choice either?

Like ok... you wanted me to stay inside and ruin my mental health for over a year and put me last on the list for the vaccine. Then I'm probably gonna be pushed to a vaccine whose mechanism doesn't impress me as much and I'm not sure what my options are later down the line. Like I get why it is this way, but feels so ""shut up and do as we say and you get no choice in the matter"" when actually I do?

I actually think JnJ would be better suited to a lot of populations who have a hard time going to two vaccine appointments like homeless people, etc. Anyway, if I have to wait a month or two for an mRNA vaccine I'll probably just do that if no one can answer my questions.",,,1613541264,{},gnqjjr2,False,t3_ll6oi1,False,True,t1_gno2bn9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ll6oi1/moderna_expects_to_supply_second_100_million/gnqjjr2/,1613541274,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

But if I were to only be able to get the moderna one, I wouldn't mind, because it's just as good. 
However, the AZ is just working less well, that's not an opinion, that's a fact. And that's not caused by the EU, that's caused by the technology behind it. Everyone in the world, excepts for the british themselves maybe, would prefer the mRNA ones over Oxf/AZ. 

Ultimately, of course I won't be getting a free choice for many months to come, so I'll probably end up getting the AZ one. I will also take it, because it's a lot better than nothing at all, but I do also get that medical personal at the moment isn't happy that they are left with the inferior product.

Those pregnant people do not have the same rights as those who are not pregnant.  They must protect the group.

Look at the hazard ratios of a variety of conditions in [this study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2521-4). The HR for being age 60-69 (2.79) is greater than even severe morbid obesity (BMI 40+, HR 2.66). The risk of advanced age rises dramatically from there, with HRs coming in at 8.62 from 70-79 and 38.29 for ages 80+. In short, young obese people are still much less likely to die or have complications than the average person aged 60+.

In April 1955 more than 200 000 children in five Western and mid-Western USA states received a polio vaccine in which the process of inactivating the live virus proved to be defective. Within days there were reports of paralysis and within a month the first mass vaccination programme against polio had to be abandoned. Subsequent investigations revealed that the vaccine, manufactured by the California-based family firm of Cutter Laboratories, had caused 40 000 cases of polio, ***leaving 200 children with varying degrees of paralysis and killing 10.***

Not sure what rate you're referring to.  


\&gt; Or why can't nurses just get sick of this shit and quit and render the hospitalization stat less meaningful?

Is there any indication that's going to happen.

\&gt; The last couple days the death count has gone down, but it's too early to pop open a beer, with valentine's day, president's day, and climate collapse going on (and the weekend), reporting could just be lagging behind.

People choose not to understand that death reporting is a lagging indicator.  Deaths that go on today's numbers aren't the deaths that happened yesterday.  It takes weeks to get a full accounting of any given day, sometimes months.  We're still posting deaths from November on today's totals.

\&gt; People generally predicted the winter would be bad. And it has been bad. I suppose it's almost time to lift restrictions so westerners can get on a plane to third world countries and infect those without access to medical care.

No, they said that they found no CLEAR evidence, after a preliminary investigation.

Why are you ommitting this?

E: Lol, here is the tweet:

""Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China.""

It even says that China conducted the investigation, as they (WHO) are a political organisation too (bosses in every country), people need to read between the lines.

EII: Petition to the mods to put ""no evidence for human-to-human transmission"" into their DB for ""misinformation"", and while they are at it, they should also consider to add Foxnews (ik, totally OT, but I've seen the WP banned for ""maybe misleading"" or whatever here) to the ""not reliable sources""-table.

The vaccines can either deliver the protein (spike protein) to the dendritic cells; and they can pick it up. The mRNA is just some stuff too; but when dendritic cells pick it up; it's actually a code that makes the dendritic cell produce these spike proteins.

I'm guessing the efficcacy is higher; although it's harder to get mrna into a cell; it will produce much more spike proteins than the amount dendritic cells can pick up from limited supply.

Both vaccines are similar; but mrna vaccine just depends on our rna synthesising capability; whereas the protein vaccine depends on our protein synthesising capability.

Your first paragraph completely ignores the other half of the story - families with two working parents are **already** exposed to COVID, and they're **already** exposing others, because they're using child care of some kind. Whether that's a daycare center (no better than a school except the providers aren't unionized like teachers) or they're having a relative watch the kids (sometimes grandma) or one of the parents has been dropped out of the workforce. Or worse, nobody is watching the kids.

&gt; Who's going to bear the costs of litigation, settlement, etc

Why would there be litigation at all? If you're a teacher, and afraid to do your job, quit. No other profession on earth - be they grocery workers, security guards, engineers, construction workers, whatever, could even dream of going to work, catching a virus that is endemic among the general population, and suing their employer. What fantasy land are you living in that you think that would be an acceptable course of action? If you can't do your job for medical reasons, the world will not and cannot stop for you. Instead, you need to go on disability or find a different job that has a more acceptable risk profile (or, in this case, a risk profile that you perceive is better, whether it is in actuality or not). 

&gt; just because we can

Just because we can **what**? Open schools? That's backwards and you should know it - the default and natural state for schools is **OPEN** not **CLOSED**. The question should be - ""We could close schools to potentially reduce risk, but should we?"" The question should not be - ""Should we continue to deprive children and families of the important developmental, educational, and social support they expect from the school system by bowing to pressure from teachers unions with flimsy what-if arguments and no statistical backing?""

My question is if underreporting is the real issue, and if the severity of this virus is worth how drastically we have changed how the would operates, (which from what we’ve seen, it looks like it is) wouldn’t we just see people dying left and right in rural areas? 

I understand all the points you made and they absolutely contribute to the numbers. But at the same time, India 4/10ths the cases of the US with 969% higher population density. Those numbers don’t make any sense even with mass cases that aren’t reported.

And if that many cases are underreported, then I mean how bad really is it? If the biggest issue was cases being underreported wouldn’t that eventually become apparently by an absurd amount of people in rural areas who were seemingly healthy dropping dead? I mean it’s shut down entire countries multiple times, if it’s worthy of that severity, mass unreported cases would naturally bring themselves to the public eye eventually. And if the amount of cases it would take to skew the percentages that much, and it hasn’t been the center of global news and/or the explanation is a bunch of “this is probably why, but we’re not sure” than there’s two possibilities.

1. What the “experts” know at the moment clearly isn’t worth much, and will drastically change in a short amount of time
2. A country with the population density of India has the number of unreported cases as you would probably assume by looking at those percentages and no ones really noticed. Meaning this really isn’t that severe, or else we’d probably be looking into it’s effect on poorer/more rural too.

Not when it comes to a global pandemic that has killed almost 500k Americans in 1 year with preventions and lock downs in place. 

&gt;Shouldn't 85% of the population be able to choose their own risk for themselves? 

Bro we've seen over the last year how little that works. Older people have to go get groceries, go to the pharmacy, doctor's appts, etc. If you're under 60 and you've been isolating or taking precautions and you're only cared about your own safety, you don't need to take precautions. We're all doing this because a large percentage of the population is severely at risk. There was a wedding last year that was directly linked to 9 elderly people who weren't in attendance but still died. They didn't get to choose their risk.

&gt;If I go out in public without a mask am I really killing grandma in the next state? 

My grandmother died in her nursing home because someone, somewhere decided they shouldn't wear a mask. We've seen how this thing spreads for a year in presymptomatic people. If you have COVID, but don't it yet, go out, infect someone, and they bring it to my state where my grandmother died, then you're not many degrees away from that death. You're certainly closer to that death that I'm comfortable being. 

&gt;Why aren't the nursing homes locked down and why aren't the elderly with health conditions more careful?

They are. That's still happening. It's clearly not enough because, you know, 500k people are dead? 

&gt;The whole thing has become groupthink in a way that is mind boggling. I think part of it is that people don't really understand that the risk is so heavily concentrated in the elderly and infirm. If that were more widely understood I think there would be even wider dissent.

Bruh I just think you're underrepresenting the empathy people have for other? The majority of people I've talked to have understood that they, personally, aren't at risk. We're asked to give a shit because others are SEVERELY at risk. One of my distant relatives in the UK is in his 50s and a cancer survivor. He's on death's door with COVID even though him and his wife haven't left their house other than one of them to get groceries and the pharmacy. He still caught it and is doing terribly because of it. I know that an entire year of lockdown is killing people's empathy but come on, a MASSIVE risk to 15% of the population that can still spread even if the elderly are incredibly careful is certainly enough reason for us all to take precautions.

Things got a little political in my direction over the last week, and some personal attacks were levied. Unless you sent me more than two direct messages, this isn't aimed at you.

There has been lots of confusion about my posts, thinking that I'm anti-restrictions or whatever. Actually, I've been getting it from both sides.

The virus is serious business.  It kills people.  It makes people sick for a long time. Some people lose their sense of smell/taste. Some people don't get sick at all, but we have *no idea* who or why. Yes, I'm ignoring the age distribution stuff here, but we know that people of every age *can* get really sick.  I really don't want a loss of smell or taste to happen to me.  That's what keeps me motivated to mask up and distance.  I don't think you should ignore the danger of the virus, *at all*. 

Just because you've decided not to distance or follow the rules, doesn't mean that you get to make that decision for other people too.  Respect their choices, even if they're *terrible* choices.  You can be *so ignorant, on purpose, just to spite me* and there's nothing I can do about it. Some people have chosen to stop distancing once they're vaccinated, and that's fine, so long as they respect other people's choices.

The virus wasn't made in a lab.  That's conspiracy theory garbage, and you know it.  Even if it was made in a lab, so what? Who cares? What does that do for you?  What does that do for humanity, or our ability to fight the virus, or the people who've lost a loved one? Nothing but spread hate. Give it up.  

If you think this is me ""defending"" China, you're beyond help.

About me - I'm not ""anti-lockdown"" or ""pro-lockdown"".  In the US, I don't think we've had a ""lockdown"", we've just had restrictions, and minimal ones at that. If we had had a lockdown like in NZ or China, I do think we'd be in a better place (fewer deaths). On the other hand I'm not *totally* convinced that they are as effective as some people think. I encourage people to ""follow the rules"" or guidelines or whatever.  Masking up is so easy, and yeah, it can suck, but just do it until you don't have to anymore.  I'm ""pro-mask"" but only to a point. They do seem to work, for a myriad of reasons. Double masking is dumb, but the idea comes from good intentions. Experts are [trying their hardest, heck, trying EVERYTHING they can](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/llsmnp/singledomain_sarscov2_s1_and_rbd_antibodies/) to protect people from a deadly virus.  If this is really difficult for you, I'm sorry. 

Please don't assume that because I troll and argue in conservative subs that I'm a conservative.  I'll get banned there eventually.

Any answer you get that is either ""yes"" or ""no"" is wrong, for now. We have only ""maybe, probably not"", and it's going to be that way for a long time.

In order to answer the question scientifically, it would require a ""challenge study"" where both vaccinated and unvaccinated people are deliberately exposed to the virus to see if transmission occurs.

The ethical concerns of deliberate exposure prevent us from performing these studies in humans.  It's the same reason that the vaccine trials took so long, we can't deliberately infect people to see if they need hospitalization or die. 

(EDIT: Well, now it looks like I [spoke too soon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/llw5cu/worlds_first_coronavirus_human_challenge_study/))

However, we did these studies in hamsters, and the results looked pretty bad. They were able to spread it. But hamsters greet each other by touching noses like all the time. Humans don't really do that (do you?). So we did similar studies with monkeys and the results look really good.

Also, you'll notice that any reputable person talking about this subject always says ""may be able to spread"", or ""maybe"", or ""we don't know if"". And that's because there is a small chance that vaccinated people will be able to spread the virus. But it's not a big chance. Doctors, scientists, and regulators are being very careful with their language on this subject, some would argue they're being too careful. That said, if they were to say that ""vaccinated people cannot spread the virus"", and then we find out that in some situations that vaccinated people have spread the virus, that would end up worse for them than if they hedge for a while. So at least to me, the way they're framing it seems pretty reasonable, you just have to put yourself in their shoes.

[Yay!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmqfk4q/)

Just because [mRNA vaccines aren't 100% effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/)  against the SA variant, *doesn't* [mean that we'll definitely need boosters](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gmu581s/).

**Spike mutation analogy:**

The spike protein is coded by 3,831 base pairs.  What does that mean?

Well, it's like a lego sculpture where you have 3,831 words in the instructions for how to build it, and the writer had to be super-detailed when explaining each motion and piece.    

In this analogy, your immune system makes lego pieces (antibodies) that can attach to any pair of exposed bumps on the lego sculpture.  We'll say there are 40 pairs exposed in this example.

A variant is when the instructions change by just one or more words.  Sometimes the photocopier for the instructions page gets a tiny smudge.  This could be really bad sometimes, especially if it's a critical word or phrase, like ""left"" or ""repeat six times"" or a description of a particularly detailed lego piece. Color might not always matter, but size would.

Out of those 3,831 words, how many have to change so much that every one of those 40 spots is no longer there?  It's probably a lot.

But wait, how many words have to change to make the whole sculpture really different, so that it doesn't work as a sculpture anymore?  Really not that many if they're in the right spots, right?  This is why most variants suck at being viruses; it's rare that a mistake would make the instructions *better*.

**Which vaccine should I get?**

When someone asks me what my favorite beer is, the answer is always the same.

It's the one in front of me.

So get the first vaccine you can, the differences are pretty minor.

**Booster questions to think about, I don't have answers**

(note: there's a difference between ""boost"" and ""booster"" here that needs to be understood.)

(also, what's the term for a mixture of sequences, heterogenous? Is my doubt about this term just from overthinking?)

(also also, I'm not convinced we're definitely going to need boosters, this is just fun to think about.)

Could a booster shot replace the second dose of a prime/boost regimen?

Should a booster shot use only one sequence of mRNA (or have all identical spike proteins), or should it have both/multiple?

For future vaccines, should the sequence/spike be the same for prime/boost or different?  If you have four spikes/sequences, would it make more sense to do two in each, or all four in each?

How much should we trust mutation modeling here? Should we anticipate future mutations and include them?  Are we good enough at that yet?

Do we need to give any non-booster doses to people who have recovered from infection?

Could we ""stretch"" doses of an mRNA booster by priming with a vaccine that's easier to manufacture, but maybe less effective (like ChAdOx1), and boost with the mRNA booster?  Could it be better or faster to prime with a current mRNA sequence and boost with an updated ChAdOx1?  

[**Conclusions**](https://gfycat.com/cleantalkativedassie)

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms.  This currently seems to also be true with post vaccination infection with any of the known variants. We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well. 

In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections and symptoms in those who do get infected. Therefore, vaccines should reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing an infection, each subsequent variant they are exposed to will just broaden their immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). So they'll have good and broad immunity to a variety of variants, which seems likely to be an indication that they won't catch or spread the virus as well in the future. Same thing happens when someone who is vaccinated is exposed to a new variant. Their immunity is broadened and strengthened by each subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. But remember, so many people will be less likely to spread the virus, so it's pretty unlikely that this reduced level of spread will be sufficient to sustain the virus in the way we have seen over the past year. So if a variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. If they don't become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing to have my mind changed on this with new information though, so don't take this as gospel.

The CDC's own study showed that the virus has been circulating here before the first cases showed up in Wuhan:

[COVID-19 was silently infecting Americans before first cases emerged in Wuhan: CDC study](https://nationalpost.com/news/world/coronavirus-silently-infecting-americans-before-first-cases-emerged-in-wuhan-cdc-study)

&gt; The CDC study found coronavirus antibodies in 39 samples from California, Oregon, and Washington as early as Dec. 13 to Dec. 16.

&gt; The revelations in the paper by researchers from the CDC reinforce the growing understanding that the coronavirus was silently circulating worldwide earlier than known, and could re-ignite debate over the origins of the pandemic.

This is according to the CDC itself.  For antibodies to be present in blood samples collected in US states between those dates in 2019 and in the quantities that it found means that not only was covid-19 already circulating in the US before Jan. 19, 2020 which was supposed to be the first case in the US, but that the number of Americans infected had to have already been in the millions.

Now combine that with the e-cigarette vaping illness that was all over the news in the US in 2019 and the following study:

[Teen vapers up to 7 times more likely to get COVID-19 than non-e-cig users, says new Stanford study](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/vaping/teen-vapers-7-times-more-likely-get-covid-19-non-n1236383)

Because there are thousands of people from many many different households in one building In a school environment and it’s very dangerous for contagious during a pandemic to have schools open so vaccines for everyone need to be prioritized once the entire country is vaccinated then you can talk about re-opening schools.

Not before we hit heard immunity in my opinion, That’s the only way to really keep kids and teachers safe as well as their families in the entirety of the American population.

Most likely hypothesis involves partial immunity, i.e. not enough for true herd immunity, but enough people who aren't being careful have gotten it by now that it may be running out of easy hosts. Could have been augmented by Nov/Dec being months where many people generally get together more and Jan being a month where they don't. Could be a seasonality factor we don't understand.

Remember that we had two previous waves that rose and fell. There were a lot of changing factors, including various levels of lockdowns and people changing their behaviors. But regardless those two peaked and fell back down as the virus ran out of easy hosts for awhile one way or another, even though each time it obviously still had room to grow again. I wonder if the long incubation period is another factor in all this... this means by the time you realize it's out of control it takes a long time to stop it, but once you get it under control again it takes a long time to fire back up. Anyway, somehow or other this one's getting under control again, but maybe it's falling faster this time because there are fewer easy hosts by the third time.",,,1613600984,{},gntg5kk,False,t3_llza35,False,True,t1_gnt78ac,/r/Coronavirus/comments/llza35/covid19_cases_hospitalizations_continue_massive/gntg5kk/,1613603717,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This is literally my point. For some reason people can't separate science and politics. Your above comment perfectly exemplifies this. It's quite telling you use ""experts"" in quotes by the way. But anyways, scientists give their analysis and results completely devoid of politics. Health scientists are only going to say x people are going to get sick, x people are going to die, and give a breakdown of epidemiological research to know what groups are most affected by it. And give their models. They research the mechanism and provide the research regarding how contagious and deadly it is. They don't look at social and economic ramifications because it's not their job. That's why it's called guidance. They have no authority on policy except to use the scientific model to assist politicians on the projected outcomes if nothing is done. 

It's a politicians job to do a cost-benefit analysis on the social and economic ramifications. It's their job to use the data and analysis from the health experts and consult economists and sociologists to understand the ramifications from a psychological, social, and economic perspective. And it's their job to implement and enforce their policy. 

You are using politics, which is the decision of politicians, to not trust scientists, based on a metric of how it affects *you*. That simply doesn't make sense. Even in your reason that you can't trust experts because they left you in a worse financial situation. That's not how science works. Here is an analogy:

If you were to go to a doctor to get the vaccine. And the doctor jabs the needle in your arm. And you jump back, and go ""oh my god, that hurt. I feel pain. Therefore, I don't trust what you're giving me"". That would be nonsense. Science doesn't care about your feelings or your situation. A person's desire for a better economic future is completely irrelevant to the scientific model. However, if you get the vaccine then we can get back to normal and you will less likely get sick or die. The interpretation of being hostile to the doctor for causing you pain is completely unreasonable. 

&gt; I really think people who sum up others' antipathy toward the lockdown as being centered around the inability to get a haircut or a Frappuccino are really revealing their own place of relative privilege during this whole era of our lives.

I have antipathy for a restrictive lockdown. I only provided one example of how anti-science plagues the anti-lockdown crowd and it doesn't make sense. I've gotten haircuts during the pandemic several times. I go to work everyday. And it's funny that you're talking about privilege, when I literally said those that use science in and of itself are completely ignoring the economic and social ramifications. And I said what fence you decide to be on is determined by circumstance, which I'm implying privilege. So yes, those that are pro-restrictive lockdown are probably working from home in a 4 bedroom house, with a private gym in their basement, a family for social interaction, cable, internet, a huge backyard to chill in, and whatever else makes it so easy for them to want to shut down society.

Very misleading comment.
This part from the article suggests that people are unwilling to take the AZ vaccine hence why so many appointments are available.
What the article omits is that until very recently we had only the Pfizer/Moderna ones and the AZ doses just arrived a few days ago.

My concern at the moment is that if these events happen, and I think they will, that fellow members of the games journalism industry may not attend out of fear even with things like widespread vaccinations, proof of vaccination required, mandatory mask wearing, and social distancing measures, etc.   


Even if you were to ensure them it'd be completely safe without a shadow of a doubt, many won't go this year no matter what. Some are genuinely afraid of COVID, others are afraid of being shamed by their peers for attending these events and being labeled as selfish and irresponsible.   


I've heard several peers say they won't attend events until 2023 which is really depressing.

[],,SparePlatypus,,,[],,,,text,t2_1apco6a1,False,False,[],"Thanks for sharing your view. Personally I see in the papers lots of talk of BioNtech being highly effective against new variants, and suggestions others will not be effective. whilst it's true pfizer expected to perform better against variants than AZ or J&amp;J (measuring all kinds of disease and not just severe) the same can't be said comparing it to Moderna. So I'm still confused at how pfizer getting so much more acceptance 

 Both pfizer and Moderna have released very similar studies to 'prove' they are effective. 

 I put prove in quotes there because in the case of Pfizer,  the studies on it that are used as the basis for it being expected to be highly effective for SA variant are based on in vitro, engineered partial mutations, whereas data from others like Novavax is real world and hence likely to represent more realistic portrait.

And other studies, not sponsored and led by Pfizer, not including just partial mutations have shown Pfizer works pretty much same against B117 but has significantly reduced efficacy against SA variant - various independent studies show much more pessimistic results against SA strain than pfizer themselves present.  

E.g

https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-226857/v1

&gt; slightly reduced neutralisation against the B.1.1.7 variant and a substantial reduction against the B.1.351 variant. 

Snippet from other preprint about to drop studying pfizers effect on new variant

https://mobile.twitter.com/BalazsLab/status/1361038394336419846

&gt; we find that three different variants of B.1.351 show very significant resistance to neutralization by vaccinee sera. About half of our samples exhibited potency below the limit of our assay. They were even less neutralized than SARS-CoV

^^ just to put in context,  theyre saying pfizer vaccine neutralizes the SA strain even less than it does the OG sars, from more than a decade ago..

Another posted the other day

https://mobile.twitter.com/Timothee_B/status/136098143683728179

&gt; in conclusion, we report that neutralization of sera is slightly reduced but largely preserved activity against B.1.1.7. In contrast, the B.1.351 is less sensitive or even unsensitive to a large part of the sera tested, particularly when global antibody levels are low.

These aren't junk studies, prominent virologists like Florian Kramer and Kristian Anderson have pointed them out

There has been several other papers studies all pointing to the same logical conclusion that pfizer will lose potency against E484k and need to be reformulated like others

I see the news recently talk about how EU have a clause to not purchase vaccines if efficacy will appear be reduced toward new variants, apparently this clause was specifically in the pfizer contract, but it's unsure how legally strong it is. Obviously b1351 is not a major issue yet, so it might not be a concern at all to be worried with 

 I have heard announcements on one day from european media that pfizer will reformulated, and another announcement they might not need to.

“If the virus had been human-made, that would show in its genome”, counters Robertson. “Besides, if you were going to create a coronavirus that can be transmitted by humans, you would almost certainly start with the first SARS virus. SARS-CoV-2 is like nothing we have seen before. It really is highly unlikely that someone created it; it is not put together from pieces we know about.” SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to other beta coronaviruses such as RaTG13, a bat virus that the Wuhan Institute of Virology has been working on. But it only shares 96% of its genome sequence with RaTG13, which makes them roughly as similar as human beings and chimpanzees, and points to a common ancestor rather than one springing from the other.

[],,Dalek6450,,,[],,,,text,t2_ubeeb,False,False,[],"&gt;For a country like Australia with an enormous size for a small population, I can't understand why the government doesn't just organise building more housing to solve this?

Because people tend to want to live in cities rather than 50+ kms away from the CBD.

&gt; I feel like there is collusion between property developers and local governments to keep the prices artificially high?

More of the opposite really. The systems benefit entrenched landholders over developers to the detriment of society. It can be politically popular with homeowners to restrict what can be built while giving handouts to property buyers. Negative gearing on property investment and first home buyer grants pump money into the market. Thought ACT and NSW are phasing it out, state's levy stamp duty (basically a one-time payment when a property is purchased) which is a horrifically inefficient tax because it discourages people and businesses from moving to where they most want to be. Broadening the tax on the unimproved value of land as ACT and NSW are doing is much, much more efficient because it encourages land-holders to develop, densify and make occupied property.

While this is happening, supply is restricted via government regulations. These include zoning laws which restrict what can be built - i.e. if an area is zoned for single-family detached housing, there's going to be a limit to how many people you can house in that area even if it's a highly desirable area (you can see this in areas like Nedlands, Crawley and Shenton Park in Perth which have lots of relatively low-density housing despite being relatively close to the CBD, the river, a university and a large park). Local governments have political incentives to implement onerous regulations and provide means for existing residents to block new development (and even renovations) because they're voted on by the residents - not people whose lives could benefit from moving *into* that area.

The result is housing prices get pushed up, cities sprawl out and then the government has to build even more roads, bridges and other services to cater to them. The Reserve Bank of Australia says that $355,000 of the $870,000 average cost of a Sydney apartment is due to zoning and local government regulations.",,,1613594030,{},gnszw0r,False,t3_lll29p,False,True,t1_gnraryq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lll29p/what_australia_has_learned_from_a_year_of_covid/gnszw0r/,1613595635,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Vaccines put selective pressure for virus mutations, yes. However, what you’re leaving out is it gives less opportunities for viruses to mutate in the first place. That’s why vaccines work(ed) for things like measles, small pox, typhoid, tetanus, influenza, and a multitude of other diseases that either don’t exist or have massively declined in how deadly they are for vaccinated people.

We also know from Israel’s studies that this vaccine is insanely effective for keeping people out of hospitals and lessening the symptoms. We don’t know if this vaccine is putting selective pressure on this virus because nobody has studied that yet. All the major variants happened before a vaccine was released.

[This](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/12/study-kids-adults-equally-susceptible-home-covid-19-spread) also shows that children have a much larger role in spreading the virus than your “minimal or zero” statement.

- I started getting kidney inflammations. Doctor not sure if this is related to covid.

The WHO was very alarmist when ebola hit a few years back. And they got a lot of flak for being too alarmist when ebola turned out to be less contagious than feared.

When covid-19 hit, it seemed to be under control after the Wuhan lockdown. I think the WHO was a bit overly cautious and believed that other countries would imitate China and also do hard lockdowns (as the WHO recommended).

After all, China was ranked way lower on pandemic response capabilities compared to the US and UK in a 2019 ranking.

I wasn't talking about vaccines anyway, more about how US foreign politics in general has positionned their ""closest friends"" in a position of never being able to negotiate anything. The way the USMCA has negotiated (Canada was first excluded), the fact that Canadian steel and aluminum is still under tarifs for ""national security threat"", that the US office bureau did in fact shut down a canadian plane production project for unfair competition of an existing American product (while it wasn't true, the plane had no existing competitor in its class), and so on.

I mean, before the pandemic, news were about a trade war! It's kind of huge!

I read in the news that the reason we first approached EU vaccines producers is that we knew it would be very risky to rely on the US for this kind of operations. It says a lot about how Canadians now look at the US. I wish relations will improve one day, but lately, Canada has been a litteral boot cleaning carpet for Uncle Sam.

I did a long thread (https://old.reddit.com/r/coronavirusVA/comments/kt532f/january_8_2021_va_coronavirus_stats/ginukb1/) on the fact no matter the state's restrictions there is a basic range of positive cases per million residents (1300-1600 positive cases/per day/per million residents) that demonstrates when cases will peak then go down. I find it hard to believe that in as a diverse population as the US that every would react in the same manner when cases hit a certain range. 

I predicted the peak day of cases in my state based on the range. 

But, here are a couple of graphs you might look at. This guy is more focused on the ineffectiveness of mask mandates but compares various states cases numbers based on restrictions.

There's a big difference between relying on previous knowledge to make inferences about new but similar situations, and relying on anecdotes. Especially when previous knowledge tells us that anecdotal evidence on treatments is incredibly unreliable. ""Follow science"" doesn't mean we're in a complete vacuum until gold standard double blind trials are done on every aspect of knowledge. It's always a balancing act between potential benefit/potential harm, how likely a thing is based on previously available knowledge, etc. 

We didn't say wear a mask because there had been randomized control trials showing that masks prevent the transmission of covid-19. We relied on available knowledge to make reasonable conclusions. We knew masking to be at least somewhat effective at preventing transmission of other respiratory diseases, the potential benefit was high, the potential harm was negligible to non-existent, so we recommended it. We know that if dozens of potential treatments are thrown at patients, then anecdotally some will appear to work by pure chance. So especially when there is no mechanism by which we'd expect a treatment to work, anecdotal evidence for things like HCQ was viewed with HIGH skepticism. But we didn't need to wait on randomized control trials to treat patients with corticosteroids or to position patients on ventilators differently. Using a corticosteroid (an anti-inflammatory) to treat an inflammatory disease follows from existing knowledge and protocol. Repositioning patients fit into the high benefit/low harm scenario.

In this scenario, the people who did the testing are saying they don't recommend going outside the protocol they tested. Because they can't say for sure how it will work. Changing the protocol DOES involve risk. It's why the US CDC has said NOT to alter that protocol. The UK has made another decision, based on what knowledge is available, and cognizant of the risks that that entails (with their understanding of those risks informed by all the things we know about immunity in general and all the other vaccines we've studied in the past). They're calculating the benefit from acting without complete knowledge to outweigh those risks. A lot of people are criticizing them for it. Meanwhile there are people criticizing the US' approach of holding in reserve the second doses for people who've received a first dose to avoid even the possibility of their second dose being delayed. We're in a fast moving situation with incredible real world consequences, and we have less than perfect knowledge. We'd love to have randomized control trials on all the things we want to know about, but when we don't we have to rely on what we DO know.

Having a vaccinated population prevents a lot of mutations from happening because viruses cannot replicate as effectively in vaccinated people.

We have vaccines that work, and we know that boosters can be developed. Just realize that arriving at the decision of refusing to abide restrictions to save lives because of personal fatigue less than one year into humanity’s first airborne blood disease places one in the same camp as the April protestors now. 

Lots of people voted for the candidate who promised he would “listen to scientists” and “follow the science” only to disregard said scientists less than one month into his term once CoVID threatened to not just “go away” like they’d thought.

I shudder to think how generational obstacles like the Great Depression and World War II would have gone from the American side if people back then threw up their hands as easily less than one year into those unprecedented struggles.

What if she slashes her vein with shears accidentally or accidentally poisons herself with chemical agents like pesticides? Can she cook? What if she causes a fire/gas explosion, what if she chokes to death eating it? I guess the only way to ensure Granny stays safe is to give her a special jacket and keep her in a padded room under constant supervision?

Risk is the price we pay for freedom and life in general. By even leaving your house, ever, there is always a tiny, but present, risk that wildlife bites you and gives you rabies.

However, if a kid goes to school, gets notice that he/she was exposed to covid, and must quarantine for 2 weeks (and by extension, their entire family), what happens to that family?  Some can handle the said quarantine, but others can't.  For most, missing two weeks of work means they are unemployed.  With the current state of unemployment, there's a semi decent chance that they won't get the UI benefits that they deserve.  The costs rises exponentially because they can't afford to miss work.

So, the family takes the risk, goes into work, and there's a new vector of spread.

Not an enviable position.  And where do you draw the line?  Assuming there's a spread of Covid, and a teacher dies due to covid complications.  Now, who's going to bear the costs of litigation, settlement, etc?  Ultimately, it's everyone of us.

I'm taking the position of ""just because we can does it mean should we?""  Is it a wise decision to open schools up so that some folks have free baby sittings (which some folks will use) whereas others who can't afford two weeks of quarantine and become spreaders themselves, all while knowing that their kids were exposed?

It was illegal

&gt;And in California, this was more than a recommendation: on December 5, the state had banned all gatherings, public and private, until regional hospital ICU capacities rose above 15% again. The in-person portion of Diamandis’s gathering was illegal.

Masks weren't required and there was no quarantine requirement

&gt;A360’s precautions, according to Diamandis’s blog post, included requiring everyone who attended to obtain a negative test 72 hours before attending, and then be tested immediately on arrival and on every subsequent morning of the event. But mask-wearing was not enforced, and there was no request to the participants to self-quarantine for any length of time before the gathering.

He despite running a vaccine company doesn't understand how testing works

&gt;Diamandis apparently believed that testing could be an infallible way to circumvent these evidence-based precautions. Under a section in the blog post titled “Lessons Learned,” he wrote of being “flabbergasted” to discover, a year into the pandemic, how unreliable some tests could be, when he used them on himself after developing symptoms and they still came back negative.

They did not follow protocols

&gt;And even if the company had submitted an application, Culver City does not currently offer indoor filming permits, while the LA County Public Health Department’s protocol for music, television, and film production requires safety plans for special events to be approved 10 days in advance.

They did not report it

&gt;Diamandis admitted that no one from his organization reported the positive cases to the public health department, and suggested that his and his team’s struggles with covid-19 could be to blame. “I’ve been in bed for days, as have half my staff, and we’re trying to figure out, you know, which way’s up and down,” Diamandis told me. “This is the first time we’ve been able to actually take a full accounting of where we are, what went wrong, and tell the story.”

But they tried to cover it up

&gt;“Really important that there is no further outreach to a broader set of people,” he wrote. “There will be no further emails to attendees or vendors.”

&gt;Diamandis chimed in by text as well: “Let’s keep all Covid related data, ideas, and communications on this single channel, please.”

Guess it depends on how to read it.

&gt;Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask **may** make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people)

That, to me, says that the jury is still out on effectiveness; not that mask wearing does not seem to protect the mask wearer.

&gt;The genomic features described here may explain in part the infectiousness and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Although the evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not a purposefully manipulated virus, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here. However, since we observed all notable SARS-CoV-2 features, including the optimized RBD and polybasic cleavage site, in related coronaviruses in nature, we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.

Check the citations, you'll see the study was funded by the NIH and the same lab is also receiving CDC funding since November.

It is rigorously peer reviewed, and cited.

Andersen also confirmed the genetic sequencing of RaTG13 in conjunction with some researchers in Norway debunking the claim that Yan makes regarding RaTG13 being fake.

The link to the topic on Virological isn't allowed but you can find it there under the topic: on-the-veracity-of-ratg13 if anyone has any questions. The link to Virological itself can be found in Andersen's acknowledgements. Had to remove it to post this here.

The most damning thing concerning China is the lack of transparency and cooperation. They've swabbed RaTG13 in 2013 and didn't report it to the rest of the world until 2020 after the pandemic had already crossed international borders. The name of the viral specimen is based on species (Rhinolophus affinis), location (Tongguan) and year (2013). The whole reason why it was swabbed was because 3 miners died of fatal pneumonia from it (since it was determined that they didn't die from SARS-CoV-1) possibly the first victims of COVID 19.

We may never determine the exact progenitor and zoonotic trail for COVID 19 because of the time involved here and the fact that we cannot determine if RaTG13 was circulating via wet markets or via short chain human to human transmission until the virus mutated enough to become COVID 19 in those 7 years. A lab accident is very unlikely given the timeline here but that same timeline almost makes it impossible to rule out a lab accident with absolute certainty.

We should really stop pursuing the lab accident angle and just nail China to the wall based on their lack of transparency for a virus that they knew infected and killed 3 people 7 years ago.

Covid already developed some kind of an escape mutation called ""E484K"" which swaped a negatively charged amino acid with a positively charged one. That way our antibodies are less effective.

""Mutations in RBD could theoretically decrease neutralizing activity of  serum of patients receiving vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 with unknown  clinical consequences. Arguably the effect of E484K could be  particularly relevant. In a recent publication, this mutation was  associated with complete abolishment of all neutralizing activity in a  high proportion of convalescent serum tested ([Wibmer et al., 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.27.426895v1.full#ref-39)). When taken together these growing body of evidence suggest that E484K should be the target of intense virologic surveillance.""

[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.27.426895v1.full](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.27.426895v1.full)

The E484K mutation is the reason that Manaus had a second wave although there should have been some kind of herd immunity after 76% of the population got antibodies from the first wave. 

""By contrast, in Manaus, Brazil, a study of blood donors indicated that  76% (95% CI 67–98) of the population had been infected with SARS-CoV-2  by October, 2020""

In this context, the abrupt increase in the number of COVID-19 hospital  admissions in Manaus during January, 2021 (3431 in Jan 1–19, 2021, *vs* 552 in Dec 1–19, 2020) is unexpected and of concern.  SARS-CoV-2 lineages might evade immunity generated in response to previous infection.

Three recently detected SARS-CoV-2 lineages (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and  P.1), are unusually divergent and each possesses a unique constellation  of mutations of potential biological importance. Of these, two are circulating in Brazil (B.1.1.7 and P.1) and one (P.1) was detected in Manaus on Jan 12, 2021.

One case of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection has been associated with the P.1 lineage in Manaus that accrued ten unique spike protein mutations, including E484K and N501K.Moreover, the newly classified P.2 lineage (sublineage of B.1.128 that  independently accrued the spike E484K mutation) has now been detected in  several locations in Brazil, including Manaus.P.2 variants with the E484K mutation have been detected in two people who have been reinfected with SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil, and there is in-vitro evidence that the presence of the E484K mutation  reduces neutralisation by polyclonal antibodies in convalescent sera.

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00183-5/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00183-5/fulltext)

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore there is a lot of evolutionary selection pressure from vaccines and immunity in general so the virus is pressured to set up escape mutations.

""**How do you explain the rapid evolution?**

It may indicate increasing and persistent selection pressure. For  example, an increasing degree of immunity in the population favours  virus variants that can partially escape the body’s defences.

**Under what conditions can such selection pressure arise?**

It can occur at the level of an individual or a population. For  example, in individuals with weakened immune systems, who cannot  effectively fight the virus effectively, the pathogen can “try out” new  things for a longer period of time. In the end, the variants that most  effectively escape the body’s defences remain.

Regions where the first wave of the pandemic was particularly strong –  such as parts of South America and South Africa – also exert strong  selection pressure because many people there developed immunity  following Sars-CoV-2 infection. New virus variants may have an advantage  here.

In South Africa and Brazil, researchers have been closely following  the development of the virus. These remarkable variants were therefore  discovered and studied early on. In other places, there may be similar  variants that we don’t know about yet.""

[https://www.mpg.de/16371358/coronavirus-variants](https://www.mpg.de/16371358/coronavirus-variants)

&amp;#x200B;

So I am not so sure about covid future. Coronaviruses in general are much more likely to mutate compared to smallpox for example where we could vaccinate everyone easily and beat the disease. There will be a race between updating the vaccines and escape mutations of the virus.

Let's see.

For example one article cited as evidence the fact that cases ""did not seem to spike"" after the BLM protests where ""people seemed to be wearing masks"".  This is not any kind of science based conclusion at all but someone just spitballing.

There have been numerous studies that measure how far droplets fly and how long they remain suspended in the air and stuff like that. But it is in a lab setting, not the real world, and misses the key question of whether or not these particles can actually infect someone. Is this evidence of masks working? I personally do not think so but opinions vary.

[Another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7268966/) had a time frame of 10-20 days. I think most people are thinking in terms of months.

The problem is that a real study would need to compare two similar cities/states/countries that are the same in every way besides their lockdown policy and such a thing just doesn't exist. The virus did not expand uniformly so comparing for example California late in its outbreak to Texas early in its outbreak is apples and oranges.

In lieu of this people try to do post-hoc statistical analysis but this isn't easy to do either. A few early studies were retracted.

Chicken pox and Polio are generally diseases found in children that the majority of people have immunity to (because they had them when they were young),

Covid on the other hand had a clean slate, 100% of the population to spread through.  This means it doesn't spread in a cluster and then stop, it continue to spread, we get huge swaths of people with Covid, hospitals get overrun, etc.

Plus covid tends to kill a large portion of elderly people that catch it.  Polio led to paralysis in something like 0.5% of cases, chicken pox is most deadly in adults at  0.03% mortality rate (most people get it as kids when it is less deadly), Covid kills something like 5%+ in 70+ year olds.

Add in the fact that we are 70 years more advanced then when polio was going around and I don't think it's useful to say ""we survived polio so you should deal with Covid"".

Let's say flu deaths are around \~150 deaths/day. That's around 55k/year which is higher than most years.

At the rate we're going, we might hit that sometime by the end of March. Should we open up everything then? When the majority of Americans still wouldn't be vaccinated?

- The lag is a little longer than you might think to: getting noticeable percentages of people vaccinated -&gt; waiting for the efficacy to kick in (a couple weeks to 50%, a month to 90%+) -&gt; waiting for that efficacy to show up in the stats (a couple more weeks - the people who are not getting the virus today due to immunity will not show up in case stats for two more weeks and hospitalizations two more weeks after that)

- The ratios are not yet changing. Cases fell first, starting weeks ago before very many had been vaccinated, and this was followed by falling hospitalizations and falling deaths. Since we are prioritizing the elderly/vulnerable, we will really see the effects of vaccines when hospitalizations and deaths fall *more* relative to cases, not in response to it, because it's still spreading but way smaller proportion of people are getting severely ill by it.

This is *starting* to show up in the stats.

For example, Ohio has started vaccination in nearly 60% of the 80+ ... based on lag times probably over 40% have immunity by now .. but the hospitalization stats updating *today* are probably reflective of who was getting infected a couple weeks prior when only around 20% had immunity. Still, even there we are starting to see an effect. New hospitalizations are falling for very age group (as cases decline in every age group), but they are falling *faster* in the 80%+ group (ex. down 36% compared to the previous week, relative to down only ~20% for lower age brackets)

These aren't eye-popping differences, and they aren't driving the overall picture. Not yet - but accelerating very quickly and will be soon.

People don’t realize how much online school SUCKS for students, and probably for teachers too but I don’t know. A lot of people have issues with school, or they don’t enjoy it, and that’s understandable. But that doesn’t mean that there’s no value from school. For basically anyone under 18, their social life and daily routine revolve around school. Sure, it’s different for everyone, but even if someone doesn’t really hang out with people on weekends, they still get a lot of interaction with friends at school and being in the building full time provides a lot of meaning. The extracurriculars, the sports, the music and arts programs, the classes, the simple experience of having study hall with friends, the food provided to poorer children, the childcare provided for kids with busy parents-it’s all super essential. If teachers are essential workers, they need to complete their duty. For middle and high schools, there are a good amount of issues. But we can’t solve any of them unless we go back to the form of schooling that’s much better for kids health. If you want the kids to wear masks, fine, I see it as harmful but I can deal with that. But if you want your kid, yes even high schoolers, to have to deal with online school taking away a huge amount of their livelihood then you obviously don’t know what you’re talking about.

If the virus is airborne, more droplets is largely meaningless.  Floating droplet transmission and airborne transmission are different.  Airborne transmission is basically 'virus dust is enough to spread' while droplet transmission requires droplets.  


There is good evidence that airborne transmission dominates - further supported by the mere existence of super spreaders.  If that is the case then this study is just pointing a finger at old fatties without much support.

We're already at the point where they're planning new vaccines based on mutations.  That's a terrible sign. They're only doing that because they're confident governments will buy it. Governments are only buying it because they expect these mutations to be potentially devastating to the economy.

&gt;Super-spreaders really do exist. Scientists have found people who produce 1,000 times as many as aerosol particles as their peers when they breathe out, making them a far greater risk.
The older and more overweight people were, the more likely they were to be among the 20 per cent who exhaled 80 per cent of aerosol droplets, the study of almost 200 people showed.
The information could be key in understanding the dynamics of the pandemic, the researchers said. It is now well established that Covid-19 is driven by “super-spreading”. Most people with the virus do not infect anyone else, but a small number of people infect many others.
Epidemiologists stress that this is not necessarily due to the person, but to the circumstances. For example, meat-packing plants, choir practices and churches have all hosted documented super-spreading events.
As our understanding of the virus has developed, scientists have concluded that it is transmitted through both droplets and aerosols suspended in the air. The new study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, has counted the aerosol particles in people’s breath and found that, as well as location, differences between people may indeed play a big role, with some naturally more prone to super-spreading.
Aerosols are made when exhaled air rushes over the mucus lining the airways. “The surface of the mucus can break up like the sea breaks up in a strong wind storm,” said David Edwards, from Harvard University. This, as with the sea, sends up spray, in this case a spray of potentially infectious mucus.

I'm sorry if I these questions get asked a million times but my wife just tested positive and I'm freaking out a little bit.

What should I do now? 

I'm not feeling any symptoms, but we live together, so when should I get tested? 

Is there a high false-positive rate on the nasal swab?

How should I prepare for if we both get sick? We do not have insurance so speaking to my doctor is not a possibility.
