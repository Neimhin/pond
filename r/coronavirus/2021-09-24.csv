Data compiled by the Gallatin County public health department shows schools that started the year with policies requiring mask use had fewer student COVID-19 cases.

During a weekly press call, health officer Lori Christenson presented data showing that there were an average of 5.8 cases per 1,000 students in schools that started the year with mask policies. There were 17.9 cases per 1,000 in schools with no mask policies.

“What this really does depict is that the connection between wearing a mask and lower cases holds in this situation,” Christenson said Friday. “ … Where there is a mask requirement we are seeing fewer cases … in those school settings.”


Christenson noted that the data didn’t mean a student contracted COVID-19 at school, and the numbers only captured schools that had mask requirements at the start of the year. The figures also do not include school employees. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends universal indoor masking by students, staff members, faculty and visitors in kindergarten through grade 12 schools, regardless of vaccination status, to reduce transmission of COVID-19. The CDC has released two recent studies Christensen pointed to showing schools with mask policies had lower rates of students testing positive.


Schools around Montana have struggled with outbreaks since the start of the year. An update from the Townsend School District, which has not required masks, this week reported nearly a third of K-6 students were absent for reasons related to COVID-19, which could include needing to quarantine because of exposure or testing positive, based on enrollment numbers from last year. Roughly 27% of seventh and eighth graders were out of class. About 10% of high school students were absent because of COVID-19.


Those under the age of 12 cannot be vaccinated for COVID-19. Townsend Superintendent Susie Hedalen wrote in the Sept. 21 letter that while many students and employees are vaccinated, positive cases were requiring the school to ""quarantine classrooms, teams, staff and groups of students of various ages.""


""We are concerned with the growing number of staff and students who are absent due to COVID-19,"" Hedalen wrote. ""There are students with allergies and colds, but COVID is spreading as well; please remember to keep symptomatic students at home and err on the side of caution.""

The district planned a special board meeting late this week to discuss protocols moving forward. 

Right before school started, the state health department issued an emergency rule urging Montana’s public schools to consider parents’ requests for students to opt out of mask mandates. School officials said that was already part of their process, and that the emergency rule didn’t change anything.


The rule itself, along with a 13-page “research report” from Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office, cited several studies, news stories and tweets saying there is “no science behind mask mandates for children” and warned of negative effects for some children wearing face coverings. Montana pediatricians criticized the way the emergency rule cited several studies, saying it cherry-picked information.

The state health department's weekly report released Wednesday showed there have been 1,166 COVID-19 cases among K-12 students since the start of this school year. That number increased from 369 a week ago.",,,,1632597387,{},he96ulo,True,t3_pvdgtb,False,False,t3_pvdgtb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pvdgtb/gallatin_county_data_shows_fewer_covid19_cases_in/he96ulo/,1632729236.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

If any other HVAC engineers are reading, here's my two cents for free: design systems with high-velocity ducts (for easy retrofits into Alaska attics packed with insulation), multi-zone air handlers to prevent certain rooms or floors from heating up way too quickly, and CONNECT THEM TO BOILERS with a heat exchanger instead of using a furnace! This would also let you get some pre-heated outdoor air to get rid of the stuffiness that is so common in houses here in the winter.

Statistically speaking, as you said, children are as safe from covid as they are from flu. So I understand parents having a difficult time deciding whether to give a 5yo a vaccine that hasn't been given to many 5yo kids and whose developmental effects they don't know about. Particularly when the vaccination isn't for the kid. It's for the community. It isn't needed for kids or even healthy adults under 50 to be STATISTICALLY safe as you say. 

But as adults we can understand and choose to do something that at most slightly inconveniences us and doesn't hurt us for the sake of the common good. Like wearing masks or isolating. But it's understandable that someone might struggle about forcing those types of decisions in a child who doesn't have the capacity to fully understand what that means, particularly when there isn't data on what the vaccine might or might not due to a 5yo body.

The vaccines are obviously safe for adults and teens, but I haven't seen any data or statistics about them in pre school aged children. If you have, please share. I just won't at this time judge a parent for their decisions about the covid vaccine in a 5yo child. 

Child bodies and adult bodies are very different. A child gets lead in their water and their brain never develops right. An adult gets lead in their water and if they keep drinking a lot of it overtime they may develop heavy metal toxicity.

Statistically, a lot of parents will weigh the risks of the unknown vs the very miniscule chance that a child will have a bad reaction to covid and maybe they choose the vaccine or not.

Certainly people can change their minds *eventually*, but that’s slightly why it’s beyond frustrating and a detriment to everybody else. How much fucking longer are they gonna need before they’re “sure it works”?

An overwhelming amount of people hesitant about it either only take anecdotal “proof” from their friends on Facebook if it aligns with their doubt and think bullshit fake articles or Fox News propaganda is what the end all of truth is. If they’re not in this category then they’re definitely 99% likely to be someone who is too lazy to do real research or know how to even decipher between science, logic, and bullshit. 

For example: In what world does an argument like “all the vast number of doctors say the vaccine is safe but my husbands friends optometrist says x, y, and z about how it’s all a big stunt by the pharma companies and that it’s all overblown, it’s just a flu. How can I trust all those doctors? Maybe they’re wrong, so im just gonna hold out until I have proof” make logical sense? It’s not everybody’s story, but  I’ve heard stories like that everywhere in the area I live and I know im not alone in that.

Tons of people try to paint them as just hesitant but the hesitation never goes away and nothing anyone can do or say typically ends up doing anything to make them budge. Vast majority still end up on the consensus of “ehhhhhh idk if I have enough proof, I think I’ll play it safe and not get it” even though the facts and truth have already been explained. 
Honestly most people hesitant are going to hard refuse only until their privileges for things get taken away. Vaccine passports for travel, inconveniences like getting spending money to get tested constantly for entry into tons of places or events, colleges requiring vaccines, employers requiring vaccination, etc.  

That is literally the only way I see so many of the hesitant people to get. it’s not about “does it work”, but rather about their inconvenience for not having it, which pressures them to go through with it.

This whole [article](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/mrna-coronavirus-vaccine-pfizer-biontech) is worth a read, but I'll give a select few passages for those who don't want to read it all: 

&gt;However, by the early to mid 1990s, some of the early excitement surrounding mRNA was beginning to fade. While scientists had cracked the problem of how to create their own mRNA, a new hurdle had emerged. When they injected it into animals it induced such a severe inflammatory response from the immune system that they died immediately. Any thoughts of human trials were impossible.

&gt;But many other scientists were turning away from the field, and her bosses at UPenn felt mRNA had shown itself to be impractical and she was wasting her time. They issued an ultimatum, if she wanted to continue working with mRNA she would lose her prestigious faculty position, and face a substantial pay cut.


&gt;In 2005, Karikó and Weissman published a study announcing a specifically modified form of mRNA, which replaced Uridine with an analog – a molecule which looked the same, but did not induce an immune response.

If someone lives in a university town, there's a virology program.  Chances are they have \*zero\* idea about what research is being done and in general this isn't a problem. There isn't a lot of ""transparency"" on a normal day when there's no pandemic.  

Should there be more transparency in general?  I mean, there is \*some\* - in the US if you look up ""NIH grant reporter"" or ""NSF grant reporter"" you can poke around and find much of the research that is being done, plus all the institutes have to report to Congress and much of that reporting is public.  Universities generally have ""expertise databases"" and sometimes have lists of all their funded proposals.  My university has both. 

But then, also, being really upfront, like providing frequent, publicly comprehensible reports that are well publicized - that takes work, which means it takes salaried employees and in general that type of research support is hard to fund.  

And of course, some research imperils the researchers.  Universities usually keep animal research quiet, especially the worse and uglier kinds.  Stem cell research, anything to do with GLBTQ health, anything to do with women's reproductive health - the more you beat the drum about that stuff the more you risk having a bunch of loonies show up at some poor research assistant professor's apartment at 3am. 

It does not surprise me in the least that people have not said, ""here is a giant list of all the projects at my university that have anything to do with animals and viruses"" because, with the best good will in the world, that list is going to be read carelessly by people who desperately want someone to blame and they're going to look at something like ""When Bats Get Toenail Fungus:  Insights into tropical fruit pathology"" and gin up a mob. 

I mean, an awful lot of the failings or less-than-ideal communication through the pandemic is not sinister, it's just institutional weakness or limited resources or the way things have always been done being really slow to change.

Just looking to see what everyone thinks because I don't see enough discussion about excess deaths/accurate reporting of deaths, except when (rightfully) bashing florida for lying.



Someone asked on yesterday's thread whether the US would reach 1 million covid deaths and I responded thusly: 


&gt;According to the CDC, we have had **958,360 confirmed deaths from respiratory infections** going back to the start of 2020. That includes covid, pneumonia and influenza, and less than 10k were confirmed influenza, and we have still been testing for it this whole time.


&gt;Some of these deaths may have been completely unrelated to covid, and bacterial (pneumococcal or  mycoplasm) pneumonia is not uncommon in the elderly, even with the vaccine that we have for pneumococcus. However I am willing to bet that most of those ~250k additional ""pneumonia"" deaths were a direct or indirect result of COVID-19 because that number is still triple what it would be in a ""normal"" year and a half (and that's without *any* preventative measures).


&gt;And don't forget people with strokes and heart attacks or blood clots who may have recovered from covid, but suffered some serious organ and tissue damage. That happened in young healthy people early on. I bet it is happening even more now with delta. And sometimes that takes time. How many covid ""survivors"" will be alive a year from now? 5 years? 


&gt;Often, covid is not even mentioned in the death certificate, especially if MEs/coroners are overloaded and don't have time to autopsy as many bodies as they should. And most rural places only have medical examiners, who are not as well trained as coroners. 


&gt;So in my (humble) estimation, we have already reached 1 million deaths in this country, possibly sometime in August, or even before then. It will probably take years before we have a good handle on the number of total deaths.

We know about this proposal in 2018 because Daszak was not trying for perfect secrecy.  And the denial of the proposal wouldn't really cause Daszak to employ perfect secrecy going forwards.  Someone just said 'no' to him, they didn't declare his research illegal or anything.

But then after this 2018 grant proposal he spun up a research team which used a still completely unknown backbone of a virus to create a chimeric hybrid with a still almost completely unknown chimeric hybrid, inserting a furin cleavage site into the new virus which is unlike any other one we've seen and which on the face of it seems suboptimal (and was improved by the P681R mutation in delta which would make more sense for someone to have deliberately constructed).  Then someone had a bizzare lab accident where they chopped up a bunch of virus and railed a line of it to actually get sick (you can't just get some SARS-CoV-2 on your hands and get sick from it, we know it doesn't transfer well on surfaces, so somehow it had to get aerosolized).  And all of this happened in perfect secrecy -- because Daszak had a time machine and knew back in 2018 that the 2019 pandemic would happen.

You simply don't get from this proposal to SARS-CoV-2, you get a virus that looks more like SARS-CoV-1.  Even if you use RaTG13 you get a virus which is &gt;99% homologous to RaTG13, which is 1,000 mutations and nearly 30-40 years of evolution away from SARS-CoV-2.  And ""serial passage"" is just doing in the lab what nature does on a very small scale it isn't magic.  After infection some large fraction of a billion humans all the variants of SARS-CoV-2, even though they're under large evolutionary pressure due to the species hop, are still all &gt;99% homologous.  To turn RaTG13 into SARS-CoV-2 you'd need serial passage through the order of many billions of animals in the lab.

This proposal does look ""curiously"" like exactly what happened because we understand zoontic spillover enough to guess that a sarbecovirus with a high affinity for hACE2 that picked up a furin cleavage site would be a threat.   What actually happened though was that nature also knows how to do genetic engineering and the progenitor virus of SARS-CoV-2 picked up the PRRAR furin cleavage site from recombination with some other coronavirus which has one.  Which we know has happened independently probably a dozen times now and have found furin cleavage sites in related sarbecoviruses.  Then delta's main mutation is the P681R mutation which improved the furin cleavage site which is a  concrete example of evolution in action.  The original FCS was poor because it grabbed it from a bat coronavirus with a cleavage site that doesn't work particularly well in humans and evolution went about working on fixing it for humans.

Meanwhile there's progress going on in understanding the zoontic origins of the virus, and there's indications that there were multiple spillover events, which really kind of kills the lab leak hypothesis dead if that's the case:

https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02519-1

So what likely happened is that a lot of bats were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 progenitor and infected with the FCS donor virus at the same time (a double epidemic in bats) and the recombination event happened multiple times and at least two independent strains hopped into humans using different variants of the progenitor.  Because nature can run a hundred million experiments all in parallel and pick the best two and make them fight it out.  Now you need two different closely related but slightly different backbones in the lab (adding uselessly massive amounts of complexity to an already complicated process) and both of them leaked independently in two lab leaks, not just one.",,,,1632586480,{},he8i50m,False,t3_pv5x9j,False,True,t1_he89mek,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pv5x9j/the_lableak_debate_just_got_even_messier/he8i50m/,,1,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,963ec8c0c0a64134f536a5bec8199a282854906a,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1632586496.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

As far as the role of immunology, synaptic pruning during development is intertwined with immune function, and there is a pretty good body of evidence at this point that Autism is associated with decreased levels of pruning while Schizophrenia is associated with increased levels of pruning.

That said, both Schizophrenia and Autism are probably dozens of different disorders that we don't have a good way of classifying yet. We really should be splitting out these diseases more, not less. Maternal immune activation during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of both Schizophrenia and Autism, but there are many moving parts there that aren't fully understood. Having shared risk factors doesn't mean the disorder mechanisms are actually the same. 

Taking the global neurotransmitter perspective is convenient for drug development, but it's pretty clearly hit a wall at this point. I don't think anyone that has been trained in Psychiatry recently would say that Bipolar is on the same spectrum as Schizophrenia, although of course they do share some symptoms/risk factors. 

Addiction is a big problem in the Schizophrenia population, although a large part of that probably relates more to patients trying to self medicate, not necessarily a shared underlying mechanism.

Okay, so the deal is that there was a 14.2 million dollar grant proposal submitted to DARPA that would have involved something that \*could conceivably\* have caused a lab leak, except a lot of the work would have been done in Wisconsin....but the proposal was rejected.  But, says, the Atlantic, we don't know that this 14.2  million dollar experiment was not set up and carried out in China between 2018 and, oh, September 2019 leaving no trace.

Now, it so happens that I did some grants management work for a virology program earlier in my career - nothing to do with bats, but plenty to do with federal grant applications.  And I am here to tell you that there is absolutely ZERO way that a 14.2 million dollar project that was rejected in 2018 was funded and far enough along to leak bat viruses by fall 2019.

You remember how it took, like, a year to get the vaccines ready even though there was 20 years of mRNA research already done? That is because science takes time.

If my lab had submitted a proposal in 2018 that was funded, the funding would actually arrive \*maybe\* four months later, probably six. There would be a little delay after the start date while the institution set up spending mechanisms. While some hiring and purchasing would probably be done pre-award and you'd probably have some people already on staff, there would be a ramp up with purchasing, setting up experiments, etc.   If it was a very, very large collaborative project, things would be even slower.

Chinese research institutions are somewhat different from American - if there were extremely urgent research to be done they could probably act faster.  But for just your average virology proposal? It's not exactly greased lighting. 

There is no way that a proposal was rejected by DARPA and then tweaked and resubmitted to a Chinese research institute and fully funded and leaking bat virus in less than a year. Remember, too, that bat virus research was not a hot topic - it's not like Chinese research institutes were hugely more desperate to fund it than DARPA, so it's quite likely that if DARPA thought the proposal was no good, it wouldn't be funded elsewhere.

Also - the world of virology is \*small\*.  People know each other. There's plenty of cross-hiring between China and the US, for instance. If someone in China got a real plum multimillion yuan award \*after DARPA rejected it\*, virology circles would be abuzz because it would be exciting and a huge career boost for someone.  Someone's postdoc in Berkeley would have gone to school with someone being paid on that grant and they'd talk about it in Berkeley and then there'd be a conference and people would talk about it at the bar....people talk about funding all the time.

Now, if you tell me that the Chinese government wants to militarize bat viruses and has a super-sekrit lab somewhere and that's why no one heard anything about this research, okay, I probably won't believe you but it's at least possible.  But if you tell me that research administrators got a huge new award going in record time AND no one talked about it at conferences, I cannot believe you because it contravenes the rules of a world I actually do know about.",,,,1632582632,{},he89mek,False,t3_pv5x9j,False,True,t3_pv5x9j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pv5x9j/the_lableak_debate_just_got_even_messier/he89mek/,1632711649.0,16,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

With people who cant get vaxxed or are immunocompromised - id reccomend social distancing and wearing an n-95, if your doctor agrees.

The covid vaccines effectiveness wanes after just 5 months. And drops to as low as 40% effectivness according to some studies.

Also 60%-80% effectivness simply means it's that effective every time you're exposed to it. The virus will be endemic. With enough exposure you'll eventually get a breakthrough case. 

I suppose years from now if the infection rate is so low and chances of exposure are so low some people may be lucky enough to avoid it.

I'm enjoying our discourse, though, and I don't get much adult conversation anymore. Haha


I think people on the fence would say it's leftist. I said the language appeals solely to the already vaccinated which reduces its reach and functionality. WE don't need persuading to get vaccinated; we already are if we are taking the time to read more than the title, most likely. Let's be honest, it's not an issue of a shot. It's an issue of being on the ""right/wrong"" side, with both sides fully believing they are 100% justified.  Regarding the article, I'm looking at it from a rhetorical perspective. It's redundant to call patients ""vulnerable"", because they wouldn't otherwise be patients if they didn't have some form of vulnerability. It's like saying ""adults beating on defenseless children."" Are there children with defenses adequate against a fully grown adult? No, and good journalism knows this. Using this adjective is an attack on the nurse. It then goes on to declare the mother is more worried about animals than her own children. This is deliberately polarizing and dehumanizing the unvaccinated. How are they supposed to respond to this? The second sentence goes on to say that everyone in New Mexico is equally selfish. From a writing perspective, it's entry-level rules to avoid generalizations. After all, how can one substantiate such a claim? All it takes with any generalization of this magnitude is to find one exception and the credibility of the author's entire argument gets called into question. ""My cousin lives in New Mexico, and she's vaccinated/nice/a saint...""

If the author had left out the slanted adjectives and the opinionated speech, this would have been actual reporting and useful for helping others make a more responsible and informed decision.

&gt; So it's about about the breakthrough cases that lead to transmission by vaccinated people, according to the posted Atlantic article. However, I thought the concern or confusion originated from this report that said viral loads in vaccinated people were as high as in unvaccinated people.

Every geneticist in my lab was mad at that paper for equating PCR values with viral load. PCR can tell you that both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals shed the same amount"" of viral particles, but can't tell you the status of these viruses. Are they viable, or inactivated, or completely destroyed but the PCR is still picking up the now loose viral RNA?

[],,zenon_kar,,,[],,,,text,t2_9fi18rm0,False,False,[],"I didn't say children don't die. I said that it's very unlikely, comparable in odds to the flu. You yourself mentioned statistics right? 5.5 million kids have tested positive. Many more would have been asymptomatic carriers. This is nearly 16% of all covid cases in the US. 22-23% of the US is under 18 so this is pretty well distributed. Counting asymptomatic cases we can say minors have a proportional rate of covid.

According to the CDC as of 9/22

Kids 0-4: 170 covid deaths
Kids 5-18: 374 covid deaths

https://data.cdc.gov/widgets/nr4s-juj3?mobile_redirect=true

Statistically these are not big risks. Many times more kids die swimming in pools every year than have died in 18 months of covid. Yet many parents still have pools in their yard and I don't see your outrage there. You wanted to talk about statistics remember. 

I'm not fearmongering, if you read what I wrote. I can't say what one is necessarily worse or better. And unless you have data you can't either. That's why I said we shouldn't judge parents for this, doing otherwise is based on the fearmongering you're discussing.

Is drinking soda worse than the vaccine? I can't say, but probably. I know having a pool is worse than kids either being vaccinated or not. My point here is that there are a lot of considerations here and I won't demean parents for struggling to find the right answer. Remember, not being vaccinated is the squo. You can't compare it to allowing them to drink soda as that is an action you take. Vaccinating is the action you take, not vaccinating is doing nothing. Uncertainties often encourage people to wait and see. 

I'm confused what you're saying here. A doctor messed up and hurt a baby which is probably slightly more common than the vaccines possibility of hurting kids, but I don't see how this matters to the discussion here particularly when I'm objectively not encouraging people to do or not do anything. Statistically, parents don't have to worry about their kids having bad outcomes from covid, but some few thousand did have bad experiences and a few hundred lost their kids. Will there be more or fewer kids having bad reaction to the vaccine? I dunno. Probably not. But I don't know. Which is why I'm saying don't judge parents having to make a difficult choice here.

Don't know what side you think I'm on about giving up. I think you're projecting a thousand other conversations onto me without actually engaging what I'm saying. Yes people have to take calculated risks. For some people they'll calculate the risk as being lower for their kids not to get vaccinated. Because some people do have bad reactions to every vaccine, no vaccine is 100% reaction free. And for most kids it's probably statistically as safe either way. Kids and adults under 40 or 50 without health problems getting vaccinated is comparable to masks. It's for the common good a lot more than it is for our own selves. Statistically, as you like to say.

I'm 31, personally. Got vaccinated as soon as I could. I had 5 days of flu like symptoms and a 103.5f fever. Statistically, that's worse than what I would likely experience from covid. Especially because I have 5 or 6 other mitigating factors that dramatically reduce my risk of serious covid. But I got vaccinated anyway to avoid being a carrier. There was no data at the time, and still isn't, about the vaccine preventing asymptomatic cases still leading to long covid. Which is common. I hope it will protect me from that but I can't say.

For kids, especially kids under 12, it's even far far far more on that side of balance. But kids at 5 can't decide to do things for the common good so it's complicated. And parents don't know the answers, you don't. I don't. So we should just be understanding. Because not being understanding guarantees they won't get vaccinated.",,,,1632602927,{},he9jasv,False,t3_puxrut,False,False,t1_he9g901,/r/Coronavirus/comments/puxrut/when_will_the_pandemic_end_models_project_a/he9jasv/,1632736941.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Okay, so you've backed off your wrong comments about what being forced means, and you're on to ""discrimination"" now. I'll tell you what discrimination *really* is: being treated unfairly for things you cannot control. A few examples: being a woman, being a minority, having a disability, being old, etc. The victim of *true* discrimination has no control over their circumstances. 

The difference with what you're claiming is you DO have control over your circumstances. You DO have a choice. You're imposing these restrictions on YOURSELF while the MAJORITY of sensible people have educated and informed themselves, and made the choice that benefits themselves as well as society as a whole. These societal benefits, in turn, provide extra benefits for the individual by extension. 

In other words, *the sensible majority doesn't want you around them*, potentially spreading lethal germs. YOU have chosen to cut yourself off from sensible people.

If India is one of the largest producer of vaccines, then what's wrong in claiming that? India has produced more than half a billion vaccines in the last 4-5 months. This certainly puts India among the top. They stopped exporting after April 2021 as they prioritized their own citizens, just like what USA or UK did.

As I said, I only saw articles which claims USA will procure a billion vaccines in the near future. Let's see that when that order comes in, I would really appreciate that. I am sure there are supply issues and these billion vaccines would be delivered over a year or so. After India is done taking care of its own citizens, there will be a ""rainfall"" (millions and millions) of vaccines to the COVAX; that's why India is an important player here.

As far as the Sputnik vaccine goes, I have not followed everything in great detail.

Indeed, it is unclear whether antibody production is protective or pathogenic in coronavirus infections. Early data with SARS-CoV-2 support these findings.

I think one factor contributing to Alaska's rapid growth in Delta variance spread is how HVAC systems are designed, especially in Interior and Northern Alaska. Forced air systems (that is, those with vents) are VERY rare, which also means that air filters are very rare. Even on the college campus, several buildings don't have any air handlers at all, only steam radiators for heat and sometimes chilled water for cooling. Outside air tends to rarely circulate at an acceptable rate through both residential and commercial buildings, which I think can increase viral load so much that breakthrough infections are becoming more common.

Example: I am currently at home with COVID... the two year old caught it (even though we are careful and he wears a mask), he gave it to the three year old, and ALL THREE fully vaccinated adults in our household (their parents with Pfizer and me with J&amp;J) now have breakthrough cases.

The risk is highly concentrated in about 15-20% of the population, and if we could somehow get 100% of them vaccinated, the overall risk to the population would be so low that it would not be something we'd have to worry about every day. The low risk people, whether vaccinated or not, are at very little risk, and the high risk people, if vaccinated are also at low risk.

But we have a group of people who are at risk but refuse to get vaccinated and those are the ones predominately showing up in the statistics. And the rest of society, which is an increasingly large majority, is significantly disrupting their lives because of this small minority.

These people will eventually either get vaccinated, become immune through exposure, or die off. If they don't get vaccinated that will take years, maybe many years. Meanwhile the lives of everyone else will be disrupted during this time.

I mean, yes, it is. But if you look at the estimates scientists made in the past 30 years its obvious that these were changed quite often, always according to new informations.

So i have no idea how you can think of climate change science as an example that shows that estimates hold true?

&gt;I don't see how this addresses any of my points...


It adresses the way you came to your conclusion/opinion.


&gt;You seem to be brushing aside the fact that variants can occur in vaccinated also, which will have the added bonus of becoming immune to the vaccinations, and likely more detrimental to those who are not vaccinated. A sub par roll out and a sub par vaccine during a pandemic in my opinion creates a perfect storm of conditions for a super virus to occur. 


Huh? Where am i brushing that aside?

I did say that vaccinated people can get infected, too. And i said that every infected cell bares the risk of becoming a new variant. The logical conclusion is that, yes, new variants can come out of vaccinated people, too.


But the risk of a vaccinated person getting infected is *signifcantly* lower. And even *if* they get infected, the virus has less cells he manages to succesfully infect. You seem to like stats, so you'll understand that a smaller total number of infected cells means less chances for new variants.


You, on the other hand, are brushing aside the possibility of eradicating the virus. If every person whose immune system isnt compromised or allergic to the vaccine would get vaxxed, the virus wouldnt find enough hosts to continue living. We saw that multiple times throughout history.

'But the flu!', you might be incined to say. But BEHOLD! 

The flu vaccine only got spread when there already were too many variants of it. There are 27 Influenca viruses in group A alone, and group B has 2 completly different lines itself.

This will eventually, sadly, also happen with covid, because people refuse to get vaccinated until its too late. Ironically, they probably will be tve first to shout, when their self-fullfilling prophecy comes true and we have new covid waves every year.


But we (probably) could have stopped it. But we didnt because some of us simply didnt want to.

&gt;This doesn't really address my original point...

&gt; The mobile vaccination clinic operated for four hours in the Arrowhead parking lot before the concert, and fans were offered a chance to get upgraded floor seats to the concert if they were vaccinated.

&gt; Brooks, who has said he is fully vaccinated, had encouraged his fans to get the shot.

Not to mention the near total lack of security, complete absence of medical presence and next to no searching. The guards let every other person in without checking their bags, the whole security seemed like high schoolers just shooting the shit.

The idea that these large gatherings are safe in any way is a complete joke. They weren't safe before COVID, they're extra unsafe now.

That includes covid, pneumonia and influenza, and less than 10k were confirmed influenza, and we have still been testing for it this whole time.


Some of these deaths may have been completely unrelated to covid, and bacterial (pneumococcal or  mycoplasm) pneumonia is not uncommon in the elderly, even with the vaccine that we have for pneumococcus. However I am willing to bet that most of those ~250k additional ""pneumonia"" deaths were a direct or indirect result of COVID-19 because that number is still triple what it would be in a ""normal"" year and a half (and that's without *any* preventative measures).


And don't forget people with strokes and heart attacks or blood clots who may have recovered from covid, but suffered some serious organ and tissue damage. That happened in young healthy people early on. I bet it is happening even more now with delta. And sometimes that takes time. How many covid ""survivors"" will be alive a year from now? 5 years? 


Often, covid is not even mentioned in the death certificate, especially if MEs/coroners are overloaded and don't have time to autopsy as many bodies as they should. And most rural places only have medical examiners, who are not as well trained as coroners. 


So in my (humble) estimation, we have already reached 1 million deaths in this country, possibly sometime in August, or even before then. It will probably take years before we have a good handle on the number of total deaths.

Everything you just claimed is demonstrably incorrect, fwiw. 

From the article:

&gt; “**The dive bars are vaccinated, that’s how you get to do it**,” Brooks said in a recent Facebook Live. “**So, the great thing about this is, [the fans are] vaccinated or they have to show a 3-day negative in-advance test.”**

And that Oklahoma tour stop you mentioned hasn’t even happened yet. But it **will** require vax cards and/or negative covid tests. 

&gt; [Garth Brooks has announced the next stop for his Dive Bar Tour will be **Monday, October 11th at the Diamond Ballroom in Oklahoma City (OKC).**](https://themusicuniverse.com/garth-brooks-announces-oklahoma-city-dive-bar-stop/)

That’s a great, fun little venue, btw. 

From that link: 

&gt; “So this is the first announcement coming of the dive bars that are coming. The string that’s coming,” he says on his Facebook Live series, Inside Studio G. “Why? Because you can get [the fans] vaccinated. You can have your vaccination card. You know everybody’s that’s in there and I think we’re working with Titan maybe, might be the company. You’ve also heard of Clear, another great company and these people just work to make sure the people who are in there are who they say they are. Everybody’s safe and this way we get to still play music.”

response to a primary vaccine series is likely to have waned over time

&gt;  
&gt;Most tracing of adult cases’ contacts would end on October 22nd, under the proposals to be considered by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) next month, The Irish Times understands.  
&gt;  
&gt;Under the proposed change to current arrangements, public-health specialists could still trigger contact tracing following a risk assessment of a particular case or cluster of cases. However, routine use of contact tracing would end.  
&gt;  
&gt;Nphet officials want to monitor this week’s decision to end contact tracing of asymptomatic cases in the classroom before making a final decision to end contact tracing of adult cases. Travel-related cases are also being monitored following the decision earlier this month to end flight contact tracing.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, there is confidence that the infection rate among primary schoolchildren will settle down over the coming weeks, despite the decision to allow close contacts not showing symptoms to attend school rather than having to restrict their movements at home.  
&gt;  
&gt;The plan to end most contact tracing is part of wider move towards normality in this phase of the pandemic, when more than 90 per cent of the population is largely protected against Covid-19 through vaccination or previous infection.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Government has set October 22nd as the date for scrapping most Covid-19 restrictions, provided the incidence of the virus remains stable or is falling.

I've had deep, intellectual discussions with people of faith (Christian or otherwise), and it seems to me they are mostly variations of organized efforts to instill a moral compass in people (or you could be cynical and say they're just means of controlling the masses).

Have you ever done something nice, even when no one was looking or no possible benefit could become of it for you--simply because you ""felt"" it was the right thing to do? If the answer is yes, then there's a part of your subconsciousness that makes you want to be a ""better"" person. That is--at least based on my understanding--what religious people practice on a daily basis in the name of faith.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We can say, at the very least, that the number of deaths from covid-19 that have resulted from the emergence of the delta variant in the United States appears to be slowing down. Two weeks ago, the country was seeing 1,524 deaths per day; one week ago, 1,943. On Wednesday, it was 2,085 — higher, but not much higher than the days preceding. It’s possible that the fourth wave of death the coronavirus has inflicted on the country is at last cresting.  
&gt;  
&gt;What’s remarkable about this wave, of course, is that it has already killed so many Americans despite the broad availability of tools both to effectively prevent and to treat the disease. Since the low in daily deaths July 7 — 213 — more than 77,500 more people have died. Of that total, more than 14,000 have died in Florida, nearly 1 out of every 8 who have succumbed to the disease.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s a remarkable figure, certainly, but one that becomes more remarkable when considering the broader context of the pandemic. From the first emergence of the virus in early 2020 until deaths peaked in mid-April of that year, New York was the state where the most people died of covid-19. During that period, 17,131 people in the state succumbed to the disease, according to data collected by The Washington Post. Through Wednesday’s peak (excluding more than 1,200 deaths reported by Florida on Thursday), Florida had seen 3 deaths for every 4 New York experienced before that first peak.  
&gt;  
&gt;That is three-quarters of the toll, even after better treatment options and the rollout of the vaccine.  
&gt;  
&gt;When adjusting for population, we see that the worst-hit states before the peak of each of the country’s four waves were the Dakotas, where more than twice as many people were dying relative to population than died in Florida during this wave. But the toll in Florida has been worse in recent months than it was in any of the other hard-hit states before the peak at the outset of the pandemic, including New Jersey.  
&gt;  
&gt;We can look at this another way. Here, the number of deaths in each state is represented by a circle. The circle for Florida in the fourth wave is the fourth-largest you’ll see; its death toll until the peak of the wave of new cases was exceeded only by New York’s initial toll and the number of deaths in Texas and California during last winter’s brutal surge in deaths.  
&gt;  
&gt;We’re comparing cases to peak because that’s (hopefully) where we are in this current wave of new deaths. If we look at the waves in their entirety, the number of total deaths of course continues to increase even as the number of daily deaths descends.  
&gt;  
&gt;If we look at the map using population-adjusted numbers per peak, we again see how the Gulf Coast has been disproportionately affected during the current surge.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s unquestionably grim and certainly tragic. But it’s also hard not to remember that so much of it was avoidable. Had more Floridians been vaccinated against the virus, they would have had much more protection against infection and hospitalization, much less death. Yes, the state’s population skews older, which plays some role. But it would nonetheless have been hard to imagine in June, as the country continued to add to its vaccination totals, that we would soon see a state that was ravaged by covid-19 deaths to the extent that a comparison to New York in the spring of 2020 even was relevant.

You still get the virus. If sick means you body fights a virus infection, then you still are sick. You don't ""get sick"" which is colloquial for systematic.

So with everyday speech one person would say lots of vaxxed people don't get sick. And that means those that got exposed do not develop systems. 

The truth is not everyone exposed will get infected because there is chance involved. And not everyone infected will have symptoms.

COVID-19 hospitalization and transmission rates are likely to remain at high levels through the fall, despite slight declines since peaks in August, according to new projections by the state Department of Health.

Washingtonians are at a critical moment in terms of how our actions can shape infection, hospitalization and death rates in the coming months, DOH’s latest COVID-19 modeling and surveillance situation report says.

The report found that COVID-19 prevalence — the percent of residents with an active virus infection — is at a new high at 0.94%, or about one in every 106 people in the state. The previous reported high was 0.64% this past August.

Transmission remains high but also has slowed, according to the state’s projections. At the beginning of this month, the effective reproductive number — or Re, which shows how many additional people each positive person will infect — was 1.14, compared to 1.49 at the start of August. A reproductive number above 1 means cases will continue to increase. To decline, the number must stay “well below” 1 for a “substantial amount of time,” the report says.

The drop could reflect increases in masking or other mitigation strategies as people became more aware of the surge in the delta variant, which accounts for close to all cases since mid-August.

“What this tells us is that our individual choices and behaviors today are going to determine whether or not our friends and families will have full access to health care in the near future, for any medical need, not just COVID,” Dr. Scott Lindquist, state epidemiologist for communicable diseases, said in a statement Thursday.

After peaking in August, the number of cases started to drop — continuing the downward trend through the Labor Day weekend — but have since rebounded, according to the report. Researchers say the recent rebound appears “sharper” among those 19 and younger, compared to those between 20 and 69 years old.

Testing shortages have also been reported across the state, though researchers said it’s not yet clear how they’re impacting case counts.

Deaths, meanwhile, are also increasing again in Washington. The seven-day rolling average of deaths has increased “rapidly” from five to 10 deaths per day in July to 27 per day by the end of August, according to the report.

Hospitalizations have started to decline after peaking at the end of August with about 190 daily admissions, though the change is small. Now, the seven-day rolling average is at about 186 hospitalizations per day. According to the report, current occupancy levels still “far exceed” those recorded during last winter’s previous highs.

Two COVID-19 scenarios The state analyzed possible scenarios based on two transmission rates — with drastically different outcomes.

In one, which assumes transmission stays constant over the next two weeks, hospital admissions could decrease by the end of December and eventually level off between 24 and 40 admissions daily. In the other, which projects a moderate increase in transmission through December, hospitalizations could increase to between 141 and 240 admissions daily, with between 1,100 and 2,000 beds occupied per day.

In the second scenario, increased travel and holiday gatherings, increased time spent indoors with people outside one’s household and school-related transmission could quicken the virus’s spread, even though widespread vaccination provides far more protection this fall and winter compared to last year. In this scenario, Washington’s rate of immunity wouldn’t be enough to control hospital admissions and occupancy, especially among what the state estimates is about 39% of the population susceptible to infection.

The number of beds occupied by COVID-19 patients is expected to fall in both scenarios through November and overall capacity is likely to remain tight as delayed care and staffing shortages continue. In addition, the state is predicting other viral infections, like influenza, to boost hospital admissions during the fall.

While “considerable uncertainty is inherent” in both scenarios, preliminary data provides some insight into how the fall and winter months might unfold, researchers said.

Washington’s overall immunity is increasing rapidly, however. Earlier this month, the state estimated our immunity was about 60%, from infections and from vaccinations.

“The current surge of patients is overwhelming our hospitals,” Lindquist said. “With school in session and flu season almost here, our best option for getting through the surge is to wear our masks and get vaccinated.”

The report’s recommendation for public health action was clear: Vaccinate to reduce COVID-19 transmission. Researchers also urged residents to wear a mask in public indoor settings and crowded outdoor settings, regardless of vaccination, and to get flu shots.

“In tandem, these actions will help prevent further burden on the health care system,” the report says.

V1:  
SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.617.2 (delta) is associated with higher viral loads \[1\] and increased transmissibility relative to other variants, as well as partial escape from polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies \[2\]. The emergence of the delta variant has been associated with increasing case counts and test-positivity rates, indicative of rapid community spread. Since early July 2021, SARS-CoV-2 cases in the United States have increased coincident with delta SARS-CoV-2 becoming the predominant lineage nationwide \[3\]. Understanding how and why the virus is spreading in settings where there is high vaccine coverage has important public health implications. It is particularly important to assess whether vaccinated individuals who become infected can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others. In Wisconsin, a large local contract laboratory provides SARS-CoV-2 testing for multiple local health departments, providing a single standard source of data using the same assay to measure virus burdens in test-positive cases. This includes providing high-volume testing in Dane County, a county with extremely high vaccine coverage. These PCR-based tests provide semi-quantitative information about the viral load, or amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, in respiratory specimens. Here we use this viral load data to compare the amount of SARS-CoV-2 present in test-positive specimens from people who self-report their vaccine status and date of final immunization, during a period in which the delta variant became the predominant circulating variant in Wisconsin. We find no difference in viral loads when comparing unvaccinated individuals to those who have vaccine “breakthrough” infections. Furthermore, individuals with vaccine breakthrough infections frequently test positive with viral loads consistent with the ability to shed infectious viruses. Our results, while preliminary, suggest that if vaccinated individuals become infected with the delta variant, they may be sources of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to others.  


  
V4:  
The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant might cause high viral loads, is highly transmissible, and contains mutations that confer partial immune escape 1,2. Outbreak investigations suggest that vaccinated persons can spread Delta 3,4. We compared RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) data from 699 swab specimens collected in Wisconsin 29 June through 31 July 2021 and tested with a qualitative assay by a single contract laboratory. Specimens came from residents of 36 counties, most in southern and southeastern Wisconsin, and 81% of cases were not associated with an outbreak. During this time, estimated prevalence of Delta variants in Wisconsin increased from 69% to over 95%. Vaccination status was determined via self-reporting and state immunization records (Supplemental Figure 1).",,,,1632534216,{},he61qsy,False,t3_publua,False,False,t1_he3630g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/publua/no_vaccinated_people_are_not_just_as_likely_to/he61qsy/,1632668173.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

One problem in Wisconsin and many other states is that the rural areas do not have many ICU beds so those sick folks might be sent to a bigger town or city. Some rural folks are more right politically leaning, Trump supporting types, so probably more likely to be anti-vaxx/anti-mask. Now they are getting so sick and taking up hospital beds not only in their hometowns, but nearby cities as well. It is such a mess we have nurses in every state quitting, hospital staff are being abused by these people...I don't blame them for quitting.

In my area there is a fairly popular local news piece that is going around. ""Local bar to close down after receiving death threats in regards to vaccine passport and mask mandates"". I guess it's important to know my area has a vaccine passport and mask mandate. The bar was a mid upscale bar.

Walking past quite literally the shittiest dive bar in my neighborhood last night. Hole in the wall doesn't even begin to cut it, because at least the hole has a plan. The place has a lineup outside the door. As I'm walking back with my Slurpee I notice that all the boomers are lined up outside with their vaccine passports ready to go, and fully masked up. Then I see their sign ""no mask, no passport, no liquor"".

I didn't go in, so I wasn't sure how packed it was inside, but it got me thinking.

Why the fuck are the lifer alchololics better at stoping the spread of covid than young ""educated"" individuals?

**I am sure there are many Doctors and researchers who would disagree with Dr. Hellerstein vis-a-vis antibody response.**  
**And we know MUCH more about COVID now than we did a year ago.**

**Anyway....**

[https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/11/09/coronavirus-vaccine-timing-doubts-impact](https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/11/09/coronavirus-vaccine-timing-doubts-impact)

But Dr. Marc Hellerstein, a vaccine researcher and toxicologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who studied at MIT, says he isn’t actually sure if he'll take one of these early vaccines.

“That’s a really good question. I might,” he muses. “I’d be worried though. I’d be worried about – do I have to get another vaccine in two years?”

Hellerstein is one of a small but vocal contingent of scientists that are warily watching the development of the coronavirus vaccine frontrunners. In general, they have two theoretical concerns about the first candidates, which could receive approval from the Food and Drug Administration sometime within the next year.

First, these vaccines focus primarily on creating antibodies – immune defense compounds that can neutralize the virus. Hellerstein says that might mean the vaccine’s protection is short-lived.

“This is what scares me – say you give some people a vaccine, and it just gets antibodies. A year later, they’re dying away because that’s how long these antibodies live. Six months, even less,” Hellerstein says.

Once those antibodies fade, Hellerstein says it’s unclear if the immune system will still recognize the coronavirus and mount a strong defense. Antibody levels often wane after the body recovers from an illness, but the immune system can typically create those antibodies again quickly if the same pathogen returns. Even so, Hellerstein argues a vaccine that focuses on T cells, a type of white blood cell that helps fight infections, might be more lasting.

In Hellerstein’s own research, he found that T cells created by the yellow fever vaccine were still effective decades after the vaccine was injected. And, Hellerstein adds, when researchers looked at people who had recovered from COVID-19, they found those who had only mild illness had fewer antibodies but more T cells. Hellerstein thinks that might mean T cells are more important for fighting off COVID than antibodies.

“The people with mild infection often don’t have antibodies at all. Those are the people we want to emulate. They won. They succeeded,” Hellerstein says.

Those people also created many different T cells that targeted different parts of the coronavirus, but the leading vaccine candidates provide the body with only one of those targets – the spike protein. This is the tool the coronavirus uses to infect and enter cells.",,,,1632597759,{},he97p4k,False,t3_pumf8f,False,True,t1_he96zte,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pumf8f/hosts_of_the_view_tested_positive_for_covid19/he97p4k/,1632729772.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's not enough to just prevent death, since non-deadly cases can still leave young healthy people with long term disabilities, both physical and mental. It's becoming increasingly clear that ""full vaccination"" for the mRNA vaccines is a three-dose course. Two doses were chosen somewhat arbitrarily and the 3-4 weeks separation between the two doses was chosen primarily for being able to rapidly conduct clinical trials. 

Don't get me wrong, having two doses even 8 months ago is still way better than no vaccination at all, but it's also silly to pretend that there's no issue when the data clearly shows that protection from two doses has decreased significantly from waning neutralizing antibody level and the prevalence of Delta which replicates significantly faster.

Your study fully admits that previously infected people were once again infected by delta. I'm just not following the logic that gets you to immunity to future variants.

As was been pointed out in the comments, there is selection bias in this study. People who survived a previous infection are obviously going to be a more hardy population. They've already weeded out the people in their population that are susceptible to the virus.

And finally, everyone knows both the vaccine wears off. It's a targeted dose. Just enough to protect, not too much to hurt you. Throw in booster shots, and you have a FAR safer plan for immunity than through infection.

They’d have to admit that their stance that “we’ll be living with COVID-19 forever, everyone will get it eventually, but don’t worry it will just be like getting a cold” is false reassurance.

They die [from flu as well](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/03/02/children-flu-deaths/). How do you know your kid is not going to be the one? Even if they don't die, how do you know that the disease will not leave some permanent side effects?

We don't know the long term effects on children of either the disease or the vaccine. We do know that it does have [potential to be problematic](https://www.healio.com/news/pulmonology/20210908/covid19-does-not-appear-to-impact-longterm-lung-function-in-children-young-adults):

&gt; Schlegtendal and colleagues concluded: “Pulmonary function is rarely impaired in children and adolescents after COVID-19, except of those with severe infection. The discrepancy between persistent respiratory symptoms and normal pulmonary function suggests a different underlying pathology such as dysfunctional breathing.”

I agree the chance is very low with children, but what's the point in deciding one is better than another when we still have no clue? It's just fear mongering. 
 
However, all you said makes sense, but distracts from the main point: these vaccines are *far* from the worst thing you can do to your kid. If you let your kid drink a can of soda, it's probably worse than getting them vaccinated. Yet, nobody talks about all these ""other"" things as if they don't regularly happen.

I've just heard of a friend of a friend. His wife went into labor. Something happened and the kid was left with a brain damage. I don't know (or even want to know - it's soul crushing tbh) the details, but initial signals point there was something wrong with the procedure the doctors did.

Even if in this situation it was not, I'm sure shit like this happens. It may have been preventable, but it happened. Wtf is this vaccine compared to this? It's all statistics. It's like we otherwise live under a glass dome, the world around us is perfectly harmless for our children, it's *only* this vaccine that will potentially ruin them. Yeah, right...

I can't control others and what they want to do, but I'm not at the same side as you. We cannot just give up and do nothing. We have to take calculated risks. I have no doubt this vaccine is as safe as it'll always be. There's not a single data point saying it's unsafe or that it'll get safer. If there were, [Pfizer wouldn't be sending it to FDA / CDC](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/20/1039071074/covid-19-vaccine-is-safe-and-effective-for-kids-ages-5-11-pfizer-says). 5 years down the road, they'll just have more data about it and that's it, while in the meantime people suffer or die for no reason.",,,,1632601586,{},he9g901,False,t3_puxrut,False,True,t1_he9cj7d,/r/Coronavirus/comments/puxrut/when_will_the_pandemic_end_models_project_a/he9g901/,1632735072.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anticonvulsants work on GABA rather than dopamine, and lithium works on the intracellular messaging system (I think).

I looked it up and I was wrong about childhood illness causing schizophrenia.  It's viral infection in pregnant mothers that increases the risk of schizophrenia.

I have a 10 month old child and have no problems with her being vaccinated with your average, everyday vaccines that children get, but don’t want her getting the Covid shot. I also won’t get it. I’m not in a high-risk group and am not worried about getting it. It’s just a fact that you still carry and spread it even with the shot so if I’m not worried about it because I’m relatively young (30), fit, and healthy, I don’t see a reason. The vaxx’s children are given that some people are against have been tested and proven for a very long time, the Covid one hasn’t.  We don’t know shit about the long term effects, and I’m pretty sure there’s a thing about children under 12 not even being able to get it. 

Listening to a molecular biologist talk about it in front of congress on cspan saying the vaccine not only isn’t effective against delta, and is only effective on the original virus for a short time, and has been showing signs of actually helping delta infect the body, cemented it for me. Please don’t take anything I said as me arguing with you or being shitty, I’m just saying I don’t think being against the Covid shot and being “antivaxx” are the same thing. I know plenty of other people that feel the same about normal, trusted, tested, vaccines but won’t get the Covid shot.

And for the record I absolutely do *not* trust our government, either party. Listening to Biden and Harris laugh about and talk shit about the vaccine when Trump was suggesting it, but now they’re pushing it, it’s all so fucked up.

The study recorded a total of 148,000 breakthrough cases, requiring 30,000 hospitalizations and 9,400 ICU admissions.  
  
Key Findings  
  
VE \[vaccine efficacy\] of both mRNA vaccines appears to wane over time  
  
VE against Delta breakthrough hospitalization (62%) exceeds VE against Delta infection (41%)  
  
Older age groups experienced further reduction in vaccine protection against hospitalization  
  
Hospitalization rate (20% vs 32%) and death rate (2% vs 12%) of breakthrough infections were lower than rates observed in COVID-19 cases in the pre-vaccination pandemic phase in 2020  
  
2.6% cumulative breakthrough rate  
  
20% hospitalization rate in breakthrough infections  
  
2.2% death rate in breakthrough infections  
  
As Delta variant became predominant, COVID-19 cases increased five-fold in the 65 years and older population  
  
In 80% vaccinated 65 years and older population, an estimated 73% of COVID-19 cases occurred in fully vaccinated individuals  
  
Breakthrough infection rates 5-6 months post vaccination are twice as high as 3-4 months post vaccination  
  
Age has a minor contribution to the reduced vaccine protection seen in the group vaccinated 5-6 months ago  
  
Waning immunity is seen with both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines during the Delta phase of the pandemic  
  
As the Delta variant surged to over 50% in June, COVID-19 hospitalizations more than doubled, reversing the prior trend of decreasing hospitalizations since April  
  
In this 80% vaccinated 65 years and older population, 61% of COVID-19 hospitalizations occurred in fully vaccinated individuals in the week of July 24th  
  
VE against breakthrough hospitalization is significantly lower 5-6 months post vaccination than 3-4 months post vaccination  
  
Rise of breakthrough hospitalization increases with time elapsed since mRNA vaccination with odds ratio increasing to 2.5 at 6 months post vaccination  
  
Older age is associated with increased breakthrough hospitalization rates  
  
VE of both mRNA vaccines in this 65 years and over cohort is lower than previously reported in smaller study sizes for both COVID-19 infection and hospitalization  
  
VE for mRNA vaccines is higher against hospitalization than against infection  
  
Prior COVID-19 infection has a major protective effect against breakthrough hospitalization  
  
Conclusion  
  
41% calculated VE against infection  
  
62% calculated VE against hospitalization",,,,1632521811,{},he5ap61,True,t3_putrdu,False,False,t3_putrdu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/putrdu/waning_effect_of_covid_vaccine/he5ap61/,1632654052.0,21,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

They’re the three most important aspects of brain health, specifically in helping to avoid further cognitive decline. If your body isn’t healthy, neither is your brain.

From there though, it’s all about creating new pathways through new experiences. A stagnant brain is a slowing brain, akin to how a stagnant body will be a slowing body. Things like brain-training games involving logic, memorization, etc. are great at keeping your mind active. Any board or video game that involves logic and puzzle solving is excellent as well. Reading is obviously excellent, but even watching new movies and documentaries can be, though to a less degree. Learning and experience new things is incredibly important. 

Traveling to new places, trying new food, even just listening to new music has its benefits. Learn a new hobby, socialize with friends, learn something new in general. It really is about giving your brain new experiences.

It’s also about being well rounded- do a combination of the above and swap it up sometimes. You want to challenge yourself and learn things. 

Personally, what I do is specifically aim to learn at least one new thing a day. Doesn’t matter what it is- if I’m not working on learning a specific skill, I’ll often pick a subject at random and spend 10-30 minutes reading up on it. Sometimes I just choose a wikipedia page at random, and from there, look at specific articles or journals related to the subject. Doesn’t really matter what it is, it’s just about learning something new. Having a specific goal involved is great, as is a plan, but I think the important part is just finding a way to challenge your brain, at least once a day, no matter what. Doesn’t matter if you dedicate 10 minutes to it or 6 hours, just make sure to give your brain that workout.",,,,1632521745,{},he5ajsn,False,t3_pul48q,False,False,t1_he3y7ms,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pul48q/preliminary_research_finds_that_even_mild_cases/he5ajsn/,1632653976.0,21,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well yes, that is how climate science works.

&gt;First of all, its a worldwide stat. That includes countries with many vaccinated, which of course doesnt matter if you only look at the numbers worldwide, but it gets interesting when you compare countries with different vaccination rates, as that gives you a better impression on how this will unfold in the future (and, depending on how you handle it, can change the google prognose in a drastic way).

I don't see how this addresses any of my points...

&gt;It also doesnt account for possible new variants. Its a fact that, the more unvaccinated people you have, the higher is the chance for a new variant to emerge.

&gt;Even if vaccinated people can get it, too, the virus has less cells to infect. And less cells means less chance of a mutation that eventually could become a new variant.

You seem to be brushing aside the fact that variants can occur in vaccinated also, which will have the added bonus of becoming immune to the vaccinations, and likely more detrimental to those who are not vaccinated. A sub par roll out and a sub par vaccine during a pandemic in my opinion creates a perfect storm of conditions for a super virus to occur. 

&gt;Now we get to the real interesting stuff: the comparision between countries that have a high vax rate, and countries with a lower vax rate.

&gt;How many of these unvaccinated people are estimated to die in which countries? How is the death rate in countries with higher vax rates?

&gt;Where do the new variants come from? How high is the vax rate there? How many unvaccinated died?

It doesnt make much sense that scientists tell people that they dont need to worry much about this virus once they are vaccinated, if it has long term effects we dont know.

So, my guess is that scientists figured that this virus is unlikely to cause long term effects or at least have a very good guess that this is the case.

For starters, laboratory experiments show that masks block the respiratory droplets and aerosols that transmit SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID. In one test, mechanical engineer David Rothamer and his team at the University of Wisconsin–Madison used a machine in a classroom to pump out particles of the same size as those that carry the virus.

I assume a response from the Plaintiffs will be forthcoming on that point.

**tldr: UA doesn't claim none of the employees are disabled, but rather that they haven't explained how they meet the ADA definition of disability (yet).**

When they talk about an initial 90% efficacy against BOTH symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, they are talking about the vaccine initially preventing 90% of infections, not simply a reduction in disease severity. This is what vaccines do. They don't prevent all infections, just the majority, which is why they reduce transmission rates and why you can typically get herd immunity without immunizing 100% of your population. Once infections are prevented, the virus has fewer and fewer pathways to propagate, so transmission chains break.

Period. 

Yes, it’s a highly effective **antiparisitic** but it has not (yet) shown to be effective in treating viruses like sars-cov-2. 

Like, *at all*. 

And yes, it’s being studied as a potential treatment for covid, *as are many other drugs*. To be sure, it has yet to gain EUA approval for treatment of covid-19. 

The CDC, WHO, etc advocate for use of Ivermectin in clinical trials. If anyone is interested in taking it to treat covid, [**please do whatever you can to participate in current medical trials**](https://www.nih.gov/health-information/nih-clinical-research-trials-you/finding-clinical-trial). Scientists *need* to have current clinical data. This is how it’ll win widespread approval if it’s found to be effective. 

In the meantime, please do not abuse livestock-grade Ivermectin to self-treat covid-19.

Ivermectin is *not* an antiviral.

It’s an anti-parasitic. There is not enough evidence (yet) to show whether it has enough antiviral properties to effectively or safely treat viral infections like covid-19. Clinical studies are currently underway. 

… 

Just a reminder:

Even Merck warns against taking it for covid, as it hasn’t been proven safe or effective for that purpose: https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/

And here’s a great explainer about the problematic data regarding its use as an antiviral, which is why current/ongoing clinical trials are so important: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/the-shaky-science-behind-ivermectin-as-a-covid-19-cure

Of course. But then the unvaccinated still should have been a much greater share of the outbreak than they were--*if it were true* that the vaccinated are much less likely to catch or spread covid.

&gt;If a majority of the people there were vaccinated, 75% of the infections being vaccinated is kinda a useless statistic.

It's not a useless statistic because 75% is remarkably close to the actual adult vaccination for Massachusetts in July. 

Back in early July, [62% of the population of Massachusetts](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/state/massachusetts) was fully vaccinated. That includes minors, of course. But in Massachusetts, [80% of the population is over the age of 18](https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/adult-and-under-the-age-of-18-populations-2020-census.html).  Out of 100 people, 81 are adults. Out of those adults, 62 were vaccinated. 62/80 = 76% of adults vaccinated. So it doesn't look like the vaccine made much of a dent.

There might be something about this demographic that would push their vaccination rate a little higher, but I can't see how it would be that much higher. These are largely younger gay men that go down there to party, and vaccination rates are lower for both younger people and men. They're gay, so you'd think leaning Democrat would push their rates higher, but [there's a lot of hesitancy in some LGBT according to the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/well/lgbtq-covid-19-vaccine.html). 

But even if it was as high as, say, 85% back in July, 75% of the infected being vaccinated isn't that impressive. It's an improvement, but not enough to say that vaccinated aren't spreading and shouldn't have to wear masks. 

&gt;Either way, that's one shoddy example among a ton of evidence of the vaccine doing a great job of preventing spread.

What makes it ""shoddy""? It's real world epidemiological data.

Well, if you turn out to be right, Good Luck living in the post apocalyptic world that results where civilisation collapses and the survivors can't keep the modern industrial world going and we revert back to a pre-industrial agrarian feudal society with no hope of ever climbing the industrial tech tree ever again because we have already consumed all the easy to access resources. We will then be in the catch 22 of needing the resources to re-develop the advanced tech but we need the advanced tech to be able to access the much harder to reach remaining resources.

Billions have and will be taking the mRNA vaccines so if we all drop dead or turn into vegetables in a few years, you survivors are %\^£$'ed either way. LOL. I certainly would rather be dead than live in that post apocalyptic future, so either its nothing to worry about and I don't have to worry about Covid either, or I don't live to see a scenario I would rather be dead for anyway.

On a policy level, there has to be some point where we are ""done."" For young people, pnemonia is more dangerous than covid - and our standards are not consistent. It gets complicated when we take in-process science and try to merge it with policy.

Like, it would be best if nearly everyone were vaccinated - but there are concequences to mandating vaccines.

Do you seriously just take an estimate based on the situation now as some kind of future telling? 

Lets view these stats with a bit of critical thinking:

First of all, its a worldwide stat. That includes countries with many vaccinated, which of course doesnt matter if you only look at the numbers worldwide, but it gets interesting when you compare countries with different vaccination rates, as that gives you a better impression on how this will unfold in the future (and, depending on how you handle it, can change the google prognose in a drastic way).


It also doesnt account for possible new variants. Its a fact that, the more unvaccinated people you have, the higher is the chance for a new variant to emerge.

Even if vaccinated people can get it, too, the virus has less cells to infect. And less cells means less chance of a mutation that eventually could become a new variant.


Now we get to the real interesting stuff: the comparision between countries that have a high vax rate, and countries with a lower vax rate.


How many of these unvaccinated people  are estimated to die in which countries? How is the death rate in countries with higher vax rates?


Where do the new variants come from? How high is the vax rate there? How many unvaccinated died?


These are question you *must* ask yourself if you view any data. Simply taking an estimate google tells you and, without thinking about it, believing that this is what will happen isnt the best way to form your opinion.",,,,1632523483,{},he5egr8,False,t3_ptxpft,False,True,t1_he5cm5i,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ptxpft/how_the_unvaccinated_threaten_the_vaccinated_for/he5egr8/,1632655933.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Schizophrenia, though always called a mental disorder, is not actually a mental disorder. It is a degenerative neurological disorder. The presenting psychosis, disorganized thoughts or catatonia are merely symptoms of the brain's deterioration. 

Historically, schizophrenia has boomed in populations during famine (it can also express when an advanced age father sires a child, but this discussion will focus on gestational nutrition). Many people carry the gene for schizophrenia; however, it has to be the mother who is malnourished during pregnancy for the gene to express later in the developing child. The effects of the gestational malnourishment does not manifest until the child's first psychotic break, usually at onset of puberty through age 25. 

A notable time in history when schizophrenia hit a population was during the Great Potato Famine in Ireland (85% increase!!!). There is also much higher instances of schizophrenic gene expression in the third world where famine is a constant, particularly certain African nations.

So, all that to say, I'm wondering if schizophrenics'  immuno-vulnerablity to CV19 poor outcomes began with their compromised fetal development. Perhaps something in their immune system is weak or absent because what was needed for certain immunities to develop never happened since they were likely malnourished during gestation.

Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder with hypomania or mania followed by depression. Psychosis can occur in mania or depression but NOT at baseline. Schizoaffective disorder is also a mood disorder but has psychosis at baseline with bipolar mood.
So from a DSM standpoint, schizophrenia is not in the same class (psychotic) as bipolar and schizoaffective (mood). The neurotransmitter component is still largely poorly understood, though similar medications can used to treat all three.
