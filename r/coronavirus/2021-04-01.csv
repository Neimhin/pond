I thought that was an interesting question so I researched it a bit. Brazil's flu is seasonal but far less so than in the US. Here's [a chart of flu deaths from the US](https://blogs.sas.com/content/graphicallyspeaking/2020/01/23/how-to-prepare-your-graphs-for-flu-season/), derived from CDC data. Instead of a modest decrease each summer, US deaths plummet to near zero.

Compare that to the coronavirus, where US cases went alarmingly high in the winter but the virus was still spreading pretty well during the spring and summer. While I'm not an expert in infectious disease, that makes me think the coronavirus is seasonal, but not as strongly as the flu.

&gt; Where I disagree is that you can have a bigger impact with COVID

I think it's pretty clear that if you're the one hosting a superspreader, you have personally contributed to many deaths that otherwise wouldn't have happened. Taking behaviors that avoid that seems prudent and morally required. But, if you're a carrier for COVID and you infect someone unknowingly at the supermarket, I don't think you are morally culpable. It seems like this is an argument against supporting fierce lockdowns a la Australia (where even your ability to infect someone at the supermarket was restricted) but doing things like international travel, and to that I would possibly agree.

But, a secondary point is that there's uncertainty on what will happen. If I have a 5% chance of hosting a superspreader that will end up infecting 100 people who otherwise wouldn't have been affected and 3 of them die, then hosting a party has an expected caused-death count of 0.15. But, that is immediate and now. Whereas, with climate change, can we be positive that things won't happen (say, carbon capture, or improvements in water desalination, etc) that won't lessen the impact there? I'm not a denialist by any means and think we should take the threat incredibly seriously. But I do think ""discounting"" events in the future makes sense due to uncertainty (this is how a lot of robotics algorithms work, for example).

I think we agree actually fundamentally on your overarching message as well as the morality of the situation.

I was definitely not expecting this. But it is worth noting that I do have stomach issues, similar to acid reflux where my stomach overproduced acid so I take an acid reducer every morning.

There  were no reports for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. To note, the current  analysis prints include data up to and including the 21 March.  
&gt;

So they found the mechanism at work, it occurred in multiple patients that had just received the vaccine, they had never seen it before except when drugs were the cause, and in these patients there were no other drugs that could explain it. It must be a pretty remarkable coincidence if for the first time they now saw these symptoms occur naturally, in multiple patients that all just happened to have just received the vaccine.

The journalist, in the ""unreliable"" newspaper, keeps pushing him asking if it is only highly probable, and why it can't be any other cause. But he keeps replying that he is sure, and that they know that the vaccine is the cause.

     ‚óèREQUIREMENTS FOR FDA APPROVAL‚óè

""By submitting a BLA to the FDA, a company is seeking permission to distribute and market a vaccine for use in the United States. FDA evaluates the data to determine whether the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine has been demonstrated and whether the manufacturing and facility information assure product quality and consistency. After its evaluation, FDA decides whether to approve (also known as to license) the vaccine for use in the United States. If FDA approves the vaccine, the company is permitted to market it in the United States for use in the population for which it is approved.
FDA makes its decisions based on its analysis of the benefits and risks for the intended population who will receive the vaccine, as well as the disease(s) to be prevented. FDA‚Äôs scientific team works collaboratively to evaluate all of the scientific data and information included in the BLA and makes the determination whether to approve a vaccine. A typical FDA team is comprised of: physicians, chemists, statisticians, pharmacologists/toxicologists, microbiologists, experts in postmarketing safety, clinical study site inspectors, manufacturing and facility inspectors, and labeling and communications experts.
In some cases, FDA seeks the input of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). This committee is comprised of a panel of outside, independent, technical experts from various scientific and public health disciplines that provide input on scientific data and its public health significance in a public forum. The FDA will consider, but is not bound by, the input received from the VRBPAC when determining whether to approve a vaccine.""

Hi, medical device regulatory professional here, previously worked in production and quality for contract pharmaceutical manufacturing as well. Manufacturer's must supply all design documentation, production process information specific to the device/drug, and information on their quality systems (these are the established business processes that maintain compliance with regulations and monitor the business for improvement). This isn't just a formula and list of instructions, equipment, and materials. Design is regulated tightly and requires much documentation. Clinical and analytical study data is specifically designed to test the limits of the drug or medical device. There are clinical efficacy studies, limit of detection and quantitation studies, studies to identify impurities, studies to make sure every piece of production equipment used in the process is compatible with the drug and that they don't leach unwanted chemicals. The same studies are done on glass vials for filling, which is quite relevant here.

When it comes to getting a supply of glass vials, it is no walk in the park either for a drug/device manufacturer. You have to find a suitable supplier, and you have to qualify them. That means an audit of the supplier and their own quality systems and production processes to ensure they are providing you with what they say they are. Certain suppliers in a drug process like this are considered critical, that is the material they supply ends up in the ""backbone"" of the product and has a direct impact on the patient or user. These suppliers require a higher level of scrutiny as your product depends on the performance of their material. Glass vials fall close to this risk level because they are ""product contact"" materials and have a direct impact on stability and impurity formation. 

So when you see a shortage in medical supplies or raw materials, there is much more than the production of those materials that come into play. There may be vials out there, but they may not be produced to the standards needed or the supplier can't prove it because they have bad systems in place to document their compliance with regulations. 

All of this, of course, is in the interest of public health and safety, which feels a bit odd when it is impeding public health and safety. Regulation isn't perfect, but without it we would have a lot more problems.

&gt;	Why not provide actual mental health...

I definitely can only speak to my own experience at my university, but we do indeed provide beefy mental health resources freely to all students in a big, updated, well-staffed facility.  Also the demand is really high.  They spun up a variety of new programs over the past year.  


&gt;	rapid covid testing ...with real positive efficacy

We provide this too, freely, repeatedly of course, and on-demand. We helped develop some of the nationally deployed tests in labs including my wife‚Äôs on campus.


&gt;	sanitation theater ‚Äî&gt; excess money

Solid question. We dug deeeeply into the university‚Äôs finance reserve to roll out NIOSH-rated and counterfeit-screened masks by the pallet, converted the output of our fancy new micro brewing/distillery program‚Äôs vats over to EtOH sanitizer production and distribution, etc.  Not quite wartime production shifts, but the closest I‚Äôve ever seen.


&gt;	vaccines available on campus

Yes, we shutdown athletics and devoted the arena to a campus/community mass vaxx site now run by the National Guard, approaching a thousand jabs a day.  Not bad for our small town.


&gt;	shuttle system

Yes, free and integrated with the municipal bus system.


&gt;	online system for appointments

Yes, in coordination with the county health department and a small army of travel nurses; they‚Äôre total badasses. Automated, spaced-repetition SMS reminders, email follow ups, and entirely run using personal QR code‚Äôs for chain of custody on health and identity data throughout.

&gt;	Saying that mostly-pointless sanitation theater helps students feel better is essentially treating them like they're stupid.

When my students tell me they feel better seeing sanitization, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm reporting to you. Granted, that‚Äôs not a representative sample in any sense, it‚Äôs just the uniformly positive set of anecdotes I‚Äôve received personally.


&gt;	their welfare is a priority when it really isn't

I genuinely disagree with this assertion but again I‚Äôm only speaking from my experience at my university.  We‚Äôve worked our *asses off* to hold the students‚Äô actual safety above literally everything else, freezing even emergency hires, all other reno/construction, ripping the process out of numerous research labs and groups to triage covid safety research and production processes above all else.


&gt;	The priority is lying to them.

This may even be documented at other universities, I don‚Äôt know, but we‚Äôve been brutally frank with our students; my group actually enjoys relating with our students quite a lot so it work out well.

At first they didn't want to give AZ to older people because it was less effective and those are the highest-risk.  Later the data came out showing a huge efficacy against hospitalization, so that was straight up reversed to get the elderly vaccinated ASAP.  Now there's actual data showing some minimal danger (at least one order of magnitude less dangerous than COVID) for younger people receiving it, so some places are stopping that.

In that context, I think this new recommendation is actually the best of the bunch: we have no finished trials on mixing doses (there are ongoing ones and there may be data on them), but it optimizes the use of the two vaccines.  In the same way that one mRNA dose after infection jacks antibodies up tremendously, one mRNA booster after a weaker vaccine is probably extremely effective.

What I find weird is that it's the AZ first dose that's caused all the clotting events in young people, so they aren't avoiding any risk by doing it this way.",,,1617320555,{},gt37aja,False,t3_mi2vpk,False,True,t1_gt2hovb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mi2vpk/germany_permanent_vaccination_comission/gt37aja/,1617322912,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

""All medicines, from vaccines to paracetamol, have the potential to cause severe side effects.

The seasonal flu jab has around a one-in-a-million chance of causing the nerve disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome.

So, the real question is: Are the risks worth the benefits?

Even if the vaccine was the cause, and this is still not proven, the numbers suggest around one death in every 2.5 million people vaccinated.

However, this has to be weighed against the known threat posed by coronavirus.

If 2.5 million 60-year-old people caught coronavirus then around 50,000 would die. If they were all 40-year-olds then around 2,500 would die.

This balance of risk and benefit will continue to be assessed as more safety data comes in and as the vaccine programme moves into younger people, who are at lower risk of dying from Covid-19"".",,,1617394980,{},gt6d636,True,t3_misogc,False,True,t3_misogc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/misogc/covid19_seven_uk_blood_clot_deaths_after/gt6d636/,1617395206,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In total, 30 people out of 18 million vaccinated by 24 March had these clots.

It is still not clear if they are just a coincidence or a genuine side effect of the vaccine.

The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency says the benefits continue to outweigh any risk.

However, concern has led to other countries including Germany, France, the Netherlands and Canada to restrict the vaccine's use only to older people.

The¬†data released by the MHRA on Friday¬†showed 22 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) which is a type of blood clot in the brain.

These were accompanied by low levels of platelets, which help form blood clots, in the body. The MHRA also found other clotting problems alongside low platelet levels in eight people.

Now the MHRA has confirmed, in an email to the BBC, that ""sadly seven have died"".

Dr June Raine, the chief executive of the MHRA, said: ""The benefits‚Ä¶ in preventing Covid-19 infection and its complications continue to outweigh any risks and the public should continue to get their vaccine when invited to do so.""

Investigations are under way to determine if the AstraZeneca vaccine is causing the very rare blood clots. Earlier this week the European Medicines Agency said it was ""not proven, but is possible"".

Two issues are raising suspicions. The first is the unusual nature of the clots which, including low levels of platelets and rare antibodies in the blood that have been linked to other clotting disorders.

""This raises the possibility that the vaccine could be a causal factor in these rare and unusual cases of CVST, though we don't know this yet, so more research is urgently needed,"" said Prof David Werring, from the UCL Institute of Neurology.

The other issue is the difference between the Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines.

There have been two cases of CVSTs after Pfizer in the UK, out of more than 10 million vaccinated, but these did not have the low platelet levels.

However, there remains uncertainty around how common these clots normally are. Estimates range from two cases per million people every year to nearly 16 in every million in normal times and the coronavirus has been linked to abnormal clotting, which may be making these clots more common.

Germany has reported 31 CVSTs and nine deaths out of the 2.7 million people vaccinated there, with most cases in young or middle-aged women.

Similar data on who has been affected in the UK has not been published in the UK, but a wider mix of people are thought to have been affected.",,,1617394807,{},gt6ctnv,True,t3_misogc,False,True,t3_misogc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/misogc/covid19_seven_uk_blood_clot_deaths_after/gt6ctnv/,1617395032,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

you don't experience symptoms of disease. you experience symptoms from your immune system. vaccines are extreme special cases, and designed to elicit strong immune responses. 1) they are packaged with adjuvants, which are basically molecules that will aggravate your immune system into reacting, and 2) they're a potent cocktail. vaccines carry A LOT of ""virus"" in them. for simplicity, imagine an infectious dose of covid-19 is like 100 viral particles. in comparison, the mRNA vaccines are packaging tens of millions mRNA blueprints for the spike protein (in reality, the true numbers are more logarithmic than this, but just for example purposes...). so of course your body really thinks it is under attack. it's sensing a very strong presence of something foreign that seemingly appeared overnight. your immune response to the spike protein from the second mRNA vaccine is going to be much, much more significant than if you were to come in contact with covid-19, because the magnitude of viral epitopes that your body is sensing is multiples more.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; B. If it's more symptomatic, this is NOT a good sign: you might be going into some kind of immune-system overreaction. Which is a BAD thing (hint: immune system overreaction is one of the ways Covid19 kills, lookup ""cytokine storms"") 

this isn't how this works. cytokine storm isn't an overreaction of your immune system per se, just your immune system damaging your body, which in turn elicits a stronger immune response, and then the cycle continues. it's a cyclical effect of a runaway immune system, and definitively not the case in any vaccine. these aren't similar at all, to be honest with you.

\&gt; C. finally, if 2nd time is worse than the first, then what about the 3rd? 

this is skipped a lot to be more simple for those with not much of an immunological background, but the 3rd is unlikely to be much worse than the 2nd. your body has an innate immune response, and adaptive immune response. for the 1st vaccine, your innate immune response reacts initially. once your adaptive immune response is primed (after the 1st vaccine), it will be the first on the scene for the 2nd shot.",,,1617390283,{},gt63rx3,False,t3_mi6e4f,False,True,t1_gt61s8x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mi6e4f/dont_freak_out_if_you_get_these_side_effects_from/gt63rx3/,1617390460,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The U.S. is killing it with vaccinations and one of the many reasons that's so great is it puts us in a position to export doses to countries that desperately need them, but I hadn't even thought of places not being able to cover the cost of administering them  as well.

&gt;The flow of vaccine doses Covax has supplied so far, in the face of funding and supply shortfalls, remains relatively manageable. Countries in need can, in theory, apply for funding to support distribution from donors including the World Bank and United States.

Okay so not too bad but,

&gt;She also worried about how limited resources would be allocated. Many African countries have a ‚Äúshockingly low number of health personnel per capita,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf we pull them all out to go and do vaccinations, then the rest of our health will suffer.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúThere is this misunderstanding that Covax vaccines are going to be sent to countries and then delivered to people‚Äôs communities,‚Äù said Ayoade Alakija, a co-chair of the African Union Africa vaccine delivery alliance. ‚ÄúCountries are receiving them at airports, and that‚Äôs where Covax‚Äôs responsibility ends.‚Äù

So countries will have the means to request funding to support distribution, awesome, but it's also up to the country to handle this responsibly and with a solid plan in place to make distribution work smoothly.

[],,KinnerNevada,,,[],,,,text,t2_m76zflk,False,True,[],"It started as a mini constellation of red dots near the right corner of my lips. Probably just ‚Äúmaskne,‚Äù I figured. I slathered on some acne cream and tried to forget about it.

But the inflamed, rashy spots didn‚Äôt fade away. In fact, they grew larger, spawning dandruff-like scales and flakes. Within days, the red dots had spread to the left side of my mouth, and even ‚Äî to my horror ‚Äî sprinkled across my eyelids. When I opened my mouth, I felt the raw, burning skin at the corners crack.

After a telemedicine visit with my dermatologist, I learned that I had perioral dermatitis ‚Äî a noncontagious facial rash that often shows up as clusters of tiny, scaly, red, uncomfortable bumps above irritated skin. ‚ÄúWe see it mainly around the mouth,‚Äù said Dr. Anna Chien, a dermatologist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ‚ÄúSome people can have similar breakouts around the eyes.‚Äù

Cases have become more common since the coronavirus outbreak began, some experts say. In one Canadian survey of 77 dermatologists published in September, more than a third reported either a large or slight increase in perioral dermatitis instances since the beginning of the pandemic.

‚ÄúIn our clinic,‚Äù Dr. Chien said, ‚Äúwe are seeing many more perioral dermatitis and other rashes related to masks.‚Äù Dr. Jessica Sprague, a dermatologist at the U.C. San Diego School of Medicine, noted a similar phenomenon. ‚ÄúMasks alter the skin environment, and they can also cause a lot of skin irritation,‚Äù she said, adding, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm definitely seeing it more now in the setting of mask wearing.‚Äù

What causes it

Perioral dermatitis might look a lot like acne, but the resemblance is deceptive, said Dr. Carrie Kovarik, a dermatologist at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the American Academy of Dermatology‚Äôs Covid-19 task force. ‚ÄúPeople confuse it with ‚Äòmaskne,‚Äô and they are two different things.‚Äù

With mask-induced acne, your pores get clogged with dirt, skin flakes or oil, giving rise to inflamed cysts that may burst. But perioral dermatitis is more of an inflammatory rash. There can be various causes, but it tends to be triggered by a disruption of your skin‚Äôs natural equilibrium, Dr. Sprague said, from the use of topical substances like steroid medications or irritating cosmetics.

The humid, enclosed space behind a mask may also encourage perioral dermatitis rashes to form. ‚ÄúDepending on what kind of mask you‚Äôre wearing, you could really have a lot of moisture sitting there on your face,‚Äù Dr. Kovarik said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre almost creating this skin fold-type area,‚Äù a little like the damp crevices that can form between rolls of skin.

That can modify the face‚Äôs natural microbial balance, research suggests, contributing to perioral dermatitis and related conditions. ‚ÄúWhen you wear a mask, you‚Äôre basically changing the terrain,‚Äù said Dr. Whitney Bowe, a dermatologist based in New York.

This can encourage or discourage the growth of certain microbes, like bacteria and yeast, which may be involved in perioral dermatitis, and can touch off ‚Äúthis cycle of making the disease even worse,‚Äù Dr. Kovarik said.

The rash appears most often in adult women, but can also crop up, albeit less frequently, in young children. Unlike cold sores, perioral dermatitis bumps are not thought to be caused by a specific virus and usually do not migrate onto the lips themselves.",,,1617381847,{},gt5mtbi,True,t3_mio57i,False,False,t3_mio57i,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mio57i/your_maskne_might_not_be_acne_at_all/gt5mtbi/,1617381914,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Note that because none of the vaccines are approved, once the declaration of emergency is removed, doctors will no longer be allowed to administer these vaccines. Also, the reason why schools and states are not allowed to **require** a person take these vaccines is because they are not FDA approved.

In principle, I agree, because we should all individually do our part to stop variants being created. In practice, I'm inclined to think that *maybe* one of the other 7 billion people you share the earth with is more likely to create that dreaded vaccine-escaping variant, and maybe we're all a bit helpless in that regard.

Reality: Variants are overblown because they get people hooked by the media. They're a wonderful cash cow for these companies. They pose a threat, but are likely to be a small factor in all of this, because vaccines will still largely prevent hospitalization and death and even most cases. Virologists are concerned about them, but a lot of experts  are concerned about a lot of things. That doesn't mean you need to be. If variants make an impact, it'll probably be through prolonging the tail of the pandemic, not through a dramatic surge. You'll be back to hugging grandma and COVID deaths will have been background noise for a while, possibly years.

&gt; People with HIV infection or other immunocompromising conditions or people who take immunosuppressive medications or therapies might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19. No data are available to establish COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy in these groups. However, the currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines are not live vaccines and therefore can be safely administered to immunocompromised people. People with stable HIV infection were included in the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, though data remain limited.

&gt; Immunocompromised people can receive COVID-19 vaccination. Data are currently insufficient to inform optimal timing of COVID-19 vaccination among people who are planning to receive immunosuppressive therapies. However, based on general best practices for vaccination of immunocompromised people, ideally COVID-19 vaccination should be completed at least two weeks before initiation of immunosuppressive therapies. When it is not possible to administer a complete COVID-19 vaccine series (i.e., two doses of an mRNA vaccine or a single dose of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine) in advance, people on immunosuppressive therapy can still receive COVID-19 vaccination. Decisions to delay immunosuppressive therapy to complete COVID-19 vaccination should consider the person‚Äôs risks related to their underlying condition.

Group 6 was invited for vaccinations around the time AZ started making up 50% of all doses administered in February. We're now working through Group 9, which was allowed to go ahead in March.

Now, as you can see, my guess isn't unreasonable. Even if AZ only made up 30% of all vaccines given to under 55s, it would be 2.85 million young people.

meanwhile in Texas, I got my *second* shot like 6 weeks ago. and although I legit qualified for my shots, the county Mega Clinic where I got it didn't even ask what my condition was. I could have been age 18 and healthy as hell -- no matter, ""just get shots in arms baby""

Three have died in the past three days. The vast medical complex is turning away critically ill patients from smaller towns nearby for lack of space.

&gt;With France now Europe‚Äôs latest virus danger zone, Macron on Wednesday ordered temporary school closures nationwide and new travel restrictions. But he resisted calls for a strict lockdown, instead sticking to his ‚Äúthird way‚Äù strategy that seeks a route between freedom and confinement to keep both infections and a restless populace under control until mass vaccinations take over.

&gt;The French government refuses to acknowledge failure, and blames delayed vaccine deliveries and a disobedient public for soaring infections and saturated hospitals. Macron‚Äôs critics, in turn, blame arrogance at the highest levels. They say France‚Äôs leaders ignored warning signs and favored political and economic calculations over public health ‚Äî and lives.

&gt;‚ÄùWe feel this wave coming very strongly,‚Äù said Romain Beal, a blood oxygen specialist at the Amiens-Picardie Hospital. ‚ÄúWe had families where we had the mother and her son die at the same time in two different ICU rooms here. It‚Äôs unbearable.‚Äù

&gt;The hospital‚Äôs doctors watched as the variant ravaging Britain over the winter jumped the Channel and forged south across France. Just as in Britain, the variant is now driving ever-younger, ever-healthier patients into French emergency rooms and critical care wards. Amiens medics did their best to prepare, bringing in reinforcements and setting up a temporary ICU in a pediatric wing.

&gt;After Britain‚Äôs death toll shot higher in January, after new variants slammed European countries from the Czech Republic to Portugal, France continued vaunting its ‚Äúthird way.‚Äù

&gt;French scientists‚Äô projections ‚Äî including from the government‚Äôs own virus advisory body ‚Äî predicted trouble ahead. Charts from national research institute Inserm in January and again in February forecast climbing virus hospitalization rates in March or April. Worried doctors urged preventative measures beyond those that were already in place ‚Äî a 6 p.m. nationwide curfew and the closure of all restaurants and many businesses.

&gt;Week after week, the government refused to impose a new lockdown, citing France‚Äôs stable infection and hospitalization rates, and hoping that they would stay that way. Ministers stressed the importance of keeping the economy afloat and protecting the mental health of a populace worn down by a year of uncertainty. A relieved public granted Macron a boost in the polls.

&gt;But the virus wasn‚Äôt finished. The nationwide infection rate has now doubled over the past three weeks, and Paris hospitals are bracing for what could be their worst battle yet, with ICU overcrowding forecast to surpass what happened when the pandemic first crashed over Europe.

If the WHO is nagging about the bad vaccination pace in the EU, my blood starts to boil: at least we do export!

The US is all about how good their programme is running: yeah, no export (though they don‚Äôt call it that because it looks bad, they just say they activated the Defence Act or something). Recently loaned (loaned!) vaccines to Canada and Mexico. Also recently said they might not need the AZ vaccine even though they are sitting on a stockpile of 30 million I thought.)

The UK doesn‚Äôt export but they call it ‚Äúwe were first!‚Äù (Or other words: being selfish, ‚Äúwe called dibs on the first 100 million AZ vaccines‚Äù). The EU has exported 10 million vaccines to the UK, btw. 

So, besides India, China and Russia, the EU is the only Western country/institute that does export and does so at the cost of their own programme. 

It‚Äôs cool to bash the EU: haha, they were late/cheap. Truth is: we honour our deals when it comes to Covax. Not a single export ban was issued when there was proof the vaccines went to that initiative. 

You can discuss our AZ attitude and how we blocked 250,000 vaccines to Australia (which, imo, was very wrong to do) but in the end the conclusion is AZ is inept, shady and borderline nuts but we need them so there‚Äôs nothing much we can do. 

The solution for the EU would be easy: every vaccine from Pfizer stays in the EU (there are only 2 Pfizer factories in the world I believe: The US with no exports and the one in Puurs which can export). They don‚Äôt do that because it would be unfair to the company and the entire world.",,,1617351679,{},gt4fcnt,False,t3_mhw6z5,False,True,t1_gt31f9z,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mhw6z5/eu_seeks_10_million_astrazeneca_vaccines_from/gt4fcnt/,1617351689,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;Through its COVID-19 vaccine partnership with the U.S. government, Moderna picked up nearly $1 billion in research aid. Now, it's joining a list of other companies to take a supply order from the federal government.

Under a deal worth up to $1.525 billion, Moderna agreed to deliver 100 million doses of its mRNA vaccine candidate if it succeeds in late-stage testing. The deal doesn‚Äôt stipulate a timeline for vaccine shipments, at least publicly, but does include ‚Äúincentive payments for timely delivery,‚Äù Moderna says. The pact also includes an option for another 400 million doses.

Are you honestly telling me that you think that Russia doesn't interfere to the same degree as the US (or to an even greater degree) in the affairs of other countries? They are both just as bad as one another in that regard, so far as I am concerned, and I can provide lots of examples to boot. I'm not commenting on the extent to which the EU is dependent upon the US (although for vaccine I think not so much otherwise things would be going a bit better); NATO isn't relevant to this conversation as it is a military alliance, developed to rival the Eastern bloc originally-- having nothing at all to do with vaccine production/distribution or generally any economic concerns.

I'm not more skeptical of Russia as a general rule, however I would observe several items:

1. Russia is a country that is run by an authoritarian regime (whereas most of the EU and the US are democracies, no matter how imperfect they might be at present). Part and parcel with authoritarian government comes corruption, and more importantly a lack of accountability to the broader population-- since they don't have genuine elections, they therefore do not have accountability to voters. Because of this, I would question any authoritarian country's vaccine development more closely, because for aforementioned reasons they do not have an adequate accountability to ensure that their vaccines are both safe and effective. 

2. The second reason, and related to the tail of reason number one, the two large authoritarian superpowers, China and Russia, both developed vaccines but started to role them out without having completed phase 3 testing benchmarks, as set by the WHO, and the broader scientific community. While I would say it is likely that these vaccines still end up being fine, it demonstrates what I have said above-- that these countries have no level of accountability or transparency to their citizens, which would make me skeptical that their vaccines meet the level of rigor that the broader scientific community would generally expect when developing a new vaccination.",,,1617324545,{},gt3eegq,False,t3_mhafzh,False,True,t1_gt0fkm0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mhafzh/brazil_records_3668_deaths_in_24_hours_and_breaks/gt3eegq/,1617326157,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Here in Norway the experts concluded weeks ago that the vaccine was the cause for the blood clots. I agree that as a rule always ask if people confuse correlation with causation. But don't be a robot that always automatically assumes this is what has happened. In this case, it is not what has happened.

The below link is in Norwegian, but the chief physician and professor, P√•l Andre Holme , who led the group looking into it says, unconditionally, ""We know the cause. And it is nothing else than the vaccine than can explain this immune reaction"".

The cases involved symptoms they had never seen before, in anyone. Which seriously weakens the argument/question: ""this happens sometimes anyway, how do we know it wouldn't have happened anyway?"" And these symptoms then was seen in multiple patients that had just received the vaccine.

&lt;-- *Here the link was when I first wrote this post 9 days ago, but it was deleted because according to the mods Norway's largest newspaper, VG, is unreliable.  The reason given is that it is tabloid, which is true if you defined tabloid only by the size of the paper it is printed on. But VG is as mainstream and reliable as any other paper in Norway. And I'm willing to debate anyone on this*. *But the rules must be respected, even when they are wrong.*  \---&gt;

I found a link to Aftenposten  the exact same quote is found there: (*First a bit more whining: I think it is the font used for the newspaper's name that makes some people think it must be more serious, grown up, reliable and ""real"" than for example VG. I wish people would evaluate the actual contents in the newspapers instead of relying on such cheap heuristics*)

It might of course, most likely I would think, be that the risk still is so tiny that it is best to keep using it on a population level. But, two things to consider:

First, young people who have an very low risk of getting seriously ill from covid-19 itself, are the ones who has been getting sick from the vaccine. Actually, it was young women who suffered these side effects. I'm still not convinced the risk from the vaccine is smaller than the risk from corona virus in these otherwise young and healthy patients. Both risks are very small.

Second, there are multiple alternatives. And I am not convinced AstraZeneca is equally good as the others. Given all of this, why would a young woman choose AstraZeneca if she had other options?

Reading between the lines in the news stories and press releases, I am seeing lot of people concerned about the public health at large, vaccine skepticism etc. And this ""colors"" their opinions on this issue. They  are concerned about the optics of talking about lethal side effects of a vaccine while we are in the midst of a pandemic. I too am convinced that the AstraZeneca vaccine will help in fighting the pandemic . It is a good thing that is is out there being injected.

But I'm not going to dismiss the possibility that for young healthy women that are so lucky that they have other options, it might be better to choose another vaccine. And if it turns out that the risk of taking the vaccine in this particular group of patients is larger than the risk from the disease, they shouldn't even be offered the vaccine. I don't care about any inconvenient optics in that case.

I live in an area surrounded by plague rats and I'm concerned that once they start catching on that people can get away with doing w/e just by saying they're vaccinated that they'll drop what little guidelines they do follow. 

It's disappointing to see the same groups of people who've advocated for everyone to pull together to beat this now do what covid deniers did a year ago and hear whatever they want to hear that lets them justify living their life. The sacrifices people like me have made seem to mean absolutely nothing to this crowd because all they see in areas like mine are hopeless plague rats.

I wish my concerns wouldn't be written off as fear mongering as often as they seem to be.  I've been stuck inside with a high risk kid for over a year now and I'd like her to have a summer this time around. I'm worried that us jumping back into normal-ish behavior will cause areas like mine to become hot spots and possibly lead to mutations that make the vaccines less effective.

1) Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is that an attack on one member state is seen as an attack on all member states. The only time it was triggered thus far is by the US in response to 9/11.

2) What matters is not so much how many people have died, that is a sunk cost, nothing to be done about it. What matters is how many lives you can save, vaccinating at risk elderly in Canada will definitely save more lives than vaccinating Virginian youth. If you see Canadian lives as as important as American lives (or even just 1/5 as important with the current relative mortality), then the rational thing would be to allow some exports instead of a complete ban.

3) I don't feel like your action is necessarily problematic nor do I have any problem with your actions.

As long as the American public is completely indifferent about human rights outside its borders, nothing will change.

The only reason shots are going into arms today is because 1) a lot of the work was actually done in advance by scientists who were thinking ahead for the next pandemic that nobody had on their radars; and 2) the Emergency Use Authorization.

The pace from identification of the virus to IND filing was impressively fast, spurred on by developments made in SARS1 and MERS CoVs, especially the stabilized spike proteins and mRNA process. However, while this was very fast this time, this part usually doesn't take a whole lot longer than a year or two.

However, you're missing the most important part in the speed from IND filing to Phase 3 readout, which is the part the takes several years: the number of infections in the community. Most vaccines spend ages in phase 3 waiting for enough infections to reach appropriate statistical power. But with COVID ripping through the population we barely had to wait 5 months to get there.

The US, is at 66,000 cases on average per day currently, and rising. Also, they are around 980 deaths on average per day currently, and stable. And the US has vaccinated around 30% of the population with a first dose.

So the difference is interesting. The Netherlands has 2,5 times the cases compared to the US (keep in mind that the Netherlands does not test a lot, 8.5% positivity) and vaccinated one third of what the US has, but they have half the deaths and are still dropping (keep in mind the Netherlands has lower overall mortality than expected the past 4/5 weeks) while the US is not dropping anymore.

A similar discussion could be made for *mild* patients. *Mild* here means you don't have to go to the hospital and occupy/use health resources, it doesn't mean mild as getting a cold. You can be sick for 20-30 days, getting pneumonia, etc., and recover being considered ""mild"".

I've read that there are no dumb questions, only dumb answers.

I also understand that the Corona virus is simpler as the Flu virus and won't probably mutate that much. Some even think that all places where it can mutate to something more effective are already been shown. If that is true, you would think that a yearly altered vaccine for Corona is less needed then that for the Flu, because Corona doesn't  change that much.

Of course there are other factors: maybe the vaccine works only x time and you need to get a new one, or not all people have taken a vaccine yet.

Also they are already working on combinations vaccines (1 shot for flu and corona). Or a pill or spray (at least nanobodies, but that is a medicine) instead of a syringe.

And with the gained knowledge there could also be new, better flu vaccines that will help longer then the current ones (maybe even vaccines agains AIDS or some cancers).

Sure, it is still a small percentage of death when compared to the number of people infected, but the issue is that the variant infects much more people at the same time, sending much more people to the hospitals and needing ICU care at the same time, which collapses the health system.  

The only exit is to vaccinate people, and do lockdowns/stay at home/only leave for the necessary and always using masks, alcohol and keeping your distance.  

In brazil, though, there is a lot of misinformation spread by conservatives, including the president, that don't like to take these precautions and want the city opened like normal, insisting on ""preventive treatments"" that doesn't work, which leads to people be more relaxed to go out, resulting in the situation we are now that you cannot have any other emergency in your life that needs ICU because the ICUs are completely full of Covid patients.

Yes and what I'm meaning to say is that, because of this deviation that was brought up some people may reach immunity on day 14, some might reach it on day 10, some mutant might even hit it on day 5 while others will need the full 6 weeks *or* possibly even longer **YOU HAVE NO IDEA WITH OUT ACCESS TO ADVANCED MEDICAL EQUIPMENT**. 

Unless if you specifically have an anti-body test proving your safe before the 6 week mark, then you have no real way of knowing if you are immune yet or not, and you wont find out until you are infected. 


**IF you decide to follow your intuition ( because it is not an exact science ) and not the scientists who research this by letting your guard down before 6+ weeks, then you run the risk of INFECTING EVEN MORE PEOPLE**

The point of the vaccine is not really to protect any one individual, but to bring the r0 down below 1 so COVID can't survive in the population.  So even if you, personally, do not get full immunity, dropping it by 2/3 will reduce the risk of the entire population.  If that collective risk gets low enough, nobody will need a mask, social distancing, etc.

I don't really have any further opinion, because I am not entirely sure what they mean when they say 80% immunity, 66%, etc.  The implications of 66% immunity hinge absolutely on what it means to have it.  If it means you have a 66% chance to be more or less immune, then you might be OK to roll the dice.  But if it means it takes 1/0.34 times as much virus to infect you, you better keep up every precaution, for your own good, because you will probably eventually get (and spread) it.

I don't know who you are, but I'm thinking of you and hope you can find the strength to still become the person you want to, when you are ready.

My personal experience (pre-covid) is losing two of my best friends to a sudden car accident nearly 5 years ago.  It took me years to finally be at peace with it, and by that I mean, stop thinking about it over and over again or being down because of it.  I'm in my late 30's and best friends are very difficult to find as it takes years of trust, companionship, activities, etc... to feel that close to people we love.  I spent nearly every day with them and still miss them but changed my mindset to just flat out accept it as I wouldn't want anyone losing their mind or their love of life and losing grip on goals, etc.... 

It's not easy.  It is not easy at all.  I started thinking of the good times and really try to picture them while I fall asleep just hanging out hoping that I can get that thought to pop into my dreams.  Sometimes it works and when it does, I wake up with a big smile being able to see them again, even if no words are exchanged.  Sometimes I can get my brain to give them a hug, other times I am able to have a conversation like I'm catching them up on what has happened recently.  

Regardless, I hope you are able to find the peace that is too difficult to find in the times we need it most.

Part of the reason we need to keep doing masks and distancing after our shots is because it‚Äôs easier to just say ‚Äúeverybody keep doing it‚Äù than to enforce different sets of rules effectively. There‚Äôs still plenty of risk out there for unvaccinated folks, so we need people in that group to continue following guidance until they get shots. That will be tough to pull off if we start having tiered restrictions. There‚Äôs plenty of overlap between groups who‚Äôve been anti-mask/anti-restrictions, who are anti-vax or hesitant to take this particular vax, and people freaking out about a potential vaccine passport somehow being more invasive than a regular passport or travel visa. There‚Äôs a chunk in there that‚Äôd be more than happy to lie about their vaccination status to not have to follow restrictions. Vaccines mean we will get back to normal if enough people take them and follow restrictions in the interim, but it‚Äôll take a bit. Not the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù people whine about, but real normal. The ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù some fight against is more the ‚Äúnew temporary shitty reality‚Äù that we can end sooner if people play by the rules.

One observation I've made throughout this pandemic is the degree to which people don't understand how slowly the scientific process works - particularly when you're doing something that involves public health impacting hundreds of millions or billions of people.  In any normal situation, before the CDC so much as utters a word, it usually comes after *years* of rigorous scientific research, experiments, debate, etc.

But because of the amount and rapid pace of death and suffering that COVID-19 has wrought on the globe, we're instead all participating in a real-time scientific experiment of sorts and everybody - including the scientists and politicians - are learning as we go.

For example, the FDA usually takes many years, decades even, for the vaccine approval process.  The only reason shots are going into arms is because of the Emergency Use Authorization.

Naturally, people want perfect information at the fastest possible speed.  ""What's that?  A study came out showing that the vaccine is 90% effective?  OK, that's settled!""

Well no, that's not how science *usually* works.  Other people look at that study, analyze the results carefully, create studies of their own to replicate the results, debate methodologies for measuring results, and etc. etc. for *years* before a consensus forms.  That's the world Fauci is coming from.  

And when you're making statements that impact the behaviors of hundreds of millions of people - yeah, there's an urge to pump the brakes on making conclusions lest you get something wrong and thousands of people get sick and die as a result.",,,1617379292,{},gt5hmdv,False,t3_mikbdd,False,True,t1_gt5cpmp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mikbdd/dr_anthony_fauci_does_not_expect_a_4th/gt5hmdv/,1617379323,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

EUA is a faster process overall, for reasons including but not limited to that it doesn't require quite as long of clinical trials as getting a full BLA. Obviously all of the vaccine companies applied for EUAs because they wanted approval as fast as possible and because they were on an accelerated trial timeline. It seems like what is particularly abbreviated in the EUA vs full BLA approval is efficacy.  For the EUA you only need to show that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks.  There's a higher standard of efficacy required for full BLA approval. So that's why they applied for the EUA in the first place vs BLA approval.   


Now that they have the EUA, which will continue to be valid for the forseeable future, they have to reason to spend the time and money required for the BLA. It's almost like asking a renter why they don't own their apartment yet - it's an entirely different process.  Presumably there will come a time when the EUA will no longer be sufficient because the health emergency will be deemed over, but I'm sure the companies are on top of that and will make sure to have the necessary approvals by that point.

Secondly I think the side effect of the AZ vaccine is technically not the same type of blood clot as from birth control pills.
 
2: There is no intent to force people to take birth control pills, but there is a movement to force people to vaccinate themselves to protect other people.

You're thinking very two-dimensionally here.  It's not that Pfizer doesn't ""want"" their vaccine to get full approval, it's that they don't need that right now because they have an EUA.  Submitting for FDA approval is a very costly process, in both time and money, and there's no reason for them to do that at the moment.  Now, I am not saying that all they need to do right now is apply and then approval would be granted.  I don't know the answer to that, and I don't think the FDA does either (for the reason I gave above).

&gt;Preclinical studies have created hope that mRNA vaccines will fulfil many aspects of an ideal clinical vaccine: they have shown a favourable safety profile in animals, are versatile and rapid to design for emerging infectious diseases, and are amenable to scalable good manufacturing practice (GMP) production (already under way by several companies). Unlike protein immunization, several formats of mRNA vaccines induce strong CD8+ T cell responses, likely owing to the efficient presentation of endogenously produced antigens on MHC class I molecules, in addition to potent CD4+ T cell responses56,87,88. Additionally, unlike DNA immunization, mRNA vaccines have shown the ability to generate potent neutralizing antibody responses in animals with only one or two low-dose immunizations20,22,85. As a result, mRNA vaccines have elicited protective immunity against a variety of infectious agents in animal models19,20,22,56,89,90

Also relevantly, 

&gt;mRNA vaccines have the potential for rapid, inexpensive and scalable manufacturing, mainly owing to the high yields of in vitro transcription reactions.

British taxpayers have invested millions of pounds into a Dutch vaccine factory at the [centre of a threatened blockade](https://archive.is/o/SafA9/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/01/british-taxpayer-invested-20m-set-vaccine-factory-centre-eu/) by the European Commission, The Telegraph can disclose.  


The  Halix factory in Leiden was equipped to produce doses of the Oxford  vaccine after Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary,¬†approved a major  investment last April.

  
The  money ‚Äì reported to be in the region of ¬£21 million ‚Äì was meant to  secure vital shipments to the UK. But Brussels has threatened to ban  exports and on Thursday vowed there would be ""no negotiation"" with  Downing Street, insisting that the doses should be diverted to European  nations.¬†  


A  leaked letter revealed that Oxford scientists urged a major EU nation  to invest in the Halix factory alongside the UK last April, but the deal  was never signed.¬†

  
The  European Union would likely have secured millions of AstraZeneca doses  had the Dutch government acted more decisively, sources suggested. An EU  official admitted the bloc had yet to contribute a single Euro towards  the Halix plant.

  
MPs suggested on Thursday night that Downing Street should ask for its money back.  
Steve  Baker, the deputy chairman of the Covid Recovery Group, said: ""We  invested in this plant. We have contractual entitlements to vaccines. If  the EU disagrees with those entitlements, they have the option of going  to court.

‚ÄúEven in my worst Eurosceptic moments, I would never have dreamt the EU would behave like this.‚Äù¬†¬†  
The  news that Britain funded the very vaccine factory which is now at the  centre of the EU blockade comes as a major shortfall in AstraZeneca  supplies threatens¬†to disrupt the successful UK rollout.

GPs  have been told to stop administering first doses this month¬†and focus  their vaccine resources primarily on those who are awaiting their second  jabs. Downing Street says the UK remains on target to vaccinate all adults by July.

The  Government has entered into negotiations with the EU over the doses  produced at the Halix plant, which gained approval from the European  regulator last week. Sources said the factory was ready to produce five  million doses of raw vaccine every month.  


But  Thierry Breton, the EU‚Äôs internal market commissioner, warned that  ‚Äúzero‚Äù jabs would be sent to the UK until AstraZeneca had fulfilled its  commitments to Brussels, even after Germany suspended routine use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people aged below 60 because of fears of rare blood clots.

‚ÄúIf  \[AstraZeneca\] does more, we don‚Äôt have any issue, but as long as it  doesn‚Äôt deliver its commitment to us, the doses stay in Europe,‚Äù¬†Mr  Breton said. ‚ÄúThere is no negotiation.‚Äù  
   
Whitehall  sources, however, pointed out that the UK guaranteed millions of pounds  to the Halix factory in April last year, before the Oxford vaccine had  been proven effective.  
The  University of Oxford signed a deal with the Dutch firm after  identifying the brand new Halix plant as suitable for building up  capacity for millions of doses.

  
Scientists from the university then approached Mark Rutte, the¬†Dutch prime minister, with a request for 10 million Euros to build barrels capable of holding 1,000 litres of raw vaccine.  
""There  will probably be a huge demand for vaccines if they successfully pass  the tests,‚Äù the scientists wrote in a letter leaked to the Dutch  broadcaster NOS.

  
‚ÄúMost  likely, the quantities of available vaccines will be limited for  several months. To avoid major delays, production capacity must be  increased now.""  
But  the Dutch failed to sign the deal, despite entering initial talks with  Halix. The failure to invest meant the EU missed the chance to secure  millions of doses for itself, sources suggested.

  
On Thursday night an EU official admitted the bloc had yet to contribute any cash to the Halix factory.  
‚ÄúWe  have checked for any EU funding possibly given to Halix under EU  financial instruments but could not identify any support. This does not  prejudge any national funding given by member states,‚Äù the official  said.  
 Sir  John Bell, regius professor at the University of Oxford, a leading  figure in the development of the AstraZeneca jab, said dealing with the  EU had been like ‚Äúpulling teeth‚Äù.  
 ‚ÄúIt has just been a nightmare, for AstraZeneca especially,‚Äù Sir John said.  
 ‚ÄúAnd then they turn round and say the jab isn‚Äôt safe. I would say it is time for the EU to make its mind up.‚Äù  
   
The stand-off over the Halix factory is further complicated by Brussels‚Äô demand for vaccines from the two AstraZeneca factories in the UK, which manufacture the vast majority of AstraZeneca jabs used by Britain.  
 The  commission wants Boris Johnson to release AstraZeneca from its UK  contract, which gives Britain first refusal on jabs. It argues that the  EU contract with AstraZeneca counts the two British plants as part of  the EU‚Äôs supply chain.  
 Brussels has demanded ‚Äúreciprocity‚Äù from the UK and believes that Britain is dependent on EU supplies of vaccines  for the completion of its vaccination campaign. Twenty million Pfizer  jabs have been exported to the UK since December, leading some sources  to claim that the UK success was ‚Äúmade in the EU‚Äù.

UK-EU  negotiations over the Halix supplies are expected to continue next  week. The UK regulator is yet to grant it approval, although a million  doses were exported from Halix to the UK for clearance between December  and last month.  
 Last  week, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission,  introduced tougher export rules allowing Brussels to target countries  with higher vaccination rates than the EU and low exports to the EU,  like Britain.  
 EU  leaders, wary that the UK could block the export of raw vaccine  materials to the EU, stopped short of explicitly backing her plans at a  summit but insisted that AstraZeneca would have to fulfil its contract  before being allowed to export.

  
A spokesman for AstraZeneca refused to comment. But the company said on  Tuesday that ‚Äúthe EU supply chain is overwhelmingly for the EU‚Äù.  
A  University of Oxford spokesperson said: ‚ÄúWe are not aware of any formal  letter sent by Oxford University to the Dutch government. However, the  vaccine team did approach a wide range of potential funding partners in  early 2020 before the partnership was struck with AstraZeneca.‚Äù",,,1617313856,{},gt2uime,True,t3_mi5w0y,False,True,t3_mi5w0y,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mi5w0y/british_taxpayers_funded_eu_factory_at_heart_of/gt2uime/,1617317011,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I would talk to your primary care doctor about this and see what they say.

I suspect most likely you would want to make some accommodations to prepare for the second shot at the vaccination site - make sure you're seated while receiving the vaccine, tell the person vaccinating you that you experienced syncope with the first dose and should have a nurse/EMT nearby to make sure you are OK, bring someone with you to stay at your side and make sure you don't fall, make sure you receive help from whoever comes with you to get up after the vaccination and guide you to the seat where you will be observed, etc.

The news is that studies are showing that the people who were vaccinated 6+ months ago for the first large vaccine trials ago are **still protected**, the exact opposite of ""vaccinations will only prevent sickness for 6 months"". Most likely they will provide protection for much longer, we just don't know how long.

Note that the people who are protected for 6+ months all received two doses.

Boosters aren't scheduled but required later based on circumstance. MMR have clear schedules due to dosing safety mostly. 

I'll say it like you are 4 years old

If you hear the word shot then it is not a vaccine ....  flu shot, rabies shot, insulin shot, gun shot to the head

If you don't say the word shot and it can lead to the disease going bye bye then it might just be a vaccine

Also I'm well aware you know this

COVID-19 will never be eliminated by herd immunity or at all that is obvious based on their failures dealing with h1n1, tried and failed bad. 

You go ahead and get this shot and ofcourse there will be 20 more variants soon enough but I am sure you'll be fine.

Chile quickly managed to make deals with many different labs, we got 12 million doses of CoronaVac from the SinoVac Lab beginning in January with 2 million doses, with each shipment we received 2 millions doses, so far we have received 6 shipments, the last one came back March 21st.

We have also received Pfizer vaccines but in smaller numbers.

The vaccination process is organized with a [Calendar](https://i.imgur.com/v5A8iME.png) where people can see when they can go to their nearest community health center, school or wherever the Vaccination center is located. 

Health workers and old people were the priority first, I think they got Pfizer, then followed people with chronic illnesses from 65 to 18 years of age, after them people without any condition began receiving the vaccine, people that work as taxi or bus drivers, teachers and the people selected as ''Vocales the Mesa''(they count the votes of an election) also were eligible to get the vaccine these past weeks.

&gt; but they are on worst Situation each day

That can be explained easily... **most of the people getting infected haven't been vaccinated yet.** The government has made really silly decisions, opening schools, malls, giving people vacation permits, some people here don't really understand the weight of the situation, they don't care about the virus as ''they are young, and it won't affect them''.

Another example of how genome sequencing can tell you where you should focus your public health measures and even lockdown restrictions - if you have been tracking the virus long enough, you‚Äôd be able to follow a variant to its lineage and link it to an outbreak. If used often enough, its a great tool for learning from your mistakes and failures. 

I understand the dissent from the Danish public at the time though - if the issue was in the milk, they may not have needed to cull the minks.Maybe that‚Äôs why their corpses began to rise from their graves. I jest though - I have no doubt most governments would‚Äôve done the same at the time.

It is not by accident that it was these countries in which the first variants of concern were discovered around the same time. It is not kismet that the only variants had appeared where regularly sequencing allowed scientists to quickly detect and analyse mutations and develop an understanding of the characteristics and risks posed.
It was because few other countries regarded it as a worthy exercise in understanding and combating the pandemic. As it turns out, there are many places crawling with mutations, but without the dedication of the UK and SA scientific teams, the characteristics and behaviour of their respective variants would be understood to a very limited degree. I trust that the unparalleled knowledge they possess regarding the variant they were each credited with discovering is not simply disregarded. I would be disappointed if boosters or tweaked variances were prepared and trialled with the intention of tackling the variant dominant in SA without engagement with the SA scientific community and clinical trials actually held in South Africa. 

These countries poured massive financial resources (bearing in mind one does not have nearly the same level of financial freedom as the other) into enhancing their genomic surveillance networks and surely, as an exception to the rule, their foresight has proved to be invaluable. The knowledge of mutations amongst many other countries is nowhere near as advanced at this stage, and many regard a variant as one of concern because they‚Äôve been advised as much by SA and the UK l - which were immediately hit with travel bans in retaliation. When it came to the pandemic, some of the worst affected regions had already abandoned this process and clearly, the lack of sanctions against many countries who didn‚Äôt bother to look for mutations proved that ignorance is bliss. Weighed against the potential of suffering economic consequences by releasing everything they‚Äôve discovered about the behaviour of the variant, both SA and the UK displayed a dedication to absolute transparency.

My second dose was by no means milder. Around a few hours after my shot (injected around 4:15-30) I started to feel the same sort of soreness from my first dose, and thought that would be it. 

I was wrong. At around midnight, the total body aches I was experiencing woke me up (I'd say they were like those you get with the flu, if not worse). These aches intensified until I started to get chills, which told me I might have a fever, so at around 8 AM I took my temperature and was regularly hitting 100 degrees (Fahrenheit) so I popped some Tylenol and went back to sleep--already feeling my aches and fever subside.

Four hours later, I was having some breakfast (toast and coffee) and I started to feel nauseous--it was very mild, but uncomfortable, and only lasted around 10-15 minutes. My aches began to come back but my fever didn't return until around 3:00 PM (with chills). I took some more Tylenol and fell asleep.

About another four hours--and a hint of nausea at dinner--at 8:00 PM, my fever and terrible aches returned again! I was worried at this point, but I took some more Tylenol and knocked out for a few hours. 

This time, when I woke up, I felt completely different. I could tell that my body was finally calming down and my aches were muted and--although I still felt warm--I could sense that I was done battling off a fever.

All in all, from about 8:00 PM (Tuesday) to 10:30 PM the next day (Wednesday), I felt rough--so that's a little over 24 hours for me. 

I have asthma and pretty bad allergies but I had NO problems breathing at all (I did stay consistent with my allergy medication throughout this though). I only felt body aches, some minor chills (not heavy, teeth-chattering chills which I've had with illnesses in the past), a twinge of nausea (less than 15 minutes total), and fever which never went higher than 100-101 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Now, solidly into my second day, I'm just a little fatigued and the injection site remains tender and itchy.

The chance of outdoor transmission is extremely low, also children somehow seem to have a lower chance of getting infected as well. People need to understand that first of all; masks have to be worn correctly in order for them to be effective as well. The reason why there is so much controversy about mask effectiveness is not their effectiveness in clinical settings. IE healthcare professionals **never** touch their masks, and they also wear slightly thicker masks for instance during surgeries. I'm halfway through at med-school but there is a very very long procedure when we have to get into a clinical sterilized environment. Wearing a mask improperly is not good for anyone, that is why mask usage for children has always been to say they don't need it.

Exactly this. The main issue has been a lack of supply. Pfizer was slow out of the blocks (although now doing very well), moderna as well (but the numbers ordered here are small anyway) and the AZ story is well known. Where the EU did fail was to not ensure that funding of and oversight of production was made a priority. That ship has sailed and it seems lessons learned at least.

&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday walked back controversial comments made by its director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, suggesting that people who are vaccinated against the coronavirus never become infected or transmit the virus to others.

* You do not need everyone or even almost everyone to get the vaccine. The CDC estimates that around a hundred million Americans have been infected. Infection yields some immunity.

That should be able to carry us to herd immunity even if we can't hit 80% of Americans vaccinated.

* A big reason many people don't need the vaccine is the overly cautious messaging about what public health restrictions still apply to vaccinated people. Yes, they've been slowly changing their attitude on it, and yes there's the concern that people could lie and say they're vaccinated as an excuse to not wear a mask- But that in and of itself poses two problems. For one you're arguing that the CDC is right to advise restrictions on people who aren't being protected by them on dishonest justifications. That dishonesty is a keystone point in many of the anti public health arguments, continuing that dishonesty is a problem. Second, the people who don't want the vaccine and are going to lie to not wear a mask probably weren't wearing a mask in the first place.

&gt; the only NATO exporter of vaccines are countries in the EU.

I don't think it will always be true. Eventually, and hopefully sooner rather than later, America WILL begin exporting vaccines.

You need to understand something. Biden (or at least his people) already has an eye on how to win the 2022 midterm elections. He's off to a great start with the public with the vaccine rollout, COVID economic relief and now his big ""rebuild America's infrastructure &amp; pay for it by taxing the rich"" plan. As long as he doesn't screw these 3 things up, chances are good the Democrats will do well in the midterms and be able to continue doing good in 2023-24.

Let's go back to the vaccine rollout. I want you to imagine two alternate scenarios, with an eye toward the U.S. elections in 2022 and 2024:

A) Biden sticks with the current U.S. vaccine priority plan to vaccinate as many Americans as possible. By July 2021 all willing U.S. adults have received their shots, opening us to begin exporting vaccine to Canada and other countries. By the 2022 elections -- over a year later at that point -- all Canadian adults have their shots too. Heartened by the vaccine rollout's success, and immune to factual claims that they prioritized foreign citizen lives over Americans, the Democratic Party posts net wins in 2022 and Biden can continue doing good work.

A) Biden changes the U.S. vaccine priority plan to enable foreign exports quickly. Critics in the Republican Party and their lackies in the conservative media (Fox News, OANN, NewsMax etc) immediately attack Biden for not being ""America First"" enough, and begin speculating about why he did so, e.g. did he take bribes from them? (I realize no such bribes took place; but have you met our Republican Party? They'll lie about anything and everything.)

Because of the change in priority, it takes an extra 6 months to vaccinate all willing U.S. adults, meaning by end of Q4 instead of Q2. In the interceding 6 months, X thousand Americans die from COVID and the Republicans blame Biden for all of them. In next year's midterm elections, this blame for American deaths due to COVID dogs the Democratic Party, and the Republicans take back control of the Senate &amp; possibly the House. The second half of Biden's term is pure gridlock, and Biden's re-election in 2024 is now threatened. (Yes, a certain number of Canadians or other foreign citizens will stay alive under this scenario, compared to scenario A. But those Canadians don't vote here, so for U.S. election purposes, the Democrats would get no credit for those lives saved.)

--------------------

Addressing some of your other points:

&gt; If the US is not willing to give up some personal freedoms a bit longer

Again, have you met our Republican idiots? They weren't willing to give up personal freedoms to protect THEIR OWN lives. Much less all Americans' lives, much much less the lives of non-Americans. I don't like them but I gotta be honest and admit they're here &amp; not going anywhere

&gt; what will it do in case Article 5 of the NATO gets triggered?

I could take a minute and Google what you're referring to, but I'm going to keep it real and acknowledge that in my everyday life, I don't know what Article 5 is. Care to explain it for me?

&gt; that is total deaths not current deaths,

How do you define current deaths?

&gt; where would a vaccine safe more lifes now, in Viriginia or Ontario where ICs are at peak usage?

Offered with respect: the vaccine is not a cure. Ontario people in ICUs will still be there whether we allow vaccine exports or not. The vaccine can only prevent other Ontarions from contracting COVID.

&gt; You can say: I don't make foreign policy but you do enable it.

Oh really? Well then, put yourself in my shoes.

Have you ever read Luria-Delbruk (or subsequent genetics studies on evolution of therapeutic resistance)?

If you let the virus burn through the population, and that creates, say, 1 million infections in an area, they are all unmitigated because no one is vaccinated, so you have lots of replication per infection. In those 1 million infections, you'll create tons of mutations and possibly some functional variants, which will exist in the population, but won't be dominant. Then apply the vaccine and all the other variants go away, but the ""jackpot event"" variants that happen to have characteristics that allow for vaccine escape will emerge.

Compare that to mitigating an outbreak with a vaccination campaign. You'll have fewer infections and fewer replications per infection. Already you've got a much lower chance of creating these variants to begin with. Is there some effect of eliminating viral interference from other similar viral strains and bringing those fitter variants to the forefront? Yes, but it's dwarfed by the lower replications in vaccinated individuals and lower number of infections in general.

The only legitimate argument I've seen against them is the fact that some tiny minority of people can't get the vaccine due to health reasons, but it's pretty easy to accommodate that within this idea anyway (by just giving exceptions for legitimate excuses).

The main argument, which regards ""freedoms"", is in my opinion absolute bullshit.  I don't understand why so many people seem to believe that American ""freedom"" means the freedom to do whatever the hell you want *free of any consequences*.  You're free to be a dumbass and not get the vaccine.  No one is going to physically force it into your arm, ever.  But we're all free to exclude your virulent ass from society in response.  Funny thing about that ""freedom"" - everyone else is free to screw you over right back, just like you're free to screw us over by not participating in the solution.  

Not to get too political, but it's the same thing with all this ""cancel culture"" crap.  I personally think that ""cancel culture"" is pretty dumb, and we have a lot of way-too-sensitive fools getting way-too-offended most of the time, and seriously overreacting.  HOWEVER, conceptually, there is no problem with the behavior on either side.  You are free to be an asshole and say or do something that lots and lots of people don't like, and then those people are free to bully you right back in response.  That's how freedom works, neither side's freedom is being infringed on.  Both are free to do as they please.

Regarding the question of risks of the AZ vaccine vs risks of catching COVID in young healthy people I see a lot of confusion even among some of my ""pro science"" friends online. I start this analysis by saying that I have advised both my mom and grandmother to get the AZ vaccine and that I think it is still a valid vaccine. Having said that I think that the decision of several countries ([just added](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSS8N2JJ071) the Netherlands) to block it under a certain age is not a ""crazy and political"" thing but it is reflected in the numbers.

- Using ISS data, the number of cases of COVID in people under 40 reported in Italy as of April 1, 2021 is 1,360,481. [https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/sars-cov-2-dashboard].

- There are various papers and estimates about the real number of COVID cases, unfortunately it is difficult to find a perfect estimate but according to the American CDC, the number of detected cases is about 22% of the total number of real cases. There are even higher estimates but we use this as a lower bound. [\[2\]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html)[\[3\]](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1780/6000389)

- Using the two data above we can estimate (obviously with a lot of uncertainty) that the number of real cases in Italy in the 0-40 range is estimated to be around 6.2 million. And it is also reasonable to think that asymptomatic cases are even more concentrated in the 0-40 range.

- According to ISS, 38 people under 40 years of age have died without major pathologies. [\[4\]](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/sars-cov-2-decessi-italia#:~:text=2.-,Data%20demographics,46,852%20\(43%2C9%25\).)

- This would bring the risk of death for a healthy person under the age of 40 (excluding the risk at the outset of catching the virus) to around 0.00061% or one person for every 163,000 infected. To be fair, if we consider only registered cases, the risk of death is about 1 in every 36,000 cases. 

- Regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine, several cases of a particular type of thrombosis (called Vaccine-Induced Prothrombotic Immune Thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) by the authors of the paper) have been reported, and at the moment, in certain countries such as Germany and Norway, we are seeing 1 case per 100,000 inhabitants with a fatality of 40%. Obviously it has not yet been ""officially"" recognized a link but as the EMA itself says it is possible given the number of cases compared to the normal population. I also add that since this number refers to the general population, it is not possible to know if it is higher or lower in the under 40 (or in women), but for now many of the cases have been in that range. [\[5\]](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/rapid-response-recommended-use-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-younger-adults.html)[\[6\]](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-362354/v1). One important thing is that understanding treatment and warning patients about possible symptoms could dramatically reduce fatality.

- This would bring the risk of death from VIPIT very close to the risk of death from COVID in the healthy under-40 group. This is not to mention that the likelihood of catching COVID in the first instance is not 100%, especially for certain people with non-risk jobs, so the risk of getting infected and dying is even lower than the above numbers.

TL;DR The AstraZeneca vaccine is definitely recommended for people over 50-60 years old, but in the under 40 healthy group the benefits are not crystal clear imo, especially when from the other mRNA vaccines there has been no increase in these cases. Obviously many papers and data are estimates or pre-prints as the situation is evolving fast.

There is still some debate on how safe you are in terms of being able to spread the virus if you test positive after being fully vaccinated. It looks like even then odds are low as the virus is not able to replicate as much as it could if you weren't vaccinated. 

The only reason I still wear a mask is to put others at ease.

We have certainly seen use of origin-region in pejorative, racial, and bigoted terms.

Young people's immune system is better, plain and simple. That has nothing to do with anything.

It does when conditions change suddenly. There are plenty of examples of this. Moths in England turned dark grey as coal from the industrial revolution made the white ones stand out. Lizards abandoned on an island adapted to that food source in like 30 years.

The have the pass and it's voluntary, cool let businesses decide, no government mandate because they don't want to touch that.

Seems great right? Sure but I have questions. How many are realistically going to require this? It explicitly slows down entry time, you now need an ID etc, for events where not even getting your ticket scanned is somewhat common. Now those ticket takers are supposed to check ID? OK, yeah that'll work real smooth at sporting events with piss drunk fans. 

The point is its too clunky to use when there are a LOT of people, more manageable when there are less people now...so anyone else seeing what I'm seeing? They're just going to abandon it when mass people are going to events again, and even if there's a mandate (which most states won't even touch, like if CA and NY aren't I don't think we're getting a mandate) it requires too much effort from people who aren't paid to care. 

That's why you'll never see bars and restaurants use this, you think the bouncer there to stop fights gives a shit? Or the wait staff who rarely checks I'd when someone orders a drink?

Futhermore, where do you all think the biggest overlap here is. People who are very supportive of vaccine passports and people who want to go to events? Or people who don't want vaccine passports and want to go to events?

I think we know the answer. The other issue is that people who are more likely to swarm these events are ones who already more likely to be defiant of restrictions and the virus, people more interested in this are likely to be more cautious.

So now, with a lower sample size, the main people who want to go to your event are already anti-passport most likely isn't it possible that scares away a lot of potential venues from using this VOLUNTARY ap?",,,1617322831,{},gt3bdpg,False,t3_mhn8pn,False,True,t3_mhn8pn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mhn8pn/covid19_vaccine_app_will_be_used_to_help_bring/gt3bdpg/,1617324778,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

As early as January 1916, after a new strain of flu had begun to sharply increase death rates in the United States, Rosenau had organized a symposium to explore the idea that the illness might be viral in origin. No definitive answer was agreed upon, but at the height of the second wave, he renewed his interest in the topic.

Under the auspices of the U.S. Public Health Service and the Navy, Rosenau and his colleagues, in an effort to ‚Äúdetermine the mode of spread of influenza,‚Äù tried to infect military volunteers with Pfeiffer‚Äôs bacillus at a makeshift infirmary on Gallops Island in Boston Harbor. Though human experiments were then seen as acceptable, in a paper later published in JAMA, Rosenau noted that the team ‚Äúproceeded rather cautiously at first by administering a pure culture‚Äù of the bacterium.

When the ‚Äútrials proved negative,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúwe became bolder.‚Äù The scientists gave each of the volunteers ‚Äúa very large quantity of a mixture of thirteen different strains of the Pfeiffer bacillus, some of them obtained recently from the lungs at necropsy.‚Äù They also inoculated the men with specimens taken from the throats and noses of influenza patients and later with the patients‚Äô blood.

It seems all the covid mutations we've seen to date are on the spike protein to help mediate insertion into the ACE2 receptor.  

This means the protein is slightly different and makes antibodies not as effective at bonding.

It might not actually be necessary but with the mutations having initial replication coefficient (r0) of 5 vs 3.2 that's VERY worrying and it might be enough, en mass, to counter vaccines.

My hypothesis though is it won't matter and that the vaccines will effectively kill off covid assuming we get to herd immunity. 

I think we need 85% of the population vaccinated for that to happen though or we're going to have covid just become endemic and not fully kill it off.

Airlines or other aircraft operators transporting passengers with COVID-19 pursuant to CDC authorization and in accordance with CDC guidance.[6]
&gt; Federal law enforcement personnel on official orders who are traveling for the purpose of carrying out a law enforcement function, provided they are covered under an occupational health and safety program in accordance with CDC guidance. Those traveling for training or other business purposes remain subject to the requirements of this Order.
U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) personnel, including military personnel and civilian employees, dependents, contractors (including whole aircraft charter operators), and other U.S. government employees when traveling on DOD assets, provided that such individuals are under competent military or U.S. government travel orders and observing DOD precautions to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 as set forth in Force Protection Guidance Supplement 14‚ÄîDepartment of Defense Guidance for Personnel Traveling During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic (December 29, 2020) including its testing guidance.
&gt; Individuals and organizations for which the issuance of a humanitarian exemption is necessary based on both (1) exigent circumstances where emergency travel is required to preserve health and safety (e.g., emergency medical evacuations) and (2) where pre-departure testing cannot be accessed or completed before travel. Additional conditions may be placed on those granted such exemptions, including but not limited to, observing precautions during travel, providing consent to post-arrival testing, and/or self-quarantine after arrival in the United States, as may be directed by federal, state, territorial, tribal or local public health authorities to reduce the risk of transmission or spread.",,,1617385376,{},gt5tzgb,False,t3_mimikg,False,True,t1_gt5tfwq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mimikg/vaccinated_americans_are_free_to_travel_but/gt5tzgb/,1617385520,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Let's use another analogy.

Seat belts are statistically proven to save lives in collisions.

That doesn't mean they make you invulnerable to serious injury or death in a collision. 

The best strategy for avoiding injury or death in a collision is through avoidance, so defensive/careful driving.

Smart people don't strap a seat belt on and then start driving recklessly. 

Similarly smart people don't look at the results of an early study or two and think ""okay, there is zero risk from covid now!"". 

The early data is reassuring, but avoidance is still the best strategy....so wearing a mask in public and social distancing from the general public and only socializing with other vaccinated people is the most prudent course of action.

I myself require the medical devices I use to be FDA Approved. For example, I took the flu vaccine last year, because it was FDA Approved, I didn't have to sign paperwork acknowledging that I'm taking an unapproved vaccine or whatever.

I'm not here to say people shouldn't take unapproved vaccines. Actually, they will help speed up the approval process by adding more data to be evaluated. I'm just here trying to find out why the vaccines haven't been approved.

And just to summarize the information you have given: the vaccines haven't been approved because:

1. They didn't request approval (doesn't really help, but ok, valid point)

2. Too expensive and time consuming (I'm sure all companies would love to skip regulation based on that excuse)

3. EUAs are just as good as Approvals, but they are not the same... (bit weird, not the same but just as good...)

4. Don't need FDA Approvals (you can take unapproved vaccines, not here to judge, but still doesn't answer my question)

A long time ago inactivated vaccines were the most common. So think the original polio vaccine. So in these cases it is in theory possible to get infected though the chances are very low. This may be where she is fearful from. 

Vaccine researchers have developed other approaches that are more commonly used now. 

The two main ones for the US are mRNA (Pfizer and Moderna) or viral vector based (J&amp;J). 

In the mRNA case there is no virus at all, it is not possible to be infected with covid or anything as there is no covid present or any other virus. The mRNA causes human cells to produce a spike proteins that is on the outside of the coronavirus and thus mount an immune response. The mRNA is not encoded to be able to replicate so it quickly is cleared from the body (within a few days). 

In the J&amp;J case, they use another mild virus and alter it's genetic material. This virus infects some cells and causes them to produce the spike protein. Again the genetic material is changed in a way that makes it unable to reproduce. So similarly this virus is cleared from the body very soon. 


In either case there is zero covid virus present, and the vaccines are unable to reproduce.

&gt;
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday walked back controversial comments made by its director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, suggesting that people who are vaccinated against the coronavirus never become infected or transmit the virus to others.

Later in the article:
&gt;
‚ÄúIf Dr. Walensky had said most vaccinated people do not carry virus, we would not be having this discussion,‚Äù said John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York.

But what she actually said was this:
&gt;
‚ÄúOur data from the C.D.C. today suggests that vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don‚Äôt get sick,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd that it‚Äôs not just in the clinical trials, it‚Äôs also in real-world data.‚Äù

Later on in the article ""an expert"" offers this clarification:
&gt;
‚ÄúClearly, some vaccinated people do get infected,‚Äù Dr. Duprex said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre stopping symptoms, we‚Äôre keeping people out of hospitals. But we‚Äôre not making them completely resistant to an infection.‚Äù
&gt;
The number of vaccinated people who become infected is likely to be higher among those receiving vaccines made by Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca, which have a lower efficacy, experts said. (Still, those vaccines are worth taking, because they uniformly prevent serious illness and death.)
&gt;
Infection rates may also be higher among people exposed to a virus variant that can sidestep the immune system.

Perhaps instead of walking around without a mask and a care in the world vaccinated people should still worry about the health of others:
&gt;
Given the rising numbers, it‚Äôs especially important that immunized people continue to protect those who have not yet been immunized against the virus, experts said.

I didn't ask why the vaccine got an EUA? Your first try answered that question.

I didn't ask what an FDA Approval is? Your most recent try answered that question.

My question is **why are the COVID vaccines not FDA approved?**

Quoting from the definition,

&gt;FDA evaluates the data to determine whether the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine has been demonstrated and whether the manufacturing and facility information assure product quality and consistency. After its evaluation, FDA decides whether to approve (also known as to license) the vaccine for use in the United States.

Because the vaccines haven't been approved, does that mean the FDA has not evaluated the safety and effectiveness? People will say the EUA did that, so what's the difference.

Again, why did the vaccine get an EUA and not an Approval? If they were the same process, they would have just gotten the FDA Approval and not bother with an EUA. But there's a reason why they got an EUA and not a FDA Approval.

The WHO has also said positive testing under 5% for 14+ days while maintaining ""extensive"" testing. The US has been under 5% positive for about 3 weeks now (although it is slowly rising back up), with 31 states below the target level but 20 above (51 includes DC). I think we still qualify as extensively testing - but some states have notably dropped testing rates. IA is testing at 1/3 the rate they were a few months ago while currently having a more than 19% positivity rate. This makes their number of ""cases"" look good - but should be clearly not ""under control"" if we examine the broader picture.

Using just a little bit of extrapolation and rounding, 10k cases tested per day with 3x as many cases occurring total (asymptomatic and untested) and a 0.3 - 0.6% Infection Fatality Rate would give us about 100-200 daily COVID deaths as a potential target -- so about 1/5 where we are now (just as Fauci is targeting roughly 1/5 the cases we are now).

I think that's the whole point.  Ohio has a lot of large universities that draw in out of state students.  Our rollout has gone well, and in terms of getting control of the virus it just makes sense to get as many college students vaccinated as possible before they scatter in two months.

Not perfect by any means but I think that's more our super Trumpy state house full of anti-maskers.

Or *anything*  that means the money and effort will be spent on something with real, positive efficacy?

Or, to put it another way: is the money that is going towards sanitation theater *excess*  money that is left over after buying medical-grade filters for recently upgraded ventilation systems, supplying each person on campus with a stack of N95 or KN95 masks, setting up hand sanitizer stations throughout the school plus giving out individual mini-bottles, and providing rapid Covid testing at several stations on campus? Are vaccines available on campus? If not, is there a shuttle system to get students, faculty and staff to a vaccination site? Is there an easy, well-publicized online system to sign up for appointments?

If all that exists, then... sure, I guess it's okay to waste students' money on something ineffective, *if* they're willing to add that to the services for which they'll be in debt for 20+ years.

Saying that mostly-pointless sanitation theater helps students feel better is essentially treating them like they're stupid. As though it's fine to take their money and let them think their welfare is a priority when it really isn't - the priority is making them *think*  everything's better.
