From what I've read about people who live in Singapore, ""culturally tight"" is misleading at best, if not an outright lie. The different ethnic groups there tend to not mix nearly as much as they do in Western countries like America. 

There is ""harmony"" simply because the police do not tolerate disharmony.

And keep in mind that other vaccines are still working well enough with cross reactive immunity against the S.A variant.  The title result here hits the AZ vaccine because the spike wasn't stabilized so the antibodies it is forming are predominantly to an ineffective shape of the spike.

Ultimately we're all going to be exposed to endemic SARS-CoV-2 and catch it.  The goal is to have build up antibodies to the vaccines and force the virus to make costly mutations to evade vaccines so the severity is much lower.

Even the vaccines that we're taking now are intramuscular and are unlikely to eliminate infection in the upper respiratory tract (like pretty much at all).

This criteria would also pick up more cases in non-vaccine arm too but overall it's not a fair comparison. From this study that will be published today we can see that pre arrival of b.1.3.51 AZ vaccine was ~72% efficacious after one dose measuring from 14 days (seemingly even before the vaccine had time to fully kick in) and that includes mild 

A bit confused now. Are you sure you're talking about AZ? Or are you saying that the way JnJ's trial was conducted, they had lower criteria for what could qualify as a confirmed COVID-19 case? From my understanding, most of manufacturers defined a covid case as simply having a cough or a fever etc. I know Pfizer did. 

&gt;In the meantime, not convinced it's the savior to South African woes in current format

Yeah, well, we just don't know what the efficacy is in preventing symptoms. SA government stated that they are relying on JnJ vaccine in light of this news about AZ, though. Idk how I feel about that, but they are more qualified than me so...

&gt;It looks like a fantastic vaccine, that got surprisingly lukewarm reception 

I am really confused by it and a bit triggered when I see how they compare its 89% efficacy with Pfizer's 95. Obviously, not too big of a diff, but shows a lack of understanding and the media play a huge role in shaping public opinion.

&gt;Hopefully at least the FDA may shed a bit more light on J&amp;J

YES! Looking forward to that.

&gt;and more light too will be shed on AZ with the US trial, which in design was closer to Moderna or Pfizer trial than cov002

Yessss

Now, I wanna ask you about the new report on Pfizer's efficacy against the variants. It's being compared to AZ in this regard, but it's only describing antibody binding and AZ had a literal small scale trial of 1700 participants, right? It seems a bit unfair to compare the two. Also, they say that they didn't really use the real SA strain for those antibody binding experiments, but rather an engineered variant that didn't contain all the SA mutations, so I'm having difficulties accepting that as even antibody binding tests against the SA variant, let alone indicative of Pfizer's efficacy against the variant.

I’ve come to the realization that so many people, including a few I know personally, are going to be so mentally fcked from this whole fiasco that they are going to be distancing and wearing masks and not going to parties and basically living the pandemic life well after a majority of the at risk population, or hell even a majority of the population in general are vaccinated.

And you know what? Sometimes I don’t even blame them entirely. The media, at least in the US,  has been perpetually covering everything in the absolute WORST light possible since last February. No hope, no fun, no morale boosters, just endless waves of stories about case counts and spikes, suPerSpreAdER events, and anecdotal stories about side effects and children dying. And then, these people my age also get most of their information from these headliners as well as wokes from twitter , Reddit, and Instagram, creating a nice little echo chamber where the pandemic dominated every last word that got to their heads.

And if positive news dares get through? If signs of fun hit their feed? If people just trying to get some fcking fresh air hit their sights? They and a literal army, a literally fucking army of basement dwelling virtue signaling simps brigades comment/replies section just  HAVING to remind everyone that wE aRe iN a PanDemiC and that your small gathering of 11 was bad because little jimmy decided to get 5.9 feet away from a maskless Karen  and that this terrible act almost caused them to faint in horror. I sort of understand the reminder if it’s a blatant violation of rules, since at this point especially we are literally almost at the finish line, but sometimes I just don’t understand these people who go around with their throne of moral superiority and remind every last person who may or may not or possibly or probably not broke the rules the at their actions were terrible. Usually this only pushes people further away from each other and that person will probably be less likely to follow the rules, at least in my experience.

And I know that this represents a minority of people, but I will guarantee to you all now that despite the fact that we are on pace to have the risk of this thing dwindle to almost nothing by April or May (assuming the JJ vaccine is approved, but even then, at this pace the summer looking almost certain) that there will still be people like this clinging to pandemic life for whatever reason well into the end of this year and into 2022. And, that they will literally be terrified of flu season because inevitably there will be a small spike in COVID cases from the 102047372th variant of this thing and calls for restrictions will start happening again. For most people, the pandemic will end soon, but for some, it will not unfortunately. 

Moral of the story: Some people will probably never let this go for a long time, but in fact normality is right around the corner. And most of us, no matter where you stood in terms of government policy, agree that we should just get the damned vaccine and this will be over with. I don’t think I can mentally take much more negative covid news, damned vaccine conspiracies,  or how they may or may might be 2 percent less effective against the 307372th variant.

&gt;  
&gt;Almost  500 confirmed and suspected cases of the South African mutation have   been detected in the region, according to virologist Andreas Bergthaler  of the Medical University of Vienna. That makes Tyrol into the new  European epicenter for a [variant of the disease](https://archive.vn/o/pn5j0/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-21/why-the-u-k-s-mutated-coronavirus-is-fanning-worries-quicktake) that may make inoculations less effective.

&gt;“Everything must be done to prevent these mutations from spreading further,” Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said in a [statement](https://archive.vn/o/pn5j0/https://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20210208_OTS0094/bundesregierung-spricht-reisewarnung-fuer-tirol-aus). “The federal government warns against traveling to Tyrol.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The  warning was issued as Austrians across the country were allowed back  into store after more than a month of lockdown. Schools in the eastern  part of the country also reopened on Monday, with the west due to follow  next week. Virologists from Tyrol have been urging authorities since  last week to consider imposing a quarantine on the region.  
&gt;  
&gt;Local officials issued a [nine-point plan](https://archive.vn/o/pn5j0/https://www.tirol.gv.at/meldungen/meldung/land-tirol-legt-umfassendes-massnahmenpaket-zur-bekaempfung-der-mutationsvarianten-vor/)  on Monday that they said would help contain the virus and inform  residents about the dangers of the new mutation.

The Chinese government insisted that the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan was 2,535 around the time that 5,000 urns were delivered to a single Wuhan crematorium in just two days.

 

&gt;  Outside one funeral home, trucks [shipped in](http://photos.caixin.com/2020-03-26/101534542_6.html#picture) about 2,500 urns on both Wednesday and Thursday, according to Chinese media outlet Caixin. Another picture published by Caixin showed 3,500 urns stacked on the ground inside.

&gt;[Muckraking Chinese journalists](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/opinion/coronavirus-china-news-journalism.html) have been publishing interviews with doctors with damning details that sometimes contradict official accounts. [One piece](https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/2020/02/%E8%B4%A2%E7%BB%8F-%E7%BB%9F%E8%AE%A1%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%97%E4%B9%8B%E5%A4%96%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%BA%EF%BC%9A%E4%BB%96%E4%BB%AC%E6%AD%BB%E4%BA%8E%E6%99%AE%E9%80%9A%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E/), since deleted by censors, alleges the official tally of infected patients is far lower than the true scale of the outbreak, citing several Wuhan doctors.   
&gt;  
&gt;To counteract the critical coverage of the Wuhan quarantine, the Communist Party's publicity department [dispatched](https://news.sina.com.cn/c/2020-02-05/doc-iimxyqvz0328664.shtml) over 300 reporters from state media agencies to Wuhan and Hubei province earlier this week.    
&gt;  
&gt;Not long after, authorities began turning to a more familiar tool for narrative control: censorship.

&gt; Chinese government labs only released the genome after another lab published it ahead of authorities on a virologist website on Jan. 11. Even then, China stalled for at least two weeks more on providing WHO with detailed data on patients and cases, according to recordings of internal meetings held by the U.N. health agency through January — all at a time when the outbreak arguably might have been dramatically slowed.

[],,elcuervo,,,[],,,,text,t2_4x3rl,False,False,[],"The Food and Drug Administration announced new steps last week to  help ensure that Covid-19 tests, treatments and vaccines stay ahead of  new, potentially more transmissible and virulent, variants, whose  emergence makes widespread vaccination even more urgent. The longer it  takes to get the virus under control, the harder it may become. And  soon, the problem may be a vaccine glut if demand is weaker than  expected.

After early challenges, vaccine delivery  is keeping up with supply. But by the end of March, the monthly vaccine  supply may reach 100 million doses. To keep pace, the vaccination rate  would have to double and then some. This will require an  all-of-the-above approach to administering vaccines, tapping substantial  capacity in pharmacies, primary-care practices and other trusted  health-care providers.

Especially with improved delivery, at some point, perhaps in  April, supply will start exceeding demand. The challenge won’t be how to  ration a scarce resource, but how to reach patients reluctant to get  vaccinated. Based on the latest Kaiser Family Foundation tracking  surveys, more than half of Americans say they don’t want to get  vaccinated. Some may simply want to wait; others may be set against  getting it.

One reason for the hesitancy may be that it was necessary to  ration scarce doses at the start, causing many Americans to internalize  the idea that some people may be more likely to benefit or more  deserving than others. It is essential to emphasize in public-health  messaging that every adult can benefit and deserves the protections they  can provide, and there will be no reason to forgo it once the scarcity  problem is solved.

Government at every level should work with as many partners as  possible to expand access. More Americans will take the vaccine if they  can get it at a comfortable location. Not everyone will be willing or  able to line up at Dodger Stadium. Insurers, pharmacies and large  employers can assist public-health systems to reach people in every  community. 

Medicare is sharing with health plans data about immunization  status of Medicare Advantage policyholders, to help plans focus on the  individuals and communities who haven’t been vaccinated. Medicare should  also share data with primary-care providers. Utah is sharing  vaccination data and working with health-care systems like  Intermountain, with an emphasis on reaching out to low-income and  hard-to-reach beneficiaries. The federal government should provide  financial support and technical assistance to enable more states to set  up such partnerships quickly.

Washington can also support state and local efforts to enhance  scheduling, to help plan as far out on the calendar as possible. States  could, for example, send those who aren’t eligible to be inoculated  under the current rationing rules a vaccine ticket to be redeemed later.  Nobody should be turned away: Those seeking a dose should get something  that connects them to a future slot.

America also needs an effective public education campaign to  assuage fears and uncertainty about the vaccine’s safety and benefits.  The Covid Collaborative, working with the Ad Council and community  organizations, is testing educational approaches that can address the  concerns of those in doubt, for instance, working with influencers who  can speak to certain groups that may be more reluctant or complacent,  such as younger Americans. People in their 20s and 30s, who will need to  get vaccinated when doses are available, may not show up if they aren’t  engaged—especially as prevalence declines and with it, a sense of  urgency.

There are significant gaps in vaccination rates across race,  income and location. Surveys suggest that trust also breaks down along  political lines, with many Republicans skeptical of getting vaccinated.  Even groups that are eligible now, such as health-care workers, are  turning down the vaccine at high rates.

The focus is now on expanding distribution and increasing  supply. The problems will soon shift to the demand side of the equation.

The mRNA vaccines actually cause your own cells to create spike protein and might be better at training killer T cells and thus be better - but they were not better against COVID classic.

We've seen across all trials and vaccines that efficacy rises as you look at more severe cases, and presumably drops as you look at less severe.

Why is it so hard to understand that what people want doesn't change what the virus does? ""Appeal to false authority"" is a logical fallacy for a reason.

Newsom is lifting stay at home orders. Cuomo is pushing for indoor dining. Both are pushing for in-person school. Face it, all Governors are done with COVID restrictions.

What people want changes how the virus affects their daily lives. 

The people of NZ wanted to obey a hard lockdown and a strict quarantine therefore the virus is gone. The people of the USA wanted soft lockdowns or no lockdowns therefore the virus is still present.

&gt;No one is arguing that morons don't ignore expert opinions. That doesn't mean it's a good idea.

Irrelevant. Rules are rules and the law is the law. If indoor dining is being allowed, it is not illegal to go to a restaurant therefore people will do so. 

Are you saying that Governor Cuomo and Governor Newsom are morons for wanting to re-open everything this February? Face it, all Governors are done with COVID restrictions.

&gt;You're right. Morons do stupid shit all the time and wishing morons didn't do stupid shit and asking them to stop doesn't work. Shame, isn't it?

Glad you agree that nothing you say or do matters in this world.

&gt;No. They fucking didn't. When things shut down again out of necessity, they will blame Biden for either doing or not doing more or less. They'll still be morons. And you'll still be using logical fallacies to try and justify their (and your?) moronic actions that cost lives and the economy even more.

No matter the color of the state, everything is re-opening this February. Face it, all Governors are done with COVID restrictions.

Pushing for more restrictions or a brand new lockdown is something that absolutely no politician wants. And the citizens that want it are an extremely fringe minority. 

Everyone agrees that life should resume even if you have to wear a mask for a few more weeks. The re-open side won.

&gt;As I've said elsewhere, it's like saying you'll save money on your car by not doing any maintenance. Strictly speaking, that's true...up front. It's exceptionally stupid if you think beyond tomorrow, which you're not doing.

The way I see things. We are so advanced with so many markets that without existing facilities and trained people there would be no way to quickly prop something up in an emergency.

Subsidies would need to be used to make things cost effective. A couple industries can share resources. There's potential to have a small enough local companies that still alow competition to exist. With it being subsidized, could the private. And used properly could be used to direct competition towards better environmental and economic policies. Like a small time smartphone company that provides secure devices to military/government and show how to make super secure/private products. Or like national medicine manufacturering facilities.

We also need appreciation for national services. Libraries were amazing when all knowledge/physical media was books. They still are but there is huge potential. Tons of adults with time for hobbies instead of consuming media. We can all learn new skills with libraries becoming areas with tools most people would find too expensive to get for personal. People could learn to craft things, 3D print, have access to powerful computer for design etc. Along with adding more funding to arts, shop class, tech class, sciences for projects. Stuff that actually leads people to be hands on. Over time behaviour will be associated with national pride and more crafters. Capable to find solutions themselves where applicable.

And lets be honest everyone saw this coming from the moment they announced the 62% effectiveness against the original strain. Everyone knew mutations were a concern and vaccines were going to be less effective against these mutations. But the UK didn’t have any options because of the massive amount of infections and the fact that they didn’t order enough of the vaccines that turned out to be more effective so their only option was to start vaccinating and hope for the best but surprise surprise the Oxford/AZ vaccine is close to useless against the SA strain, which is spreading everywhere, and its probably also much less effective on people over 60.

No ya dingus, there are a different set of BEHAVIORS for NorCal v SoCal. Massive cultural differences and average science educational attainment are WAY WAY different. The major industry in SoCal is entertainment, in NorCal (or the people-dense part of NorCal anyway) it's tech. 
A significant % in NorCal are much better at looking at an exponential growth graph in the abstract and saying ""oh fuck"" than in SoCal. People everywhere are fucking up, but NorCal had a higher proportion of people who listen to science experts.  

Also population density in LA and SJ  are NOT comparable at all. I live in the Bay Area, we don't really do tall apartment towers the way SoCal does.  

Your logic is pretty trash right at the beginning so i'm not going to bother with the rest. pointing out different outcomes within the state that are easily explained with demographic and behavioral differences are irrelevant to and thus do not inform us about Gov.

If they looked at the graph of new cases over the last year and compared surges in cases to calendar events, they'd find that almost all peaks are due to people getting together for something, and almost all drops in cases are the back side of those peaks.

We're just about off the peak generated by the 2020 holiday season.   Vaccinations will start having some effect, but do the math, people... we've vaccinated about 40 million people.  Some percentage of these will already have had COVID and not known it, but we'll ignore that.   40 million out of 328 million is only about 12%, which will be contributing some to the reduction in cases, but that's not enough to drive it...new cases are being driven by gatherings of people.

If we have another event where lots of people want to gather together and share air, we'll have another surge.   

That's if the virus strains don't change.   If a more infectious strain becomes dominant, then we'll get sharper peaks in surges, and more overall infected in surges.

Worse, if a new strain makes some of our existing hygiene practices ineffective, we'll have more spread until/unless we update those.

Here is the whole article:   


The start of the mass rollout of coronavirus vaccines promised a clear path out of the health and economic crisis that has gripped the world for the past 12 months. The emergence of mutated strains, particularly the South African variant and concerns over the effectiveness of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine against it, has shifted the debate about how straight that path might be. The question now is not how quickly we go back to normality but what kind of normality that will be. The ever-changing threat that the virus presents means that some aspects of pandemic life may be here for the medium or even the long term. Any remaining hopes for the speedy eradication of Covid-19 look fanciful.   

It is a sobering message. Millions of people, including in the UK and Europe, are still living under extensive restrictions to stop the spread of the virus. The economic and societal damage, in the form of closed shops and restaurants and, in many countries, schools, is painfully evident. It is a reminder that the fight against Covid-19 is not a one-off battle with a definitive end point. Policymakers as well as the public need to be realistic about what is achievable in the long run. The world has learnt to live with flu, which kills some 500,000 people worldwide in an average year. In much the same way, the NHS in the UK has said it plans a mass campaign of booster jabs akin to annual flu jabs to help stay ahead of Covid-19 as it keeps mutating.   

The prospect of living with coronavirus in some form raises important considerations for public health policy. The most important is that it should not be taken as a green light to the lockdown sceptics. This is not the time to give up on social distancing measures and let the virus take its course. The overriding aim must remain to cut transmission rates. The lower the rates, the lower the probability of the virus mutating. It is also imperative that public confidence in vaccination programmes is not undermined. Vaccine hesitancy among adults remains an issue everywhere. In the UK, where the AstraZeneca vaccine is the mainstay of the government’s vaccination rollout, experts on Monday stressed that it is still likely to offer significant protection against serious illness from the South African variant.  

The arrival of more dangerous mutations strengthens the case for greater global co-operation. The more widespread infections are allowed to remain globally, the greater the chance that more mutations will appear, ultimately reducing the efficacy of vaccines. A co-ordinated programme, involving more intensive genomic surveillance, will be needed to keep track of the virus and new mutations — both worldwide and at national and regional levels, to clamp down on local infections as soon as they occur.  

Just as important is the development of new antiviral drugs that work against Sars-Cov-2. The pharmaceutical industry and governments have, rightly, thrown resources at developing vaccines but they should not neglect the therapeutic avenue. The spread of HIV has been controlled through the use of antiviral drugs. In addition, governments should target research and development efforts to help produce vaccines that can be adapted to prevent infection by the new variants. Genetic jabs using new mRNA technology will be particularly useful here. 

 None of this will be cheap. But the amount of money required is trivial compared with the human cost of failing to invest. Vaccines, drugs and surveillance offer a path back to something like what life was like before the pandemic, but it will not be a smooth nor speedy voyage.",,,1612810907,{},gmm0d0a,False,t3_lfi7ox,False,True,t1_gmlvuc8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfi7ox/learning_to_live_with_coronavirus/gmm0d0a/,1612812633,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Like, the way I understand it, vaccines will bring us closer to normality. I wonder how much closer?

The reason behind this, beyond the fact of being civilized human beings, is, as they also say, ""With a fast-moving pandemic, no one is safe, unless everyone is safe."", and, as they also say, ""Developing a vaccine against COVID-19 is the most pressing challenge of our time - and nobody wins the race until everyone wins."". Take these two sentences and repeat them to yourself 100 times each. 

The, hopefully, maybe, possibly the skeptical reader might be open enough to read [COVAX Explained](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/covax-explained) to look into the reasons behind the effort. COVAX Explained was written early last year, and while people knowledgeable  about infectious diseases can see (and did see) something that is very important about public health in all such situations, it didn't emphasize what has now become a very important point.  

Any and almost all infectious diseases WILL mutate and become resistant to the first attempt to control them whether this attempt is antibiotics, antivirals or vaccinations. The long and unpleasant history of antibiotic resistance on the part of microorganisms has played this scenario out hundreds of times. When a nation acts like a greedy little piggy and pats itself on the  back for ""taking care of our own"" a microbe or a virus goes on with its daily business, and the result of its busywork is variants that go right past the vaccine, variants that bounce back on the greedy piggy that 'thought' it was protected.  

Vaccine hoarding is exactly like pissing into a strong wind. If your goal is simply to empty your bladder that's one thing. If you'd like to permanently exile the urine from your body and its clothes then the strong wind blows it back at you, and your efforts fail. Vaccine hoarding results in a very temporary 'feeling' of safety at the cost of wasting huge piles of money and time spinning your wheels to no good effect.",,,1612810816,{},gmm05qj,True,t3_lffpdr,False,True,t3_lffpdr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lffpdr/vaccine_troubles_overseas_could_haunt_united/gmm05qj/,1612812529,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Interestingly they had problems sourcing enough orange cones.

They would then hold the cars until about 20 minutes when everyone was released.

I was really amazed at how well it was run. There was a longish wait of about 1 1/2 from start to finish but no one I know was complaining about it.

I think there is no one size fits all especially for seniors since having to navigate long lines and then waiting even for a relatively short period of time would be difficult for many seniors who simply can't walk long distances or stand for long periods of time - so drive throughs make sense.

&gt;In Brazil, several similar cases were documented with a new variant there. Researchers are exploring whether reinfections help explain a recent surge in the city of Manaus, where three-fourths of residents were thought to have been previously infected.

&gt;**In the United States, a study found that 10% of Marine recruits who had evidence of prior infection and repeatedly tested negative before starting basic training were later infected again. That work was done before the new variants began to spread, said one study leader, Dr. Stuart Sealfon of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.**

&gt;“Previous infection does not give you a free pass,” he said. “A substantial risk of reinfection remains.”

&gt;Reinfections pose a public health concern, not just a personal one. Even in cases where reinfection causes no symptoms or just mild ones, people might still spread the virus. That's why health officials are urging vaccination as a longer-term solution and encouraging people to wear masks, keep physical distance and wash their hands frequently.

&gt;California scientists also are investigating whether a recently identified variant may be causing reinfections or a surge of cases there.

&gt;“We’re looking at that now,” seeking blood samples from past cases, said Jasmine Plummer, a researcher at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.

&gt;Dr. Howard Bauchner, editor-in-chief of the Journal of the American Medical Association, said it soon would report on what he called “the Los Angeles variant.”

I wonder if what they refer to as Los Angeles variant is cal.20c that has one documented reinfection with it:

The risk will never be zero, as with everything in life, but the measures were never about preventing *all* deaths, it was about preventing massive collapse of healthcare systems at a nationwide or even global scale. That will be the measure used for risk assessment, much more so than if anyone will die.

I was dismissed and asked to check with a specialist ""which should be able to take me immediately"". Well, I called multiple and it was a minimum of 6 weeks waiting time.

I ended up paying a private doctor to prescribe the medicine and it helped.

Absolutely right. And then once you get out of “the bargaining phase,” you resign to the fact that people won’t ever understand and you’re going to be an outcast for the rest of your life. My autoimmune disease has strict, extreme restrictions that make people be sad around you (if they have empathy), roll their eyes at you (if they don’t), resent you, generally not enjoy themselves whenever you’re around, and ultimately phase you out of their lives. 

It’s a harsh come-down if you used to be social, and were accustomed to being the life of the party and having people be happy to see you. Source: the past ten years of my life. I want everyone who still has their health to read this and do everything they can to avoid anything that would take it away. Trust me. You don’t want to go through this.

No more winter holiday gatherings ever again I guess. 10 person Christmas dinner limits. Sorry grandma, you can no longer attend.
 
Children can no longer play with friends in the playground or meet new kids at school. Only masked and distanced interaction allowed. The alternate is *too dangerous ... GASP!* 

The wedding industry can say goodbye. No more wedding receptions allowed. Right to the courthouse (double masks to and from everybody. It’s ok though, you’re allowed to go down to only *one* mask for the actual vows... we aren’t animals ...) and right home. Only stop for groceries! 

But that’s probably ok. The wedding industry won’t last long anyways, as young adults can no longer socialize and meet each other. Only online school/work where the only actual classmate/colleague you see is your sister. Hey - maybe the porn industry is predicting the future now too! 

Masks and distancing long term. Hah. This has gotten so utterly ridiculous. For most of us here, the risk of covid is so stupidly low *right now* - and even lower after being injected with vaccines that ... *checks notes* ... protects from severe disease at a rate of *100 per-effing-cent*. 

This sub is a cancer. I’ve finally hit my limit. To everyone else who is sick of these BS takes - take a break from this crap. The world isn’t changing for good. We’re going back to living soon, I would guess soon after we get the additional protection that keeps most of us out of the hospital - I know i damn well will. Variants be damned.

As long as some of the vaccines remain even partially effective, this should slow down the rate of new variants showing up, and buying us that time will give us the opportunity to build better vaccines and outrun this thing.

None of this is a guarantee. We could be playing cat-and-mouse for quite some time, updating the vaccines and pressuring the virus to evolve in response and so on.

Tons. There are tens of millions of people who want the vaccine ASAP. This is by far the fastest way to make it happen.

Quarantines and lockdowns have been enforced multiple times before. Why would that be unconstitutional?

Most of them adopted lockdowns. What's illegal?

Obviously there's a lot of variables here, but we're probably looking at ~450M shots needed in arms by Apr/May.  That's 50M people with J&amp;J and 200M people with Moderna/Pfizer.  That number could jump up with approvals for children or if ENSEMBLE II finishes up, but that's also assuming a relatively high up take.  We might be looking at a lot more hold-outs that won't be convinced by Apr/May.

So 450M shots.  We've already done 40M. Let's assume an average of 2.5M for February and 3.5M for March.  We'll need a ramp to hit that 4M-5M number.

That gets us at 195M.  Okay, so we'll still have room to burn at 4M per day for awhile.

But let's assume a slightly slower ramp.  2.5M average in Feb. 3M average in March, and 3.5M average in April.  That's 285M.  We're down to basically one month of burn at 4M-5M per day.  Slow down the ramp any more than that and we'll never hit 4M because we won't have the arms to put the shots in.

Now imagine if while running that model, every 3rd person was a block in the chain bcuz either previously infected or vaccinated. Just 1/3, well below herd immunity level.  

The result will be a massive drop in transmission and infection and every notch above 1/3 will have more and more affect. That is likely what we are seeing now, for real; and also what looks like could be happening in Europe in some areas that also got this last big wave right after we took off.  

Unless there's a strain that completely cuts around all of this (i.e. something NEW)--which we will know immediately as we will see massive amounts of reinfections if that is the case (not isolated reports) it is IMPOSSIBLE to have another wave similar to the last one with the amount of infection already there and the vaccine rollout.",,,1612817026,{},gmmdxmh,False,t3_lfkdac,False,False,t1_gmmcp5s,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfkdac/covid_us_reporting_fewer_new_cases_but_study/gmmdxmh/,1612819495,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

He literally did not. That “quote” is nowhere in the article—you literally made it up. Dr. Ryan was not quoted in the article as saying, “we need to hide the data,” and his quoted reference to “protecting China” could easily refer to protecting them from the reputational harm of being seen to be covering things up by being more transparent. He appears to be saying that it’s in also China’s own best interests to be transparent. He makes no quoted statement in the article about hiding anything from the public.

At this point, I’m still not seeing evidence that the WHO lied. You, however, have definitely lied just now, in this comment.

&gt;But I’m starting to think you’re one of Winnie the Pooh’s Internet warriors

That would be a very convenient way to dismiss anything that you don’t already believe, wouldn’t it? Here—let me remove that convenience:

China under the Chinese Communist Party is a repressive, authoritarian regime with one of the worst human rights records in the world. Its systematic oppression of minorities, in particular the Uighurs in Xinjiang, constitutes genocide and a crime against humanity. China currently lacks all democratic legitimacy, and is rife with abuses of basic rights and freedoms. Fuck the CCP, and fuck Xi Jinping.

My mom has terminal lung cancer, COPD, and emphysema and is now on in-home hospice. Her chemo treatments weren't working to slow the growth of the tumors. Treatments have ruined her mind and body. She is unable to really comprehend what is going on and is at a somewhat unruly and unreasonable stage. She is a fall risk but refuses to take it easy. Last week she was fighting a UTI that nearly killed her. We got antibiotics and on Friday, she snuck out of the house to take the dog for a walk. It's like she's a rebellious teenager.

My grandma has COPD and is frail. She is watching her daughter die. 

My son has moderate mental health issues (schizophrenia and depression and anxiety).

I am also physically disabled which is service connected. I am the only one who leaves the house for food and whatever absolute necessities we have. I forgot my mask once in early April last year. I am wracked with anxiety and I feel like there is no end in sight.

Oxford coronavirus vaccine shows sustained protection of 76% during the **3-month interval until the second dose**

[https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-02-02-oxford-coronavirus-vaccine-shows-sustained-protection-76-during-3-month-interval](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-02-02-oxford-coronavirus-vaccine-shows-sustained-protection-76-during-3-month-interval)

* Analyses reveal single standard dose efficacy from day 22 **to day 90 post vaccination of 76% with protection not falling in this three-month period**
* After the second dose vaccine efficacy from two standard doses is 82.4% with the 3-month interval being used in the UK. (82.4% effective, with a 95% confidence interval of 62.7% - **91.7% at 12+ weeks)**
* **Data supports the 4-12 week prime-boost dosing interval** recommended by many global regulators
* Analyses of PCR positive swabs in UK population **suggests vaccine may have substantial effect on transmission of the virus with 67% reduction in positive swabs among those vaccinated**

This study is important as the literature suggests many individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 still experience neuropsychological sequelae and it will be useful to understand any potential long-standing deficits. **Participants must be over 18 years of age and must have a stable internet connection and access to a computer with Zoom, a microphone, and a camera.** 

**Study Link:** https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/XL56KRN

**Disclaimer (ethical/legal):** This study has been approved by the University of North Dakota IRB (#IRB0002578)

There was a time BEFORE people in Asia wore face masks to slow spread of infectious disease. It basically grew out of the first SARS outbreak (which hit several countries in Asia hard while basically being a non-issue here in the US).

I would frankly be surprised if this DIDNT have an impact on global mask-wearing when a person is sick. I suspect the external social pressure to not be a sick person just coughing and sneezing and farting one's droplets into public is going to shift behavior towards mask usage.

Ahh, the ol' strawman fallacy. We're doing well already!

1. Models with baseless assumptions.  e.g. ""If we assume masks reduce particle transmission by 50%, R0 drops below 1.0 with 25% less deaths than the no-mask model.""

2. Studies based on circumstantial evidence.  e.g. ""After Spain implemented a mask mandate, cases dropped significantly.  Therefore mask mandates are associated with a reduction in infections.""  For bonus points, many of those studies were redacted during Europe's fall surge in cases.

3. Lab studies that looked at particle size and made various assumptions between particle size and infectivity.  e.g. ""Cloth masks saw a 50% reduction in particles compared to the control test.  Therefore cloth masks would reduce infections by 50%.""  That's flawed logic when you consider that most people who get infected don't just encounter the minimum threshold of viral load, they often exceed it.  If you spend 30 minutes on a bus next to someone who has COVID, you're not twice as likely to get infected if that person isn't wearing a mask.  You're probably gonna get infected regardless.  There's never been a double-blind study comparing the infectiveness of actual COVID patients who wore masks versus those who didn't.

Once you factor stuff in that's not affected by mask mandates, such as household transmission and the % infectivity of asymptomatic people compared to symptomatic people (symptomatic people are more infectious, but also less likely to go out in public places), I'm really, really skeptical of how much mask mandates actually do to protect others.

For real-world examples, look at Minnesota and Wisconsin.  Neighboring states with extremely similar demographics that have nearly identical case and death numbers.  Wisconsin has a mask mandate with almost zero enforcement, packed bars, no shutdowns.  Minnesota has a mask mandate with strict enforcement, an attorney general who will fine any businesses that refuse to comply into bankruptcy, and shut down for 6 weeks last winter.  That's not a perfect double-blind study, but that comparison is about as good as it's ever gonna get.

&gt;“We are not defenseless against COVID-19,” said CDC Director Dr. Robert R. Redfield. “Cloth face coverings are one of **the most powerful weapons** we have to slow and stop the spread of the virus – particularly when used universally within a community setting. All Americans have a responsibility to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”

[To the Dutch CDCs messaging:](https://www.rivm.nl/en/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/face-masks-and-gloves)

&gt;It seems **likely** that face masks help prevent infecting others, ""**but only to a limited extent**. It remains important for everyone to comply with the  coronavirus measures and the basic rules. Stay at least 1.5 metres from others, avoid crowded places and if you have symptoms, stay home and get tested. Previous estimates indicated that a disproportionate number of people in public spaces would have to wear a face mask to prevent one single infection. However, the number of contagious people in the Netherlands has risen so significantly that this ratio of prevention is no longer so disproportionate. **It will not be possible to state with certainty within the short term whether face masks do or do not have an additional effect.**

Wisconsin another great example. We saw them vote in person in the spring, told it was gonna be a disaster. S. Ct strikes down covid measures, again we are told this is MURDER.

Meanwhile, nothing happens in WI until September when the latest wave started for every state and it had a normal up and down wave like any other state and its numbers are below average as far as deaths per million, etc. Better than MI for sure.

The public can have confidence in the Oxford jab despite evidence that it is less effective against the South Africa variant of coronavirus, the vaccines minister says.

Writing in The Telegraph, Nadhim Zahawi says the vaccines being used in Britain “work well against the Covid-19 variants currently dominant in the UK”.

It follows an announcement on Sunday of new findings that show the Oxford University-AstraZeneca jab does not protect against mild and moderate infection of the South African variant.

South Africa announced on Sunday it is putting its AstraZeneca programme on hold because of its poor efficacy against the variant which emerged in the country. Its health minister suggested it was only 22 per cent effective against the variant.  

A new Oxford vaccine that can beat the South African variant is likely to be ready by autumn, its designers have said.

It comes amid concern over reluctance to get the vaccine among black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities. Royal College of General Practitioners figures show that 14.4 per cent of white people have had the jab compared to 6.8 per cent of black people. 

In the coming weeks the Government will set out its plans to increase take up in those groups. 




More than 12 million people have now received their first dose of the vaccine, with almost 1,000 jabs per hour administered at one point over the weekend. The Government is on course to beat its target of offering the vaccine to all over-70s and clinically vulnerable people by Feb 15.

Another 373 deaths were reportedon Sunday, the lowest figure since December, as deaths, infections and hospitalisations continue to trend downwards.

It also comes as ministers believe employers can insist that all of their staff get vaccinated against Covid under laws governing health and safety at work.

The idea of 'vaccine passports' - which would allow employers to insist upon proof of vaccination - have been dismissed as ""discriminatory"" by the Government, but the Telegraph understands that the issue is at the centre of a row in Cabinet with some ministers arguing in favour of the scheme.

A collaboration between Oxford and the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa found that viral neutralisation by sera induced by the AstraZeneca jab was “substantially reduced” against the B.1.351 South Africa variant compared to the original Covid strain.

The study, conducted on approximately 2,000 volunteers with an average age of 31, could not determine whether the current AZ vaccine prevents serious disease and death from B.1.351.

However, Oxford scientists said it is likely to do so. They pointed to a recent study in South African by Janseen using a similar vaccine technology which indicated that protection against severe disease was preserved.

Mr Zahawi described the emergence of new variants of Covid as “worrying”, but said: “We should bear in mind that recent studies show the vaccines being deployed right now across the UK appear to work well against the Covid-19 variants currently dominant in the UK.

“In terms of other variants, not in the UK, we need to be aware that even where a vaccine has reduced efficacy in preventing infection there may still be good efficacy against severe disease, hospitalisation, and death. This is vitally important for protecting the healthcare system.”

A tweaked version of the “workhorse” AstraZeneca vaccine is currently under development, and could be rolled out with only a fraction of the regulatory hurdles seen for the first jab.

The team at Oxford’s Jenner Institute said they are also in the preliminary stages of preparing a version to combat the Brazilian variant, should one be required.

Professor Sarah Gilbert, who designed the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: “We have a version with the South African spike sequence in the works. It’s not quite ready to vaccinate people yet.

“It’s easy to adapt the technology, develop a new vaccine which will have to go through a small amount of clinical testing, not nearly the same amount as we had to go through last year.”

She added: “We’re already working on the first part of the manufacturing process in Oxford.

“That will be passed on to other members of the manufacturing supply chain, as we go through the spring, and it looks very much likely that we can have a new version ready to use in the autumn.”



Professor Shabir Madhi, chief investigator of the trial in South Africa at the University of the Witwatersrand, said the new results should prompt a change in strategy.

“These findings recalibrate thinking about how to approach the pandemic virus and shift the focus from the goal of herd immunity against transmission to the protection of all at risk individuals in [the] population against severe disease,” he said.

This follows publication of different results last Tuesday indicating that the Oxford jab prevents two-thirds of Covid transmissions of the original strain, and 100 per cent of hospitalisations, from 22 days after the first jab.

Ministers recognise that the disease will not be defeated through a single vaccine drive, but rather kept at bay through the delivery of a series of tweaked jabs to combat emerging variants.

Professor Gilbert said this could be done rapidly with only a minimum amount of clinical testing, making use of protocols used by the flu vaccination programme, known as strain change, which sees new versions of the jab rolled out each autumn.

One million doses of the AZ jab arrived in South Africa last week for health workers.

""We shall hold on to it,  this is temporary, until we know what steps to do next,” said the country’s health minister, Zweli Mkhize.

He said: “AstraZeneca had promising results and availability. The vaccine is only 22 per cent effective against the new variant.”

The NHS vaccinated nearly 1,000 people a minute for an hour on Saturday, Mr Zahawi said, as under-70s begin to come forward to receive their jab.

Between 11am and midday on Saturday, the NHS vaccinated 979 people a minute, making him “confident” that everyone in high-priority groups will be offered a jab by May.

Officially, the Government has committed to offering a first dose by February 15 to the top four priority groups, comprising care home residents and staff, people aged 80 and over and frontline health and social care staff, those aged 75 and over, and people aged 70 and over along with anyone clinically extremely vulnerable over the age of 16.

However, the Telegraph revealed last week that people in their late 60s had already received letters asking them to book an appointment.

On Sunday the author Sebastian Faulks, 67, became the latest person in their sixties to announce that he had received a jab, tweeting that he had been offered one from his local surgery “even though I’m in wrong age group”.



In contrast to earlier in the rollout, Downing Street is content to allow parts of the country which have moved through the priority groups more quickly to continue at their own pace.

The seven-day rolling average of first doses given in the UK is now 433,8571.

Based on the latest figures, an average of 373,214 first doses of vaccine would be needed each day in order to meet the Government's target of 15 million first doses by February 15.",,,1612743636,{},gmizws7,True,t3_lezjeo,False,True,t3_lezjeo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lezjeo/keep_the_faith_in_oxford_covid_jab_urges_vaccines/gmizws7/,1612743647,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

-the number of superspreading events that will allow it to colonize new population centers

-roll-out and distribution of the J&amp;J vaccine

-targeted deployment of rapid at-home tests to vulnerable groups that haven't yet been vaccinated

That Chu et al meta analysis that gets mentioned, for example, did not reveal evidence for masks. In fact, they said that any evidence for masks is weak at best and isn’t based on research on public masking (the studies that they analyzed were largely poor self report studies in Asia). 

This list also conveniently leaves out more recent studies with more ecological validity, such as the recent study in Denmark (some people call it the “Danish mask study,” but I think the more appropriate term is the “Danish guideline adherence effects” study): https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817

This recent study of Marine recruits also showed no effect of all the guidelines: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2029717

Also this RCT of healthcare workers, who shows that cloth masks specifically can have opposite effects: https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577?fbclid=IwAR10n4XuIqgKFZQDEItYH73EhB0qLO78nid8PmRXeKHJ-1U2p9il5feY830

The point I’m trying to make is this:

A lot of scientific research is like sitting in a quiet room with absolutely no sound. In this room, the quietest of noises can startle you, and when they do, you write a paper saying “noise startles!” 

Cool, we can hear that noise in the lab, but the real world is very loud. That noise that would startle you in the quiet room won’t even be audible on the street. 

Furthermore, there is absolutely no way that a person living their daily life can wear a mask “correctly:” https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks

If the CDC and the rest were honest, they would claim this: we think masks can stop the spread because some studies have shown that some masks demonstrate some filtration effects when we blow aerosols through them in the lab with a machine. 

In the end, we end up with this:

That’s why if you look at Israel’s overall data you don’t see much change but if you look from a granular level at the groups who have gotten both doses you see big improvements.

Same governor?

Many variants aren't that great at being viruses.  [Some have already gone extinct](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/19/danish-covid-mink-variant-very-likely-extinct-but-controversial-cull-continues).

Reinfections are rare, but some studies show [less than 1 in 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kyj0bx/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/) (maybe in the 1 in 10,000 range).  Reinfections tend to be much milder than previous infections, even those new variants. 

Milder cases, especially asymptomatic cases [are worse at spreading the virus](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kcy2e0/weekly_question_thread_week_of_december_14/gg8tp7n/).  

Speculation time: Say you get vaccinated and then get one of the variants, what happens? Well, you probably don't have symptoms, or if you do they're mild.  And your immune system just learned how to deal with another swath of potential variants, probably for a long time, if not forever.

Multiple [studies using monkeys](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03041-6) show both strong immunity, or [sterilizing immunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/la4fud/immunogenic_bnt162b_vaccines_protect_rhesus/) from multiple vaccine types.  

Immunity from the vaccine is [comparable to](https://www.verywellhealth.com/antibodies-from-vaccines-and-from-natural-infection-5092564), or even [considerably better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l5whhu/increased_resistance_of_sarscov2_variants_b1351/) immunity from a previous infection.

Immunity from clearing an infection lasts [*at least 8 months*](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/koxkm1/sarscov2_infection_induces_longlived_bone_marrow/), though [probably a lot longer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/klpvp7/sarscov2specific_t_cell_memory_is_longlasting_in/)  Again, [*at least* 8 months, though you may not even really need very many antibodies,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ldj06f/immunological_memory_to_sarscov2_assessed_for_up/) duration of immunity is looking pretty stellar, since other types of immunity seem to be driving the bus.  It's too soon to say ""lifelong"" but [that is a possibility.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4nkco/the_immune_system_mounts_a_lasting_defense_after/) Also, it looks like those who have recovered *may* only need [one dose of an mRNA vaccine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/labst4/robust_spike_antibody_responses_and_increased/). There are some people who don't develop lasting immunity from infections. 

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l9nfu8/stable_neutralizing_antibody_levels_six_months/) probably a lot,[ lot longer,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/)  probably many years. 

The OG SARS virus, the one from 2003, gave detectable immunity [both 6](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/12/7264) and [12 years later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kvbz9y/weekly_question_thread/gizs32j/)   

Covid19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, OG SARS was caused by SARS-CoV. Looks like both of them came from bats.  [They’re 79% the same.](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930251-8) (PDF)

Immunity from the current vaccines may last just as long, or even longer.

[Cool vaccine tracker](https://covidvax.live/) made by a redditor.

[Another argument against](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kxkrb9/endemic_sarscov2_will_maintain_postpandemic/) the idea that we'll need annual boosters or new vaccines every year.

[Looks like delaying the second dose is fine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/layx6g/single_dose_administration_and_the_influence_of/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) At least with [ChAdOx1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), though there is evidence from the mRNA vaccine trials that suggest that up to 6 weeks is better if not at least acceptable. The problem is that you have to wait longer for the second dose, and therefore, full protection. [CDC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbiqne/daily_discussion_thread_february_03_2021/glvp1nl?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) says there is no maximum interval between doses. 

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) * article does a good job of explaining the likelihood of vaccines *at least* reducing spread. 

[Pfizer's vaccine may also prevent spread](https://news.yahoo.com/israeli-study-suggests-pfizer-covid-143104894.html) in addition to preventing disease. [Wow!](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/coronavirus/1611598602-israel-less-than-0-01-of-second-vaccine-dose-recipients-contract-covid-19)

These are very poor citations.  The first study doesn't show driving of an escape mutant.  It's challenge with a mutant that arose in culture.  A similar situation would occur when a mutant arises in an animal reservoir wherein we have limited protective immunity.

Your second citation is on the development of vaccines to address antiviral resistance induced by replication errors and genomic reassortment.  Limiting the replication of influenza viruses limits the potential for resistant mutants.  

I'm assuming that your third citation is the Rafi Ahmed (my former colleague) paper on BMPCs seeing as you linked to the TOC.  This paper doesn't address anything you're saying.  It states that BMPCs remain for a year.  All but one sample had memory B cells specific for influenza.  Mutant escape isn't addressed anywhere in the paper.   

If you wanted an actual citation, it would be https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X08004489  However, this does not explain why influenza cannot be eradicated as this is at the level of clades or sub-clades whereas there are entire subtypes of influenza that no longer exist in humans (and some no longer exist on the face of this planet).

&gt;With regards to emergence of zoonotic viruses (animal reservoirs):

Again, two very poor citations.  Your first citation doesn't address influenza at all and bats are not a known reservoir for human influenza.

As for your second that you quoted, influenza binds to sialic acid on glycoproteins, shared among species.  The difference is in the linkage.  Pigs have alpha(2,3) and alpha(2,6) sialic acid and humans have alpha(2,6) and a minor population of alpha(2,3).  Birds are alpha(2,3).  Pigs can be infected by avian influenzas, then through drift leads to an alpha(2,6) which then infects humans.  Receptors known.  No immune invasion needed.  **All subtypes of influenza today came from other species.**  This is why influenza can never be ""eradicated"" unless we could somehow achieve herd immunity in all pigs and birds on the planet.

&gt;Yes, animals can serve as reservoirs. Mutations in viral pathogens in reservoir hosts could lead to things like swine flu or bird flu as you suggested.

It's not a question of ""can"" and ""could.""  It's a fact that they do.  

&gt; I would argue that the selection pressure of a virus that jumps species would be to that specific species (reservoir host). Viral evolution within the population of reservoir hosts is under selective pressure by those hosts immune systems. It can definitely increase the propensity to jump species, but it can also decrease the propensity as well.

Given that swine and humans share the same receptor, swine influenzas readily infect humans.  Additionally, given that humans have a minor population of alpha(2,3) linked sialic acids, bird influenzas can infect humans as well.",,,1612798910,{},gml9ngl,False,t3_leg0lw,False,True,t1_gmkc2lv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/leg0lw/mutated_virus_may_reinfect_people_already/gml9ngl/,1612798992,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

By the end of it, it was like I couldn't remember a time when I wasn't on the bus. My life was the bus. I'm exaggerating, obviously, but by the end of a full day confined inside this tiny environment, it did kinda warp my worldview a bit.

I feel like right now, the people saying they will keep masking forever, are mentally on the bus. They have forgotten what it's like to live prior to covid, and therefore when they're extrapolating forward, they just imagine more of covid life, because that's what they've adapted to.

""I can't imagine not wearing a mask in public anymore."" Right, because you've been doing it for a year and staying in your house and not visiting anyone, and your mind has normalized all that stuff at this point. Once the world starts opening up again and community spread drops to a very low number, a lot of people are going to drop the masks, and it's going to stop seeming so normal. At that point, I'd anticipate that some will continue to mask while sick, but that's about it.

Screw off mate. We’re done. Especially after we get our dose of the first generation of vaccines.

Anyway, lol at your praising of the benefits of online learning. You have no idea what you’re talking about. I have 22 students on my Zoom on any given day. They can’t turn and talk to each other, work cooperatively (I’ve tried, it doesn’t work), do any sort of authentic,  hands on learning, and constantly have trouble with technology and internet connections. Many of them do not interact at all, despite my attempts to engage with games and activities, several barely do any work despite my pleas for them to try, to come to my office hours, and my many emails and calls to their parents. I have a few who have started therapy for depression and anxiety. Most consistently do the bare minimum, besides the ones who have parents who are affluent enough to sit next to them and help them all day. There has been plenty of data on online learning during the pandemic and none of it is good. 

You definitely sound like an armchair “expert”. Not surprising for Reddit. Perhaps you do have a bit of experience in education, most likely in the older grades. I teach younger students. I’m sick and tired of adults including middle school/ high school teachers talking about how students need to suck it up and deal with it, when they have never personally had to do what these young kids are expected to do. They have never done what elementary school teachers are expected to do. We are treating these little kids terribly and ignoring their needs for months, essentially. A year in some places! We have kindergarteners who are expected to be on Zpom for hours and who don’t interact with other kids outside of a screen- it’s ridiculous and I’d argue borderline abusive. 

You love bringing up low income students and say they were already behind- that’s true. But wooo boy, can’t wait to see how they’re going to do after all of this. Do you care? Not only are mental health issues, drug/alcohol abuse and child abuse increasing, we are going to see increased crime in the future, mark my words.

**Spillover infection**, also known as **pathogen spillover** and **spillover event**, occurs when a [reservoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_reservoir) population with a high [pathogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen) prevalence comes into contact with a novel host population. **The pathogen is transmitted from the reservoir population and may or may not be transmitted within the host population.**[**\[1\]**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spillover_infection#cite_note-1)

A **zoonosis** (plural zoonoses, or zoonotic diseases) is an [infectious disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease) caused by a [pathogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen) (an infectious agent, such as a bacterium, virus, [parasite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite) or [prion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion)) that has [jumped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-species_transmission) from an animal (usually a [vertebrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate)) to a human.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis#cite_note-mw-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis#cite_note-sgc-3) **Typically, the first infected human transmits the infectious agent to at least one other human, who, in turn, infects others.**

This leads to exponential growth with subsequent decrease caused by the reduced mobility that occurred beforehand.  This is disease wave dynamics.

Symptoms are typically:

- Shortness of breath that persists
- inability to do physical exercise without causing your heart to feel strained
- a large amount of GI/IBS issues, including intermittent nausea
- coughing in some cases can still persist
- chest pains
- brain fog
- issues with blood clotting
- issues with general inflammation being triggered very easily (that can lead to some of the above symptoms, among others, to happen).

Chairman Nguyen Thanh Phong made the announcement Monday afternoon as the city has recorded 31 Covid-19 community transmission cases in eight districts since the country's latest outbreak began on Jan. 28.

All cultural, sport and entertainment activities, beauty salons, massage parlors, internet cafes, wedding centers, theaters, gyms and billiard services will also be suspended from 12 a.m. Tuesday until further notice.

Religious events with gatherings of more than 20 people are prohibited.

Gas stations, shops selling ""essential"" goods like pharmaceuticals and medical facilities will operate normally but must comply with preventive measures.

The Nguyen Hue flower street will not see an opening ceremony as scheduled and will only open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. People who do not wear masks will be strictly fined, the announcement added.

Minister of Health Nguyen Thanh Long said that the Covid-19 situation in HCMC is quite complicated because it has gone through many cycles of infection, so the starting point of the transmission chain has not yet been identified.

He added that the number of patients in the city related to the Tan Son Nhat International Airport outbreak might continue to rise.

The Health Ministry on Monday sent its Deputy Minister Nguyen Truong Son to HCMC to support the city in handling its outbreak.

HCMC currently records 31 Covid-19 cases, of which 30 are related to the Tan Son Nhat airport outbreak.

This is the second time the city has stopped all ""non-essential"" services due to the novel coronavirus. The first time is last March.

There have been all of these analyses of droplets and particles and how far your sneeze travels but this is all just guesswork and doesn't model real world situations.

Most of the studies you see are post hoc statistical analysis that try to correlate lower levels of spread with mask use but they are all various degrees of inconclusive, probably because there are so many other variables at play that they can't control for.

Unlike you, however, I will refrain from asking YOU for YOUR credentials - because this is an open forum and anybody can comment.  I don't need your permission to speak confidently on the subject, and your downvotes would suggest I'm well within the guardrails of generally understood science on this matter.

I am not sure how familiar you are with conditions outside of Sweden, but the US has essentially been full-on herd immunity via infection since last summer.  Restaurants have been open at 100% capacity, families have still been mingling in multi-generational get-togethers, extended families traveled all over the country for Thanksgiving and Christmas, schools have been open in many areas, and the vast majority of people have not had ANY decrease in mobility since last April when we all genuflected with New York while not having any cases ourselves.  The last administration primed the country for letting infections wash through the population and that is essentially what has happened up to this point.  You can't call our case counts of 200,000+ per day anything else other than that.

You can't keep trying to prove a negative without providing any meaningful sources.  Please provide sources to back up your theory that reinfections are a ""significant underlying variable"".

Restricting reinfections to those 244 who were symptomatic we estimated participants in the positive cohort had 95% lower odds 245 of reinfection, aOR 0.08 (95% CI 0.05-0.13).

The reason is simple: it's political.

There was a massive campaign to show that not only the UK regulators are faster then EU, but that the investment of the UK governement in the AZ vaccine was a great big deal - because the UK can produce vaccines for themselves until they don't need them anymore (typical vaccine nationalism).

So it's like the Astrazaneca became the banner for Brexit, which Boris desperately needed after the Herd Immunity disaster, and overall pandemic management.

And it's working, people go completely berserk to defend AZ and UK Govt. decisions, **people were joyful to bash the EU for having AZ over-promise and under-deliver vaccines by more than 50%** - like, such delay and breach of contract will be responsible for potential thousands of deaths, but fuck the EU! Right?

Boris even commented that UK roll out was secured and no vaccine will leave England until UK orders are met - god forbid to let the manufacturer manage their own stock compensate part of their failure with UK produced vaccines, and help EU!

All because they want to win a stupid race, to have the UK see how better they are without the EU, because they are winning the vaccine race. It's sad and disgusting, to participate in vaccine nationalism and to brainwash people.

I really do hope they get the SA variant under control, because if they're going to need mRNA vaccines and the EU makes them wait for stock until EU gets fully vaccinated in reciprocity to their behavior, it's going to be bad.

Currently the only countries that are exporting vaccines is EU, India, China and Russia - in the eyes of the UK Nationalists the only one that's worth anything is India and it's because they are producing AZ.",,,1612809075,{},gmlw7zg,False,t3_lfb4pv,False,True,t1_gmlk3su,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfb4pv/biontechpfizer_vaccine_should_work_against_virus/gmlw7zg/,1612810505,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Show me some serology data that shows greater than 60-75% of the population with immunity needed for herd immunity effects to begin to take place.  66% wasn't enough in Manaus Brazil to prevent another surge.  If you have some data that shows high levels of immunity by more than a model, please present that data and I'll change my mind.  But, as of right now, the much more logical explanation is reductions in mobility.  

Hell, we can even use California as an example.  California was very hard hit in the third wave.  Herd immunity would not allow for an immediate surge when there was a change in mobility.

Scientists, including some from Russia, according to Bucci, would still not have access to raw vaccine development data. In response, they would have received that a ""security department"" will examine the requests. Russian medical experts also confirmed this to SPIEGEL. Such behavior on the part of both the state Gamaleja Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow and ""The Lancet"" is ""outrageous,"" Bucci said.

Four deaths have been reported so far as a result of Sputnik vaccination, he said. Details of the circumstances, however, are available from only two people, he said.

There are inconsistencies in the number of subjects, he said: Two numbers were given in the ""Lancet"" article: At one point, there were 21,977 study participants; at another point, 21,862 participants were listed again.

Questions arose when calculating efficacy: for example, 15 percent of participants in the placebo group would have formed antibodies on day 42. Most likely, they would have become infected during that time and had an asymptomatic course of Covid-19. It's unclear whether that factored into the calculations.

It is also unclear why the number of subjects in the ""vaccination group"" is much higher in the interim studies than in the final report in ""The Lancet.""

In the ""Lancet"" report, there are also discrepancies in the numbers of participants who were infected with Covid-19 despite the Sputnik vaccination: according to the ""findings"" of the study, only 16 of around 15,000 test persons were infected after 21 days, whereas elsewhere in the paper there were suddenly 61 Covid cases in this group on day 20.

Nobody could have predicted that specifically the AZ vaccine would be susceptible to the particular variation in SA, and when the UK vaccination program started the SA varient wasn't being talked about bar in scientific circles, and no evidence of it having a higher vaccine resistance was talked about until in January.

In reality, if not in the 'post-fact age', truth doesn't depend on who says it. Astounding isn't it ? Especially if the tribal reflex is self defeating, which is the major point of this article. 

A fable is in order. Once upon a time A and B who hated each other in many ways, some of them quite bizarre to those who were neither A nor B, were sitting on a railroad track. Both wished to get the sunniest spot, and there was no end of their battles. Suddenly A took a microsecond's break from the battle and looked down the tracks. ""Look out a train's coming"" he said. B said, ""what's your 'subtext' ?  What are you trying to get away with ?"" So it was back to the important thing, the *only* thing in their opinions. 

SMASH ! SQUISH ! SPLATTER ! *End of story.*

To say that I'm stunned would be an understatement haha. I'm finding that very hard to believe. Sharing your profession/field on the internet is harmless haha. But I guess I gotta take your word for it haha.

Why do I then have a feeling like I could ask you about anything regarding the topic of coronavirus vaccines hahaha?

Where does your interest in vaccines or science come from and how do you go about informing yourself on these topics?

&gt;everyone, particularly Americans was spoiled on the high efficacy of the mRNA candidates

Yeah, but Novavax has *the* highest efficacy at 95.6%, it's against the original variant, but that's the data we have for Pfizer as well, so that's the fairest way of comparing them. It's tech is also so weird and interesting. First time I heard of such subunit nanoparticles, although to be fair to me, I only started caring about vaccines recently lol.

&gt;in vivo sera studies w single engineered mutations, ignores interactions and can't capture complexities of real life trials, it's not a proper comparison.

It's more *in vitro*, no? So, on that topic, are you aware of any *in vitro* binding studies like this for vaccines for which we have official efficacy data too? I ask because that would be helpful in perhaps extrapolating that antibody binding data to real-world efficacy or would at least give us some sense of how the two relate.

&gt;One interesting thing I'm looking to is the data on heterologous prime-boost

My second question is what are the possible downsides to combining ANY two vaccines if there are any. From an immunological point of view, there shouldn't be an issue with combining any two vaccines. All of the vaccines simply expose you to the antigen. They do it different ways, but your having been exposed to it a different way the first time around when you get a booster shot using a different vaccine shouldn't have ANY negative implications on that second vaccine's ability to produce the antigen in your cells (if it's a DNA or RNA vaccine).

Of course, you won't be able to predict efficacy, but it would be perfectly safe to assume that the efficacy would be high and that there would be ZERO safety concerns, *in* *my* *opinion*. Simply not knowing the number for efficacy would be inconvenient, but if I imagine a cool thriller-movie situation in which I only have one choice for a booster shot and it's a different vaccine, I *personally* would have ZERO concerns and would be very enthusiastic about taking it lol.

&gt;you're the expert here ))

Haha sure. I am just really stoked about immunology, just like you lol. I really wish I was an expert. Imma become one.

I know it’s tempting to go the censorship route, but this whole Covid crisis has MORE THAN demonstrated the problem with doing that:  whatever “side” is biggest or has the most tech simply then “owns the narrative” and can actively CREATE whatever reality they want (news sources that are ALL pushing the same agenda “fact-checking” themselves and labeling ANYthing they don’t want out there as “misinformation” would honestly be hilarious if it wasn’t so disturbing).  The best recourse paradoxically seems to be to just throw the proverbial doors open, give people ALL the information you have, and let them make up their own minds.

If you remember the guidance from February/early March of last year, there was a general sentiment that medical masks could provide some protection to the wearer, but weren’t worthwhile to prevent spread of the virus or to be used by laypeople. 

After more information came out that masks actually did significantly lower transmission, the tone changed pretty quick. Mask recommendations became requirements and moral imperatives pretty quickly. I think we’ll see more jobs and travel destinations requiring vaccines, and a strong public messaging campaign to go get vaccinated.

There isn’t a particular reason the vaccines *won’t* lower transmission if they cut down on the severity or symptoms or eliminate them altogether.

Somewhere, some algorithm realized that ""Things are looking better"" doesn't get as much engagement as ""Things are getting worse"" so you get the second headline, regardless of how truthful it is or how damaging its untruthfulness is to society.

The same goes for political divisiveness, fake news, etc, etc, etc. Apparently we really like to engage with  content that makes us scared/angry/upset.

Or the total of 10 people they've shot in  a city of 4-7 million for the past 30 years. Lack of  intermingling(relatively) is more because people are not that social  outside their circles in this very Asian city anyways. No barriers to it  because of the peace tho.

I'm very left-leaning but that doesn't mean I'm pro-indefinite lockdown like others. I understood the harsh lockdown at the beginning since we didn't know much... but once we learned more and more about transmission of the virus, effectiveness of masks, and relatively low-risk activities, I stopped supporting indefinite lockdowns, especially of outdoor spaces which are safer than indoor spaces.

The problem is a lot of upper middle-class residents here now think the only way to handle this is to lockdown... not understanding that the virus spread so much in LA because of low-income essential workers sharing households. We can't really shut all businesses down and Newsom knows that. LA has a huge amount of low-income essential workers who live in multi-generational households. That's the reason LA got hit so hard despite the ""lockdowns."" Then when cases surge again, people want every business shut down but Newsom knows he can't necessarily do that without financial support and the ire of businesses.

This last lockdown just didn't make sense to a lot of people. Plenty of indoor businesses could stay open but outdoor dining &amp; campsites were closed. When asked to present evidence that outdoor dining contributes to spread, the LA Health Dept admitted they didn't have any evidence but they just didn't want different households to mix. Well, tough shit because different households were gonna mix anyway; this time inside their homes. Hence the major holiday surge we had. The rules seemed arbitrary, not based in actual science, and it was the turning point of when I became unhappy with them. Instead of promoting reasonable measures &amp; frequent testing, the Health Dept just said to never see friends or family when the rest of us knew that wouldn't work. Especially for those mutli-gen households.

The continuously shutting-down low-risk activities and re-opening with arbitrary guidelines has eroded our confidence in the local health dept. &amp; government.

So yeah, I don't necessarily think Newsom is handling it super well, but now he's got the ire of both sides of the aisle. The anti-lockdown and pro-lockdown crowds are both mad at him for the semi-quasi state he's put us in. They have to keep changing the ""rules.""

Not to mention, the Blueprint for a Safer Economy plan sounded fine in the beginning, but it's 100% unrealistic now. We can't move into the next tier until there's like less than 5 new cases per 100k people. Can't open ""normally with some restrictions"" until &lt;1 case per 100k people.

There isn’t an agreed upon level of antibodies needed to neutralize most viruses or infections, it’s a range. Sometimes a wide range.

If you’re vaccine produces the number 2000, you’re still above the minimum number but likely the response isn’t an overwhelming

In the mRNA vaccine cases, the cushion formed is so massive that in lab testing it can suffer a drop and still be neutralizing. That’s what Pfizer has now found in 3 separate lab tests.

Nope, no herd effects yet.   Total, the US has had less than 28 million people who have recovered from the virus.   Added to the ~42 million vaccinated (assuming no overlap) that's 70 million out of 327 million people, or about 22%.

To reach herd immunity we need about ~65-85 percent, and for existing immunity due to vaccines and recoveries to impact the case rate as much as we're seeing, we'd need enough people with immunity to start ""fencing in"" the virus, in other words situations where it can't reach anyone else to infect.   

This would correspond to small populations with a greater percentage of people who have immunity, effectively herd immunity on a smaller scale than state or nationally.

So far, no states are vaccinating people by area, rather they're targeting vaccines to at-risk people, which means that they're going to save lives, but also that the virus will still be able to spread.

I think even in the US the increase in small family gatherings on a single day may be offset by more people taking time off.

&gt;I wonder if Sweden is getting close to herd immunity. There are some states in the US such as North Dakota that had very few restrictions and are relatively rural with the population concentrated in a relatively few places, kind of like Sweden. Without many controls the cases dropped and have stayed down for months.

Sweden isn't really anything like North Dakota, most people the urban centers of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö, which are fairly dense cities and very few live in rural areas.

\-Democrat and Republican Governors alike want to re-open everything this February including indoor dining and in-person schools.

They are still studying if you can spread the virus after being vaccinated.



&gt;Do the approved COVID-19 vaccines prevent you from spreading the virus to others?

&gt;THE ANSWER

&gt;Right now, experts aren't sure. There isn't enough research on the matter, but studies are underway to find out. 

&gt;""There's still the potential to spread the virus,"" said Dr. David Priest, an infectious disease specialist with Novant Health. ""The science is out on the ability to spread the virus if you've been vaccinated.""

&gt;While experts aren't certain what the vaccines do for transmission yet, they do state the vaccines are scientifically shown to greatly improve a person's chance of fighting off the virus and avoiding illness.
