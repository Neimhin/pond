Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United  States, predicted on Thursday that the daily death toll from the  coronavirus would continue to rise for weeks to come, and counseled  patience with the vaccination program gearing up across the nation.

Hours  later, officials across the United States reported yet another daily  record for deaths, over 4,000. The total for the pandemic in the U.S.  has surpassed 365,400.

In [an interview with NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/01/07/954324536/december-was-pandemics-deadliest-month-vaccine-process-has-been-slow),  Dr. Fauci said the high toll was likely to continue, and was probably a  reflection of increased travel and gatherings over the holidays.

“We believe things will get worse as we get into January,” he said.

He  stressed that it was still possible to “blunt that acceleration” by  strictly adhering to public health measures like social distancing and  mask wearing.

“Now’s not the time to pull back on this,” he warned.

The  virus has exacted a punishing toll across the United States. In recent  days, Wyoming and Arizona been among states that have recorded high per  capita rates of virus deaths, [according to a New York Times database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html). On Thursday, Florida reported more than 19,800 cases, the state’s highest single-day total.

Dr.  Fauci advised Americans to be patient with the snags and delays that  have slowed the vaccination effort and provoked widespread frustration.

Coronavirus Briefing: An informed guide to the global outbreak, with the latest developments and expert advice.

So  far, at least 5.9 million people in the United States have received a  dose of one of the two Covid-19 vaccines that have been authorized for  use, according to [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations).  That figure is far short of the goal federal officials had set to give  at least 20 million people their first shots by the end of December.

Dr.  Francis S. Collins, the head of the National Institutes of Health, said  Wednesday he was “not totally surprised” that vaccine distribution had  gotten off to a “rocky” start.

“We had  this remarkable plan that Warp Speed had put in place to have doses  ready to go the very next day after the F.D.A. approval, but that’s a  lot of logistics,” [he told The Washington Post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRvDOCXZPPE),  referring to Operation Warp Speed, the administration’s vaccine  development program. “So maybe we shouldn’t be too shocked that it  didn’t go like clockwork.”

He also echoed Dr. Fauci’s warning, and said “the next couple of weeks are going to be really critical.”

[But the rollout is beginning to accelerate](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/06/world/covid-19-coronavirus/more-pharmacies-will-begin-distributing-doses-to-high-risk-groups-and-other-vaccine-news).  More people were reported as having received their initial shots in the  third week of the vaccine drive than in the first two weeks combined.  The C.D.C.’s count rose by 470,000 between Tuesday and Wednesday. and  then by another 612,000 between Wednesday and Thursday.

In [a letter](https://www.aha.org/system/files/media/file/2021/01/aha-hhs-leadership-actions-needed-expedite-administration-covid-19-vaccines-lettetr-1-7-20.pdf)  on Thursday to Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human  services, the American Hospital Association called on the federal  government to do more to coordinate what is being done in different  states and municipalities.

“Hospitals  are committed to be a central part of the vaccination effort, but  hospitals alone cannot do it, especially as we care for burgeoning  numbers of critically ill Covid-19 patients, and struggle to maintain  sufficient staffing work to have enough personal protective equipment  and other resources,” Richard J. Pollack, chief executive of the  association, wrote in the letter.

Mr. Azar urged the states on Wednesday not to stick too rigidly to the C.D.C.’s guidelines on whom to vaccinate in what order.

“There  is no reason that states need to complete, say, vaccinating all health  care providers before opening up vaccinations to older Americans or  other especially vulnerable populations,” Mr. Azar said at a news  conference. He added that, “It would be much better to move quickly and  end up vaccinating some lower-priority people than to let vaccines sit  around.”

In  the NPR interview, Dr. Fauci said that any program on so large a scale  would have to overcome stumbling blocks, and that the timing of the  rollout, which began around the December holidays, may have added to the  delays.

“I think it would be fair to  just observe what happens in the next couple of weeks,” he said. “If we  don’t catch up on what the original goal was, then we really need to  make some changes about what we’re doing.”",,,1610084729,{},giiif4r,False,t3_ksv2ns,False,False,t1_giig0to,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ksv2ns/as_us_tops_4000_deaths_in_a_day_a_record_fauci/giiif4r/,1610121984,20,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I agree.  Strains need to be tested with their compounded mutations.  A charge difference here and steric hindrance there can alter the topology of the spike.  N501Y is thought to be for higher affinity to ACE2 and better entry.  E484 and a few others are known to potentially be immune evasive.

Tier 1 includes the highest priority population groups identified in each of the four categories ([Table 1](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/national-strategy/planning-guidance/guidance_508.html#table-1)) and may vary based on pandemic severity and supply. However, Tier 1 is the highest priority group to receive vaccination if there is limited vaccine supply for any level of pandemic severity; groups within Tier 1 may change depending on the characteristics and epidemiology of the pandemic and its impact.

&amp;#x200B;

Tier 2 targets groups in the homeland and national security category that are critical to maintaining our country’s safety and security. Critical community support service personnel are prioritized because they are needed to assist in a community pandemic response and support vulnerable populations such as the elderly, persons living alone, and households complying with voluntary quarantine when a household member is ill (recommended as part of the community mitigation strategy). Mortuary services personnel also are targeted when excessive fatalities are anticipated and risk overwhelming mortuary services. Critical infrastructure sectors targeted in Tier 2 are those that provide “just-in-time services” (e.g., products like electricity and natural gas that cannot be stored), are relied on by all other infrastructures for their essential operations, and contribute to public health and safety. The highest risk children, whose underlying medical conditions increase their risk of complications or death from influenza infections, and household contacts of infants aged less than 6 months old, are included in this tier.

&amp;#x200B;

Tier 3 includes the remaining population groups that protect homeland and national security, provide health care, and maintain critical infrastructures. Critical infrastructure sectors targeted in Tier 3 are those that provide essential products and services where there generally is greater “redundancy” than in Tier 2 in infrastructure (e.g., there are many bakeries, dairies, gas stations) or personnel (e.g., there are many truck drivers); or where burden is likely to decrease in a pandemic (e.g., less demand for mass transit). Many businesses in these sectors can take other measures to protect employees, such as using alternate work schedules, teleworking, and reducing in-person meetings and other contacts in the workplace. In the general population, children without high-risk medical conditions are targeted in this tier.

&amp;#x200B;

Tiers 4 and 5 are focused on groups in the general population that have not yet been vaccinated. During a pandemic with a high/ very high level of severity, Tier 4 includes high risk adult populations such as persons aged 19 to 64 years old who have underlying medical conditions and older adults aged 65 years or older. Tier 5 included healthy adults aged 19 – 64 years old.",,,1610136580,{},gikt446,False,t3_kt5ow3,False,False,t1_gikirz3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kt5ow3/biden_will_release_all_available_vaccine_doses/gikt446/,1610175976,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;The best way to monitor that evolution is by sequencing the virus in as many people who are infected, as often as possible. Only by tracking how SARS-CoV-2 is changing can scientists hope to stay ahead of the most dangerous and potentially more lethal mutations. In Nov., the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) launched a sequencing program that will ask each state to send 10 samples every other week from people who have been infected, in order to more consistently track any changes in SARS-CoV-2’s genome. But it’s a voluntary program. “It’s still not a national effort, it’s voluntary, and there is no dedicated funding for it,” says Baric. “Come on, we’re in the 21st century—let’s enter the 21st century.”

&gt;Without substantial federal funding dedicated specifically to sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes, most of the work in the U.S. is currently being done by scientists at academic centers like the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and the University of Washington. Since early last year, the CDC has been working to better characterize SARS-CoV-2 viruses from patient samples in partnership with some of these academic labs, as well as state and local health departments and commercial diagnostic companies, in the SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing for Public Health Emergency Response, Epidemiology and Surveillance (SPHERES) consortium “If we sequence one out of 200 cases then we’re missing a lot of information,” says Baric. “If we’re sequencing about 20% of cases, then we might start to see something and we would be in the ball game to find new variants. We probably could be doing a better job of that here in the U.S.”

&gt;Other countries are also working on this effort. The U.K. has long been a leader in genetic sequencing, and likely because of their efforts were able to identify the new variant relatively quickly after it emerged. Globally, scientists have also been posting genetic sequences from SARS-CoV-2 to the public GISAID database.

&gt;The good news is that if the mutant strains do become resistant to the current vaccines, the mRNA technology behind the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna should enable the companies to develop new shots without the same lengthy developing and testing that the originals required. “The mRNA platform is eminently flexible to turn around,” says Fauci. If a new vaccine were needed, it would be treated by the Food and Drug Administration as a strain change in the virus target, similar to how flu shots are modified every year. “You could get that out pretty quickly,” says Fauci, after showing in tests with a few dozen people that the new vaccine produced satisfactory amounts of antibodies and protection against the mutant virus.

&gt;Tracking every change the virus makes will be critical to buying the time needed to shift vaccine targets before SARS-CoV-2 leaps too far ahead for scientists to catch up. “We are taking [these variants] seriously and will be following them closely to make sure we don’t miss anything,” says Fauci.",,,1610071019,{},gihu1z3,True,t3_kssgbw,False,False,t3_kssgbw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kssgbw/the_covid19_virus_is_mutating_what_does_that_mean/gihu1z3/,1610106515,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Not sure what your argument is, if you actually have any. Many other people looking into excess mortality based on other periods state them explicitly and explain the differences. For example if you take 2010-2019 - in 2010 Swedish population was 9.3 - a milion less or 10% less than the population in 2019. In 2010 also only about 1.3 milion or 14% were immigrants - in 2019 it was 19.6% or over 2 milion. % of people that are 0-17 years old or 65+ years old has also changed - from 20.4 and 18.5 accordingly in 2010 to 21.1 and 20.0 in 2019. However, if you look at these numbers for 2015 of course these numbers are not as different - 9.8, 1.67M or 17%, and 20.6% and 19.8% accordingly the previous stated numbers. So yes, the baseline is much closer to today than any other years you can take in comparison.

Firstly because I’m a pretty healthy guy who takes care of himself, I’m hyper aware of hygiene right now and I always socially distance and wear a mask. I only leave my house when I need to. I stay up to date on all the latest news and science around the world, and I know the numbers and risks in my local area etc. I supplement vit d, c, zinc, magnesium, NAC, NAD, 5htp etc. I feel my immune system is the best it can be for dealing with a virus. 

Secondly I don’t want to take a vaccine away from elderly or high risk people, or someone who needs it because they are working on the front lines, or keeping our shelves stocked and the economy going.

Thirdly because mRNA vaccines are just too new for me to blindly trust without more data. So far they are looking relatively safe, and it’s looking very promising indeed. But at the same time they are created using a brand new vaccine technology, never approved or tested on humans before this pandemic, at least not tested long term. 

I see myself as very scientifically minded guy who’s capable of understanding and sorting through the science and data. So I just want to see more long term data first.

I have seen no one wearing a mask when I look outside and constantly hear people coughing and hacking outside. It's frankly terrifying. Especially considering we have recirculated air in our buildings and we arent allowed to keep the stairwell doors open.

CFR/IFR is currently falling off a cliff as we get more and more LTC care and elderly vaccinated and as those that are vaccinated move further from their dosage dates and complete their 2nd dose.

Daily death tolls are tricky as they lag pretty far behind when the people actually die, which obviously lag from infection dates as well so we might not see it in the death rates until 4-6 weeks after they have started getting protection from their vaccines.

So maybe early April to see the full effects if CVS/Walgreens hit their Jan 25th date.  With initial effects starting like... right now?  Obviously very very minimal, but we're 2 weeks out from West Virginia completing all LTC doses, other places had started some LTC doses in mid December so those folks are having their immunity start working. 

We are currently just barely cresting the necessary number to hit 1M total deaths (utilizing 7 day rolling average as deaths bunch up during the weekdays because many people filing death certificates don't work on the weekends).

It's hard to say exactly what cases are doing because days off for Christmas and NY have clearly messed up the testing.  Things looked mostly flat from mid December on and this rise above those ~Dec 12th numbers might just be make-up from the dip.

&gt;The not-yet peer reviewed study by Pfizer and scientists from the University of Texas Medical Branch indicated the vaccine was effective in neutralizing virus with the so-called N501Y mutation of the spike protein.

&gt;The mutation could be responsible for greater transmissibility and there had been concern it could also make the virus escape antibody neutralization elicited by the vaccine, said Phil Dormitzer, one of Pfizer’s top viral vaccine scientists.

&gt;The study was conducted on blood taken from people who had been given the vaccine. Its findings are limited, because it does not look at the full set of mutations found in either of the new variants of the rapidly spreading virus.

&gt;Dormitzer said it was encouraging that the vaccine appears effective against the mutation, as well as 15 other mutations the company has previously tested against.

&gt;“So we’ve now tested 16 different mutations, and none of them have really had any significant impact. That’s the good news,” he said. “That doesn’t mean that the 17th won’t.”

&gt;Dormitzer noted another mutation found in the South African variant, called the E484K mutation, is also concerning.

AP NEWS - by CARLA K. JOHNSON and LISA MARIE PANE

The U.S. registered more COVID-19 deaths in a single day than ever before — nearly 3,900 — on the very day the mob attack on the Capitol laid bare some of the same, deep political divisions that have hampered the battle against the pandemic.

The virus is surging in several states, with California hit particularly hard, reporting on Thursday a record two-day total of 1,042 coronavirus deaths. Skyrocketing caseloads there are threatening to force hospitals to ration care and essentially decide who lives and who dies.

“Folks are gasping for breath. Folks look like they’re drowning when they are in bed right in front of us,” said Dr. Jeffrey Chien, an emergency room physician at Santa Clara Valley Regional Medical Center, urging people to do their part to help slow the spread. “I’m begging everyone to help us out because we aren’t the front line. We’re the last line.”

Meanwhile, the number of Americans who have gotten their first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine climbed to at least 5.9 million Thursday, a one-day gain of about 600,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hundreds of millions will need to be vaccinated to stop the coronavirus.

About 1.9 million people around the world have died of the virus, more than 360,000 in the U.S. alone. December was by far the nation’s deadliest month yet, and health experts are warning that January could be more terrible still because of family gatherings and travel over the holidays.

A new, more contagious variant is spreading around the globe and in the U.S. Also, it remains to be seen what effect the thousands of supporters of President Donald Trump who converged this week in Washington, many of them without masks, will have on the spread of the scourge.

Trump has long downplayed the virus and scorned masks, and many of his ardent supporters have followed his example. He has also raged against lockdowns and egged on protesters objecting to restrictions in states such as Michigan, where armed supporters invaded the statehouse last spring.

On Wednesday, the day a horde of protesters breached the U.S. Capitol, disrupting efforts to certify the election of Joe Biden, the U.S. recorded 3,865 virus deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The numbers can fluctuate dramatically after holidays and weekends, and the figure is subject to revision.

“The domestic terrorists overran the Capitol police, just as the virus has been allowed to overrun Americans,” said Dr. Eric Topol, head of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. “The U.S. lost control of a Trump-incited mob and a Trump-played-down pandemic virus.”

Some of the forces contributing to the eruption of violence were partially foreseen by experts in global disease planning when they held a tabletop exercise in 2019, said Dr. Eric Toner, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who directed the drill.

“We did consider the possibility of active disinformation and using a pandemic for political gain,” Toner said. “Real life turned out to be much worse.”

In California, health authorities Thursday reported 583 new deaths, a day after 459 people died. The overall death toll there stands at more than 28,000. The state also registered more than a quarter-million new weekly cases, and only Arizona tops California in cases per resident. Florida broke its record for the highest single-day number of cases with over 19,800, while its death toll reached 22,400.

Los Angeles County, the nation’s most populous with 10 million residents, and nearly two dozen other counties have essentially run out of intensive care unit beds for COVID-19 patients.

“This is a health crisis of epic proportions,” said Barbara Ferrer, public health director for Los Angeles County.

Guidelines posted on the website for Methodist Hospital of Southern California warned: “If a patient becomes extremely ill and very unlikely to survive their illness (even with life-saving treatment), then certain resources ... may be allocated to another patient who is more likely to survive.”

- infected escape into the community causing another outbreak 
- harder to deep clean couches, beds, pillows etc  
- inadequate or shared ventilation systems  
- re-using indoor lifts and corridors with the infected inbound travelers, breathing their air, letting infected outside for exercise via the same shared spaces.

In NZ our leading epidemiologists [have recommended quarantining at dedicated facilities like an airbase](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/covid-19-coronavirus-the-case-to-quarantine-all-travellers-at-ohakea-air-base/DTQTYNXB2EK5GLPF7VCER2R4XQ/). I would add that the military staff that work there from aircrew, security, healthcare, cleaning etc are rostered on and stay at the base for a few months at a time and they need to have a stand down period of 14 days and negative tests before they can return into the community.

To see actual numbers of deaths with regards to lag, I recommend https://adamaltmejd.se/covid/

Some important information about Swedish death reporting:

* Numbers are normally reported 4 days a week (Tue-Fri), but there have been less reports during the last weeks due to holidays
* Sweden reports deaths by death date and not report date, this is why the deaths at Worldometers always seem to be decreasing. Either wait a while or use the link above to compensate for this.
* Wednesdays usually report higher numbers as that is the day registers are cross-checked to find additional deaths that have not been reported yet. This week Wednesday was a holiday (epiphany) so there was no report then, and so it was reported on Thursday instead.
* Do not blindly trust the prediction of the link above though.

**Drugmakers expect tests to confirm vaccines effective against new coronavirus variant**
dec 22, 2020
https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-variant-idUSKBN28W1P5

&gt; At least four drugmakers expect their COVID-19 vaccines will be effective against the new fast-spreading variant of the virus that is raging in Britain and are performing tests that should provide confirmation in a few weeks.

also I've read UK, South Africa are testing independently. Then some universites like this:

**University of Pennsylvania scientists testing vaccines against variants of COVID-19**
https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/university-of-pennsylvania-scientists-testing-vaccines-against-variants-of-covid-19/ar-BB1cvwbq

&gt;""We're testing Moderna, Pfizer, and other people are testing the new variants against people that have been vaccinated,"" said Dr. Drew Weissman, who is leading a team of scientists at Penn. ""My guess is we'll have an answer in the next week or two that confirms, or likely confirms, that the vaccines will work.""

&gt;Dr. Weissman says by creating new versions of itself, what the virus is doing is learning how to better infect humans. To that end, his team is looking ahead at what other variants or viruses may come in the future.

&gt;""There have been three coronavirus epidemics in the past 20 years. You have to figure there's gonna be more,"" said Weissman.

The European Commission has reached an agreement with pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and BioNTech on the order of 300 million additional doses of their corona vaccine, as reported by committee chairman Ursula Von der Leyen.

""We are ensuring that Europeans receive adequate numbers of safe and working covdid-19 vaccines,"" von der Leyen reported on Twitter.

Specifically, the European Commission is proposing to EU member states to purchase 200 million additional doses of the BioNTtech / Pifzer vaccine, with the option to purchase an additional 100 million doses. With the previous orders, the total comes to 600 million doses. Delivery of the first 75 million doses of the new order is expected to be in the second quarter of this year, with the rest to follow in the third and fourth quarters.

In total, the EU now has agreements on orders for 2.3 billion doses of various vaccines.

At this stage I have to say this sounds reasonable. At the rate at which they're getting the vaccine they don't have enough. If they finally start to get more vaccine they can open it up more.

However, large-scale clinics, such as **those held in arenas or stadiums**, those held over multiple days or those conducted during emergency scenarios, will likely require added logistical and technical considerations.

These clinics may be provisionally located at walk-through sites (**churches, community centers, outdoor tents) or other settings such as mobile, curbside, or drive-through sites.**

The government would no longer have to deal with buying/maintaining servers/switches/etc.. for a project that will no longer be relevant a year or 2 from now. They can just contract AWS to get the necessary hardware up and running for a temporary amount of time, all for significantly less money than if they had done it themselves. This amount of traffic would honestly be absolutely nothing for them, they have many different contracts going already that cause way more traffic than this would. And the incentive they have to do it would be money of course, which the government wastes more than this would cost on less important shit on a regular basis.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -As the events that unfolded in Washington on Wednesday captured the nation’s attention, the raging coronavirus pandemic claimed its highest U.S. death toll yet, killing more than 4,000 people in a single day, according to a Reuters tally.

COVID-19 hospitalizations stood at 132,051, stetting a grim record for the fourth day in a row as of late Wednesday night, a Reuters analysis of public health data showed.

As thousands of mostly unmasked supporters of President Donald Trump laid siege to the U.S. Capitol, daily reported cases of the novel coronavirus again soared past the 250,000 mark, taking the total case tally to 21.2 million.

The deadly virus surging in most of the nation is hammering parts of California most severely, including the Los Angeles metropolitan area, pushing hospitals to their limits.

Earlier this week, public health officials ordered the suspension of elective surgeries for at least three weeks in more than a dozen southern and central counties in the state.

Nevada, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania logged their highest single-day death toll on Wednesday.

The latest surge is compounded by the rapid spread of a new, highly transmittable COVID-19 variant that was first detected in the United Kingdom in December and has now spread to at least seven U.S. states, including New York, Colorado and California.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health on Thursday announced the first confirmed case of the variant in Dauphin County, where an individual tested positive “after known international exposure.”

The variant was also identified in Texas on Thursday, contracted by a resident, with no history of travel, of Harris County, which includes the Houston metropolitan area, the Texas Department of State Health Services said.

With the strain on stretched healthcare systems increasing across the country, federal and local officials announced steps to speed the sluggish pace of inoculating eligible residents with two authorized coronavirus vaccines.

On Wednesday, top health officials announced plans to start distributing COVID-19 vaccines through pharmacies around the country earlier than expected this week as states have struggled to administer supplies they have been allocated.

The lack of a federal blueprint for the crucial final step of getting the vaccines into tens of millions of arms has left state and local officials in charge of the monumental effort, creating a patchwork of different plans across the nation.

The partnership with 19 pharmacy chains will eventually allow the Operation Warp Speed program to deliver vaccines to as many as 40,000 locations around the country, U.S. officials said at a news conference on Wednesday.

U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar also said that states should not let recommendations to prioritize certain groups, like healthcare workers, slow the pace of vaccinations.

Azar urged states not to keep vaccines sitting in freezers too long for distribution to priority workers and has encouraged governors to skirt government recommendations for who should receive vaccines first if it can speed inoculations of others.

If states are struggling to distribute the vaccine, “then by all means you want to be opening up to people 70 and over or 65 and over,” he said.

Who should be inoculated has been the subject of yet another spar between New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and the state’s governor, Andrew Cuomo.

On Thursday, de Blasio lashed out at Cuomo for shutting down the mayor’s plan to start vaccinating some residents in group 1b, outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which includes people aged 75 and older as well as frontline essential workers.

De Blasio argued that the city’s public hospitals have “thousands of slots available” due in part to a substantial contingent of health workers who declined to be vaccinated. Cuomo, who has lamented the slow supply of vaccines from the federal government, has argued all healthcare workers should be vaccinated before moving on to the next category.

In neighboring New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy said on Wednesday that vaccinations are being offered to people in the 1b category, including law enforcement and fire fighters, as well as other frontline essential workers.

Murphy said he anticipated there will be fluidity to inoculations, with several groups offered them at once to be sure no vaccine expires and is wasted.

“It is not necessary to vaccinate all individuals in one phase before moving on to the next phase,” Judy Persichilli, the state’s health commissioner, said at a news briefing alongside the governor.

I suspect that the confusion came from estimated throughput for the full sprint, everyone who wants the vaccine can get it, big drive through vaccination points at full capacity estimate being extrapolated to the very beginning of the vaccine rollout where its microtargeted at frontline healthcare workers. Happens all the time when leaders make decisions based off of info from powerpoint slides, or even just reference briefings given to them when speaking to the media. 

One thing I've done is given up hope for getting the shot anytime soon, being a middle aged healthy person.

Sure.  I don't think he stated ""years"" as a fact, and the study you linked doesn't point against it at all in any way.   It is strange you linked to it at all of evidence that the vaccine or infection don't work for a good period of time (like up to a year) because that isn't what it says.  

The vast, VAST amount of information we have, and all the studies we have, and every last bit of information we have about all other coronavirus infections leads us to the probability that immunity from both the vaccine and previous infection is probably a bell curve around 2 years.  Some TINY amount of outliers might get re-infected (but at much milder outcomes) within 1 year, a larger number of people will be immune for about 2 years, and probably VERY FEW people are immune for more than 3 years and will get infected after that time and may very well die from it (if they don't get another vaccine dose)

[https://time.com/5925467/covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy/](https://time.com/5925467/covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy/)

&gt;“There were four cases of Bell’s palsy within a month or month and a half in the Pfizer trial out of 22,000 recipients,” Offit says. “So that works out to roughly eight per 10,000 per year.” Such a case count may be low, but it does exceed the average background rate of Bell’s palsy in the general population, which is 1.2 per 10,000 per year, Offit says. [Other sources](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1071111/#:~:text=The%20incidence%20is%20around%2023,70%20people%20in%20a%20lifetime.&amp;text=It%20affects%20men%20and%20women,left%20sides%20of%20the%20face.) put the incidence as a somewhat higher 2.3 per 10,000.

On the one hand even an eight in 10,000 chance of contracting facial paralysis does sound scary; on the other hand, about one out every 1,000 American was killed by COVID-19 this past year.

It begins with a global perspective on the spread of the pandemic that correlates more with geography, demography and seasonality than lockdown stringency and sequencing. The responses of governments have damaged economies, lost livelihoods, worsened healthcare-access and learning-outcomes, while curbing rights and freedoms of citizens. In India, the draconian lockdown dealt a crippling blow to the economy which has hurt the poor badly but could not ‘flatten the curve’. The inadequate and inappropriate policy response has made the task of economic recovery even more difficult.

&gt;Given the variables, infectious disease specialists have had a hard time determining the risks of flying. But a study published on Wednesday provides some clarity.

&gt;After an 18-hour flight from Dubai landed in Auckland, New Zealand, in September, local health authorities discovered evidence of an outbreak that most likely occurred during the trip. Using seat maps and genetic analysis, the new study determined that one passenger initiated a chain of infection that spread to four others en route.

&gt;Previous research on apparent in-flight outbreaks focused on flights that occurred last spring, when few travelers wore masks, planes were running near capacity and the value of preventive measures was not broadly understood. The new report, of a largely empty flight in the fall, details what can happen even when airlines and passengers are aware and more cautious about the risks.

&gt;The findings deliver a clear warning to both airlines and passengers, experts said.

&gt;”The key message here is that you have to have multiple layers of prevention — requiring testing before boarding, social distancing on the flight, and masks,” said Dr. Abraar Karan, an internal medicine physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School who was not part of the study team. “Those things all went wrong in different ways on this flight, and if they’d just tested properly, this wouldn’t have happened.”

&gt;The new infections were detected after the plane landed in New Zealand; the country requires incoming travelers to quarantine for 14 days before entering the community. The analysis, led by researchers at the New Zealand Ministry of Health, found that seven of the 86 passengers on board tested positive during their quarantine and that at least four were newly infected on the flight. The aircraft, a Boeing 777-300ER, with a capacity of nearly 400 passengers, was only one-quarter full.

&gt;These seven passengers came from five countries, and they were seated within four rows of one another for the 18-hour duration of the flight. Two acknowledged that they did not wear masks, and the airline did not require mask-wearing in the lobby before boarding. Nor did it require preflight testing, although five of the seven passengers who later tested positive had taken a test, and received a negative result, in the days before boarding.

Pfizer and moderna target each number in this code, producing antibodies that target each part.

&gt; There is one obvious cautionary note in the new research: About 10 percent of people infected with the coronavirus see their immune response degrade. There is no clear explanation for why this happens in some people. The human immune system is enormously complex, and the immune response varies greatly from person to person.

&gt; “The kind of immunity you get from natural infection is very variable. And it’s kind of reminiscent of the fact that we can have a tremendous variability in clinical outcomes” from coronavirus infections, said study co-author Alessandro Sette, also with the La Jolla Institute.

&gt; What that means in practical terms is that people who have gotten sick with the virus, or have had a positive test result, cannot know with certainty that they’re in the 90 percent who have lingering immunity, Sette said.

&gt; “If I had covid, I would still not throw away my masks, I would not go to rave parties. People still need to be responsible,” Sette said. “It’s like driving a car where you know you have 90 percent probability that the brakes work.”

Here's a link to the study itself:

https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/01/06/science.abf4063

&gt; 188 individuals with COVID-19 were recruited for this study. Subjects (80 male, 108 female) represented a range of asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 cases (Table 1), and were recruited from multiple sites throughout the United States. The majority of subjects were from California or New York. Most subjects had a “mild” case of COVID-19, not requiring hospitalization. 93% of subjects were never hospitalized for COVID-19; 7% of subjects were hospitalized, some of whom required intensive care unit (ICU) care (Table 1). This case severity distribution was consistent with the general distribution of symptomatic disease severity among COVID-19 cases in the USA. The study primarily consisted of symptomatic disease cases (97%, Table 1), due to the nature of the study recruitment design. Subject ages ranged from 19 to 81 years old (Table 1). Most subjects provided a blood sample at a single time point, between 6 days post-symptom onset (PSO) and 240 days PSO (Table 1), with 43 samples at ≥ 6 months PSO (178 days or longer). Additionally, 51 subjects in the study provided longitudinal blood samples over a duration of several months (2-4 time points; Table 1), allowing for longitudinal assessment of immune memory in a subset of the cohort.

Only 4 of the 188 people studied were asymptomatic.  My concern from the beginning is that many of those asymptomatic cases with positive test results might not have had enough of an infection to generate the necessary immune response.  They did evaluate those with moderate vs severe symptoms but only had 13 participants to look at which isn't enough.  They barely referenced asymptomatic positives because there were only 4.  If I was an asymptomatic positive I'd be careful about assuming this study's implications actually applied to your specific circumstance.

Finally, these were cases confirmed with multiple PCR blood tests over a period of time.  It's far safer to get the vaccination and know for sure you've gotten an adequate immune response instead of guessing that a single positive confirmation (especially if it's a quick antigen or similar) has automatically conferred protection from COVID and you don't need one.",,,1610120863,{},gijtq2k,False,t3_kt3ycl,False,False,t3_kt3ycl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kt3ycl/postinfection_coronavirus_immunity_usually_robust/gijtq2k/,1610154624,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Yeah its probably a bad idea to invite out of staters to your state to get vaccinated when vaccines are distributed by population. There was someone in another sub that said their canadian relatives had gotten the shot in FL. 

BUT Florida is doing what every other state needs to be doing- vaccinating by age alone and with zero other qualifiers. Say you're a 70 year old newlywed immigrant that entered on a k1 visa and is in the process of adjusting status that lives in florida. You're in the US legally, but you don't have residency anywhere but live in florida, and all your docs are foreign save for your relatively uncommon visa in your Botswanan passport. Yes we could write a rule that factors this in, but nobody giving the shots will be able to memorize it and you'd have to escalate several levels blah blah blah. Or you could have strict residency requirements, and this 70 year old legal resident is at the very end of the line. There are likely thousands of other grey areas besides the plausible but likely extremely rare one I thought up. 

IF i was king of florida and saw the lines were too long, you know what I would do? raise the minimum age. Maybe FCFS for 65+ is too much of a mess, but it would run smoother if the minimum age was 85. Then increment it down a year every few days. I wouldn't bother with appointment websites because the most vulnerable are least likely to be able to navigate them. I'm not king of florida, though.

There's a more comprehensive challenge trial in UK ongoing that will investigate this further.  I don't believe pfizer or moderna aims to study this in the US, but I think the UK challenge trial also covering pfizer and Moderna. 

However overall an intramuscular vaccine is limited at its effect in reducing onward transmission, even if it had 99% efficacy against preventing disease. I would guess the absolute tops would be like 50%, This is a respiratory virus after all:

Cuomo keeps moving back the goal posts to prevent any type of NYPause being put back in place.

Part of me believes Cuomo doesn't want to shutdown until the transition occurs and some meaningful legislation can start being passed for aid. Another part of me thinks that he believes New Yorkers will reject the restrictions just like California has essentially done.

Legit question.  I cannot find this exact source; I believe it was something like 88-12, but it was also an older paper so may not be relevant now.

Some background papers though:

[Asymptomatic cases may not be infectious, Wuhan study indicates](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4695).  This is the most recent in a significant line of ""asymptomatic people are not very contagious"" research.

[SARS-CoV-2 viral load is associated with increased disease severity and mortality](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19057-5).  Higher contagiousness correlates with more severe symptoms.
 

There's an overwhelming evidence that before interventions happened, super-spreaders accounted for the majority of spread.  See [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.15.20195008v1) and [here](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/47/29416) for instance.  And super-spreaders are typically those with symptoms; for instance the original Daegu super-spreader was also the person from the Daegu outbreak that was in the hospital the longest.  But when we stop super-spreading, we take away that whole group of transmissions, which might account for so many that what's left includes a significant portion of asymptomatic transmission.  Reducing symptomatic spread from light symptoms also has this effect.   So maybe these two pieces of data are consistent.",,,1610117604,{},gijn720,False,t3_ksp9q0,False,True,t1_gihv50x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ksp9q0/people_without_symptoms_spread_virus_in_more_than/gijn720/,1610150378,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

 [Comprehensive mapping of mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain that affect recognition by polyclonal human serum antibodies (biorxiv.org)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.425021v1.full.pdf) 

Heres a few direct quotes:   . As another example, both E484K and E484Q reduced neutralization by the serum from subject B (day 26) by 10-fold, the same reduction achieved by depleting the serum of all RBD-binding antibodies (Figure 5A,D). 

 Two other RBD mutations, K417N and N501Y, co-occur with E484K in the S.501Y.V2 South African lineage (Tegally et al., 2020). K417N escapes neutralization by some monoclonal antibodies (Greaney et al., 2020; Starr et al., 2020a), but mutations to site 417 only modestly affected binding by a few of the samples we assayed (the largest effects were for the last time point for subjects A and J, see Figure S3). N501Y increases affinity for ACE2 (Starr et al., 2020b) and is also present in a recently described U.K. lineage (B.1.1.7) that may have increased transmissibility (Kemp et al., 2020a; Public Health England, 2020; Rambaut et al., 2020). Although other mutations at N501 have modest effects on binding by some monoclonal antibodies (Greaney et al., 2020; Starr et al., 2020a), mutations at N501 do not strongly affect binding by any sera we tested (Figures 2A, S3). 

 . In particular, emerging lineages in South Africa and Brazil carrying the E484K mutation will have greatly reduced susceptibility to neutralization by the polyclonal serum antibodies of some individuals. In contrast, the N501Y mutation present in the U.K. lineage is unlikely to greatly affect neutralization by most human sera, although it could contribute to increased viral titer or enhanced transmissibility (Kidd et al., 2020; Public Health England, 2020).",,,1610117538,{},gijn2k6,False,t3_ksu7s8,False,False,t1_giiva2o,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ksu7s8/pfizerbiontech_vaccine_appears_effective_against/gijn2k6/,1610150292,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Moderna is 94.1% effective (against cases in general, it is totally effective against severe COVID-19 cases) and Pfizer/BioNTech is 95% effective. Ergo, some people can catch it after being vaccinated, it is just very rare.

As for the ""virology lecture"" (I really should have said vaccinology lecture) sit down, because it's long: The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are RNA vaccines. This means that they target the proteins that the viral family the virus targetted belongs to (in this case SARS-COV-2 of the coronavirus family) uses to invade cells.

Upon invading a cell, a virus releases its genetic code into that cell. The cell then creates copies of the virus, becomes inflated with new viruses, and bursts. These new viruses repeat the process in other cells, and the immune system overwhelms itself in an attempt to stop the process. This causes a viral disease - polio, common cold, flu, MERS, SARS, hepatitis D, pneumonia, chickenpox, et al, in this case, COVID-19.

By targeting the proteins SARS-COV-2 uses to invade cells, we prevent the virus from taking the first step in causing disease, and it is, from my understanding, basically left as a tiny glob of protein floating around in your body. If you sneeze the virus out or cough it out, and it enters someone's body, it cannot cause disease, ergo, you cannot spread the disease.

Florida has a shit ton of high quality hospitals to cater to rich retirees. I live in a relatively small town and we have 3 hospitals, multiple health centers, and billboards advertising our local radiology department that people will literally fly from Canada to use. Plus, about 8 other hospitals in our county. I can't say anything for certain, but I'd bet we have some of the best healthcare in the country.

Rich retirees are already basically bubbled. Other than their friends they play dominos with they never go anywhere. Not a crazy strict lockdown ir anything, but they don't much.

A lot of Florida's population are ""Snow Birds."" People who live here seasonally. Many didn't come down this year. And Florida has a bad track record in counting ""Out of State Visitors"" in the covid count.

Florida in general has had a lot of shady stuff going on with numbers. There have been a ton of stories of crap being fudged. Just from me as a casual observer checking tracking sites. They had the data for ICUs in my county, then the numbers started getting worse, then suddenly they only have data for statewide ICUs not most counties 

I don't have a friend working in the hospital anymore (quit in disgust a couple months ago). But he used to tell me the situation was consistently much worse than the public knows and would outline issues with reporting and transparency with it. Of course, any anecdote like this is filtered through personal experience and might just be representative of a single bad manager. So, take that with a grain of salt.

Vitamin D seems to help. People in Florida tend to be decently active outdoors. And the weather is warm enough that people have stayed jogging in the sunlight all winter. Many places already had infrastructure for moving things outdoors. Humidity I've heard might be a factor too and Florida is crazy humid, but I don't know anything certain there.

The only people that need N95 masks are really people that are going to spend a large amount of time in a space with lots of virus; like ICU doctors and nurses.

For average joes even the cheapo cloth masks can offer better than 50% protection and lower viral load if you do get infected rather than snorting in all the airborne virus possible through the nose.  It also lowers the amount of virus can put out into their environments.

Infection isn't a mystery at this point, whether you get sick or not depends on the amount of time you spend exposed to the virus and the amount of virus that enters your system.  People are vigilant outside, then get home and have friends and family over because of the cognitive dissonance over the fact that their friend or family could have covid.  
We just associate it with some ""stranger"" coughing on us at the market, not your kid bringing it home from school or your s/o picking it up in the breakroom where everyone is maskless and chatting it up.

My explanation is simply this: when bad times come,  most cannot accept thay it's by accident or just because bad things happen in life, but because other humans are responsible. So when a pandemic happens, it's imperative to forget everything you know about biology and nature and claim that Bill Gates is somehow responsible. 
When people are faced with good things, let's say a person gets cured of cancer, he doesn't first thank the doctor nor the medical advancement, but praises some religious figure. When 5g is near, it's not good because people found a way to have faster internet,  it's bad because I read on Facebook that 5g caused the pandemic. And when people produce vaccines and we can start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, it's somehow Bill Gates again responsible.

Now that we're almost a month into the global vaccination effort, I'm convinced that's the way to do it.

If we weren't being as strict about the priority system, we would probably have about 6% of the country vaccinated by now. I don't see this in Biden's plan though, so I have little hope.

I really, really hope we start to see more states drop or loosen the priority system. It's just not working out the way we'd hoped and we need to switch to a system that's meeting expectations.

Edit: Some people have pointed out that Israel is only giving it by age right now, which is true, but the reason I referred to that as ignoring the categorical system is because it's so easy to verify age and to distribute broadly if that's the only category that I don't even consider it comparable to the current American system.",,,1610135382,{},gikqe5m,False,t3_kt5ow3,False,True,t3_kt5ow3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kt5ow3/biden_will_release_all_available_vaccine_doses/gikqe5m/,1610174435,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[Unique form of COVID found in Northern Nevada](https://www.kolotv.com/2020/11/21/unique-form-of-covid-found-in-northern-nevada/)

&gt;RENO, Nev. (KOLO) - Some interesting results are emerging from a research project KOLO 8 News Now first brought forth last May.  
&gt;  
&gt;Researchers up at UNR were sequencing the virus in patients who tested positive to COVID in Nevada.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr.  Paul Hartley from the Nevada Genomics Center was helping break down  samples and plot the RNA of COVID found in patients who had tested  positive to the virus.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the time 76  samples had been processed. By the end of June researchers had tested  200 samples from patients throughout Nevada.  
&gt;  
&gt;Researchers  with the Center for Molecular Medicine hoped to better understand what  kind of COVID was in Nevada and if there was only one virus. They  discovered both  
&gt;  
&gt;“This virus matches  mostly to the European strain, most of the strain we have also seen in  New York and Washington. or California,” says Dr. Subhash Verma, an  Associate Professor at University of Nevada Reno School of Medicine in  Microbiology and Immunology. “But one big difference of what we saw here  was 50% of the variant we picked up here is unique to Northern Nevada.  Northern Nevada somehow has a unique mutation which is in one of the  proteins which makes the virus replicate,” says Dr. Verma.  
&gt;  
&gt;The sequenced results were deposited into an international data base.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  uniqueness of the virus here in Northern Nevada is interesting in that  it may indicate the shelter in place worked and that residents were  spreading the virus just within Northern Nevada.",,,1610140221,{},gil1col,False,t3_ktarwr,False,True,t3_ktarwr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ktarwr/white_house_covid_task_force_warns_of_possible/gil1col/,1610180590,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; so ignore public health advice that says no need to wear a mask

The public health advice changed, so you listen and act accordingly. The mask issue is almost a year old and you people still won't let it go when the standards changed almost 10 months ago.

&gt; Social media and 24/7 news makes it hard for many people to know what's right and wrong.

If you're using social media as your primary or even supplementary resource for how to handle a public health crisis, you deserve to have your internet devices taken away from you.

&gt;  Saying wear a mask/no need for masks is bad messaging.

Again, one issue that's been addressed almost a year ago and you people won't let it go.

&gt; I understand why it was done but you have to be able to see how this creates distrust in what is happening.

Only if you're a paranoid conspiracy theorist who thinks that social media posts and sketchy blogs are reliable, and scientists and health experts are part of some shadowy cabal created to control the masses.

It’s even possible that this improves the effectiveness of the second dose. In any event, the difference is going to be minor.

There are still unknowns about the covid vaccines. I wasn't suggesting that vaccines are bad or ineffective; just warning that you shouldn't assume you can't infect others until the vaccines have been evaluated for that characteristic.

The state has also told officials that if a surplus remains even after all those eligible to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccine under expanded criteria have been granted access, they should move to Tier 1 of the next phase of distribution, which has not yet officially taken effect.

That group includes individuals who work in education, child care, emergency services and agriculture, as well as those 75 and older.

The announcement comes amid a slower than anticipated vaccine rollout throughout the state. The slowdown has been blamed on a variety of issues including the fact that some frontline workers have declined the vaccine and the state has lacked a regimented plan when it comes to leftover doses.


On Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom said that distribution rules would be eased to prevent vaccine from going to waste.

“We want to see 100% of what’s received immediately administered in people’s arms, and so that’s a challenge,” he said during a briefing. “It’s a challenge across this country — it’s a challenge, for that matter, around the rest of the world. But that’s not an excuse.”

Last month, the state health department released guidance that said vaccine doses may be offered to people in lower priority groups when demand eases and doses are about to expire.

“Health Departments may temporarily adjust prioritization based on other resource constraints while continuing efforts to immunize higher priority groups as soon as feasible,” the guidelines state.


To date, a total of 586,379 vaccine doses have been administered throughout the state. A total of 2,052,025 doses, which includes the first and second dose, have been shipped to local health departments and facilities, CDPH said.”",,,1610081209,{},giicwko,False,t3_ksv8pc,False,False,t3_ksv8pc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ksv8pc/california_oks_expansion_of_who_can_get_covid19/giicwko/,1610118222,18,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Now, most people who get a bradykine or cytokine storm don’t die that day, although some do.  It’s that day that they get worse, with many but not all heading to Emergency within the next three days.  

There’s outliers who die earlier along that timeline.

I would assume that with the mild infection you also have a very insignificant chance of long-term damage unlike the general recovered population.

The thing is that immunity doesn't have that much benefit if you can't effectively eradicate the virus and if you have to vaccinate again in 24 months anyway.

A lot of people want to think about herd immunity, but I don't a lot of benefit because The virus still stays in the circulation and Even if the vaccine lasts 2 years that's just not very long for temporary immunity from a virus this infectious.

You don’t have to wear a mask inside for “medical reasons” but you’re also not expected to bother the doctor to get a note from them. We also don’t have to wear them outside.

I don’t know what city centres are like in England at the moment as I live in a rural part of Scotland but I can only imagine that there will be too many people at once for the police to be able to fine. Plus due to cuts made by the Tories, I can’t remember the last time I saw a Bobby on the beat. If there’s no police on the beat how are they going to enforce the thousands of fines that are going to have to hand out every day?

All this will do is just create more distrust in the police and people will throw even more caution to the wind when they realise that the people who are meant to enforce law and order literally cannot because the government would rather put the taxpayers money in leaving the E.U.",,,1610068302,{},gihouka,False,t3_ksp4yk,False,False,t3_ksp4yk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ksp4yk/police_will_fine_brits_without_face_mask_the/gihouka/,1610103653,71,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

As in, “don’t wear them, there is no data showing that they help”.

Now, this is such a limited way of thinking. Honestly. I wore a mask against the advice back then because **common sense** was telling me something.

Then a couple of months later everyone is on board that masks help calming the spread. Duh!? Was it hard to predict?

I don’t think we need evidence to support that we **still** shouldn’t be breathing on top of each other - indoors AND outdoors - when we know for a fact that it spreads via droplets.

Wearing a mask outdoors might seem useless to some because of the “lack of data” way of thinking - but it does no harm and for all we know it could even be helpful.

I wear a mask everywhere I go and I’m quite proud of being over-protective of us all rather than be potentially responsible of manslaughter.

There was a Freakonomics podcast where they talked about how Target stores was sending pregnant women baby/pregancy coupons in the mail. Women were rightly freaked out, because they often hadn't registered or specifically told target they were expecting. So Target started sending them coupons with other things they didn't expect to buy; 10% off sporting goods followed by buy-1-get-1 nipple cream, $25 off a crib between produce prices and new DVD releases. They wanted the pregnancy coupons to look organic, and not targeted - but the truth is they were tracking what people bought using their credit cards, and comparing that to publicly available information to send targeted mailers that looked like anyone could have gotten them. So if you went to Target, bought some stretch pants from the maternity section, and later some stretch mark lotion and prenatal vitamins, Target would see that, thanks to credit cards. Seems mostly harmless, but before they switched to the ""this is totally just a random coupon circular, and not targeted to you"", there were women who had their pregnancy outed by the ""based on things you've bought, you're expecting.

### Summary

**What is already known about this topic?**

Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs rarely after vaccination.

**What is added by this report?**

During December 14–23, 2020, monitoring by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System detected 21 cases of anaphylaxis after administration of a reported 1,893,360 first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (11.1 cases per million doses); 71% of these occurred within 15 minutes of vaccination.

**What are the implications for public health practice?**

Locations administering COVID-19 vaccines should adhere to CDC guidance for use of COVID-19 vaccines, including screening recipients for contraindications and precautions, having the necessary supplies available to manage anaphylaxis, implementing the recommended postvaccination observation periods, and immediately treating suspected cases of anaphylaxis with intramuscular injection of epinephrine.",,,1610125029,{},gik2qkb,True,t3_kt6h0p,False,True,t3_kt6h0p,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kt6h0p/allergic_reactions_including_anaphylaxis_after/gik2qkb/,1610160301,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

False negatives are usually on the order of 10-15%, perhaps a bit more. It's higher with COVID tests; typically 20-30%, sometimes even higher. This is mainly because the virus first infects the nasopharynx, then migrates further down into the respiratory tract. Symptoms often don't appear until the virus has moved down into the lungs, so it's easy to miss. False positives are comparatively rare, usually less than 5%, and are almost exclusively due to contamination. 

Your friend's faint positive could mean a couple of things depending on what kind of test it was. The timing isn't right for the vaccine to be a factor in the test results, plus rapid tests typically test for the virus itself. Most COVID cases are asymptomatic (in fact, most respiratory infections are asymptomatic), so she may in fact be infected, but either asymptomatic or presymptomatic. One week is right about the point symptoms typically develop if they're going to.

There are no possible long-term side effects. 

This vaccine provides your body with messenger RNA which contains instructions for your body to create a protein that makes up the harmless shell of the real virus. Just the shell, not the virus itself. 

Then, within a couple of days, that mRNA disintegrates and is gone. It is no longer in your body and cannot do anything.

From there, your body creates antibodies to beat up on that harmless protein and memory cells to remember it... that way, if you get the real virus later, your memory cells recognize that protein and quickly start producing antibodies to fight it.

Look at Sweden. A place that supposedly fucked it all up by relying mostly on voluntary measures, instead of authoritarianism.

And in Sweden they found that during this pandemic, life expectancy only went down by 4 months on average. 

We lost perspective when we only measure Covid deaths.

Do we want to live antisocial lives isolated from our friends and family under authoritarianism indefinitely, and lose our civil liberties, dignity and autonomy to gain an extra 4 months of lifespan?

Why would we not approve the AstraZ vaccine for those we have data on (those under 50 say) and give it to those people as soon as we can approve it for them?  And give the Moderna and Pfizer to older people?

They will sweep a few shops and bus stations at random here and hand out fines to get some stories they did so at least, to look like they are busy.

[],,CheesecakeAgitated73,,,[],,,,text,t2_8205z1em,False,False,[],"I Found an interesting comment on YT:


"" I have carefully studied the development of the covid vaccines and many things about them are very concerning to me: First of all, up until this point there has never been a successful vaccine for corona viruses, due to a problem typical of corona vaccines called antibody dependent enhancement or ADE. In animal trials for previous vaccines, the animals were vaccinated and seemed to have a good antibody response, but upon exposure to the wild virus, they developed a paradoxical immune enhancement leading to severe inflammation in all the organs of their body (especially the lungs), and they died. There is no way to know if these vaccines cause ADE because it wasn’t tested for in the trials. Due to emergency protocol, the usual practice of testing animals prior to humans was bypassed and the potential for ADE was not directly addressed in human trial participants. Historical precedent would suggest, however, that ADE is a distinct possibility, and we may not know the true negative effects until years down the road when vaccinated persons are exposed to genetically similar versions of corona virus. Second, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain lipid nanoparticles that are “PEGylated”, meaning the nanoparticles are coated with PEG (polyethylene glycol). PEGs can lead to a life threatening anaphylactic reaction. Such reactions are already occurring during the initial vaccine rollout and PEGs are the most likely culprit. Approximately 72% of the US population have PEG antibodies, with 8% having extremely elevated levels (more than 500 ng/mL), putting them at risk for severe allergic reaction and/or future autoimmune conditions. These reactions were totally predictable, with many experts warning of the danger posed by PEGs, yet participants with a history of severe allergic reaction were excluded from the trials, serving to obscure the actual negative impact PEGs will have now that these vaccines are being given to members of the public who have not been screened for PEG antibodies. Additionally, PEG nanoparticles are integral components for state of the art biosurveillance technology currently being developed by DARPA and companies like Profusa that are seeking FDA approval. To me, it is quite strange and concerning that these vaccines contain PEGs (as an adjuvant), given the connections I just mentioned. I do not relish the prospect of being injected with nanoparticles given their association with biosurveillance technology of the military industrial complex. Third, it is impossible to ascertain long term safety because of the foreshortened timeframe of Operation Warp Speed. Vaccines should be tested for 5 to 10 years to adequately assess their longterm effects. Short term safety is questionable too, as much of the data is still unavailable, and the current reports on safety and efficacy essentially amount to self-reported press releases from these companies themselves. Fourth, the efficacy number of 90% for Pfizer and 94% for Moderna, is a statistical trick, reporting relative risk reduction instead of the real reduction of absolute risk (for more info, see below*). Also, the trials only assessed these vaccines’ ability to prevent mild symptoms and NOT their ability to prevent viral transmission. If they don’t prevent people from transmitting the virus (especially when safer, cheaper drugs like Ivermectin do) what’s the point? Fifth, these are NOT vaccines in the normal sense. They are mRNA vaccines, a completely different process for achieving disease protection; mRNA vaccines seek to introduce messenger RNA into the body in order to “trick” cells into producing immunogens, which then stimulate an immune response. These vaccines are the first of their kind ever to be authorized and distributed to this many people. Those getting vaccinated are essentially an extension of phase 3 of the trials. Because of the lack of long term safety assessment and the new nature of this technology, people are participating in a mass human experiment with no way of knowing for sure all the terrible long term health effects these could cause. Many problems from vaccines are known to have an incubatory period and do not manifest until much later on, which is why these need to be tested for multiple years to actually assess risk. One such problem currently being discussed is the mRNA technology’s possible impact on fertility, as the spike protein it encourages your body to make is very similar to a protein crucial for placental development. This could interfere with the reproductive process. The vaccines’ impact on fertility is currently unknown as animal reproductive toxicity studies have not been completed. Sixth, there was a signature for many different problems seen in the various trials and initial rollout for these vaccines, problems that are concurrent with commonly documented vaccine injuries. Injuries that did occur in the various trials included, but were not limited to, anaphylaxis, Bell’s palsy, and transverse myelitis. * Regarding the reporting on the reduction of relative risk instead of absolute risk, in the phase 3 trial of the Pfizer vaccine, for example, 22,000 people were vaccinated and 22,000 were given placebo, for a total of 44,000 trial participants. Of those 44,000, just 170 were diagnosed as having covid-19 post-vaccination. Of those 170, it was reported that 8 received the vaccine and 162 received the placebo. From this ratio it was inferred that the vaccine would prevent 154 out of 162 from getting the disease for an efficacy of greater than 90%. But even as the British Medical Journal explained, “A relative risk reduction is being reported, not absolute risk reduction, which appears to be less than 1%”. It is very concerning that a vaccine is being given to tens or potentially hundreds of millions of people based on a figure derived from only 170 trial participants (just 0.38% of the total participants in the trial).""",,,1610124253,{},gik10v0,False,t3_kd5duq,False,True,t3_kd5duq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kd5duq/pfizers_ceo_hasnt_gotten_his_covid_vaccine_yet/gik10v0/,1610159185,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

"" I have carefully studied the development of the covid vaccines and many things about them are very concerning to me: First of all, up until this point there has never been a successful vaccine for corona viruses, due to a problem typical of corona vaccines called antibody dependent enhancement or ADE. In animal trials for previous vaccines, the animals were vaccinated and seemed to have a good antibody response, but upon exposure to the wild virus, they developed a paradoxical immune enhancement leading to severe inflammation in all the organs of their body (especially the lungs), and they died. There is no way to know if these vaccines cause ADE because it wasn’t tested for in the trials. Due to emergency protocol, the usual practice of testing animals prior to humans was bypassed and the potential for ADE was not directly addressed in human trial participants. Historical precedent would suggest, however, that ADE is a distinct possibility, and we may not know the true negative effects until years down the road when vaccinated persons are exposed to genetically similar versions of corona virus. Second, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain lipid nanoparticles that are “PEGylated”, meaning the nanoparticles are coated with PEG (polyethylene glycol). PEGs can lead to a life threatening anaphylactic reaction. Such reactions are already occurring during the initial vaccine rollout and PEGs are the most likely culprit. Approximately 72% of the US population have PEG antibodies, with 8% having extremely elevated levels (more than 500 ng/mL), putting them at risk for severe allergic reaction and/or future autoimmune conditions. These reactions were totally predictable, with many experts warning of the danger posed by PEGs, yet participants with a history of severe allergic reaction were excluded from the trials, serving to obscure the actual negative impact PEGs will have now that these vaccines are being given to members of the public who have not been screened for PEG antibodies. Additionally, PEG nanoparticles are integral components for state of the art biosurveillance technology currently being developed by DARPA and companies like Profusa that are seeking FDA approval. To me, it is quite strange and concerning that these vaccines contain PEGs (as an adjuvant), given the connections I just mentioned. I do not relish the prospect of being injected with nanoparticles given their association with biosurveillance technology of the military industrial complex. Third, it is impossible to ascertain long term safety because of the foreshortened timeframe of Operation Warp Speed. Vaccines should be tested for 5 to 10 years to adequately assess their longterm effects. Short term safety is questionable too, as much of the data is still unavailable, and the current reports on safety and efficacy essentially amount to self-reported press releases from these companies themselves.

Trump would use the occasion to declare a state of emergency.  Biden would not have been certified, so Trump would continue to rule, since he “clearly won the election that was stolen from him”.  He would then “negotiate” a new, fascist, constitution with the hostage takers occupying the Capital.

That’s how a fascist coup is supposed to work.

My point of linking it was the statements made were that this should provide years of protection and the decay of antibodies is minimal. I would argue the large drop especially in 55+ is not minimal if you actually look at the charts showing nAB drops. That was my purpose in demonstrating that. You can argue it still shows presence of nAB but it definitely isn't minimal drop in nAB. You can argue B cell will revive nAB but wheres the data on that? either in COV-19 infections or here in vaccine trial?

^ that's a good meta-analysis. 

The biggest benefit is that people who have the virus - symptomatically or not - are far less likely to spread it to others if they wear a mask. Micro-droplets in breath are the main vector for transmission and a mask both catches most of them before they can spread, and reduces the distance they spread.

Thanks for giving me a bright spot, The Fatigue is spreading and it's tough to keep up the morals (well ... we're stuck in a situation where morals can go down easily); just had a talk today with two cleaning ladies who are close to giving up (""what's the point of keeping our discipline when everybody else just ignores it? And, by the way, what do you think of The Vaccine?"");

 kudos! to you guys and gals, by the way, for sharing insights on the mechanisms working the RNA-based vaccines - online debates about it are near impossible to win but pin-pointing the fears and working through them one by one seems to do the trick.

These ladies with whom I worked it through today, they're good ol' moms who picked up a cleaning job in the local nursing home. Not stupid, not the brightest candles either, plain good-natured women ... who heard someone tell them in scientific-sounding words how the RNA-vaccines are being used to alter the genetic code of mankind.

 Starting with the cells the body is made up from, through the inner workings of the cells (and a ""safe"" nucleus guarding the reproductive genetic material from outside influences); the difference between nucleus-DNA and intracell-RNA; the job of RNA to build things for our body; bioscientists reverse engineering the vaccine RNA to check what it's doing (and finding that at least the RNA used does what it's expected to do), how the Oxford/AstraZenaca approach uses a different, better-understood technique (wrap a known-harmless virus into the Corona shell); how additional agents in all vaccines are used to stimulate the immune system to respond (and that the well-known side effects of it include that you may have a sore muscle and feel unwell the day after. It's an immune response we're asking for, not a miracle cure).

That no vaccine is ""completely safe"" (as our Minister of Health, trained bankster) claims but the trade-off between 1-in-10,000 and 4-in-100,000 side effects is worth the 20-in-1,000 effects of the virus we're making a stand against ... and that 4-in-100,000 in a population of 83,000,000 does mean that there will be some 3,400 people in total experiencing this effect over the next couple of years (versus 900 people dying everyday, after accounting for an analysis of several thousand cases where the people involved found that in the UK, 88% of all deaths-with-Corona were actual deaths-by-Corona).

Thanks again for bearing with my wall of text, I don't get to talk this through over a nice, cold beer these months. But taking some time to work it through in 1-on-1 (or 1-on-2 situations) seems to help in keeping the morales up for a while longer; help people get less overwhelmed by the information a friend of their cousin has picked up on Telegram :)",,,1610139300,{},gikzaty,False,t3_kt1m32,False,False,t1_gikmcui,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kt1m32/the_us_has_recorded_over_4000_covid19_deaths_in/gikzaty/,1610179397,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Think of it this way:  Currently one person will infect about 3 others.   For numbers to stabilise, 1 person has to spread it to only 1 person.  So you’d need 2/3rds (66%) of your potential infectees immunised.

If only 1/3rd are immunised, 1 person still makes 2 people sick so the case numbers keep growing exponentially.   Not as fast as when it was tripling each generation, but still growing.

In practice it’s a lot more complicated because it’s not like every infected person transits it to exactly 3 others who are all equally at risk of severe disease.   Local lockdowns might have made local  R(eff) much lower than 3.   If it’s down to 2, you’d see a drop in cases at 50% immunisation.  If it’s at 1.5, you see a reduction at 33%.  But it would flare up again if lockdowns were relaxed.   (The formula is 1 - 1/R = herd immunity = when an outbreak starts to die down naturally rather than keep growing.)

[],,PM_ME_GLUTE_SPREAD,,,[],,,,text,t2_16ve5n,False,False,[],"Think of your body like a bank. Many people come in and out of it every day, most are just there to deposit or withdraw money or take out a loan. Sometimes, somebody may come in to rob it. 

People have learned that, when somebody does come in to rob it, they’ll have a black ski mask on.

Now, imagine that the only way for the bank to learn that “black ski mask”=“robber” they have to actually have the robber come in and rob them. After that, they know that if somebody comes in wearing one, there’s a good chance that person is a robber, but only after they’ve had millions stolen.

What the vaccine accomplishes is basically sends a letter to the bank saying “hey, if somebody comes in wearing a black ski mask, there’s a good chance they are there to rob you, keep an eye out for that”. So now, any time somebody comes in wearing a ski mask, the guard at the door can say “you can’t come in wearing that” and sends them on their way.

It’s taught the bank how to identify the robbers without ever having to be robbed in the first place. 

The vaccine teaches your body how to recognize the virus without ever having to get sick in the first place. 

It’s also been through similar testing as any other vaccine just at an accelerated pace. Typically, a vaccine will have to go through different trials, while getting funding from different groups, one by one. These trials can be pretty expensive as the equipment to run them is expensive and paying the scientists to run them is also expensive. 

With this vaccine, the federal government basically said “here’s cash, figure it out”. This allowed the various groups making the vaccine to not have to worry about finding money to pay for the tests. It also meant that, since the cost of the test wasn’t an issue, they could run multiple tests at once instead of one at a time, allowing the vaccine to get the same safety and efficacy scores in a much shorter time, while still going through the “normal” level of scrutiny.

For instance, it is so difficult getting tested in Berlin (I had covid myself and had to go through the ordeal). They make you wait for two hours outside in the rain before testing you. They only test you if you have really severe symptoms. Just mild or normal symptoms or the fact that you were in contact with a positive person is not enough because we don’t have enough tests and/or the labs are already overwhelmed. So they just tell 80% of the People who come to the test center and want to get tested “I’m sorry, not this time (it’s probably easier getting into the Berghain than getting tested for covid in Berlin) just stay at home for 14 days, will ya?” Of course, everyone who’s told this happily obliges /s.

He shared a video with us last night of all the ""fake injections/vaccinations"", just a montage of videos where it looked like they weren't actually being vaccinated.

I shared this fact check article with him about retractable needle technology, which covered quite a few of the ""fake injections"" [https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-miramar-retractable-needle-idUSKBN28X2FU](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-miramar-retractable-needle-idUSKBN28X2FU)

But then I found the article in the OP, and I'm at a total loss for wtf happened here. 5 El Paso nurses are set up to get the vaccination on TV, but 1 of them clearly does not get the injection, and the hospital comes back and injects him a ""2nd time"" after people notice?

Why is the hospital offering a zero explanation for this event? Did the nurse agree to the injection on tv then change his mind last minute? Did the person administering the injection just fuck up? Did they grab an empty syringe by accident and not notice?

Seems hugely irresponsible to offer no explanation for this fuck up because now people like my father-in-law use that as a reason to not get the vaccination, and share the video with their entire extended family to discourage them as well.",,,1610139078,{},gikysn6,True,t3_ktbbwc,False,True,t3_ktbbwc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ktbbwc/update_questions_raised_over_vaccine_injection_at/gikysn6/,1610179107,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
