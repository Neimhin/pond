[],,tractiontiresadvised,,,,,,[],"I'm not an expert, but I've been following [This Week in Virology](https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/) and many of their episodes have addressed these issues.

&gt; potential long terms effects that scientists have not done studies on yet

There have never been any long-term effects from any vaccine which did not show up within about six weeks of vaccination. ([source: interview with Dr. Paul Offit, who developed a rotavirus vaccine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54WDQYvvcCs)) All of the clinical trials went long enough to cover that possibility. But the long-term effects of getting COVID are looking pretty crappy for a lot of people.

&gt; I just don’t want to make a decision I can’t take back

I totally get that, but keep in mind that ""not making a decision"" is *also* making a decision! You have in effect made the decision of ""no, at least not right now"".

Unfortunately, this virus isn't going away, so the way I see it is that you have a choice of getting immunity in a controlled fashion at a time of your choosing from a vaccine or getting it in an uncontrolled fashion from an infection (including reinfection) at an unknown time which may come with a nasty disease. And the longer you keep kicking that can down the road, the more likely it is that the universe will make the decision for you.

&gt; I’m also not comfortable with having to take a booster every 6 months

That's a separate issue, but you probably do not actually have to take a booster every 6 months unless you have a really weak immune system (like if you're on immune-suppressing medications). People have latched on to the idea because your antibody levels do drop after around 6 months, but there's a good chance that they don't need to be at high levels and your T cells will get the job done instead.

not really. scientists fail and learn, fail and learn all the time. then boom, success, that's built on the learning. if science came up with a treatment for als, i wouldnt be suspicious because they failed to treat it for the last 100 years. 

if mrna gives you pause, you can go with the j&amp;j, which is more traditional. you having covid + j&amp;j would prolly result in greater immunity than pfizer anyway. plus, its only one shot.

i dont understand what the origins of the virus have to do with anything. whether its a lab leak or natural, its here and killing people. yeah, scientists are people and not immune to corruption, but vaccines are low cost. the most expensive covid vax is $36. no point to corrupting vaccines--the money is in cures and treatments, so thats where corruption goes. 

as for me, i got vaxxed to protect myself. i have als, so if i got covid, i would prolly die, because covid has a neurological component. anecdotal, but scientists have reported two people with als who went off a cliff after contracting covid (their als sped up and they were bedbound). if the mrna vaccines were so terrible, they would prolly have already killed me off then, eh? but here i am, after 3 shots of moderna, which has a 100 microgram payload compared to pfizer's 30. I'm still walking around and feeding myself.

[],,D-R-AZ,,,,,,[],"Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is detectable in saliva from asymptomatic individuals, suggesting a potential benefit from the use of mouth rinses to suppress viral load and reduce virus spread. Published studies on the reduction of SARS-CoV-2-induced cytotoxic effects by mouth rinses do not exclude antiseptic mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity. Here, we determined the effect of commercially available mouth rinses and antiseptic povidone-iodine on the infectivity of replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 viruses and of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viruses. We first determined the effect of mouth rinses on cell viability to ensure that antiviral activity was not a consequence of mouth rinse-induced cytotoxicity. Colgate Peroxyl (hydrogen peroxide) exhibited the most cytotoxicity, followed by povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), and Listerine (essential oils and alcohol). The potent antiviral activities of Colgate Peroxyl mouth rinse and povidone-iodine were the consequence of rinse-mediated cellular damage when the products were present during infection. The potency of CHG was greater when the product was not washed off after virus attachment, suggesting that the prolonged effect of mouth rinses on cells impacts the antiviral outcome. To minimalize mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity, mouth rinse was largely removed from treated viruses by centrifugation prior to infection of cells. A 5% (v/v) dilution of Colgate Peroxyl or povidone-iodine completely blocked viral infectivity. A similar 5% (v/v) dilution of Listerine or CHG had a moderate suppressive effect on the virus, but a 50% (v/v) dilution of Listerine or CHG blocked viral infectivity completely. Mouth rinses inactivated the virus without prolonged incubation. The new infectivity assay, with limited impacts of mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity, showed the differential effects of mouth rinses on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results indicate that mouth rinses can significantly reduce virus infectivity, suggesting a potential benefit for reducing SARS-CoV-2 spread.

I had very high fever, muscle pains, extreme exhaustion... I coughed my lungs out for more than a week, to the point of almost suffocating. My SO got a shorter version but such high fevers that we had to go to emergencies, while my usually ""I catch every virus around and get scaringly high fevers from it"" 3yo only had a runny nose for two days.
After that I kept suffering from extreme exhaustion for another two weeks, plus a generalized eczema and petechiae on my legs for two more weeks. About a month and a half later, it resolved by itself without treatment (because none of the treatments I got for the eczema worked and the doctors just gave up).
During the last four weeks I had to go to work again, because the ""flu"" was supposedly over and not contagious anymore.
Spanish Healthcare System is good, but we don't get flu tests. Nor mononucleosis ones. You go to the doctor and he makes the diagnosis based on the symptoms. About a month after this ""flu"", my area was the first and worst hitted by coronavirus in the country. And we all know what happened later.
I don't say it was Covid because I don't know, but it could have been and I maybe spread it to half the train during my commuting.
Or it could happen again tomorrow and be another new virus and the beginning of a new pandemic.
Let's test everybody with ambiguous symptoms, always, until we identify what they have. If it is endemic flu, rsv, covid, etc, they just heal at home, but please, let's be sure first of what they have. That way if something appears that doesn't match any known virus, we can isolate it, or issue a public alert, or whatever.

Sorry man, but it’s the market.

[],,Benevolay,,,,,,[],"I have a bit of a conundrum. Throughout 2020, my mother was scared of the eventual vaccine. But we talked her through it and we all got vaccinated in March of this year, with the second shot in April. Now, she's really pro-vaccine. That's great. She just got her booster shot this week, but the thing is, she now wants everybody in the family to get the booster shot. So I feel like the shoe is on the other foot now and now I'm the one who is reluctant.

  
With the first two shots, the science was completely onboard. **Get vaccinated**. So why is the science different with the booster? It isn't being recommended to everybody. Why don't they just recommend the booster to everybody? They say on the CDC website that only at-risk people should get it. I'm a fat guy but I'm otherwise healthy. Haven't had to go to the hospital in over a decade and I don't have any other health conditions. I read over all of the CDC guidelines for who should get the booster and I'm not sure I meet the guidelines aside from my weight. Is my weight enough reason to rush out and get the booster even though it's only recommended for at-risk people?

  
If I don't get the booster I wonder how my mother would react and if that would make her scared of the vaccines again. But the fact that they're not recommending everybody go get the booster just confuses me and I don't really know what I should do. I feel like I should wait and see if/when the CDC expands their guidelines to recommend that everybody get the booster shot, but there's technically nothing stopping me from just going to get the booster shot right now. I just wish I knew why they aren't recommending I do that.",,,,1634454047,{},hgyhnmt,False,t3_q9tnrf,False,True,t3_q9tnrf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q9tnrf/daily_discussion_thread_october_17_2021/hgyhnmt/,1634583531.0,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,[],text,t2_oihsk,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,Sagranda,,,,,,,"Part of the issue is that the 2G ruling (only recovered and vaccinated people) is optional and not a state mandate.

So stores/facilities/etc. which use it could be considered to discriminate against unvaccinated people, which may lead to ""actions"" against them. Be it vandalism, simply bad publicity and maybe even attacks. All those things have happened before.

It also leads to uncertainties of the working staff. Will they lose their job if they aren't vaccinated or not?

&amp;#x200B;

One other issue is that conspiracy theorists and anti-vaccine people won't take the vaccine either way. They may even feel reinforced through such methods.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there's also a group of people who merely hold an imho healthy scepticism about the side effects of the vaccines. Yes, we have a lot of data, but there's also a bunch we don't really know and we have seen side effects after some time that we haven't seen before. Most, if not all, of those are rare, that's true, but people will be clairaudient because of it. Not to mention that people actually died after taking the vaccine which may or may not be related to it. 

I know that I have to deal with almost constant pain in my left chest, am unable to move my left arm without issues (painkillers don't get rid of it, just ease it a little bit) and sometimes have a bit of trouble breathing since getting my booster shot a few weeks ago. It may not be related, but people are careful because of such reports. 

Now they aren't against the vaccine and they actually do all the necessary things beside getting it to minimalize the risks of getting and/or transmitting it. They merely want to wait a little bit longer to see what happens after they have been researched for a longer time. It's imho understandable and yet they do get thrown in the same category as conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers and receive the same penalties.

It can be considered unfair and I know of quite a few people who are now saying ""if they want to discriminate against those who merely want to wait and are a bit sceptic about a new vaccine and want to ""force"" us not directly but through such methods, then I won't take it. I don't want to play their games."".

It's a bit of a ""bratty"" response, but I get it and it will push a lot of people into the ""I won't get the vaccine"" corner. I got my 3 shots due to conviction, but I still understand those people (not the conspiracy theorists and co, but those who are just a bit sceptic and want to wait). People simply don't want to be discriminated against, no matter the reason.

 Individual pharmacies' publications were limited to signs outside to their establishments, and their online websites. Community volunteers had only so much money to set up temporary tents to offer vaccination information. 

Television presence was limited, too. An occasional celebrity appeared for 15 seconds, imploring viewers to ""get the shot"". 

An occasional 15 second advertisement on social media platforms with a plain blue background and white font simply asked us to ""get the shot to stop the spread"". How boring can you get? 

A concerted effort to raise awareness was needed, and not fulfilled. Where were the concerts for the shot?! One or two in my area (75 miles away) advertised free shots upon entry. What about concerts on TV, with songs about people on ventilators, families with no one left to support them, and whole communities deviated? 

Where were the roadside billboards depicting celebs getting their shots? The bus bench advertising was as non-existent, and none were seen on my local buses plastered above people's heads. 

I get an occasional request at my clinic (Florida) for a booster shot. It seems very few are aware that you can just walk into *any* pharmacy and ask for a shot. That pharmacy doesn't stock the shot you want? Go online on that same smartphone that you use to preorder takeout and Google the shot you want. Why is no one aware of this? 

The telephone numbers originally (and still being advertised) for the state health department lead to waiting for hours only to get a message that eventually someone will pick up the phone. In most cases, the caller hangs up without getting the info they're looking for. They still don't know about the CDC website, or think that it's some kind of ""big government evil entity"", and so avoid it. They don't know the number for their local health department. As a result, they never find the information that they should, and fall on Facebook - where someone is always lurking, willing to spread disinformation. 

Our government and local health departments have failed utterly in educating the general public about the vaccinations available, their safety, and the need for social health. It's a terrible shame.

I have no idea how much vaccine waste is avoidable but we'd better study it.

That being said, getting boosters to all the millions and millions of Americans and Westerners who want them WILL rob lower-income countries of doses, and it's not the same as using up doses that would be wasted anyway.

Pharmaceutical companies stand to make billions if they can convince the richer nations to keep buying doses instead of having to sell them to lower income countries instead. I'm not even a tinfoil hat kind of guy but Big Pharma is a thing and it's deeply, deeply corrupt. They produce a lot of good things - obviously - but I would take their own studies with a bucket of salt and look at the global picture.

I think J&amp;J is great, I'd go as far as to say that it is an A-tier vaccine while the mRNA ones are S tier. But at the federal level, there's been a complete refusal until this week to want to admit that there is a difference between vaccines, coupled with a bias against making recommendations for it because there is less data. We were told to get the vaccine we could at the time, and when it became clear that the vaccine was not performing as well, there were no efforts made to fix that. The worst example of this is that immunocompromised people with J&amp;J are still not allowed to get boosters as of today, whereas immunocompromised people with Pfizer and Moderna have been for a month or two now, despite those vaccines performing better in pretty much every piece of data that has been made public.

And now, even with them finally acknowledging the drawbacks of J&amp;J, they are repeating their exact failure. Early studies indicate that even a second dose of J&amp;J will leave people who take it in a worse position than mixing. Even many members of the FDA panel themselves acknowledge this. And I understand that this is new data and that they haven't had the time to look it over. However, they ended their meeting without any agreed upon date to deal with this topic. For people like me who refuse to be put back into the situation we've been in the last half year by taking a second J&amp;J dose, we are left hanging without any indication of when they will consider letting us mix vaccines.

The problem isn't J&amp;J, the problem is the government's failure to adjust to the situation and allow EUAs for us that are uncomfortable with our current protection to proactively fix that. We were told to get the first vaccine offered to us, and then we were definitively shown why that was a bad idea.

[],,michaelthecoder,,,,,,,"I think I can make sense of it. First, what you are hearing that J&amp;J is slightly less effective is probably incorrect in light of recent data. This data that we have gotten this week shows that is not preventing infections pretty much at all anymore, whereas Pfizer has only had its efficiency halved without boosters. This is a bit more extreme than most other reports, but this is newer data than those reports and is a significantly large study. Still, all the data I've seen has J&amp;J as still really good against death. So what gives?

The key is to understand that the body has two main defense mechanisms: antibodies and B/T cells. Antibodies are the immediate defense, whereas B and T cells are the slow heavy weapons. So logically, infections and spread tend to be more about antibodies, as the B and T cells are too slow to do anything about that, whereas hospitalizations and death are more about the B and T cells.

Keeping that in mind, all of that points to J&amp;J doing a decent job with the B and T cells, but a terrible job with the antibodies. This is a complicated situation and different people have different takes on that, which is why you hear such drastically different things. Some people such as the FDA and CDC seem to believe that antibodies are useless and we should only be focused on the hospitalization and death aspect. I do not have a medical degree so I cannot talk about that angle, but I do have a math degree and I believe that this misses our most important tool in the toolbox: preventing spread. You don't ever hear about how vaccinations protected you against polio and measles by keeping you out of the hospital. You hear about how they cut spread so that you didn't get it in the first place! Even if we can't get to COVID 0, cutting spread will still significantly reduce infections, hospitalizations, and deaths.

Another complication is that J&amp;J does seem to be doing worse with hospitalizations than the other vaccines. There's a couple possibilities here. One is that it could be doing worse with the B and T cells part as well as antibodies, but I have an alternative idea. I suspect that Delta is hitting faster than Alpha did, and as such, some people are getting hospitalized before their B and T cells have time to get into full gear, so preventing hospitalizations is pushed more towards antibodies than it had been while preventing deaths is still almost completely correlated with the B and T cells. This is just my personal gut feeling as to what might be going on though.

[],,ScienceHatHa,,,,,,[],"There are multiple coronavirus vaccine platforms.  I’d be very surprised if there was a medical condition that a person could not have a protein based, adenovirus based, or rna based coronavirus vaccine.  

The RNA vaccines seem especially good fit people who have severe multiple allergies. One would think an allergy to RNA would be incompatible with life.  The lipid layer is also not particularly allergenic compared to protein based vaccines.  In the US, people who did react to the RNA vaccines have been told to use JnJ as the second dose.  So even people who have had an adverse reaction to the RNA based vaccines have an option.

I’m in the JnJ trial and was told that if boosters were available that day (this was in September) they would recommend I get an RNA vaccine because of a medical condition I have.  Now JnJ never published the safety signal they saw (it was one event) so it was probably unrelated to the vaccine and that guidance would probably be different today.  

I’m just mentioning these example to emphasize that many doctors would not jump to don’t get vaccinated if you’ve ever had an vaccine reaction.   Instead the guidance is more typically, let’s try a different type of vaccine. 

I also used the childhood egg allergy example in another response.  When H1N1 happened in 2009 - there were a lot of kids with egg allergies whose parents suddenly decided they could try that egg allergy vaccine protocol their allergists had been recommending for years.

You have a virus that’s so dangerous that we all need disruption to our daily lives and mask mandates and yet at the same time so trivial that breakthrough infections don’t matter…except you still have to isolate for ten days.  So I understand the public frustration and I think it’s time to have a very real discussion about where we go from here now that this virus is well on its way to being endemic.

That said, the boosters are not simply “all good and no bad.”  We know that the mRNA vaccines had a significant side-effect profile and that while this was merely an inconvenience for most people, a significant portion of people needed to take to their beds for a day or two (and missing a day of work is an issue for some people) and there were some rare myocarditis cases.  So I think that needs to be balanced against the very real benefit of a booster for reducing breakthrough cases and transmission.

My guess is that in the long term, we’ll find that two doses given four to six months apart work as well as the 0,1,6 schedule currently proposed.  However, remember that a year ago today there were no vaccines and the first top-line results hadn’t even been announced yet.  We were in a hurry and it made perfect sense to try to space the first two doses as closely together as possible.

As a healthcare worker, I’m scheduled to get my booster in three weeks (I got a Regeneron infusion in early August so I have to wait 90 days after that), but I think we should gather more data on booster side-effects before recommending them for the general public.

There is good news: [Israel has reported fewer-than expected myocarditis cases after booster doses](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-reports-very-few-myocarditis-cases-after-pfizer-boosters-2021-10-01/).

But this plague has killed more americans than world war 2 in less than 2 full years.  It has massivly disrupted our economy, our safety, and our day to day life.  The only way it stops being an issue is if enough of the population gets the disease or vaccinated for it to drop the threat level.  It is a novel disease we have no real resistance to nativly.  Since our medical system and economy cannot handle all 333 million americans getting it in a few years, the only alternative is to vaccinate everyone we can.

Since partisan bullshit and misinformation campaigns have made a sizable portion of the population react negatively to the only acceptable solution, we have to mandate it.

Antivaxxers said they'd paralyze all train stations on 01/09 when the pass became mandatory for train travel. The government fielded anti-riot police at all major train stations in anticipation of disorders and... hardly anyone showed up. In some cities literally not a single person.

Then they were going to repeat this some time in mid september, can't remember when exactly. Same thing happened.

This time around, the port workers of Trieste first said they'd halt all the operations last Friday (15/10). They didn't. There were a lot of protesters, but a large part of them weren't actually port workers, they were random antivaxxers coming in from all around. The port kept working, even if at reduced capacity.

Now they're saying the port is back to normal but ""the protest was a win"", and if things don't change they're going to paralyze the port on October 30th...

If you had Pfizer more then 6mo ago for your 2nd shot, and are:

-18-49 with underlying health conditions MAY get a booster, based on their own individual risk assessment (no doctor's note needed)

-18-64 with a high occupational exposure risk MAY get a booster.

""Underlying health conditions"" includes 74% of the adult population based on BMI alone (since it's overweight BMI, not just obese), then goes on to include high blood pressure, current/former smoker, other substance use, diabetes, and asthma, among others.

People at risk due to their job includes healthcare workers, teachers, first responders, grocery store workers... anyone working with the public or in close quarters with many others. Also in institutional settings, e.g. prisoners.

So damn near everyone will qualify one way or another.

Do you have a source for any aspect of that statement? Neither that timeline nor those results agree with what I've heard. The TL;DR is that while there have been failed mRNA vaccines, they met the safety goals of the trials but they failed the efficacy goals (i.e. they didn't work well enough against the thing they were supposed to prevent). Nobody would be able to ""release mrna tech to the public"" unless it had passed a phase III clinical trial, but most of them failed in phase II like [Curevac's prostate cancer treatment](https://www.labiotech.eu/more-news/curevac-mrna-jpmorgan-failure/).

In case you'd like more details with sources, out of sheer laziness I'm going to copy and paste below something I wrote up on the topic a while back.

----

[""The Repeated Setbacks of HIV Vaccine Development Laid the Groundwork for SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines""](https://www.nber.org/papers/w28587) is a surprisingly readable paper from the National Bureau of Economics Research. (Why would an economic researcher write about this? It's a defense of the importance of spending money on R&amp;D even when we don't get immediate results. Biotech stockholders lost money in the short term but the world got a huge win in the long term.)

The parts about mRNA vaccines for HIV are in section 6, ""Nucleic Acid Vaccines"" which concludes thusly:

&gt; By 2019, just months before SARS-Cov-2 was about to enter the world stage, mRNA had reached the forefront of vaccine research, with experimental tests of vaccines against influenza, Zika, and Ebola virus as well ([Maruggi et al. 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30803823/)). With many of the problems of packaging mRNA out of the way, and with the possibility of streamlined fabrication of mRNA vaccines on demand, it has become clear in retrospect that if mRNA vaccines actually worked, they would be the first out of the starting gate in the race for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

Here are the mRNA-related papers which they reference in that section:

[Pollard et al. 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538310/) - mRNA vaccine testing for HIV in mice

[Bogers et al. 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25234719/) - mRNA vaccine testing for HIV in rhesus macaques

[Pardi et al. 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29326426/) - Review of diseases for which mRNA vaccines and treatments had been in trials

[Leal et al. 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30289805/) - mRNA vaccine testing for HIV in humans, Phase I safety trial (they concluded it was safe)

[Maruggi et al. 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30803823/) - Summary of how mRNA is a promising technology for many future vaccines

For diseases besides HIV.... [Here](https://www.modernatx.com/pipeline) is what all Moderna is working on and [here](https://biontech.de/science/pipeline) is what BioNTech is working on. CureVac has also been working on [more mRNA vaccines and treatments](https://www.curevac.com/en/pipeline/); [this](https://www.labiotech.eu/more-news/curevac-mrna-jpmorgan-failure/) is about their prostate cancer treatment which was considered safe but failed its efficacy goals, and [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28754494/) is their phase I safety trial results for an mRNA rabies virus for humans.",,,,1634438916,{},hgxt98k,False,t3_q9f5sv,False,False,t1_hgxiw30,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q9f5sv/vaccine_mandates_stoked_fears_of_labor_shortages/hgxt98k/,1634569557.0,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,[],text,t2_2md6zqzx,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was a short window early on where a vaccine could have squashed sars-cov2 if we vaccinated the whole planet quickly enough, but we never had the infrastructure or cooperation for that to happen and that ship has now sailed.

Now, the push to vaccinate is to make this something that still exists, and still is harmful, but down to a level we can manage.  Currently case and casualty (quarantining, sick leave, hospitalization, and death) rates are high enough covid is shutting down our economies and crushing our hospitals.  The goal with vaccination is to at least drop casualty rates low enough that society can operate as per normal.  It may still kill or injure several times as many people as the flu does every year, but it gives us time to build infrastructure and to make therapies to deal with it.  Hopefully we get good enough at treatment that it becomes another cold or flu.  But we arent there yet.

Anyone who says vaccines will permanently fix covid are missing the hints, deluding themselves, or selling something.

Saying the vaccines aren't worth it is also stupid, as with current fatality and hospitalization rates spread over all 333 million americans, without the boost of vaccinations, we are looking at millions of americans dying and tens of millions more hospitalized before everyone has had it ONCE.  This would continue every year and with every variant until the disease naturally evolves to a less harmful variant or we all develop enough immunity to render it harmless.  Historic pandemics of novel, fast spreading diseases like covid have taken years to decades to resolve themselves naturally.  

Waiting for nature to take it's course is dumb when we have such an accessible alternative to cutoff this disease.  It wont stop it, but it will hinder it.  Most importantly, vaccines massivly reduce the damage it does.",,,,1634448435,{},hgy9zke,False,t3_q9f5sv,False,False,t1_hgy4jdq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q9f5sv/vaccine_mandates_stoked_fears_of_labor_shortages/hgy9zke/,1634579234.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,[],text,t2_15umdw,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,jvalordv,,,,,,,"The richest country in the world has 44.3M cases, 714K deaths. That's a 1.6% case fatality rate. Over 5 million potential US deaths, plus another 1.6% of all Americans in perpetuity. Then there's the millions of Americans with longterm ailments from covid: https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-safety-outcomes/estimates-of-americans-with-long-covid-19-per-state.html

Meanwhile, even with delta and just a 2 shot schedule, the vaccine reduces transmission by 5x, hospitalization and death by at least 10x: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7037e1.htm?s_cid=mm7037e1_w

Unsurprisingly, the states with the lowest vaccination rates got hit hardest by delta: https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/covid-19-deaths-among-older-adults-during-the-delta-surge-were-higher-in-states-with-lower-vaccination-rates/

According to this, out of 9 million J&amp;J doses, there were 28 linked cases of blood clots: https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/coronavirus-vaccine-blood-clots Note that the same article says if you're hospitalized you have a 20% chance of clots.

The chance of getting a blood clot from that vaccine is then .0003%. Google says the likelihood of being struck by lightning is 1-in-15,300, or .0065%. You have 22x the chance of being struck by lightning than you do developing the ""most common"" hazardous side effect of vaccines. You have 5333x the chance of dying from coronavirus in the US using the 1.6% case fatality rate. mRNA vaccines are even more safe and effective.

For this, the J&amp;J was temporarily paused and resumed after further examination. While that should be proof of how important safety is to governments, it just makes conspiratorial people more distrustful.

mRNA vaccines are even safer and more effective. I can run through the comparative stats on those if you'd like.

&gt;Workers must receive both doses by Nov. 30.

However, access to grocery stores, banks and other places that provide essential services will not be dependent on vaccination status.

But at 89, her health problems began to mount: heart failure, weakness from post-polio syndrome, a 30-pound weight loss in a year.

&gt;”I’m in a wheelchair,” she said. “I’m getting weaker. I’m having trouble breathing.” On Sept. 30, Dr. Helen Kao, her palliative care doctor and a medical director at Lumina Hospice &amp; Palliative Care, determined that she qualified for hospice services — in which a team of nurses, aides, social workers, a doctor and a chaplain help patients through their final weeks and months, usually at home.

&gt;Ms. Cotton, a retired accountant and real estate broker, embraced the idea. “I’ve lived a very full life,” she said. “I’m hoping I’m near the end. I need the help hospice gives.” Her sister died in Lumina’s care; she wants the same support. For older patients, Medicare pays the cost.

&gt;But Lumina and other hospices that serve Benton County, Ore., are grappling with pandemic-fueled staff shortages, which have forced them at times to turn away new patients or delay their enrollment — as it did with Ms. Cotton. “It’s devastating,” Dr. Kao said.

&gt;Another of her palliative care patients, Ruth Ann McCracken, 91, has declined physically and cognitively since suffering two strokes last year. Last month, her family made an appointment for hospice enrollment.

&gt;The day before the appointment, Dr. Kao made a difficult call to Ms. McCracken’s daughter, explaining that Lumina had lost several nurses and could not safely admit new patients, perhaps for several weeks.

&gt;Distressed and fearful of delay, the family followed her advice and made an appointment for enrollment with another local hospice, Samaritan Evergreen — only to have that meeting postponed, too, because of a nursing shortage.",,,,1634476125,{},hgzayl0,True,t3_q9y6gl,False,False,t3_q9y6gl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q9y6gl/short_on_staff_some_us_hospices_are_asking_new/hgzayl0/,1634599634.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,[],text,t2_3nelaphm,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tim Walz of Minnesota said on Friday that he would call upon the state’s National Guard to help ease staffing shortages that have kept hospitals from transferring Covid-19 patients for stepped-down care at long-term care facilities.

&gt;Mr. Walz called the transfers a “very typical thing in our medical system” and said they had been bottlenecked by capacity at those facilities. He said the National Guard will be given the training necessary to provide long-term care. He did not say how many soldiers will provide that relief, but said it will be “a fairly large contingent.”

&gt;The governor traveled to North Memorial Health Hospital in Robbinsdale, just outside Minneapolis, to announce the plan.

&gt;North Memorial’s chief executive, Dr. Kevin Croston, said his organization was struggling with staff shortages it did not have a year ago. “Our teams are now more stressed than they’ve ever been,” he said, adding that the “roller coaster” his employees are experiencing is happening all over Minnesota.

&gt;Last week, the state’s health commissioner, Jan Malcolm, said the staffing shortages among health care workers stemmed from “the extreme stress and burnout that they have faced for over 18 months now.”

&gt;The state is facing another surge of cases. Patients infected with coronavirus are nearing 1,000 in the state’s hospitals, according to state data. Cases in Minnesota are up 20 percent in the last two weeks, as are hospitalizations, according to a New York Times database.

&gt;Mr. Walz said that 400 of the patients currently hospitalized for Covid-19 should be transferred to lower-level care but beds at those facilities are not available — and those 400 hospital patients are taking up space needed for incoming patients.

&gt;LeadingAge Minnesota, the largest association of organizations caring for the state’s seniors, said in a statement that the governor’s plan will not solve the root causes of the staffing shortages. The trade group called on lawmakers to make immediate wage increases to support retention during a time when the industry is seeing record levels of burnout and turnover.

&gt;The state also announced that an emergency staffing pool would be reactivated, a measure used earlier in the pandemic.

&gt;State Representative Anne Neu Brindley, a Republican, issued a statement Friday saying Walz’s plan was “merely a band-aid that won’t outweigh destructive government policies,” according to the Star Tribune. She said policies like vaccine mandates are “driving health care worker resignations and layoffs.”

&gt;Andy Cochrane, chief hospital officer at North Memorial Health, said at the conference that 96 percent of intensive care patients at the system's hospitals in Robbinsdale and Maple Grove who tested positive for coronavirus are unvaccinated.

&gt;Nearly 60 percent of Minnesotans are fully vaccinated, according to a New York Times database, and Mr. Walz is urging a push for more. “Don’t end up in the hospital if you can help it,” he said. “One of the ways you can do that is: Get vaccinated.”

[],,jdorje,,,,,,[],"[Here's](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.07.21264626v1) Pfizer data from Israel.  It shows a 10-20-fold improvement in those with third dose vs 2-dose cohorts in each age bracket; however, this has confounding factors in that these demographics may have fundamentally different exposure rates.  It also shows a 5-fold improvement in infection rates in the third-dosed versus the several days after the dose, rising to a 10+ fold in under-30s.  

[Moderna data](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.29.21264089v1.full.pdf) is not quite as good, since we only have phase 2s and not real world data.  A similar antibody titer boost is seen in &lt;65 and &gt;65 age groups, but the starting antibody titers are higher so there is argument for waiting longer. 

We still lack any measurement of cellular immunity after boosting with either vaccine dose.  And we lack any data from the US, of course, though states and hospital systems will likely have data within the next month or two.  Since we aren't running any trials it's pretty important that we give enough people - though not necessarily everyone - third doses that we can get real world data in a reasonable timeline.

The most convincing evidence (though correlation is not always causation) is generally in case counts, as it was in spring.

I was doubtful that there was a single medical condition that would make someone unable to be vaccinated with any coronavirus vaccines since there are multiple types of coronavirus vaccines.  People have options, especially in Indonesia since I’ll bet they have access to the more traditional platforms used by the Chinese, the Astra Zeneca adenovirus vaccine, and the mRNA vaccines.  

So let’s say someone has a reaction to the coronavirus protein based vaccines - well there are two new platforms that are genomic based.  Let’s say they react to the adenovirus - well that still leaves the RNA platform.  Here I’ll spell out so no one can interpret it as yelling - As Far As I Know, there is not a human on earth that is allergic to RNA.  One would think that would be incompatible with life.

If you look at that list you linked for reasons one might not be vaccinated for a specific vaccine  (did you look at the list?) the main reason to not receive a vaccine is a **previous reaction to the same vaccine**.  Additionally, the guidance for the overwhelming number of vaccines was NOT “don’t get vaccinated” The guidance was - talk to your doctor.

There are protocols that allow people with a history allergic reactions to a vaccine ingredient (e.g. children with egg allergies) to be vaccinated with vaccines that contain the ingredient they are allergic to (e.g. egg proteins).

IE: someone who gets their first flu shot in 5 years is more protect that year than someone who gets a flu shot every year. But that first person had to go 5 years without any protection to get that slight extra protection for 1 season. 

I have not read the primary literature on it nor do I even know who would be considered experts in the field to get their opinion, but it seems like plausible problem. Basically, if you get a vaccine that is just very slightly different from the previous year, then it will be neutralized by your immune system too quickly for your immune system to adapt to the subtle, but important changes. But if the virus changes a lot, then a variant-specific booster would still be very effective (even more protective than someone who went without previous years flu vaccines).

Production is no longer the bottleneck, distribution is - unless you're restricting vaccination to only include the mRNA vaccines (as opposed to Sinovac or similar). 

June through August had an average of over 35 million doses given daily. We're down to only 25 million doses/day given. Distribution has ticked up ever so slightly in the past week or two because the EU and the US have authorized boosters. 

The idea that one dose given domestically takes away a dose given elsewhere is no longer accurate. 

Middle income countries across many different geographies like Turkey, Chile, Cambodia, Turkmenistan, Panama, and Brazil all have higher vaccination rates than the US. Big middle income countries like Mexico, Thailand, and others are above 50% first dose. 

While supply is not completely irrelevant, most of the big middle income countries that have low vaccination rates are tied to hesitancy. Russia, the Philippines, and Pakistan have a population where the large majority don't want the vaccine. Indonesia is an exception to the rule, as they have actual supply challenges and are still seeing distribution rates go up. India is the one ""big country"" that has supply challenges still, but that is a choice it has made itself: it is one of the world's largest producers of vaccines and they are choosing to ship them to other countries rather than use them domestically. 

That leaves low income countries. And yes, they have supply challenges, but distribution challenges and vaccine hesitancy dominate in these countries. Regardless of supply, uptake in these countries will be low. 

It was true that the world was supply constrained up until a couple of months ago. But we have reached an inflection point: nearly 7 billion doses have been administered.

**Did the European Union’s Database of Adverse Drug Reactions report 2,000,000 injuries and 20,000 deaths due to coronavirus vaccines?**

Answer: **no.**

The source for those figures appears to be a blog with the dubious name of medicalkidnap.com

In contrast, [here's the EU's summary of the current reports on vaccine safety](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/overview/public-health-threats/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/treatments-vaccines/vaccines-covid-19/safety-covid-19-vaccines), including links to the drug reaction reports mentioned by OP. They don't provide one single headline figure (instead breaking it down by individual vaccine), but I went through and totted them up;

665,707 people reported some kind of medical event after vaccination.

Of those, 6990 died

For reference, that's from a total of 562,800,000 recieving a vaccine.

Why are medicalkidnap's numbers so different? I don't know for sure, but all the reports have the following caveat for anyone attempting their own analysis;

""These figures cannot be extracted directly from the public database of suspected adverse reactions, which groups information per type of side effects. As more than one suspected side effect may have been included in a single case report, the total number of side effects will never match the number of individual cases. Similarly, this public database does not provide the total number of cases reported with a fatal outcome.""

Some people I know are allergic to certain ingredients in the vaccines, others have traced epileptic seizures to times where they were vaccinated, others still have immunological conditions that lead them to be ""unvaccinatable"". All of these people - again these are anecdotal - were advised by their doctors to not get vaccinated. 

It's also true that people who lack institutional &amp; financial support (e.g. can't afford to take the time off work without pay to get vaccinated) can't get vaccinated. 

Those who don't have access to healthcare professionals, where they can safely ask questions about side-effects and potentially adverse effects (however low the probabilities are, they exist and should be open to discussion), can't make an informed decision about whether or not they ought to be vaccinated. Though they *can* make a choice, I think we should ensure that they can make an *informed* choice.

|Condition|US Adult Pct|
|:-|-:|
Overweight/Obese|74%
High Blood Pressure|47%
Current/Former Smoker|40%
65+|21%
Alcohol Use Disorder|13%
Diabetes|11%
Mood Disorder|10%
Current/Prior Cancer|9%
Asthma|8%
COPD|5%
Immunocompromised|4%
Pregnant|2%

And that's just the [Underlying Medical Conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html) guidance.

I'll need to find my source on it, but I'm recalling from when I pulled numbers for a different comment that something like between a quarter and a third of adults in the United States with normal range BMI have high blood pressure—I'll find it for you-but even taking the lower end of that, just the top two medical qualifiers alone get us to 86%, if we use 1/3 it brings us to 90%. Then add in the current or former smokers who aren't overweight or hypertensive and we definitely get to over 90%, then we just keep going down the list adding the dwindling fraction of people without anything listed above.

My rough, to back-of-the-envelope math says it's all but certain we edge up over 99% with the remaining 10 health conditions I listed. Alcohol and mood disorders will probably be somewhat correlated, as well smoking, asthma, and COPD, and smoking and cancer—but there are lots of cancers other than lung cancer. Pregnancy and immunocompromised are likely the two least correlated, so most of those would likely carry through.

On top of that, 50±% of US workers are in jobs which would be covered under the CDC's [Occupational or Institutional Settings](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/essential-workers-boosters.html) guidance.

So, when we're left with only the most healthy Americans—the top _maybe_ 1%—with all else being equal we would expect half of them to qualify.

So, yeah, _a little_ close after all.

&gt;You know what both Germany and UK have in common? They both are falling behind on vaccination while more and more countries climb the stair with more and more vaccine for their population. 

Definitely cherry picking.

Both Belgium and the Netherlands are witnessing significant increases right now - Belgium just posted the highest figure since May. 

Singapore is just now starting to go down the peak of its most massive wave ever, and it's pretty much the second most vaccinated country in the world.

Germany is increasing relatively slowly, and not only it's not that bad vaccine wise (vaccine % in Germany is notoriously underestimated, as the RKI itself mentioned), but also its death rate is pretty much the same as Italy's despite 5x the cases. Which means that either covid in Germany is more merciful than in Italy, or more simply that Germany is catching more cases. Which in turn makes it once again very clear how comparing different countries' case load figures and taking them at face value is pretty meaningless as they will always be affected by testing rates and policies.

The main difference is that second hand smoke doesn’t spread and kill people within days/weeks of exposure, nor does it further spread from those who just inhale it once to even more people exponentially.

The reason the covid numbers are remotely comparable to yearly smoking deaths is because of mitigation for the past 19 months - masks, distancing, and now vaccines. Unlike smoking, if the virus spread unchecked, it can potentially infect 80%+ of the population in a short amount of time. At a death rate of 1-2 per 100 infected, you can reach more than 3 million deaths and 10 times more hospitalizations.

I think most of the new trials are focusing on limiting circulation of RSV by producing a more durable immune response in adults. I'm not optimistic that it will gain enough traction to limit the spread in a given community, but if enough parents of young children get it perhaps it's enough.

Also, it's spread here as misinformation often, but RSV is one of the few viruses where ADE has been observed. An early vaccine candidate with inactivated virus caused it, and there have been studies that show even naturally derived antibodies can result in ADE (at one time there was speculation that a mother's own antibodies passed near the time of birth may have resulted in ADE for the first RSV infection in newborns, though I don't think that was established as fact).

Because first I would have to get covid which is unlikely then I would have to get long covid which is even more unlikely and then we would have to last longer than a couple of weeks. What's more, I don't want to live my life the way we lived the last 15 months. Honestly I would have rather gotten covid and died early on. So the risk of long covid to me seems miniscule to the thought of the pain of living like we have.

&gt;But if the virus changes a lot, then a variant-specific booster would still be very effective (even more protective than someone who went without previous years flu vaccines).

When you are talking about large changes in the flu virus, having a broad exposure of multiple years to a varieties of flus is going to be an advantage.

Got the weirdest rant ever. For our store “you need a mask to shop in our store”

The anti-maskers were complaining that we were pointing them out and making them feel like monsters and not respected because we don’t provide them a mask.
- What happen is this procedure:
1. Do you have a mask.

2. If no, Sorry we don’t have anymore masks please maintain social distancing

3. That is all there is no barring anyone from entering the store.

Apparently the “problem” is we make them feel like anti-maskers because they are one of the few people in the store not wearing a mask and all the employees are talking to them from a distance. Stating that we need to provide them a mask to make them feel comfortable.

The worst part is some anti-maskers are seeking validation from us to let them. Our employees cannot stop anti-maskers from coming. We allowed them to not give the anti-maskers validation of shopping without a mask.
The thing is, we literally ran out of masks after going through 150box ( 50per count) for the week. Providing masks is your responsibility and not the store’s ( you were capable of doing this 3 month ago). The social distancing is standard protocol of doing our best to keep our employees safe.
