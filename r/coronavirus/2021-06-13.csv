You wipe with your left hand, this is also the reason using your left hand to do anything is taboo in so many cultures, you never touch food with your left hand, never touch people with it, never offer money with it.

I live in Thailand, I don't use toilet paper. I cycled across the Middle East and India, didn't use toilet paper there either. China is an outlier in that they *do* use toilet paper, in fact they invented the stuff. Most of Asia doesn't use it, or at least doesn't traditionally as the primary method.

Bidets far less common in Europe, bidets exist to an extent but not the same way water is used as the primary method here. Bidets in Europe are often a distinct fixture [2] that you'd move to after. In most of Asia, they are traditionally a bucket of water with a scoop [3] but in more modern times are often a hose with a trigger spray at the end [4] (colloquially known as a ""bum gun"").

He's correct that much of the world doesn't use TP. He just got the continent wrong.

Reasonable accommodations are not just give to any and anyone who just decides they don't want the vaccine.  Reasonable accommodations exist under the ADA.  So if you do not have a legitimate reason to not get the vaccine, they do not have to provide you a reasonable accommodation.

Examples:

Employee 1:  Anti-vaxxer with no medical issues.  Refuses to get vaccine.  

Employee 2: Has an autoimmune disease and has had bad reactions to vaccines in the past.  Refuses to get vaccine.

The employer MUST grant a reasonable accommodation to Employee 2 but does not need to for Employee 1. Employee 1 is not protected under the ADA and so reasonable accommodations are irrelevant.

Now, the reasonableness of accommodations is a fairly highly litigated topic from time to time and, if the employer, such as a healthy system like in the article, says that it is not reasonable for them to employ an individual that is unvaccinated even with PPE, masks, distancing, etc., then that is their perogative.  A court will then decide if they made the right decision regarding reasonableness.

A lot of people are surprised to learn that retiring to Europe is quite difficult and not really an option for them. It isn't just that it's difficult, it's that it's nearly impossible. For instance, in Ireland you would have to have proof of €50,000 per year to cover your expenses, plus a lump sum of cash (~equivalent to the price of a house in the US according to the embassy), plus carry private health insurance, because they don't for obvious reasons want Americans using up the resources they intend for Irish citizens. If you have decades to plan, yeah, you might be able to come up with that... But most people just don't make that kind of money.

It's a nice dream and one I'd like to pursue, too. I just think it's a good idea to know what to expect.

It's currently unknown if the guard and hospital staffs have infected any unvaccinated patients, but they have certainly infected other fully vaccinated people.

For countries that pursue mitigation through vaccination like the US, the silent spread is considered a non-issue by the American government and populace, but Vietnam follows a Zero Covid strategy, and a silent spread in a dangerous setting like in hospitals among a largely unvaccinated population (meaning that the ill and unvaccinated patients are likely going to get very sick and die) is an unacceptable scenario to be stomped out immediately. Frankly put, that kind of silent spread only encourages the virus to mutate into something vaccine-resistent due to the massive selective pressure of all these vaccinated but still infected people. On an individual scale, sure, you're vaccinated and you basically get a get out of jail free card unless you're really unlucky. However, on a society-wide scale, allowing silent spread among the vaccinated people on a grand scale of billions of people are almost definitely going to kill a lot of people without access to vaccines or unable to get vaccinated, and the first people to die will be will be the unvaccinated patients, family members, and neighbors of the people who got vaccinated.",,,1623688877,{},h1qwzpp,True,t3_nzlv7k,False,True,t1_h1qqyxr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nzlv7k/vietnam_53_health_care_workers_in_hcmc_infected/h1qwzpp/,1623963120,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Couldn't find a good local dashboard with English search terms (maybe you have a link), so had to opt for OWID (don't like to use it to compare with the Netherlands because their data is lacking for the Netherlands).

It maybe also just have to do with what we perceive as a ""good"" or acceptable level in each country. In the Netherlands they find less than 1,000 cases good, it is below the ""signal level"" and lowest since early September. In Romania that might be different. In the Netherlands there have always been quite a high level of cases during the entire pandemic, so this is now considered ""low"" here.

The vaccinations are going quite well, they administered &gt;233,000 doses yesterday and the day before &gt;330,000. The weekly average is now almost 240,000 vaccinations per day. Around 61% of adults at least partially vaccinated and 32% fully vaccinated. And vaccination willingness among the population seems to be 85% to 90%. The vaccination grade among seniors is also very high.

So I honestly do not know why Romania's cases and also test positivity are so low. All the while they have only partially vaccinated 28% of the adults and fully vaccinated 26% of the adults. And vaccinations are hardly growing anymore, as the vaccination rate is very low and trending downwards at around 40,000 vaccinations per day. And deaths are also much higher in Romania. But ICU patients (could not find any data for hospital patients/admissions) are pretty similar. While cases and test positivity are much, much higher in the Netherlands for some reason.

I do not know what the reason for this difference is. 1) could always be that data between countries is incomparable, 2) Romania has much stricter measures for their level of cases and/or 3) people in Romania take it much more seriously. When I went to the supermarket today in the Netherlands well over half of the people did not wear masks and no one really cared, while it is mandatory for public indoor buildings when walking around.

I work 7 days a week with rotating days off, some 16 hour days just to cover minimum staffing. I asked my employer to give me one guaranteed day off per week until I feel a little better and they couldn’t do it. There are literally days at the hospital where I am the only one on shift and have 30ish patients to juggle. Losing me one day a week sends staffing into the flaming red and they cease to function. 

I’m seriously at a loss. We lost a lot of staff after COVID and haven’t been able to recover. We are one or two staff members away from shutting down as a department which makes me feel pressured to stay. We are part of a union and are going to strike soon.

*Numbers are from end of last week (either from Thursday or Friday) so they are slightly lower than the numbers cited in the press release*

49.9% of all adults (18+) have received at least one shot, and 25.2% of all adults are fully vaccinated. In terms of full population (Sweden has 10.40m inhabitants), the percentages are approx. 39.3% for first shots and 19.9% full vaccinations. A total of 6 151 465 doses have been administered, i.e. 59 per 100 pop.

Currently most (new) vaccinations are made with either Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna. AstraZeneca is reserved for 65+ and that age group has pretty much finished vaccinations save for the second doses. J&amp;J is paused indefinitely and will likely never be used. Excess doses are AFAIK being donated to COVAX.

Most of Sweden's 21 regions are currently vaccinating around ages 40+ or 50+, together with 18+ with comorbities and medical staff. The nationwide age distribution is currently

Age | First dose coverage | Full vaccination
---|---|----
18-29 | 10.51% | 4.73%
30-39 | 13.42% | 6.1%
40-49 | 29.02% | 7.64%
50-59 | 65.21% | 11.18%
60-69 | 86.14% | 35.57%
70-79 | 92.3% | 61.13%
80-89 | 93.23% | 85.86%
90+ | 90.63% | 84.19%

The national goal is that all adults should have been offered a first dose by Sep 5. The past 7 days a total of 637 107 doses have been administered, which is an average of 91 015 per day. Adjusted to US population this corresponds to 2.9m doses/day. Most vaccinations recently seem to be 2nd doses rather than 1st doses.

Around 600k doses of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are currently being delivered weekly. A bit more than 16m doses is required to fully vaccinate all adults, i.e. around 10m additional doses are needed for that.

Hospital managers have reported to the city Department of Health urgently implementing quick screening and tracing measure by collecting samples of all medical staff in the hospital, especially those who had contacted the staff of the Information Technology Department.

Until this morning, of 887 people undergoing tests, 53 were positive and 834 were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Simultaneously, the hospital has also collected samples of 88 patients in departments such as tetanus, encephalitis, HIV/AIDS, chronic liver disease. All test results came out negative for SARS-CoV-2.

In prior periodic tests for medical staff who directly treat Covid-19 patients in the hospital, all results were negative.

Most of the 53 positive staff members isolated in the Infectious Department had no symptoms of Covid-19 and received two shots of Covid-19 vaccine.

The entire hospital was locked down from Saturday afternoon for disinfection and contact tracing.

Additionally, the hospital in coordination with the City Center for Disease Control has kept tracing contacts F1 and F2 in localities where medical workers are residing and fumigate all departments and personal items.

Last but not least, the hospital will work with researchers to keep an eye on positive cases who have had two shots of Covid-19 vaccines already to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine.

**51 percent of everybody 18 years or older have now received at least one dose vaccine. More than one fourth [of all adults] are now vaccinates with two doses.**

\- It is with vaccinations and by continuing to follow the recommendations that we will exit the pandemic. The fact that we have vaccinated half adults with at least one dose is a milestone and a reason to rejoice, and we have also come a far way with second doses for fullt protection, says Johan Carlsson, director-general for the Swedish Health Agency.

Since the start [of vaccinations] 26 December 2020, a total of 4.1 million people have received at least one dose vaccine, and of them 2.2 million have also received a second dose. It means that 51 of everybody above 18 years have received one dose and 27 percent have now received a second dose. It is shown by data from the National vaccination registry.

To quickly reach those that are at greatest risk of becoming seriously ill and die, the elderly have been prioritized. Among those who are 65 years or older 91 percent have received at least one dose and 63 percent are fully vaccinated. (Data from 14 June)

The vaccine coverage is lower among people born outside of Sweden, but the latest statistics show that the proportion of vaccinated in that group has increased the last weeks.

\- Having a high vaccine coverage is not enough, it also needs to be evenly distributed to prevent local outbreaks in places with many unvaccinated, says Johan Carlssons, director-general at the Swedish health agency.",,,1623674393,{},h1q3auy,True,t3_nzlub5,False,False,t3_nzlub5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nzlub5/over_half_of_swedens_adult_population_has_now/h1q3auy/,1623943125,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

A little over 50% didn’t experience any side effects at all and remember, they were still 94% protected after receiving the vaccine. So, you don’t need to worry if you don’t have any symptoms after your COVID-19 vaccinations.

These things will be curves of probability that will vary by person.  Antibody tests over a statistically significant portion of the population will help define those curves which will lead to recommendations, etc.


If your already assuming that there is going to be a yearly shot for this, why not start with that yearly shot now?


As for a waste of money - when your creating things in bulk it gets cheaper because of economies of scale.  From a planning point of view creating enough vaccine to fully vaccinate everyone is reasonable.
If everyone is going to get the vaccine every year then investing in the infrastructure to be able to create that much vaccine yearly is a good investment, not a waste of money.


And if that same infrastructure can be used for other mRNA vaccines that are being explored then it is an even better investment.
That is part of the reason that technology transfer to allow countries that have the industrial capacity to make their own vaccines is being done.


Ideally for the next possible pandemic causing virus they can just send everyone the details to create an mRNA vaccine for it.  Then all of these vaccine plants around the world can make doses and deploy them where necessary.  If only there was some sort of health.. committee or organization like thing that could be used to organize response in an area.. or region.. or across the world. /s


Once we get everyone who wants a vaccine their vaccine I am fine with letting the chips fall where they may on the people who want to take their chances.

Yes, they’re rising in US states and counties with low vaccination rates. Additionally, *some communities* with relatively low vax rates aren’t seeing cases “rise,” they just aren’t falling. 

From the article, since you’re hitting a paywall. :)

&gt; States with higher vaccination rates now have markedly fewer coronavirus cases, as infections are dropping in places where most residents have been immunized and are rising in many places people have not, a Washington Post analysis has found.

&gt; States with lower vaccination also have significantly higher hospitalization rates, The Post found. Poorly vaccinated communities have not been reporting catastrophic conditions. Instead, they are usually seeing new infections holding steady or increasing without overwhelming local hospitals.

…

&gt; Vaccination is not always even within each state, and The Post found the connection between vaccine shots and coronavirus cases at the local level comparing more than 100 counties with low vaccination rates (fewer than 20 percent of residents vaccinated) and more than 700 with high vaccination rates (at least 40 percent vaccinated).

&gt; Counties with high vaccination had low coronavirus rates that are going down. In counties where few people are vaccinated, not only are there higher case rates, but the number of cases there is growing.

…

&gt; But experts worry that unvaccinated people are falling into a false sense of security as more transmissible variants can rapidly spread in areas with a high concentration of unvaccinated people who have abandoned masking and social distancing.

…

&gt; An uptick in infections in numerous states offers a preview of summer surges that could take hold “if the unvaccinated continue to behave as though they’re vaccinated,” said Michael Saag, an infectious-disease doctor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

Take the context of the post I was answering to and then re-read my post. But with the context that I an saying that vaccines are not useless. 

Sure, they were never 100%. We all know that. 

I am implying what I said: That B.1.617 and B.1.617.2 have mutated to the point that the vaccines have lost efficacy. Because the Vitus mutated. 

Crazy man beneath my post took what I said that thinks that the vaccine was useless. That is not what I said. What is it is happening is that the virus is mutating to the point the vaccines are losing efficacy. Which is what is happening and expected.

This seems more likely to me. Multiple studies have shown that people who have less serious symptoms are worse at spreading the virus than those who go on to develop severe disease. Young children (under 10 - 12) generally don't develop severe disease. They also have small, weaker lungs (compared to adults) and are closer to the ground.

Now, that said, kids are less likely to get tested, and less likely to get treatment in hospitals despite similar symptoms (can't find that link rn) compared to adults.

Kids do get Covid, and they do get sick, and some have died. However, they're not as important to vaccinate as adults, yet (in my opinion, you are free to disagree, I don't blame you).

 There are about as many over 65s in Africa as in the USA (90 million). This means that the incentive for getting vaccinated may be very low, leading to a lower uptake. If there is 70% uptake among 12+ and none among those younger, then that amounts to less than 50% uptake.

However, since children will probably take smaller vaccine doses, it would be very quick to have them all vaccinated. 

What might eventually happen is for a variant to emerge in countries with a younger population that transmits faster among young people, and then that could spread around the world. Bad news.

&gt;But health experts worry the Alpha variant could be trumped by the Delta variant, which appears to be even more transmissible and may cause more severe illness for those not vaccinated.

&gt;Right now, about 10% of Covid-19 cases in the US can be attributed to the Delta variant. But that proportion is doubling every two weeks, Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said in a CBS interview Sunday.

&gt;He said the Delta variant will probably take over as the dominant strain of coronavirus in the US.

&gt;”I think in parts of the country where you have less vaccination -- particularly in parts of the South, where you have some cities where vaccination rates are low -- there's a risk that you could see outbreaks with this new variant,"" Gottlieb said.

&gt;While 52.4% of Americans have received at least one dose of vaccine, only 43.4% have been fully vaccinated, according to data Sunday from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The problem is even worse for Pfizer - the PLACEBO group had zero deaths. Does that mean that the placebo is 100% effective?

[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-vaccines-compared/618226/](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-vaccines-compared/618226/)

For the AstraZeneca vaccine, one person in the control group had severe COVID-19, but eight people were hospitalized; for Johnson &amp; Johnson, 34 people in the placebo group had severe COVID-19, but only five people were hospitalized. It’s true that zero vaccinated people were hospitalized in either study after the vaccines took effect. But with numbers that small, you can’t draw a reliable conclusion about how high efficacy may be for these outcomes. 

As Diana Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research pointed out about the Johnson &amp; Johnson trial, **“It’s misleading to tell the public that nobody who was vaccinated was hospitalized unless you also tell them that only 5 people in the placebo group were hospitalized.”** She’s right. And you can’t be confident about predicting effectiveness precisely in a wider population outside the trial, either. For example, some of the vaccine trials included relatively few people older than 60 as participants.  
  
You can see how fragile these numbers are by looking at those compiled for severe disease. **In the Pfizer trial, for example, just one vaccinated person developed severe COVID-19 versus three in the placebo group—which meant that a single bout of disease made the difference between a calculated efficacy rate of 66 percent and one of 100 percent.** 

For the Novavax and Oxford-AstraZeneca trials, there were zero people with severe disease in the vaccinated group versus only one in the control group, so adding or subtracting one would have been even more dramatic. **The problem is even greater for deaths. For that efficacy analysis, only two of the vaccine trials—for Moderna’s and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s—reported any COVID-19 deaths at all in the control groups.**",,,1623692580,{},h1r5esl,False,t3_nz002n,False,True,t1_h1r3qgr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nz002n/gottlieb_says_coronavirus_delta_variant_likely_to/h1r5esl/,1623968857,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,tomasNth,,,[],,,,text,t2_v74t3ky,False,False,[],"Many virologists maintain that the coronavirus most likely jumped from an animal to a human in a setting outside a lab. But without direct proof of a natural spillover, more scientists and politicians have called for a full investigation into the lab leak theory.

Proponents of a lab investigation say that researchers at Dr. Shi’s institute could have collected — or contracted — the new coronavirus from the wild, such as in a bat cave. Or the scientists may have created it, by accident or by design. Either way, the virus could then have leaked from the laboratory, perhaps by infecting a worker.

China has sought to influence investigations into the virus’s origin, while promoting its own unproven allegations.

Beijing agreed to allow a team of World Health Organization experts to visit China, but limited their access. When the W.H.O. team said in a report in March that a lab leak was extremely unlikely, its conclusion was seen as hasty. Even the head of the W.H.O., Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: “I do not believe that this assessment was extensive enough.”

Last month, President Biden ordered intelligence agencies to investigate the origin question, including the lab theory. On Sunday, the leaders of the world’s wealthiest large democracies, at the Group of 7 summit, urged China to be part of a new investigation into the origins of the coronavirus. Mr. Biden told reporters that he and other leaders had discussed access to labs in China.

“Transparency matters across the board,” Mr. Biden said.

In less polarized times, Dr. Shi was a symbol of China’s scientific progress,  at the forefront of research into emerging viruses.

She led expeditions into caves to collect samples from bats and guano, to learn how viruses jump from animals to humans. In 2019, she was among 109 scientists elected to the American Academy of Microbiology for her contributions to the field.

A top Chinese virologist’s insistence that the coronavirus didn’t escape her Wuhan lab is difficult to verify.
“She’s a stellar scientist — extremely careful, with a rigorous work ethic,” said Dr. Robert C. Gallo, director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology employs nearly 300 people and is home to one of only two Chinese labs that have been given the highest security designation, Biosafety Level 4. Dr. Shi leads the institute’s work on emerging infectious diseases, and over the years, her group has collected over 10,000 bat samples from around China.

Under China’s centralized approach to scientific research, the institute answers to the Communist Party, which wants scientists to serve national goals. “Science has no borders, but scientists have a motherland,” Xi Jinping, the country’s leader, said in a speech to scientists last year.

Dr. Shi herself, though, does not belong to the Communist Party, according to official Chinese media reports, which is unusual for state employees of her status. She built her career at the institute, starting as a research assistant in 1990 and working her way up the ranks.

Dr. Shi, 57, obtained her Ph.D. from the University of Montpellier in France in 2000 and started studying bats in 2004 after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which killed more than 700 people around the world. In 2011, she made a breakthrough when she found bats in a cave in southwestern China that carried coronaviruses that were similar to the virus that causes SARS.

“In all the work we do, if just once you can prevent the outbreak of an illness, then what we’ve done will be very meaningful,” she told CCTV, China’s state broadcaster, in 2017.

But some of her most notable findings have since drawn the heaviest scrutiny. In recent years, Dr. Shi began experimenting on bat coronaviruses by genetically modifying them to see how they behave.

In 2017, she and her colleagues at the Wuhan lab published a paper about an experiment in which they created new hybrid bat coronaviruses by mixing and matching parts of several existing ones — including at least one that was nearly transmissible to humans — in order to study their ability to infect and replicate in human cells.

Proponents of this type of research say it helps society prepare for future outbreaks. Critics say the risks of creating dangerous new pathogens may outweigh potential benefits.

The picture has been complicated by new questions about whether American government funding that went to Dr. Shi’s work supported controversial gain-of-function research. The Wuhan institute received around $600,000 in grant money from the United States government, through an American nonprofit called EcoHealth Alliance. The National Institutes of Health said it had not approved funding for the nonprofit to conduct gain-of-function research on coronaviruses that would have made them more infectious or lethal.

Dr. Shi, in an emailed response to questions, argued that her experiments differed from gain-of-function work because she did not set out to make a virus more dangerous, but to understand how it might jump across species.

“My lab has never conducted or cooperated in conducting GOF experiments that enhance the virulence of viruses,” she said.

‘Speculation rooted in utter distrust.’

Concerns have centered not only on what experiments Dr. Shi conducted, but also on the conditions under which she did them.

Some of Dr. Shi’s experiments on bat viruses were done in Biosafety Level 2 labs, where security is lower than in other labs at the institute. That has raised questions about whether a dangerous pathogen could have slipped out.

Ralph Baric, a prominent University of North Carolina expert in coronaviruses who signed the open letter in Science, said that although a natural origin of the virus was likely, he supported a review of what level of biosafety precautions were taken in studying bat coronaviruses at the Wuhan institute. Dr. Baric conducted N.I.H.-approved gain-of-function research at his lab at the University of North Carolina using information on viral genetic sequences provided by Dr. Shi.

Dr. Shi said that bat viruses in China could be studied in BSL-2 labs because there was no evidence that they directly infected humans, a view supported by some other scientists.

She also rejected recent reports that three researchers from her institute had sought treatment at a hospital in November 2019 for flulike symptoms, before the first Covid-19 cases were reported.

“The Wuhan Institute of Virology has not come across such cases,” she wrote. “If possible, can you provide the names of the three to help us check?”

As for samples that the lab held, Dr. Shi has maintained that the closest bat virus she had in her lab, which she shared publicly, was only 96 percent identical to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19 — a vast difference by genomic standards. She rejects speculation that her lab had worked on other viruses in secret.

Dr. Shi’s research on a group of miners in Yunnan Province who suffered severe respiratory disease in 2012 has also drawn questions. The miners had worked in the same cave where Dr. Shi’s team later discovered the bat virus that is close to SARS-CoV-2. Dr. Shi said her lab did not detect bat SARS-like coronaviruses in the miners’ samples and that she would publish more details in a scientific journal soon; her critics say she has withheld information.

“This issue is too important not to come forward with everything you have and in a timely and transparent manner,” said Alina Chan, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Broad Institute of M.I.T. and Harvard who also signed the Science letter.

Many scientists and officials say China should share employees’ medical records and the lab’s logs of its experiments and its viral sequence database to evaluate Dr. Shi’s claims.

Dr. Shi said she and the institute had been open with the W.H.O. and with the global scientific community.

“This is no longer a question of science,” she said on the phone. “It is speculation rooted in utter distrust.”

‘I have nothing to fear.’

The pandemic was a moment that Dr. Shi and her team had long braced for. For years, she had warned of the risks of a coronavirus outbreak, building up a stock of knowledge about these pathogens.

In January of last year, as Dr. Shi and her team worked frantically, they were exhausted, but also excited, said Wang Linfa, a virologist at the Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School who was in Wuhan with Dr. Shi at the time.

“All the experiences, reagents and the bat samples in the freezer were finally being used in a significant way globally,” said Dr. Wang, Dr. Shi’s collaborator and friend for 17 years.

Dr. Shi published some of the most important early papers on SARS-CoV-2 and Covid-19, which scientists around the world have relied on.

But soon, the speculation about Dr. Shi and her lab began to swirl. Dr. Shi, who is known among friends for being blunt, was baffled and angry — and sometimes let it show.

In an interview with Science magazine last July, she said that Mr. Trump owed her an apology for claiming the virus came from her lab. On social media, she said people who raised similar questions should “shut your stinky mouths.”

Dr. Shi said what she saw as the politicization of the question had sapped her of any enthusiasm for investigating the origins of the virus. She has instead focused on Covid vaccines and the features of the new virus, and over time, she said, has calmed down.

“How on earth can I offer up evidence for something where there is no evidence?” she said, her voice rising in anger during the brief, unscheduled conversation. “I don’t know how the world has come to this, constantly pouring filth on an innocent scientist,” she wrote in a text message.

In a rare interview over email, she denounced the suspicions as baseless, including the allegations that several of her colleagues may have been ill before the outbreak emerged.

The speculation boils down to one central question: Did Dr. Shi’s lab hold any source of the new coronavirus before the pandemic erupted? Dr. Shi’s answer is an emphatic no.

But China’s refusal to allow an independent investigation into her lab, or to share data on its research, make it difficult to validate Dr. Shi’s claims and has only fueled nagging suspicions about how the pandemic could have taken hold in the same city that hosts an institute known for its work on bat coronaviruses.

Those in favor of the natural origins hypothesis, though, have pointed to Wuhan’s role as a major transportation hub as well as a recent study that showed that just before the pandemic hit, the city’s markets were selling many animal species capable of harboring dangerous pathogens that could jump to humans.

The Chinese government has given no appearance of holding Dr. Shi under suspicion. Despite the international scrutiny, she seems to have been able to continue her research and give lectures in China.

The stakes in this debate extend into how scientists study infectious diseases. Some scientists have cited the lab leak scenario in pushing for greater scrutiny of “gain of function” experiments that, broadly defined, are intended to make pathogens more powerful to better understand their behavior and risks.

Many scientists say they want the hunt for the virus’s origins to transcend politics, borders and individual scientific achievements.

“This has nothing to do with fault or guilt,” said David Relman, a microbiologist at Stanford University and co-author of a recent letter in the journal Science, signed by 18 scientists, that called for a transparent investigation into all viable scenarios, including a lab leak. The letter urged labs and health agencies to open their records to the public.

“It’s just bigger than any one scientist or institute or any one country — anybody anywhere who has data of this sort needs to put it out there,” Dr. Relman said.",,,1623702004,{},h1rq7hc,False,t3_nzv7xe,False,False,t1_h1rpzjf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nzv7xe/a_top_virologist_in_china_at_center_of_a_pandemic/h1rq7hc/,1623983018,16,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The virologist, Shi Zhengli, said in a rare interview that speculation about her lab in Wuhan was baseless. But China’s habitual secrecy makes her claims hard to validate.


To a growing chorus of American politicians and scientists, she is the key to whether the world will ever learn if the virus behind the devastating Covid-19 pandemic escaped from a Chinese lab. To the Chinese government and public, she is a hero of the country’s success in curbing the epidemic and a victim of malicious conspiracy theories.

Shi Zhengli, a top Chinese virologist, is once again at the center of clashing narratives about her research on coronaviruses at a state lab in Wuhan, the city where the pandemic first emerged.

The idea that the virus may have escaped from a lab had long been widely dismissed by scientists as implausible and shunned by others for its connection with former President Donald J. Trump. But fresh scrutiny from the Biden administration and calls for greater candor from prominent scientists have brought the theory back to the fore.

Scientists generally agree that there is still no direct evidence to support the lab leak theory. But more of them now say that the hypothesis was dismissed too hastily, without a thorough investigation, and they point to a range of unsettling questions.

Some scientists say Dr. Shi conducted risky experiments with bat coronaviruses in labs that were not safe enough. Others want clarity on reports, citing American intelligence, suggesting that there were early infections of Covid-19 among several employees of the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

Dr. Shi has denied these accusations, and now finds herself defending the reputation of her lab and, by extension, that of her country.

There are a couple of wrinkles: it's hard-ish to count those ""vaccinated by COVID"" numbers, particularly for places that were hit early before testing was widespread (e.g., New York City, where quite possibly 1.6M people were infected by April 2020).  In the other direction, there are any number of people who thought they caught COVID but actually had a bad cold or something, but don't really have any immunity.  In the US, with plentiful vaccines, a simple rule like ""vaccinate everyone"" would cut around this uncertainty.

The other wrinkle is that ""vaccinated by COVID"" is OK, but not great, in terms of the immunity it seems to provide.  A study of UK healthcare workers late in 2020 showed that the protection they got from having a COVID infection was in the ballpark of a single dose of one of man-made vaccines.  It'll get us by, but we can do better.  People who have documented COVID infections and later receive a dose of one of the mRNA vaccines get very, very good protection.

One more thing is the variants which may be more infectious.  Let's look at Delta.  It's estimated to have an R0 of around 6.  As Delta becomes the dominant strain, the herd immunity guess goes up to 1-1/6, so, say, 85% of the population needs immunity.",,,1623701564,{},h1rp9hj,False,t3_nzm2oo,False,True,t1_h1rjume,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nzm2oo/coronavirus_infections_dropping_where_people_are/h1rp9hj/,1623982378,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I can understand the necessity for some of these laws; and I understand the logic in favor of them.

It also makes it favorable for the elderly to remain in country, keeping the money local by disincentivizing moving to a lower COL area.

Germany is/was also on my “maybe” list; I will have to crunch the numbers when the time comes. Really most EU countries that have a similar standard of living to the US, I would consider an option.

Humans only exist for a certain number of decades, and we don't do a great job passing along our collective ""visceral experiences"" to our next generations.

So in this specific contextual case, as older people who knew the damage wrought by polio and TB pass away, their surviving descendents didn't get direct exposure to those experiences, they start to question why we still get vaccines for that stuff. Combined with new sources of misinformation linking vaccines to autism, or Bill Gates, or fertility, those people grasp onto *those* as a more convincing truth simply because those messages are relatable to various problems that exist *today*, and the diseases those vaccines were meant for, are not around today (because the vaccines work that well).

[],,ScammerTimeBurglar,,,[],,,,text,t2_6nyzeyz6,False,False,[],"There’s no sneaking of anything. Severe cases are required for death. Overall the death rate is 0.5% to covid unvaccinated. To get to that point of limbo of death or not one needs to be severe. 

Since you need this A.B.C. kindergarten style, here you go. 

If you gave 100 people a Pfizer vaccine and they were all exposed with an infectious dose of covid, 91% of them would not become infected. That leaves 9 vaccinated people infected. 

Now have 100 unvaccinated people who were all exposed to an infectious dose of the virus. All infected. 

9 vs 100. 

The trial showed that 9 people in the control, unvaccinated group had severe covid. One person in the vaccinated group did. 

Of the nine people left in the Pfizer group that are infected, they are 9x less likely to develop severe covid, a requirement for death, than if they were unvaccinated. That doesn’t account for any effect having some antibodies from the vaccine. That lowers risk even more, but again we’re not even accounting for that. 

The 50% symptomatic efficacy bar in my opinion is far too high. A lower efficacy vaccine that give an immune system a head start against the virus would still tremendously lower severe cases and death rates. Only in exceedingly rare cases does one die from a reinfection from an initially mild covid case. 

If you’re looking for a conspiracy/scandal, there’s more money in therapeutics than vaccines, as evidenced by Merck abandoning their IAVI collaborated pill vaccine based on the same platform they successfully used on Ebola. The immune response was right up there with natural infection and could have been the easiest to distribute vaccine in the world. Why make vaccines for several dollars per course when you could sell the government a course of therapeutics for $1400 each, and be paid up front?",,,1623704883,{},h1rwfuh,False,t3_nz002n,False,True,t1_h1rkf58,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nz002n/gottlieb_says_coronavirus_delta_variant_likely_to/h1rwfuh/,1623987166,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

So what is a mask? If we float ourselves to a country like Japan believe it or not they wear face masks when they are sick, but need to work. (like little sniffles)
- why do they wear the masks? They wear is because they care about their coworkers and the people around them. In japan their culture revolves us/we not me/i.

So now lets hope into America for instance, mask wearing is a massive culture shock to people. From personal experience alot of reasons i get is variations of “ i will take my chances “
- note the word: i 

Now lets get mask on vs mask off. How does wearing a mask affect your lifestyle? How you work? Health? Talk? Etc?

In reality, there should be minimal differences between mask on and mask off.
Experience;
- i volunteered at a hospital specifically in transporting samples. It is MANDATORY i wear a mask to completely eliminate contamination from my own breath. i can talk to my doctors just fine, janitors, and even patients.

Now
- magically talking is inaudible . extremely difficult to breathe. uncomfortable 

These are essentially the two things i see when it comes to these masks.

Here are things to remember. Your choice is your choice, but it does not override the policies/rules of everything.
- for example, had a customer enter the store with mask on and take off as soon as no employees around. Offered the man a mask SEVEN times. He literally snapped and started attacking our employees complaining about choice, he doesn’t believe etc. Our response is following the rules their store has given them to create a safe environment.
- now lets get a closer look, the man has a choice to wear a mask or not. The employees do not have that choice since they are there to maintain a policy to create health and safety. That man has to wear a madk because this is not a choice. No shirts no shoes no service?  Can you walk into any store naked freedom of choice yes? That is what you should be thinking about when you are entering an area thst is NOT PUBLIC OR YOUR OWN

No need for masks when people are vaccinated. I feel like youre poking fun at the recommendation to wear 2 masks which I honestly dont get. The virus is airborne. Its a very simple concept that 2 barriers will prevent less particles getting through than 1. Masks and social distancing is *harm reduction*, you cant eliminate the issue completely but you can take different steps to eliminate it as much as possible.

If you’re making the claim asymptomatic cases leads to death, that sounds reasonable if you completely ignore how the disease progression works. It simply isn’t the case. 

If one is 91% protected from any symptoms of the disease and we know that about 0.5% of unvaccinated Americans die from being infected by the virus regardless of symptoms(600k/115m est. infections), 0.5% of 9% is closer to 0% than it is 1%, and is the at-worst value.

&gt; Over all simulation replications, the median cumulative mortality per 100 000 for standard dosing versus delayed second dose was 226 v 179, 233 v 207, and 235 v 236 for 90%, 80%, and 70% first dose efficacy, respectively. **The delayed second dose strategy was optimal for vaccine efficacies at or above 80%**

&gt;Thank you toontje for your analysis. This week has been truly fantastic when it comes to vaccinations in the Netherlands.

This might be our peak week. Vaccinations trends tend to follow deliveries. It will probably stay around the current rate or a bit lower the coming weeks. All mRNA vaccines will be used (1 - 1.15 million per week). All Janssen vaccines will be used as well voluntarily (assume there will be enough demand, as a lot of people want to be fully vaccinated ASAP). And then quite a few second doses AstraZeneca, which means there will still be quite a bit of AZ vaccinations the coming weeks.

It will be a great summer, hopefully the delta variant will not create massive problems here and stays at a low level a bit longer. And let's hope we will be well prepared for a new COVID-19 winter season with a very high vaccination grade and that decisive and quick actions will be taken if needed to curb new waves (probably won't happen, haha, but one can hope).",,,1623626335,{},h1o9dew,True,t3_nz7k36,False,True,t1_h1o6ygp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nz7k36/netherlands_coronavirus_infection_average_nears/h1o9dew/,1623903961,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;	There were also discrepancies between unvaccinated respondents who said they would “definitely not” get the vaccine and those who just plan to “wait and see”: The “definitely not” group is overwhelmingly more white (70% of respondents), Republican (67%) and concentrated in the 30-49 age group (48%).

Compare states all you like but they are all the same half-measures that extended restrictions and needlessly lost lives. I watched as people enjoyed normalcy, in some cases 8 straight months of no local transmission, because the people and their Government did the hard work to eliminate local transmission and establish quarantine for all those entering the country. No excuses when we have far greater resources at our disposal too.

Civil liberties and the economy were all excuses against firm measures like lockdowns yet in hindsight, they would have been a small price to pay because of long term dividends.

From The Lancet in April:

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00978-8/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00978-8/fulltext)

&gt;Evidence suggests that countries that opt for rapid action to eliminate SARS-CoV-2—with the strong support of their inhabitants—also better protect their economies and minimise restrictions on civil liberties compared with those that strive for mitigation. Looking ahead, mass COVID-19 vaccination is key to returning to usual life, but relying solely on COVID-19 vaccines to control the pandemic is risky due to their uneven roll-out and uptake, time-limited immunity, and the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. History shows that vaccination alone can neither single-handedly nor rapidly control a virus and that a combination of public health measures are needed for containment.

&amp;#x200B;

This is from [a thread](https://twitter.com/dgurdasani1/status/1403293582279294983) by an epidemiologist I follow from the UK which is starting to see a wave of new cases due to Delta quickly growing to dominance.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We need to remember evolution of the virus isn't likely to end here. This to me is one of the biggest dangers of letting transmission continue at high levels. Even if this doesn't result in the same level of deaths as before, it will result in more long COVID &amp; virus mutation.  
&gt;  
&gt;And allowing virus mutations to continue at high rates as the virus replicates, alongside vaccination is a recipe for disaster - as this is the most favourable condition for selection towards escape. It isn't enough to surveil virus adaptation- we \*must\* prevent it.  
&gt;  
&gt;There's no doubt delta will change the shape of the pandemic in the UK, and possibly across the globe, given it's level of fitness. It was really negligent of the govt to allow this into the country, &amp; then do very little to prevent spread.

According to the report, since the start of February to 7 June, there were 33,206 Delta cases in England: while 19,573 were in unvaccinated individuals, 1,785 were among fully vaccinated people and 7,559 were among those who had received one jab, with the vaccination status of the remainder unclear.
In total, 383 people in England were admitted to hospital with the Delta variant over that period – 223 of whom tested positive for Covid before turning up at A&amp;E – with 42 having had two doses of the jab, 86 having one dose and 251 unvaccinated.
Of the 42 deaths recorded in England within 28 days of a positive test involving the Delta variant, 23 were in unvaccinated people, with 12 among those who were fully vaccinated and seven among people who had had one dose.”

Basically, the efficacy rates hold up with studies (about 88-90%)in completely  avoiding delta-covid. 

Also, 12 deaths is way too low of a sample size to draw conclusions on vaccines effectiveness against death vs the delta variant. This is why clinical studies are a much better source as they are more controlled for other factors (ie what were the ages,  comorbidities among the 12
vaccinated deaths)?

I'm not sure from your post, but it sounds like you are saying in the past you have had a positive COVID-19 test?

It's still recommended that you get vaccinated, because evidence indicates that the vaccine helps ensure you have long lasting, durable protection from getting very sick from COVID-19 in the future, whether you have had a COVID-19 positive test in the past.

I am glad that you were not severely ill in the past!  However, some people do get severely ill from COVID-19, such as being so sick they have to go the the hospital, or even considering troublesome milder side effects such as altered taste or smell, or not being able to perform at peak physical performance. For example, Boston Celtics player Jayson Tatum is 23 years old, a professional NBA player so he's physically at the top of his game and very young.

More than just breathing issues.  

Currently 10% of cases in the US are B.1.617.2 (Delta).  Doubling every two weeks.  Meanwhile places like Alabama and Mississippi are sub 50% even on one dose of the vaccine.  Overall the US vaccination rates for people over the age of 12 is right about 50%.  The math is pretty easy.  If 50% of the population is now vaccinated, but the new variant is 40% more infective (estimates vary--R0 between 5-8, as compared to the OG strain at 2.4-2.6)) and hospitalizations are increased, we could easily be right back where we were.

I was aware of the large sum of cash requirement, mentally I figured half a mill banked plus whatever the house cost, so probably 1-1.25m total.

It’s the first time hearing about the private health insurance requirement, though. This could well end up being a deal breaker; as the *entire* reason I’d consider moving overseas would be to offset the cost of healthcare. Maybe private healthcare is cheaper in EU countries that otherwise have subsidized healthcare.

I know you haven’t made any accusation; but I’ll state it anyway. I have no intentions of being a burden on anyone in my retirement. Moving to a country such as Ireland (mostly because that’s where I’d feel most “at home”), in my mind would be mutually beneficial, and that I’d have an overall net positive impact by paying ongoing property taxes, spending locally for ongoing needs (food, clothing, assorted other) and the taxes associated thereof. I reckoned that the true expense of +1 person to their health care system (facilities already built, doctors trained, medicine produced at mass scale) would be smaller than what I would contribute to other services that I would not be a drain on such as schools, unemployment, etc. 

In the end it would come down to a math equation on whether it’s financially beneficial; and that’s the only criteria I would use.

It’s up the local populace/their elected officials on whether injecting 1-2m that otherwise wouldn’t be there into the local economy would be of greater benefit than the +1 on the healthcare roster for ~20 years.

No, the UK trial saw only 6 cases in the vaccine group. But that's what happens with the most effective vaccines, there just aren't a lot of cases among the vaccinated.

But as others have mentioned, none of these trials were big enough or long enough to determine efficacy against severe outcomes with any degree of certainty, so you always have to take the 100% figure with a massive grain of salt. Pfizer's interim readout in November, which was the basis for their EUA, only had 8 cases in the vaccine group and technically only showed 66.7% efficacy against severe disease (1 in the vaccine group vs 3 in the placebo). But the numbers for severe disease were so small that they were almost meaningless; 1 case was the difference between 66.7% and 100%.

The vaccines are still exceptionally effective (likely in the high 90s) at preventing severe outcomes, but they were never going to be 100% and it was pretty unfortunate that the ""100% effective against hospitalizations and death"" got parroted around so much based on trial data that was never designed to make any real conclusions about that.",,,1623686720,{},h1qs50j,False,t3_nzjeyi,False,False,t1_h1q5c6j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nzjeyi/novavax_covid_vaccine_highly_effective_in_us/h1qs50j/,1623959741,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

And given the lack of availability, it's the wrong strategy for something like the Delta variant.

Ok, lets do some more math to illustrate this:

Lets say that without any vaccination, 100 people would have gotten symptomatic COVID.

* 1 dose at 33% efficacy: instead of 100 people getting it, only 67 people get it.  (67% times 100)
* 2 doses at 90% efficacy but half the people vaccinated: instead of 100 people getting it, only 55 people get it. (10% X 50 +50)
* In other words, the two doses for half the people results in a lot fewer cases compared to one dose for twice the people.

And then on top of that, the two doses would be more concentrated in the most vulnerable groups, so the reductions in severe cases would be even more dramatically in favor of two doses than just the cases numbers would suggest.

Senior ministers have signed off on the decision to delay the lifting of all legal restrictions on social contact.  
&gt;  
&gt;That could mean capacity limits for sports, pubs and cinemas will remain, and nightclubs would stay closed. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to confirm the delay at a news conference later - at 18:00 BST. The extension will be put to a Commons vote this month and could trigger a sizeable Conservative backbench rebellion. England was due to move to stage four of the government's roadmap out of lockdown on 21 June, when venues and events would be allowed to operate without capacity limits and the cap on guests at weddings would be lifted.  
&gt;

The market had an outbreak, infecting the wife who went to the market there. She was fully vaccinated and lived far away, so she was not contact traced. She infected her husband, who was an IT staff in the hospital. He was also fully vaccinated. In the hospital, he infected 53 other colleagues, all of them have been vaccinated. 1 of the 53 infected his wife, who was the microbiology staff of another hospital and also fully vaccinated. The wife then infected her 3 colleagues and a guard of the hospital, all 4 have been vaccinated. It's currently unknown if the guard and hospital staffs have infected any unvaccinated patients, but they have certainly infected other fully vaccinated people.

For countries that pursue mitigation through vaccination like the US, the silent spread is considered a non-issue by the American government and populace, but Vietnam follows a Zero Covid strategy, and a silent spread in a dangerous setting like in hospitals among a largely unvaccinated population (meaning that the ill and unvaccinated patients are likely going to get very sick and die) is an unacceptable scenario to be stomped out immediately. Frankly put, that kind of silent spread only encourages the virus to mutate into something vaccine-resistent due to the massive selective pressure of all these vaccinated but still infected people. On an individual scale, sure, you're vaccinated and you basically get a get out of jail free card unless you're really unlucky. However, on a society-wide scale, allowing silent spread among the vaccinated people on a grand scale of billions of people are almost definitely going to kill a lot of people without access to vaccines or unable to get vaccinated, and the first people to die will be will be the unvaccinated patients, family members, and neighbors of the people who got vaccinated.",,,1623691547,{},h1r32g9,True,t3_nzlv7k,False,True,t1_h1r2tky,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nzlv7k/vietnam_53_health_care_workers_in_hcmc_infected/h1r32g9/,1623967257,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

New-ish.    Not seen in clinical trials, but they surfaced in Israel and CDC has been warning doctors to be on the lookout for cases of myocarditis after mRNA vaccination since at least June 1st and it's on the agenda of the CDC ACIP meeting this week.   

Clinical trials prior to the EUA for adults had on the order of 20,000 participants which is both a huge trial and also too small to capture rare but serious side effects that would only be expected to affect fewer than a couple participants in the trial.   Trials on adolescents were smaller.

Instead, there is ongoing review of serious events that occur after vaccination.   What to do when these are detected is a hard question and you should expect to see strong opinions voiced on what to do next.

The government believes it will achieve this by reducing the gap between doses from 12 weeks to eight for people over the age of 40. Everyone over the age of 40 who had a dose in mid-May will be offered a second by July 19, while all over 18s will have been offered their first shot by that date.

From the CDC: [Based on how these vaccines work in the body, experts believe they are unlikely to pose a risk for people who are pregnant. However, there are currently limited data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people.

Clinical trials that study the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and how well they work in pregnant people are underway or planned. Vaccine manufacturers are also collecting and reviewing data from people in the completed clinical trials who received vaccine and became pregnant.

Studies in animals receiving a Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, or J&amp;J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine before or during pregnancy found no safety concerns in pregnant animals or their babies.

CDC and the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) have safety monitoring systems in place to gather information about COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and will closely monitor that information. Early dataexternal icon from these systems are preliminary, but reassuring. These data did not identify any safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated or for their babies. Most of the pregnancies reported in these systems are ongoing, so more follow-up data are needed for people vaccinated just before or early in pregnancy. We will continue to follow people vaccinated during all trimesters of pregnancy to understand effects on pregnancy and babies.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html).

For example, my very conservative estimate is that Germany will be able to fully vaccinate 70% of all adults by the end of July. But I reach that number only by calculating that we will have been giving X million jabs by that time and then divide X by 2, so I get to X/2 million people fully vaccinated. But politicians cannot entirely influence how many first doses will be given and how man second doses, so the real numbers for the end of July might be: 63% fully vaccinated, 77% with at least one dose. 

But the fact is that most governments assume that only about 70% of all adults will actually take the jab within the near future, with the remaining 30% being hesitant, or unavailable, or facing medical obstacles. (Those figures will, of course, vary from country to country.) Based on that assumption, by the time you get to 70% there will be no big gap between fully vaccinated people and people who only have received the first jab. So it will look less like the 63%/77% in my hypothetical example, but more like 67%/73%.

I think however that the degree of measures was no longer sustainable because everyone flouted them. Several points during the second half of 2020 were at fault:

- june 2020: government's reaction after dropping restrictions for July 1st: *have a nice holiday!*

- august 2020, Grapperhaus' marriage, rules flouted by justice minister who always was hardline about 'those who flout measures'. 

- september 2020: line kept going up and up but nobody took action. And when cities piloted mask requirements everyone found it 'ridiculous'

- november 2020: when numbers dropped during a semi-lockdown tougher restrictions were implemented making people much less motivated and further adding fuel to the fire of anti-lockdown-protestors

These are just a few of many mishaps, which now are only repaired thanks to vaccinations of which I believe the GGD's do excellent work, even if I started out skeptical when there were rumors of German military use when it seemed we 'didn't have a plan'.

You're right, if the option was JJ/AZ or covid, then getting JJ/AZ would be a no-brainer.

However, if choosing not to get JJ/AZ means you get Pfizer/Moderna two weeks later, with a very low case count in the country, the risk/reward ratio shifts to be primarily on the risk side, and it's recommended to wait for Pfizer/Moderna instead (our Health Authority found that we would have more deaths from side effects than we would prevent from covid if we used JJ/AZ).

*However*, that is not necessarily true everywhere, as it depends on your access to other vaccines, the infection rate in your area, and so on. It also, somewhat, depends on your personal risk profile, which is why you can get JJ (or AZ but I haven't heard of anyone who's opted for AZ over JJ in the voluntary program) after consultation with a doctor, although whether they allow you to get one seems completely random at the moment.",,,1623703836,{},h1ru6d3,False,t3_nzm2oo,False,False,t1_h1qmeid,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nzm2oo/coronavirus_infections_dropping_where_people_are/h1ru6d3/,1623985660,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

One thing that I have learned when looking at modern conservatism - is that whatever it is that they are rampantly accusing people of is a form of projection. You see it all the time. Anti-homosexual pastor outed as gay, anti-corruption state senator taking bribes, etc. etc.

Conservatism is, overwhelmingly, ruled by fear, and that fear overrides any and all rationality. And they mock liberals constantly because they see liberalism as a direct attack on how they live, and they are deathly afraid.

And the truth is this: their way of life is dying. Slowly, but surely, it's dying. And they're afraid.

What are they afraid of? Well - let's take a look at our old pal, projection.

Ever notice how vehemently against helping marginalized populations your sort of white working class voters are? The reality of the situation is they are incredibly, uncomfortably close to where these marginalized populations are. Poorly educated. Low earnings. What they're scared of is becoming the bottom-rung of society - and are immensely proud of being (in their eyes) not the bottom rung of society.

That's why they're against things like increasing the minimum wage. If you make $13.50 an hour working at a Home Depot, you don't think of an increased minimum wage to $15 as a rising tide lifts all boats. Instead, you look at it as all the sudden the people on a lower rung of society than you are now on the same level as you. All the sudden -you're- the bottom rung of society - even with these people that you see yourself as better than.

And that scares the hell out of them. Because they think they're better than that, and in their mind, the difference would be the government artificially propping up the guy flipping burgers - where you clearly are better and more valuable than them, now all the sudden the government has propped them up in an attempt to ""marginalize"" you.

That's what they fear, marginalization. Being the bottom rung of society - and guys like Trump and the modern American party play them like a fiddle. They would rather be clearly better off than someone that they view as beneath them, than both you and they be significantly better off than they are now.

That's the most important thing - being able to compare themselves to people and go ""yeah, I'm better than them"" and feeling as if that being better than them is something intrinsic and based on your own individual ability.",,,1623703517,{},h1rthqn,False,t3_nzm2oo,False,False,t1_h1r5vlf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nzm2oo/coronavirus_infections_dropping_where_people_are/h1rthqn/,1623985193,48,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, it's really unclear. There's a lot of people who think that this virus has mutated rapidly over a short period of time and reached what we would call new-fitness level. But it's not going to continue to mutate at this rate. It's mutating about at the rate of influenza B right now. So it's mutating as quickly as influenza B. Remember, this virus has to thread a very careful needle. It's trying to change the spike protein, which is a protein on its surface that we develop our antibodies against in a way that our antibodies no longer recognize that protein. But that spike protein is also what the virus uses to attach to the lining of our respiratory tract. So it can't change it too much or else it no longer can latch onto our cells- cells. So it's trying to thread a very careful needle. It may be that the rate of mutation of this virus starts to slow down. The good news is that so far, none of these variants that we've seen defeat the vaccine. Some of them- for some of them, the vaccines are a little less effective. But the vaccines have maintained their effectiveness against all of these variants, including .617.

According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html), 5208 people (170 per 100,000 doses) have died after receiving the COVID vaccine, measured over a 6 month wide window from Dec 2020 to June 2021. However, the US [annual mortality rate](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm) in 2019 was 870 per 100,000 people, meaning that in a given 6 month long window we expect 435 per 100,000 people to die of random causes. The vaccine distribution ramped up over this period, but if we assume vaccination rates were uniform then we would expect the average person was vaccinated for 3 months of the CDC survey period, so we should expect 217 deaths per 100,000 vaccinated people due to things unrelated to the vaccine. This number is similar to the actual deaths, 170 per 100,000, suggesting that nearly all of these reported “vaccine deaths” are unrelated the vaccine.
