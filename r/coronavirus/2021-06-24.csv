I'm confused by your point here. This approach to efficacy measurements is standard best practice because you can only reliably measure efficacy against a controlled data set. 

You could take a group of 100 people, give them the vaccine, measure for three months, then come out and declare that because 98 of them did not get COVID your vaccine is 98% effective. But that would be a claim without proof, because in order to say such a thing you need to know how many of those people would have gotten the disease if you had not given them the vaccine. 

The majority of the control group in the study did not contract COVID either. Efficacy is a measure of the delta between your base/naive chance of infection and your chance after vaccination.

I was a direct contact with my brother (before he was confirmed), with my Mom (before she was confirmed on a separate occasion) and with my wife which we basically shared everything before she got the covid test back (as i was certain i would get it too as we attended the same dinner). 

On all 3 occassions (that i know of) i never had a RT-PCR test and antibody tests were negative (the tests were made about 1 month after). 

I know that all of this is anecdotal and stuff, but back in February 2020 before the first case was confirmed in my country  I had a sore throat and coughed for about 2 weeks and had some chills in the last 2 days of that period (nothing to worry about at the time from my perspective as it could be anything). Now, when my brother was first confirmed about 6 months have passed and i felt pretty much the same but only for a couple of days. When my mom had it, i felt the same. Same when my wife had it. Here's the kicker, i felt the same after i got the first dose of the vaccine. 

So here's the question. Is this all related? Did I had it in February 2020 and that helped me not getting infected during the whole period?",,,1624639881,{},h30hrnd,False,t3_o7mbcx,False,False,t3_o7mbcx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o7mbcx/undiagnosed_sarscov2_seropositivity_during_the/h30hrnd/,1624922319,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There are generational differences, different trims, different colors and many different variations but in its essence it's a pickup truck with an identifiable shape. The mRNA vaccine has the description of the ""outer silhouette and shape information"" of the said pickup truck and it will inform the immune system (let's call them the ""Parking Enforcement Officers""). If a vehicle, matching the description of the F150 approaches the gate (ACE2) of a cell, PEO's are gonna tow that vehicle to the best of their abilities. It doesn't matter what's under the hood. It might be a modified F150 or an electric one. The safety of the cell after the vaccine depends on the difference and capabilities of the PEO's of each city (as in each person).

On the specific of another spike binding to the receptor, a Jeep Gladiator may easily get through that gate or it may not even be able to climb the curb leading to the gate, it's pure speculation after this point. When you are a car person, you can immediately tell the difference with looking at the shape. Current mRNA vaccines are teaching the immune system the ""accurate description of F150"".

&amp;#x200B;

It's logical to assume Sars-Cov-2 is and will not be the only virus that has the ""spikes"" which can cling to ACE2 or other receptors on a cell but that virus is our only target with the current mRNA vaccines against coronavirus since this is the one making us sick at the moment.

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

&amp;#x200B;

**Who‚Äôs involved in the ERP and how it will be run**  
The programme is overseen by an industry-led steering group co-chaired by Sir Nicholas Hytner and David Ross and working closely with national and local public health authorities. **The board will consider the evidence from the pilot events and make recommendations to the Prime Minister and the Secretaries of State for DCMS, BEIS and DHSC on how restrictions could be safely lifted.**  
A Joint Programme Board will work across government to inform policy development on reopening sectors ahead of Step 4 of the roadmap.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pilot events**  
**The ERP‚Äôs first phase of pilots includes:**  
FA Cup Semi Final, Wembley Stadium  
World Snooker Championship, Sheffield Crucible Theatre  
Luna Cinema, Liverpool  
League Cup Final  
ACC Business Event, Liverpool  
Circus Nightclub, Liverpool  
FA Cup Final, Wembley Stadium  
The BRIT Awards, London  
Outdoor gig, Sefton Park Liverpool  
Government has selected events based on settings that cover a range of criteria, including different audience capacities, outdoor and indoor venues and different layouts.  
We will test some settings and layouts more than once (eg, Wembley) thereby increasing the sample size. Pilot findings will be scalable and transferable across different sectors, maximising the output from a small number of studies.  
All events will be subject to national and local approvals. Further events may be announced in due course.",,,1624648627,{},h310vth,False,t3_o7s5hw,False,True,t1_h30pb97,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o7s5hw/just_28_covid_cases_found_among_58000_people_at/h310vth/,1624932669,1,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Yes, I did listen them. Dr Ugur Sahin from Biontech said, normally vaccines are produced between 7 to 10 years and we produced this vaccine in 15 months, so long-term effects are still unknown.

Thank you for telling me to listen doctors, that's exactly what I did. And guess what? Fauci e-mails are saying that too. Should I believe to ""h294824bd"" on reddit or Fauci?

&gt; there is no world wide conspiracy orchestrated by the pharmaceutical industry and the entire scientific community of literally every country.

Well, American Court system disagrees with you. You should watch ""The Pharmacist"" documentary on Netflix and see how doctors got sentenced 40 years in jail. Lmaoooo. It's not conspiracy, they're in jail. You might wanna visit those so-called doctors behind bars.

We never had lockdown in Florida and partied up. By the way, I never wore a mask too. Guess what? Locked-down California had more death from covid average per person than Florida.

I guess those masks and lock-down didn't really work well for Cali.

Never wore a mask, never stayed home, never got vaccine. I'm still alive, bro. No worries.

We're more likely to die from American racist cop shooting us than dying from covid which has %0,3 probability anyway. What should we do to stop those cops since, bullet from American cops are way more likely to kill us than covid.

The original comment was stating that Norway has been slower to vaccinate than the US because the EU is sending its doses to other countries. However; EU vaccine exports are irrelevant because the EU has no control over the doses Norway receives, which are separate from the doses the EU receives, even if the orders are placed together. 

Additionally, Norway is not bound to only buy through the EU joint procurement program. They have bought other doses through Covax, separate from the joint procurement program with the EU, and sent them to less developed countries. When that happened, it was expressly made clear that Norway could claim those doses if it chose to, but instead was choosing not to.

The biggest reason for the slow rollout to date is that Norway ‚Äî like much of Europe ‚Äî planned to use AstraZeneca as its primary vaccine.

So in my city many businesses are putting up signs saying if you are fully vaxxed then you do not need to wear a mask inside. Which is all fine and dandy to ke except that's trusting people on their word since no place is going to ask for your vaccination card or anything, and I dont think I would fully support that anyway... not sure why it just seems like a slippery slope that I dont fully understand.

My point being though that now in many businesses the optics are that if you are wearing a mask then you are not vaccinated yet, but here is the deal with me. I am epileptic who also a few years ago had to go through chemo as well. So I've been told that even though it's been years that chemo does heavy damage to your immune system and takes many years to recover from. I'm not sure about that but I know my epileptic seizures fuck with all of my body, and my seizure meds have caused my immune system to absolutley tank since I started taking them like 3 years ago. After I started my meds I have never been more sick more reguarly in my life (33 years old). But this last year was very different for me, because I have not been sick from any contagion all year, and its fucking amazing! It's all the masks and I know it, hell I wasnt even that good at washing my hands reguarly because I'm a forgetful idiot thanks to my seizures and meds (like real major memory problems) but I always wore my mask.

So now in the SoCal city I live in it's basically vaxxed everyone, except crazy republicans, and people who cant get vaxxed. Then you have people like me who wearing the mask has a definite improvement in their medical life... but now I look like every other idiot in the store who refuses to get vaccinated.

It doesnt really affect my life and it doesnt bother me to much. It just sucks that me taking extra precautions because if my medical needs is now causing me to look like... I'll be nice and just say, makes me look like a giant fucking moron who is part of the 5g gang.

I really hope that this overall eventually normalizes wearing masks. I'm very quickly in some places already losing that wonderful 6 feet that I got between me and everyone else in line. My socially awkward self really loved not having to be close to people in public. Now I have to stand in front of my scooter (epileptics not allowed to have a drivers license, so its E-Scooters all the time for me) when in line to keep people from breathing down my neck, and even then I still get people asking me ""do you mind?""

With a global pandemic, the continued spread of the virus in other countries poses a significant threat to everyone. It not only acts as a reservoir for the virus; it gives it the opportunity to mutate and become more virulent.

We, in developed countries, possess the infrastructure to transport and store mRNA-based vaccines. Even facilities in rural areas, which lack ultra-cold storage capabilities, are able to keep mRNA vaccines for some time due to the updated storage guidelines. In the US, we have also had an abundant supply of vaccines. Quite simply, the issue is now demand. 

Supply has not been plentiful in many other developed countries, and most developing nations lack the infrastructure for cold storage and quick distribution. It, then, makes sense from both a global pandemic perspective, as well as from a foreign policy perspective, to export excess resources when they are not necessary.

Another possible factor to consider is the uncertainty present in whether booster shots are necessary in the future. If it becomes apparent that they are necessary, it may very well be more efficient from a logistical perspective to only have - at most - 3 types of vaccine boosters available in the country.

Post-polio syndrome (PPS, poliomyelitis sequelae) is a group of latent symptoms of poliomyelitis (polio), occurring at about a 25‚Äì40% rate (latest data greater than 80%). These symptoms are caused by the damaging effects of the viral infection on the nervous system. Symptoms typically occur 15 to 30 years after an initial acute paralytic attack.

[**Shingles**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingles)

Shingles, also known as zoster or herpes zoster, is a viral disease characterized by a painful skin rash with blisters in a localized area. Typically the rash occurs in a single, wide stripe either on the left or right side of the body or face. Two to four days before the rash occurs there may be tingling or local pain in the area.

Because Bubba isn't getting vaccinated now or in the next 10 years, unless you think we should tie Bubba down and force the shot into his arm.  I don't.

That would basically be those who are 18 and under if you live in the US.  People in that age range (unless immunocompromised) are not in danger from covid even when not vaccinated, the data is quite clear on that.

Not 70% or 80% but 100% in the population will inevitably‚ÄîI would say in a window that runs from now to in another year and a half‚Äîbecome immune. And that will be either through vaccination or through natural infection.

&gt;    ‚ÄúBecause this virus will become endemic. It‚Äôs not going to go away. And whomever now, for example, actively decides against getting vaccinated, will inevitably get infected. There‚Äôs nothing you can do about it.

&gt;    ‚ÄúThis is because the measures will at some point be reduced more and more‚Äîfortunately‚Äîand then the virus will circulate in the population. It will circulate in the throats of people who are vaccinated, who don‚Äôt even realize that they carry the virus. It will circulate naturally in the throats of children under twelve who, of course, cannot yet be vaccinated.

&gt;    ‚ÄúThe virus will spread unrecognized under a blanket of immune protection and then it will always hit people who are not immunized by vaccination, who are fully susceptible and for whom the current risk profiles apply.

&gt;    ‚ÄúThere it goes again by age and underlying illness and who becomes infected then naturally, also, if he has a high risk, will possibly land in the intensive care unit. So we will have people in the ICU next winter as well who have severe COVID-19 symptoms.

&gt;    ‚ÄúAnd that gap, that 30%‚Äìif we think about 70%; that 20%, if we think about 80% vaccination rate‚Äìthat 20% that‚Äôs left, they‚Äôre going to get infected. And the question is, of course, they will still get the opportunity, of course, after the summer and in the fall, to reconsider that and to say don‚Äôt I want to get vaccinated instead of getting infected naturally? And they can still take that opportunity then.

&gt;    ‚ÄúBut if they don‚Äôt get vaccinated, of course they‚Äôre going to get infected. Now this has nothing to do with political debates or mandatory vaccination or any kind of even ethical debate. That is a free decision, which one also makes in the end. Only I believe those actively against the vaccination decide, which must know that they decide thereby also actively for the naturally infection‚Äîwithout any judgment.‚Äù

Do I believe to you or should I believe to Dr. Ugur Sahin who found covid19 vaccine first from biontech? Long-term effects are unknown since world was under lockdown. They didn't have the enough time to produce and test the vaccine like any other diseases.

Generally, vaccines are produced between 7 to 10 years. Covid vaccine was produced under 1,5 years. That's the exact reason, why we don't know the long-term effects.

&gt; you may survive, but you can still be maimed and still pass it on to others who will die

Yes, we saw that when they compared Florida vs California, death per person mortality. We never locked down and Cali did but yet, Cali had more death per person than Florida.

Forget about covid. If I have a chance of dying from any disease with %0,03. I aint get none of those vaccines. We're more likely to die from American cop shooting us than covid anyhow. I didn't see any Americans doing anything to stop that for 250 years.

If that‚Äôs the case and if models show the potential for that effect on hospitals to happen with a certain percentage of a population still unvaccinated and certain variants in circulation then it seems reasonable to impose health measures that will mitigate viral spread.

I don‚Äôt think anyone is arguing for societal lockdown until 100% vaccination is achieved. Requiring mask wearing in some contexts and banning very large gatherings is not a lockdown.

We‚Äôre hopefully going to have good data on this soon from the UK which has a relatively high vax rate and where Delta is now predominant and where the most restrictive health measures have already been lifted. So far it seems like cases and hospitalizations have been largely uncoupled by their vax rates even with Delta circulating. If that remains true as they pass through their impending peak of cases from Delta then it seems like there is little chance of returning to ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù style health measures as long as vax rates are high enough.

[],,Thermodynamicist,,,[],,,,text,t2_5a0m6,False,False,[],"&gt; The general consensus seems to be if you haven‚Äôt been vaccinated at this point that‚Äôs your problem. 

It's everybody's problem. 

If you are doubly vaccinated and optimistic, you might have perhaps 90% protection. 

But let's pretend that you have 99% protection. The case fatality rate is about 0.1%. But let's say that it's 0.01%.

So with these factors you have 1% of 0.01%, which is 10^-6 . 

Let's put that in perspective for a moment. I work in the aircraft industry, and my safety standard for civil applications is 10^-9 catastrophic failures per flying hour.

So if we were 100 times safer than reality, COVID-19 exposure risk is still about 1,000 times the risk considered acceptable when designing an airliner, and yet it's still socially acceptable to be afraid of flying. 

The real risk is about 10^-4 , which is significantly higher than the risk of flying in a fast jet, and IIRC aligns with the design risk for space launch. 

Whilst the protection offered to individuals by vaccination is nice, the objective of the exercise is to vaccinate enough people to generate herd immunity, which prevents outbreaks from growing. 

If Rt &lt; 1 then most people will never be exposed to risk in the first place and the protection offered by mass vaccination therefore far exceeds that offered to an individual.

&gt;It‚Äôs been a problem since near the beginning of the pandemic, but Kasper S√∏gaard of the Global Maritime Forum said the situation has worsened recently, largely due to new travel restrictions countries have imposed in response the [delta variant](https://apnews.com/article/sydney-coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-fcd9357e250e5b127db23cd02a45bfe5) of the coronavirus, which was first identified in India.  
     
&gt;More than [80% of world trade](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-ap-top-news-international-news-global-trade-collateral-damage-1f598b7675fb004586ebe713b29f8eac) is transported by sea, meaning seafarers play a critical role in global commerce. The International Chamber of Shipping estimates that 200,000 are affected by travel restrictions, either stuck at sea or unable to leave home to get to their ships.  
       
&gt;Some have been stranded for as long as 20 months, which contravenes the International Labor Organization‚Äôs Maritime Labour Convention, which allows a maximum of 11 months.  
        
&gt;About 900,000 crew members are from countries that aren‚Äôt producing vaccines, meaning their movements may be further limited if they can‚Äôt get vaccinated.

That‚Äôs a political choice, not a fact based one. 

The CDC says it‚Äôs safe.

‚ÄúCOVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated in tens of thousands of participants in clinical trials. The vaccines met the Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs (FDA) rigorous scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization (EUA).

‚ÄúLong-term side effects are unlikely
Serious side effects that could cause a long-term health problem are extremely unlikely following any vaccination, including COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccine monitoring has historically shown that side effects generally happen within six weeks of receiving a vaccine dose. For this reason, the FDA required each of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines to be studied for at least two months (eight weeks) after the final dose. Millions of people have received COVID-19 vaccines, and no long-term side effects have been detected.

CDC continues to closely monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. If scientists find a connection between a safety issue and a vaccine, FDA and the vaccine manufacturer will work toward an appropriate solution to address the specific safety concern (for example, a problem with a specific lot, a manufacturing issue, or the vaccine itself).

The numbers, that's who.

Unless you're on Team Covid, a drop from ~70% effectiveness to ~60% effectiveness is not good news.

&gt; Where do you get the idea, that vaccines were supposed to protect against symptomatic infections?

Effectiveness against symptomatic infection is one of the primary criteria on which vaccines have been judged so far. For example, one of the thresholds used by both the WHO and FDA as a criterium for a successful vaccine was 50% effectiveness in preventing symptomatic infection, with a lower bound for the 95%CI of &gt;30%.

AZ has now fallen to a point only barely above that, and there's a good chance that it will drop below that threshold for variants in the not-too-distant future.

Beyond that, the WHO has consistently and explicitly championed the idea of achieving population immunity (herd immunity) through vaccination.

The reason is because the 60% efficacy is in regards to the existing statistical likelihood you will be hospitalized.

Fortunately, that variant came around right as most Schools were letting out for the summer.  If kids can't be vaccinated, and the Delta variant permeates through the summer, it challenges Schools again. 

Fortunately the recent relief package provided a lot of money to Schools for pandemic related costs cause that was a problem in my county. When my County went back to School close to full time, 1/3 of parents still opted for virtual, and I live in a very conservative area. It was only 4 days a week, not 5, with Wednesdays being for extra sanitation. 

At thst point all Staff had the opportunity to be fully Vaccinated. Cases amongst staff were almost gone, but there was a massive spike of cases of students, 72% by the 2nd full week back. In my state, they only contacted someone if they were within 6 feet of someone, indoors for 15 minutes or more within a 24 our period. So most students tested were symptomatic. Furthermore, if child, as opposed to an adult, was contacted by a contact tracers, they were only told to be tested if symptomatic. 

The Delta variant spreads up to 60% faster than the Alpha variant, and is worse. 

I know our School system is still planning on offering a virtual option this year. We invested in bipolar ionization systems for air purification, and Teachers aren't really  resistant to in person anymore.

&gt; [p.9 of 17] An analysis of observational data from state-based eviction moratoria in 43 states and the District of Columbia showed significant increases in COVID-19 incidence and mortality approximately 2- 3 months after eviction moratoria were lifted (pre-peer review). Specifically, the authors compared the COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates in states that lifted their moratoria with the rates in states that maintained their moratoria. In these models, the authors accounted for time-varying indicators of each state‚Äôs test count as well as major public-health interventions including lifting stay-at-home orders, school closures, and mask mandates. After adjusting for these other changes, they found that the incidence of COVID-19 in states that lifted their moratoria was 1.6 times that of states that did not at 10 weeks post-lifting (95% CI 1.0, 2.3), a ratio that grew to 2.1 at ‚â•16 weeks (CI 1.1, 3.9). Similarly, they found that mortality in states that lifted their moratoria was 1.6 times that of states that did not at 7 weeks post-lifting (CI 1.2, 2.3), a ratio that grew to 5.4 at ‚â•16 weeks (CI 3.1, 9.3). **The authors estimated that, nationally, over 433,000 cases of COVID-19 and over 10,000 deaths could be attributed to lifting state moratoria.**

&gt;This pilot has several key limitations that warrant careful interpretation of the results. Firstly, it was designed to explore a potential signal for the use of ivermectin in COVID-19, not to provide definitive evidence on the subject, hence its small sample size. Second this pilot was restricted to subjects with non-severe disease and no risk factors in whom the treatment was provided in the first 48 h of fever or cough, this should be taken into consideration for the design of any confirmatory studies to be conducted. Additionally, the quantification of the viral load presented is intrinsically limited by heterogeneity in the samples, even if all were obtained by the same clinicians, standardization against a human epithelial cell gene would be required to ensure the viral loads are truly comparable

By Jeff Jenkins 
June 22, 2021 - 1:40 pm

CHARLESTON, W.Va. ‚Äî Gov. Jim Justice said Tuesday there are no plans to discontinue the COVID-19 vaccination sweepstakes even with the leveling off of vaccination numbers in the Mountain State.


Gov. Jim Justice
During his media briefing Tuesday at the state capitol, Justice said the incentives were still worth the effort even though the state has recorded less than 5,300 vaccinations during the past week.

‚ÄúWe gotta continue to try. There‚Äôs no reason whatsoever, whatsoever to call off what we‚Äôve got out there and what we‚Äôre doing,‚Äù Justice said. ‚ÄúState after state after state is doing exactly the same thing or even more that what we‚Äôre doing.‚Äù

The next round of winners will be announced June 30. The sweepstakes that include cash and prizes continue through the first week of August. West Virginia is using federal pandemic relief money to fund the prizes than include the giveaway of $1 million a week, new trucks, hunting rifles and shotguns, lifetime hunting and fishing licenses, college scholarships and state park vacations.



New vaccination numbers from the Centers for Disease Control show approximately 52% of the state‚Äôs eligible population have been fully vaccinated. The numbers include 70% of those over the age of 50 who have been fully vaccinated. Those numbers drop down significantly for those under the age of 50.

Justice said those who haven‚Äôt been vaccinated are taking a deadly chance.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the death lottery,‚Äù Justice said.

He said some residents aren‚Äôt taking the risk seriously.

‚ÄúIf a bunch of, bunch of, bunch of folks that hadn‚Äôt had their vaccines started dying, a bunch of them, you‚Äôd see a real response. We wouldn‚Äôt need to be giving away lifetime hunting and fishing license and trucks‚Äìyou‚Äôd see people running to get the vaccine,‚Äù Justice said.


James Hoyer
State InterAgency Task Force Director Jim Hoyer also urged more younger residents Tuesday to agree to be vaccinated.

‚ÄúYou want to be in the right lottery West Virginia,‚Äù Hoyer said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to be in the one that puts you in the hospital, the one that potentially causes you to lose your life. You want to go out and be vaccinated if you haven‚Äôt been vaccinated.‚Äù

Hoyer said there‚Äôs a ‚Äúlot of work to do‚Äù when it comes to vaccinating those between the ages of 18-29 and 29-50.

Hoyer did announce Tuesday COVID-19 hospitalizations have dropped below 100 patients for the first time in nearly a year.

‚ÄúThis is the first time since July 23, 2020 that we‚Äôve been below a hundred,‚Äù Hoyer said.",,,1624650914,{},h315tkm,False,t3_o7rc5a,False,False,t3_o7rc5a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o7rc5a/justice_says_some_west_virginians_are_entering/h315tkm/,1624935353,20,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;June 25 (UPI) -- The Japanese government said four coronavirus cases had been found among Olympics arrivals from overseas, after two members of the Ugandan delegation tested positive for [COVID-19](https://www.upi.com/topic/COVID-19/).  
        
&gt;Tokyo said a French national who arrived in February, an Egyptian in April, a Sri Lankan in May and a Ghanaian in June all tested positive. The public was not informed of the positive tests at the time and the individuals had traveled to Japan for Olympics-related reasons, the Mainichi Shimbun reported Friday, citing the Cabinet Secretary's office.    
          
&gt;The government has been facing mounting public criticism over the decision to hold the Summer Games despite concerns about a surge in cases during the event. Infections have grown since Japan lifted a state of emergency in Tokyo and other areas last week.  
      
&gt;Tokyo requires all overseas arrivals to undergo a 14-day quarantine, but athletes are exempt. The Japanese government estimates about 70,000 people will travel to Japan for the Olympics, with many exempt from quarantine, the report said.

Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said that starting from Sunday, entrants from Bangladesh, Britain, Indonesia, Israel and Peru would have to spend 14 days in government-run facilities.

People coming from Brazil and India already face such quarantine, while all others must quarantine at home or in hotels for 14 days.

Taiwan‚Äôs seven Delta infections were all imported cases detected during quarantine.

The island is battling a cluster of domestic infections, almost all of them due to the previously globally dominant Alpha variant, though numbers are steadying and the outbreak has been comparatively small.

Chen announced 76 new domestic infections on Friday, down from 129 a day earlier.

Taiwan‚Äôs tally of infections stands at 14,465 since the pandemic began, including 610 deaths.

Those of us who have acted responsibly, remained masked and have gotten immunized have done our part.  We will continue to do our part.  Those who have *not* will continue with their behavior.   

This is human nature.

It permeates every human society, from laws against jaywalking to warning stickers on hammers: *there will always be fools who will act against their own self-interests, and in the process somehow degrade experiences for everybody else.*  

For some reason, people think COVID was a unique point in time to reset the human condition, and that some glorious future awaits because *this time it will be different.*

&gt; Sweden, whose still mostly voluntary measures has made it an outlier in its response to the pandemic, has seen the number of people in intensive care rise to its highest level since the initial outbreak a year ago.

&gt; The restrictions will be prolonged until mid-May and mean restaurants will have to close at 8.30 pm and that shops and malls can only let in limited numbers of customers. Sport venues and public pools will remain effectively closed to visitors.

None of the measures in CA were ""voluntary"".  And I remember when they wouldn't allow OUTDOOR dining at restaurants here in CA, apparently the only restriction in Sweden is when they close.

It argues that governments, financiers, and technological utopians have, since the 1970s, given up on the complex ""real world"" and built a simpler ""fake world"" run by corporations and kept stable by politicians. The film was released on 16 October 2016 on the BBC iPlayer.

Thank you for proving me right more than ever before. MRNA vaccines are worked on over 30 years to be tested on thousands of people and to be seen if there are long-term effects on people or not. That's perfectly suit well with science. That's great.

This is why people cannot trust a vaccine that was invented within 15 months. Nobody knows what the real long effects are, since it's made within 15 months.

Who took covid19 vaccine 5 years ago, so we can assess the long term effects right now? Nobody, exactly.

That's for proving me right with your example.
