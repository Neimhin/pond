Either way, current projection for 90% is Jan 10 (this'll slip back), 80% for Dec 10 (this is moving forwards), a date's to be set in stone at 80%, so you'll know in a few weeks.

I believe we have to encourage in a positive manner and show factual information. Although, not always throwing facts at people because they become fatigued and desensitized. 

I know from first hand, attacking people about vaccination solidifies their ideals even moreso. My brothers started out as skeptical about the covid vaccine and as a family we were on them. Now it's seems they are increasing attached to opposing it after all this. I know for a fact they feel attacked. I mean at one point it was 5 people yelling at one to do it. He could barely get a word in. I do believe we pushed too hard. One of our family members forced them to look at the Herman Cain and it seemed to just pushed them further away. I have found I don't think pushing people is really the way to go. 

I remember as a kid my dad would scream at me. He would throw shit across the room too if I didn't do what he said. I wouldn't do it purely out of spite and the more he yelled the less likely I was to do it. When I got older, I finally said if you want me to do something just ask me nicely, tell me why, and respect my opinion and I'll do it. From then on, he did and I did what I was asked of. If I had a problem with it, instead of him not listening to anything I said and telling me do it cause I said so he let me talk. Something this lead to stuff getting done a lot more efficiently. 

Honestly, I think this is a giant problem with how we have dealt with the COVID vax. Many do feel attacked, so they do further identify with these harmful ideals and become hardened in them and push back. As adults, we act like children sometimes haha. 

If politics hadn't put this wedge in place I don't think it would be so much a problem overall though.

Maybe we have to approach it at a different angle. I know many are afraid of some specific alleged ingredient for instance. What if we did a live viewing of scientists doing gas chromatography checking for certain ingredients to prove they aren't present? They could have a group of pee that are that as a problem present to ask questions.  This may not be a perfect example, but I feel like we have to start thinking outside the box. The back and forth arguing just is not cutting it. It's just making it worse. 

I have convinced 6 of my friends overtime to get the vax, but I changed up how I went about it. I gently encouraged them as a friend and addressed their concerns without attacking them. It seemed to work a lot better tbh.

In 2009 Sweden mass vaccinated over 6.5 million ppl  against swine flu with the pandemix vaccine. Anyone over the age of 16 was eligible. The end result was 350-400 confirmed cases of narcolepsy in the vaccinated group, adjusting for ""natural"" cases we are left with about 150-200 cases in the age group 16-24. The symptoms took between 67 weeks and up to 2 years to emerge. For the pandemix vaccine there where 4380 reported adverse effects in the whole vaccinated group, to be compared to cormirnaty with several 10s of thousand adverse effects (in sweden). 

We have 6 deaths in the age group 0-9 here, where the deceased had a posive test. This age group consist of some 1.2 million individuals giving us a population mortality rate of 1 per 200 000. Sweden has had wide spread infection and no testing of children outside hospital care, so estimating a CFR would be hard. 1,2 million cases or some 15% of the population has had a confirmed infection. Even assuming we caught every infection (and one could assume the infection rate is the same in the 0-9 age group as the general population) would mean a 1 in 30 000 CFR (6 out of 180 000). This risk is to be weighted against the risk of severe adverse effects, short and long term. The CFR in healthy infants for the RS virus the reported mortality rate is about 0.5 to 1.7 percent, for comparison.

The recall now includes roughly 2 million of the 3.5 million test kits that Ellume had shipped to the United States by last month, a substantial increase from the company‚Äôs earlier estimate that about 427,000 of those kits were potentially faulty.

It is not clear how many false positives the affected tests have yielded. The issue, which the company had previously traced to a problem with one of the raw materials used in its test kits, does not affect the reliability of negative results.

The F.D.A. categorized the recall, which was first announced last month, as Class I, the most serious type. Use of the tests could have ‚Äúserious adverse health consequences,‚Äù the agency said. People who falsely test positive for the virus may receive unnecessary treatments for Covid-19 and experience delays in being diagnosed with and treated for ‚Äúthe actual cause of the person‚Äôs illness,‚Äù the agency noted.

‚ÄúEllume has investigated the issue, identified the root cause, implemented additional controls, and we are already producing and shipping new product to the U.S.,‚Äù a company representative said. ‚ÄúImportantly, not all of the positive results of the affected tests were false positives, and negative results were not affected by this issue.‚Äù

Many of the affected test kits have already been used. Consumers can determine whether they have used or purchased one of the affected tests, and request a replacement, online.

Those who try to use one of the affected test kits will be notified in the app that the test has been recalled. ‚ÄúIt really won‚Äôt be possible to use any of those tests now,‚Äù Dr. Sean Parsons, Ellume‚Äôs chief executive, said in an interview last month.

The company has put additional precautions in place to prevent the issue from recurring, he added.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm very sorry that this has happened,‚Äù Dr. Parsons said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all about chasing accuracy, and to have these false positives is disappointing.‚Äù",,,,1636591318,{},hk5440q,True,t3_qr8nwq,False,False,t3_qr8nwq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qr8nwq/home_covid_tests_recalled_over_false_positives/hk5440q/,1636874260.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know enough about deer management (I wrote a whole book on whitetails) to tell you that it is probably impossible to vaccinate a meaningful number of whitetail deer outside of very controlled situations in enclosed areas. Just looking at past failed experiments with trying to use chemical birth control to control whitetail numbers demonstrates how impractical it is to inject anything into a significant number of wild deer. Hunting will not help this situation much, either.

The only thing that comes to mind as a potential control method would be if an oral vaccine for deer was possible, and if it was stable enough to be left out at ambient temperatures for days on end. Then perhaps you could use salt and mineral licks and feeding stations to vaccinate them. Which of course would also be encouraging higher transmission at the same time.

So the chances of some horrible effects happening 5+ years from now are astronomically low, and lowering farther each passing day. 

But you know what IS showing potential long term side effects? COVID-19. I have not seen any children specific studies, but all sorts of issues are being investigated. From blood clots to cognitive issues, we have no idea what this sickness is doing to people long tern. There could be a whole generation of people with damaged lungs and destined for early dementia walking around. We don't know yet obviously, but the bread crumbs are there for some long term issues for all but the lightest of covid cases.

I even decided to leave it a few years back because it was taking a toll on my mental health, but I've always gone back because the drive to use my skills, knowledge and compassion to help sick, vulnerable and frightened patients has so far been indestructible for me, weathering some really awful moments.

*But*.

The day I walked out of my ED (ER) after a *brutal* shift in the early days of the first UK lockdown, when PPE was inconsistently available and there was no vaccine, so my colleagues and I were *literally* risking our lives every time we went to work (most of us had written wills/advance directives, that's how much risk we felt at, and we *still* went to work every day on the front lines), and found a bunch of utter morons protesting in the car park with 'COVID is a hoax' and 'Stop Killing Patients' and 'Doctors &amp; Nurses are MURDERERS' and 'Nuremburg II Awaits You' signs...well, that was almost the last straw. I trudged past those maskless *fucks*, one of whom called me 'complicit in genocide' and 'a puppet', and sat in my car and cried. For a minute I honestly didn't know if I would be able to treat them with the same level of care and professionalism as anyone else due to my rage and disgust for them, and if I couldn't be confident of that then I couldn't be a nurse. I sat there and cried for almost an hour before I drove home.

Things felt different by the time I was next on duty, but I talked with colleagues and we'd all experienced something similar at some point. A couple of people did leave ED but most of us stayed and we just carried on as before. But it hurt, it hurt *deep*. Those arrogant, ignorant fucks almost broke us by being despicable at a time when we were already fragile, hanging on by our fingernails (which are really short, because nurses...) and *that was their intention* - cruelty, because they have internet access and near-terminal (*actually* terminal in many cases, as it turned out) Dunning-Kruger. 

I did leave eventually, at the end of 2020, in order to care for my darling Dad at the end of his life. He had cancer and between the distance and the risk of infecting him I couldn't keep working *and* do what I wanted and he needed me to, due to the near-collapse of community nursing services in his area. After his passing, I took a few months out and now I work in a care home for frail elderly and young adults with neurological disabilities/conditions. I'm not sure if or when I'll ever go back to the front lines of acute care again. I'm enjoying using my experience and skills to help my residents live happy, healthy, quality lives and at least I don't get called a murderer or a puppet by people who can't reliably *spell* 'vaccine' let alone understand what they're villifying. Plus it's *always* heartbreaking to lose a patient, but it takes an extra toll when you know they didn't have to die - they could have significantly reduced their risk with a simple vaccine. We‚Äôre only human and it takes a toll, which I'm done paying for now.

&gt;We have hundreds of millions of people who have been vaccinated to produce antibodies against the non-Delta coronavirus protein domains and are who are now being exposed to the Delta variant. To reiterate, there is (to the best of my knowledge) no evidence whatsoever of ADE in this situation. In fact, we see the opposite: people who have been vaccinated are far less likely to become infected with the Delta variant, and if they become infected, they are far less likely to experience severe disease. These trends have been seen over and over in different populations, and they are the exact opposite of what you would see if ADE were operating. If the mechanism proposed by Yahi et al. were happening in the real world, then we should see higher Delta infection rates among vaccinated people, with more severe disease. We are not. We are seeing the reverse.

Wikipedia calls them ""the maiden, the prince and the peasant"":

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne\_Carnival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne_Carnival)

&gt;Every year three people (the Dreigestirn or triumvirate) are granted the titles of Jungfrau, Prinz, and Bauer (maiden, prince and peasant respectively), who pay a large sum of money for the privileges. The carnival prince is deemed to be the highest representative of the festivities, leading the main parades throughout the week. Traditionally, the Jungfrau (""maiden"") is always portrayed by a man dressed as a female. As an entity, the trio has existed since 1883. In earlier times these were individual characters, but all three entered the Cologne carnival in the 1820s.  
  
The prince, also called ""Seine Tollit√§t"" (His Madness), is the most important personage of the Cologne carnival. His float is the final one in the large parade on Shrove Monday. The naming as ""prince"" came as late as 1872, prior to it the name was ""Held Carneval"" (hero carnival), the personification of carnival. His attributes however remained unchanged, those of a regent: crown with peacock tail, a golden chain, a girdle with glitzy stones, white undershorts and a purple jacket. A sceptre in the right hand, and a slapstick in the left one. The slapstick is known as a general symbol of the fool, but specifically it is a fertility symbol and the symbol of the princely reign over his fool people during carnival.  
  
The peasant bears the title of ""Seine Deftigkeit"" (His Heftyness). As Cologne is a large city, the peasant must be a stately guy. He expresses the boldness of the old privileged imperial city of Cologne (became a full-fledged free imperial city finally in 1475. At that time, Cologne was the largest central European city, having a huge percentage of agricultural land inside its walls\[1\] and the farmers guild was well respected and influential). The sword and the flail symbolize his loyalty to the empire and his truthfulness. As the keeper of the city, he also keeps the city keys at his girdle. The key symbolizes the heroes of the city militia contingent in the Battle of Worringen AD1288, whereafter the city achieved independence from the archbishop of Cologne.  
  
The maiden, also called ""Ihre Lieblichkeit"" (Her Loveliness) symbolizes the patronizing mother Colonia and is traditionally played by a man. Beard or moustache are forbidden for this role. From 1936-43, the maiden was ordered by Nazi authorities to be played by a real woman. The Cologne maiden wears a mural crown. This ""defender"" crown and her virginity symbolize the impregnability of the city. Also she has a hand mirror symbolizing ""female vanity"", a recent attribute with no deeper meaning. Her Roman dress is a reminder of the Roman empress Agrippina (the younger, AD 15‚Äì59), wife of emperor Claudius. Agrippina was born in the city in AD15 and succeeded in getting a renaming of the place as the new Roman city of Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (CCAA) by AD50",,,,1636619611,{},hk6j7vb,False,t3_qqxa5z,False,False,t1_hk3y4mx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qqxa5z/germany_carnival_party_is_on_despite_covid_wave/hk6j7vb/,1636900754.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Background

Domestic pets can contract severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection; however, it is unknown whether the UK B.1.1.7 variant can more easily infect certain animal species or increase the possibility of human-to-animal transmission.

Methods

This is a descriptive case series reporting SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant infections in a group of dogs and cats with suspected myocarditis.

Results

The study describes the infection of domestic cats and dogs by the B.1.1.7 variant. Two cats and one dog were positive to SARS-CoV-2 PCR on rectal swab, and two cats and one dog were found to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 2‚Äì6 weeks after they developed signs of cardiac disease. Many owners of these pets had developed respiratory symptoms 3‚Äì6 weeks before their pets became ill and had also tested positive for COVID-19. Interestingly, all these pets were referred for acute onset of cardiac disease, including severe myocardial disorders of suspected inflammatory origin but without primary respiratory signs.

Conclusions

These findings demonstrate, for the first time, the ability for pets to be infected by the B.1.1.7 variant and question its possible pathogenicity in these animals.",,,,1636587814,{},hk4w8a3,True,t3_qr7iw4,False,False,t3_qr7iw4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qr7iw4/infection_with_sarscov2_variant_b117_detected_in/hk4w8a3/,1636870253.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;St Petersburg, Russia's second largest city by population, has ordered mandatory vaccination for people over 60 and those with chronic illnesses, a regional consumer health watchdog said on Tuesday.

&gt;The step was significant because authorities have generally held back from forcing people to get inoculated, fearing it could further entrench resistance to the domestically produced Sputnik V vaccine which is already distrusted by many Russians.

&gt;In Moscow, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said this coming week would be crucial for the capital and that it would be clear by the end of it what measures needed to be kept on. He said he hoped the situation would be more or less stable.

&gt;Many regions that have lifted the workplace shutdown will now require visitors to present a QR code on their mobile phones when visiting cafes, restaurants or shopping centres to prove they have been vaccinated or previously had the virus.",,,,1636631578,{},hk6xnjq,True,t3_qrjmb0,False,False,t3_qrjmb0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qrjmb0/russia_says_its_turned_tide_on_covid_cases_but/hk6xnjq/,1636909166.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;Nearly everything about their study shocked the scientists. They knew deer could be infected with the coronavirus. But they were stunned by the numbers ‚Äì four out of five deer tested positive at the highest peak ‚Äì as well as high viral loads that were ‚Äútruly gobsmacking‚Äù, Suresh Kuchipudi, clinical professor of virology at Penn State and coauthor of the study, told the Guardian. They were also surprised by the fairly clear links in the genetic analysis connecting human transmission to the animals and then the rapid transmission to other deer.

&gt;‚Ä¶

&gt;The study in deer is ‚Äúa really hard reminder that we need to do a much better job funding wildlife research, not just for SARS-CoV-2 but for other infectious diseases,‚Äù Carlin said. ‚ÄúWe have scientists who are more than capable of going out there and figuring out what‚Äôs going on with SARS-CoV-2, but there‚Äôs no real system in place to do that on a national level.‚Äù

&gt;More research would also reveal whether or how animals spread the virus across species, including to people.

&gt;If research like this hadn‚Äôt been conducted, Kuchipudi said, the outbreaks among Iowa deer would have gone undetected. ‚ÄúThere was a silent epidemic, if you will, happening in the deer,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe would have never known unless we tested the samples.‚Äù",,,,1636631174,{},hk6x372,True,t3_qrjf2j,False,False,t3_qrjf2j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qrjf2j/as_covid_recedes_in_us_a_new_worry_emerges/hk6x372/,1636908845.0,30,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;But while the vaccines‚Äô effectiveness against severe disease and hospitalization has mostly held steady, even through the summer surge of the highly transmissible Delta variant, a number of published studies show that their protection against infection, with or without symptoms, has fallen.

&gt;In fact, many studies show that the vaccines remain more than 50 percent effective at preventing infection, the level that all Covid vaccines had to meet or exceed to be authorized by the Food and Drug Administration back in 2020.

Maybe that squeaks it back a little under Pfizer, who knows, but either way neither option is a bad choice. Also antibody counts aren't the only thing at work in an immune system.

I was team Pfizer for my first 2, and decided to get my booster as Pfizer because of the data that came out showing Pfizer-boosted-Pfizer was 95% efficacy (real world data, not petri dish antibodies) compared to unboosted Pfizer. It bears repeating that the 95% is not the typical comparison of unvaxxed-to-triple-Pfizered, it is 95% when comparing 2-dose to 3-dose Pfizering. That's huge!! Also I knew that my body responded without side effects to the first two Pfizers so I was more comfortable tripling it than seeing if I'd get hit by the Moderna bus like a lot of my friends and family did.

Firstly, its incredibly hard once someone fell into the conspiracy trap/cult think to get out off again. Its a lenghty process in which you have to avoid to overwhelm the person with facts, they often stonewall you. Their conspiracy think comes from them being unable to differentiate credible sources from aunt karens facebook posts. It comes from an emotional place e.g. fear. Heres some info about that:

*Multiple activities bring deer into direct contact with people, including captive cervid operations, field research, conservation work, wildlife tourism, wildlife rehabilitation, supplemental feeding, and hunting (10). Wildlife contact with contaminated water sources has also been suggested as a potential transmission route (11), although transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater has yet to be conclusively demonstrated (25). Transmission from fomites or other infected animal species cannot be discounted.*

Captive cervids are captive deer. Captive deer potentially spreading it to wild ones. Wildlife rehabilitation would be like, facilities treating and then releasing injured deer.

On Saturday I received my Moderna booster. I had a rough time with the second dose (fever for 3-4 days), so I was expecting as much with the booster. Started developing a fever Saturday night 8 hours after the booster. I also developed a **very** sore throat at the exact same time. I was swallowing so much mucus I assumed it was from that. Fever and sore throat went away by Monday night, but then I developed very swollen lymph nodes in my arm pit (injection arm) that was very painful. Tuesday morning I then developed a constant tickle in my throat that led to a dry cough. 


Tickle and lymph node are better, but still there. I had very limited interaction with anyone in the days leading up to the booster.

&gt; **Even if some gain can ultimately be obtained from boosting, it will not outweigh the benefits of providing initial protection to the unvaccinated.** If vaccines are deployed where they would do the most good, they could hasten the end of the pandemic by inhibiting further evolution of variants. **Indeed, WHO has called for a moratorium on boosting until the benefits of primary vaccination have been made available to more people around the world.**

&gt;Health officials reported 50,196 new cases on Thursday, the fourth day in a row in which Germany has broken its record for new infections.

&gt;From next week those who are not fully vaccinated will be excluded from a number of entertainment sites in Berlin, the city's Senate announced on Wednesday, as it expanded the so-called ""2G"" rules that bar people without two shots from entry.

&gt;Outdoor events with more than 2,000 visitors will also be off-limits to unvaccinated adults, officials said.

&gt;The move comes amid an escalation in rhetoric against unvaccinated people from national ministers in Germany, where the inoculation rollout has fallen behind several European neighbors to the west.

&gt;Chancellor Angela Merkel, in a video message posted on the country's government website late Wednesday, said that ""in Germany, I must say unfortunately that our vaccination rate isn't high enough to prevent the fast spread of the virus,"" urging quick action at national level to boost the rollout.

&gt;Germany has fully vaccinated 66.7% of its population, leaving one in three people unprotected.

&gt;Infections have skyrocketed in recent days; the country's seven-day incidence rate rose to 249.1 cases per 100,000 people on Thursday, up from 154.5 cases a week ago.

&gt;Hospitalizations and deaths remain at a much lower level than in previous peaks, but there is growing concern about gaps in the country's vaccination coverage as it moves into the winter months.

&gt;Health Minister Jens Spahn said the country was experiencing a ""massive"" pandemic of the unvaccinated, an early signal that the government is directly targeting unprotected people to join the vaccine program.

&gt;Merkel also called Wednesday for a meeting between the country's 16 federal state premiers ''as quickly as possible'' to ensure ''harmonious'' measures at national level. Germany's federal state premiers are primarily responsible for imposing and lifting restrictions, but the country's new parliament on Thursday is debating on whether to turn coronavirus measures from the national level to regional leaders.

&gt;In a hurdle to its attempts to expand rollout, Germany's vaccine committee recommended people under 30 are only inoculated with the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 shot, after it observed a higher number of cases of heart inflammation in younger people who received Moderna rather than Pfizer.

&gt;In a news release on Wednesday, STIKO said its recommendation applied to both initial vaccination and any possible booster jabs.

The country's worst-affected province said it plans to take that step next week.

&gt;Austria has taken a series of measures in recent weeks in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19 and encourage more people to get vaccinated. On Monday, new rules took effect barring unvaccinated people who haven't recovered from an infection from restaurants, hotels, hairdressing salons and large public events.

&gt;Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said late last month that unvaccinated people in Austria could face new lockdown restrictions if infection numbers continue to rise ‚Äî which they have. On Thursday, official figures showed 760.6 reported new cases per 100,000 residents over the previous seven days ‚Äî a rate three times that of neighboring Germany, where record numbers also are causing alarm.

&gt;During a visit Thursday to Bregenz in western Austria, Schallenberg said that a lockdown for the unvaccinated is ‚Äúprobably unavoidable‚Äù and that the unvaccinated face an ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù winter and Christmas, the Austria Press Agency reported.

&gt;‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see why two-thirds should lose their freedom because one-third is dithering,‚Äù Schallenberg said. ‚ÄúFor me, it is clear that there should be no lockdown for the vaccinated out of solidarity for the unvaccinated.‚Äù

&gt;Upper Austria province, the country's worst-affected region with nearly 1,200 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past week, said later Thursday that it plans to take the lead.

&gt;Officials there ‚Äúplan a lockdown for unvaccinated people from Monday, provided that there is a legal green light from the federal government, or rather that the federal government creates the legal basis,‚Äù governor Thomas Stelzer said.

&gt;Schallenberg said authorities would consider a vaccine mandate for some professional groups. He added that the country's vaccination rate is ‚Äúshamefully low.‚Äù About 65% of the population is fully inoculated.

Moderna‚Äôs vaccine, which appears to provide the world‚Äôs best defense against Covid-19, grew out of four years of collaboration with research scientists at the N.I.H.‚Äôs Vaccine Research Center. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the company has blocked three N.I.H. researchers from being named on a key patent application.

Much more than scientific recognition is at stake. If federal researchers were named on the patent as co-inventors, the government would have a nearly unfettered right to license it to other manufacturers, which could help expand access to the Moderna vaccine in poorer nations and bring in millions of dollars in revenue to the government.

Dr. Collins declined to be interviewed. But speaking to Reuters in advance of a virtual health conference hosted by the news service, he made clear that the N.I.H., the government‚Äôs biomedical research agency, was not prepared to back down.

I think Moderna has made a serious mistake here in not providing the kind of co-inventorship credit to people who played a major role in the development of the vaccine that they‚Äôre now making a fair amount of money off of,‚Äù he told Reuters. He added: ‚ÄúBut we are not done. Clearly this is something that legal authorities are going to have to figure out.‚Äù

A spokeswoman for Dr. Collins, Renate Myles, stopped short of saying the dispute was headed to court.

‚ÄúDr. Collins simply stated that N.I.H. is not giving up on our claim that N.I.H. is a co-inventor on the mRNA technology use in the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, but defers to legal authorities on how this might be resolved,‚Äù she said. By legal authorities, she said, Dr. Collins meant government lawyers.

The three government researchers that N.I.H. has been trying to get named alongside Moderna employees as co-inventors  worked with company scientists to design the genetic sequence that is at the core of how the vaccine triggers an immune response.

As the virus began to spread in January 2020, scientists at N.I.H. and Moderna worked in parallel over a single weekend to zero in on the gene for the virus‚Äôs spike protein. Both teams independently identified the same gene.
Moderna has so far rebuffed the government‚Äôs efforts. In a July filing with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, Moderna said it had ‚Äúreached the good-faith determination that these individuals did not co-invent‚Äù the component in question.

Moderna‚Äôs chief executive, St√©phane Bancel, said Wednesday the company was in confidential discussions with the N.I.H. and would communicate publicly if a resolution to the dispute is reached.

‚ÄúWhat we just need to work out with the N.I.H. is who are the inventors. And there are very clear rules set out by the law about inventorship, and they are very important to protect the patent,‚Äù Mr. Bancel said at a virtual conference put on by Wired magazine.

Moderna has also received $1.4 billion from the federal government to develop its vaccine and another $8.1 billion to provide the country with half a billion doses. Moderna is earning billions in profits from supply deals worth about $35 billion through the end of next year.

Biden administration officials have said they lack the authority to require the company to share its vaccine recipe and technical know-how with manufacturers who could produce it at a lower cost for poorer countries.",,,,1636594412,{},hk5azv2,True,t3_qr9mip,False,False,t3_qr9mip,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qr9mip/the_nih_says_it_is_not_giving_up_in_patent_fight/hk5azv2/,1636877728.0,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So it looks like 3x less likely to die if you are vaccinated and get a breakthrough case. But from the data in the article we, can't determine how much less likely you are to get infected in the first place.

It's a moving target.

When hospitals get overwhelmed the ratio will probably go up as the vaccinated treynd to have better outcomes and will then be prioritized for treatment.

As we develop better anti-viral treatments the ratio could go up or down as we're able to save more people overall, it would depend on if there's some correlation between vaccination and efficacy of the new treatments.

So, yes, you should expect the numbers to be different in subsequent studies. Both because of random factors and because of environmental and technical changes.

What *you* should do though is not treat every study as an announcement of a new truth, but rather as a single piece of evidence pointing to the truth.

It can be a lot of work to drill down to what the results of each study are claiming and evaluate the relative value of each study. Thankfully though, that's not your job or responsibility.

The WHO, CDC, federal, state, and county Departments of Health all have people whose job it is to ingest all the latest studies, evaluate them, and issue guidance.

Every single one of these organizations is saying one thing: **Everyone who is able to get vaccinated, should get vaccinated.**

It doesn't matter if the ratio is 100:1, 40:1, 20:1, or 10:1**‚Äîeveryone who is able to get vaccinated, should get vaccinated.**
