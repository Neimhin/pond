I developed heart disease at a young age, a fluke 1:1M plaque rupture blocked the main artery over 99%. Flatlined for over 4 minutes. Had I not been in the ER to begin with, I would be dead. It did extensive damage and I've had CHF ever since.

Anyway, herd immunity just means that the transmission rate is &lt;1 even if there are no protective measures. If we barely achieve that, we would maintain our case numbers for a long time until enough additional people had been infected and were immune to drop the number significantly below 1, so that new cases wither away quickly.

Regarding the conservative thing, and this is important and dangerous i think. 

In Sweden its the opposite, the only party openly bashing on the strategy is the far right. I think its kind of dangerous that Sweden seems to be doing better and better. Anti-lockdown people can use it to push for really dangerous do-nothing strategies.

But Sweden did a lot, actually a lot of ""socialist esque"" things. People have a hard time to believe that you can get people to do things without punishing them. No there were no police in the streets arresting people going for a walk and they didnt put the whole country in house arrest. Instead of sticks there are carrots. 


For example during april there was the highest number of people ever (twice as high as 2019) staying home getting paid to take care of their sick children. This is not because children were sicker, its because the guidelines says that you should stay at home of you have the slightest symtoms. Similarly the government made it so that you get paid more If you stay at home when youre sick than before. Riskgroups gets paid If they stay at home etc.

Another thing that some people might not like (Since it doesnt fot their narrative) is that the reason why Sweden didnt do a forced lockdown was not to save the economy. The agency responsible thought it would cause more suffering in the long run. The Public Health agency is not responsible for the economy, they dont care about the economy. They are however responsible for public health in a broad sense, they can not only focus on the coronavirus. For example the reason they didnt shut down schools are because lack of education will have serious consequences in the long run on both society and individual children. Increasing inequalities, child abuse, asocial behavior, decreased mental health, increased wealth gap etc.

**Students eating** lunch boxes in the sun, loud zeroing activities and lots of cyclists. Much is the same during the start of the semester at Umeå University, but outside some of the university buildings something unusual is visible.

Soldiers in uniform stand in front of military tents and shout out instructions to passers-by.

\- Are you going to pick up a test or leave a test? Do you have the receipt ready in the app?

Here on the university campus, the largest sampling effort against the coronavirus in Sweden is currently underway. The goal is for 20,000 students and staff to be tested for a week to see if they have an ongoing infection or not.

The project can provide important lessons in the fight against the virus. Most samples are asymptomatic, which means that hidden routes of infection can be stopped. Everyone with positive test results will be encouraged to isolate themselves, which will prevent the start of the semester, when thousands of students gather again, from the spread of infection in the area.

**Anders Johansson, researcher** in infectious diseases at Umeå University and chief physician at the Västerbotten Region, is one of the project leaders. He says the study can help save lives in the region.

\- We do this partly to gain new knowledge, but also to prevent a difficult situation in a few weeks. We already know that the infection usually spreads first in these age groups, and that it can be seen in the nursing homes a few weeks later.

All test participants are encouraged to take a new test after one week, which means that it will also be possible to measure whether the start of the semester has contributed to increased spread of infection or not.

**Another important purpose** is to better understand what symptoms we should look out for. Participants fill in detailed forms about their condition, and thus the study can provide answers to what symptoms the infected had - if they even had any.

\- We hope that there will be enough positive answers so that we can say with statistical significance which symptoms are linked to covid-19, says Ramona Groenheit, project manager at the Swedish Public Health Agency.

**Prior to mass testing** , the region has been equipped with personnel who will help track all infection positive test results. Close contacts must be mapped so that the chains of infection can be broken.

Unlike the usual infection tracking in Sweden, all close contacts will be asked to do a coronation test. Normally, those who have been close to someone with covid-19 are encouraged to be careful and vigilant about symptoms, but you are not asked to get tested if you do not feel ill.

This is due to the fact that the Swedish Public Health Agency and state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell believe that asymptomatic people are not driving the spread of the coronavirus. As infection tracking is now becoming more rigorous than usual, that opinion can now be put to the test, Anders Johansson explains.

\- If we get enough positive cases, we can see if even those without symptoms spread this. That would be against what Anders Tegnell usually says.

**Infection tracing efforts can** also provide an answer to another controversial question: what is really the best way to trace the coronavirus?

Some critics believe that Sweden should trace infections as in Germany, where tracking is often managed by healthcare professionals mapping and contacting people who may have been infected. In Sweden, instead, a greater responsibility is placed on the individual, who is often asked to contact his or her close contacts.

**During the study** at Umeå University, half of the infection tracking will be handled by 35 specially appointed doctors, who will call and track the cases in the same way as they do in Germany. The other half of the positive cases will be encouraged to so-called self-tracking.

\- Since both methods are used in Sweden, I think it is good to study if one of them works better. Especially since it is written, talked about and liked so much. Then it is good to check if there is any difference, says Anders Johansson.

The study is expected to cost several million kronor to carry out, and is funded primarily by the Public Health Agency, but also by the Västerbotten Region and Umeå University.

**Even though the** project can provide important lessons, it is not entirely unproblematic. Västerbotten has been one of the least affected regions during the pandemic, and the proportion of positive responses in mass testing is expected to be low.

On Thursday, when 3,500 tests had been analyzed, only two of them were positive.

**Is there not a risk that you will hardly discover any cases here and that it will be a costly project that does not provide much new knowledge?**

\- We have built up an increased national capacity for increased testing, and one might think that it is reasonable to use it to try to answer whether it is safe to open up or not. But it is true that this is expensive, says Anders Johansson.

    Biggest testing so far
    The hope is that 20,000 people will be tested during the study. Asymptomatic people pick up sampling sticks that are inserted down the throat and up the nose. They also fill in information in a special app. Students and staff who are at home with symptoms of illness can have a kit delivered to them.
    
    The test is voluntary, and is offered to all students and all staff at Umeå University and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Umeå. The university has a total of about 34,000 students and 4,000 employees.
    
    The samples are distributed and collected Monday – Thursday during week 36. Week 37 is a new round of testing to see if the virus has spread at the university. All positive cases will be traced to infection. Half of the cases will be called for self-tracking, and the other half will be contagious by special personnel.

As for your supposed proof that it didn't come from a bat, or that it came from a pangolin i've got to say those arguments are completely false. I understand the confusion though, as media response to the information presented was spotty at best, but its important to understand the distinction. The strain of virus does contain elements common to those found in pangolins, but that doesn't meant the virus came from pangolins. virus strains don't evolve the same way other things do, they can incorporate elements from other strains of virus into their own design and reproduce as a new strain. The fact that the bat-based virus incorporated elements from pangolins suggests that a virus in the bat came into contact with the virus in a pangolin and incorporated elements from it-- the virus was still mostly similar to those found in bats and therefore most likely still came from a bat.

The real answer likely as to where the virus came from likely has less to do with wild animals though. Its almost definitely not a coincidence that theres a coronavirus research lab within wuhan that carries viruses up to 96% similar to covid-19, and while the virus obviously isn't laboratory engineered the most likely answer to all of this is that someone fucked up, the virus mutated enough to start spreading (most likely those infected in the military games were infected by a precursor strain, otherwise thered be a lot more deaths) before the virus mutated further into the strain we curently link to the wet market, which may very well have its patient zero in the market, the conditions are basically a paradise for a virus looking to get its hooks in.",,1599225828,{},g3zar38,False,t3_ilzlbp,False,True,t1_g3xxmvp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ilzlbp/robert_pattinson_has_covid19_halting_the_batman/g3zar38/,1599225920,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Here’s Dr Fauci’s take on it:

&gt;In an interview with Kaiser Health News published Tuesday, Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, which is composed of research experts that review data from clinical trials, has the power to end the trials early.

&gt;The independent board, Fauci said, could decide ""the data is so good right now that you can say it's safe and effective."" If the clinical trials were to produce results that are overwhelmingly positive, scientists would have a ""moral obligation"" to stop the trial early and make the vaccine available to all participants in the study, speeding up the process to make it more widely available.

&gt;""If you are making a decision about the vaccine, you'd better be sure you have very good evidence that it is both safe and effective,"" Fauci said. He added that he is ""not concerned about political pressure.""

Those numbers have been downplayed a bit since, with other experts saying those statistics were outdated. However, there is quite a bit of evidence that COVID-19 negatively affects cardiac muscle.

&gt;And researchers at San Francisco’s Gladstone Institutes reinforced that dramatically with a preprint publication of research on bioRxiv—which means it has not been peer-reviewed—that demonstrated, in culture, how the virus damages cardiac muscles.

&gt;They added the virus to human heart cells in Petri dishes. One of the authors, Bruce Conklin, senior investigator at Gladstone, said the “carnage in the human cells “ was unlike anything seen in other cardiac diseases. “Nothing that we see in the published literature is like this in terms of this exact cutting and precise dicing. We should think about this as not only a pulmonary disease, but also potentially a cardiac one.”

New Zealand, once devastated by the Spanish Flu, locked down and has 1,764 cases total and 22 total deaths. and before you say it is an Island, so is Hawaii, which has over triple the deaths with a third of the population.

South Korea which had a severe lockdown, 331 total deaths with a population of 51 million.

The thing was that these countries had lockdowns that people actually followed, that had good healthcare already, and executed the programs well, taking care of their countrymen.

COVID-19 has just exploded on many college/university campuses across the US.

A ""study"" that does not control interdependant variables is not at all a sensible study.

I really think it could be a cause for unnecessary issues, certainly for me (sleep, energy, mental health, joint health, memory, healing...)

I know a retired psychiatrist, on disability for depression, that had been getting zero omega-3 intake.  Bad for health, but especially mental health, as proper intake can help the brain.  Then showing the NIH fact sheet, had to explain to go for the EPA &amp; DHA, as the ALA has single digit absorption.

I asked a specialist about a condition, they hand waved and said ""vitamin deficiency"" and ""eat a balanced diet.""  No mention of likely candidates.

Because of food allergy, I should have been on one particular supplement my whole life, but was never ""prescribed"" one. 

In my opinion, it's not rocket science.  You take a list, like Harvard list of vitamins and minerals, and you total up what you get from each in your diet.  If it's below the daily value (or equivalent like adequate intake) then supplement enough to push you over it.  Shoot for between the daily value (DV) and the upper intake level (UL).  That's it.  All the data is published by the NIH, not some ""weird health blog.""  We should learn this in health class.

But I've seen so many articles of doctors writing about how supplements are a waste of money with possible exception of a multivitamin (and wow, multi's can vary so much in coverage not just in magnitude, but in number of micronutrients), that most people I try to explain this to look at me like I'm an anti-vax kook.  Yet the latest was [Oregan State University published a super easy-to-read paper showing the large percentages of American's deficient in all the micronutrients](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/micronutrient-inadequacies/overview), but most doctors think ""there's no public health problem.""

**2,500 randomly selected individuals were tested for ongoing covid-19.** **All samples were negative.**

**- The spread of infection in society is significantly lower now, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of department at the Swedish Public Health Agency.**

**Another twelve people** with confirmed covid-19 have been reported dead in Sweden, according to the Swedish Public Health Agency's latest statistics. As a result, 5,832 infected people have died in the country. A total of 84,729 people have been confirmed infected with covid-19 in Sweden.

\- If you look in Europe, we have unfortunately found that there is an increase in several European countries, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of department at the Swedish Public Health Agency, at today's joint press conference.

\- When it comes to Sweden, the trend continues, we see a slow downward trend in recent weeks. If we look at IVA-cared for cases, there is the same trend there, she continues.

Sweden now has 2-3 deaths per day and some days no deaths have been reported.

The Swedish Public Health Agency has conducted a third national study of the prevalence of covid-19. None of the 2,500 randomly selected people who participated in the study had an ongoing one, it turned out.

\- Corresponding survey in April, which was the first, then we saw that 0.9 percent of those randomly selected were positive for infection. 0.3 percent were positive at the end of May in the second survey. And now it is 0, says Karin Tegmark Wisell.

Studies have also been done on the prevalence of antibodies to covid-19 among Sweden's blood donors. Seven percent of them had antibodies, according to the Public Health Agency.

In Stockholm, about 12 percent of the people tested had antibodies, in Västra Götaland about 5-6 percent, in Scania the proportion was even lower.

\- We have also looked at antibodies in outpatient tests, this applies to patients who seek care for other than covid-19. There we see that the prevalence at the national level is around 6 percent, says Karin Tegmark Wisell.

**Among adults** , aged 20–64, the highest prevalence of antibodies was among the outpatient samples.

\- It is random which samples you get in, but is around 10 percent in week 23, when it was at its highest, says Tegmark Wisell.

The Swedish Public Health Agency has also investigated the presence of antibodies among children. In general, it is lower than in adults, around 4-5 percent when it is highest in the group 0–10 years.

Among older children, the prevalence of antibodies is just under ten percent.

**The Swedish Public Health Agency has** carried out an investigation in the Rinkeby-Kista district, which was hit hard by the corona virus. 530 people chose to participate in the study and it turned out that 18 percent of those tested had antibodies.

Karin Tegmark Wisell points out that it is not possible to say anything about the proportion of antibodies in the population as a whole.

\- It is important to know what selection is behind and not to draw any general conclusions about a group or a region for any of these studies, she says.

**Karin Tegmark Wisell is asked** how to interpret the figures regarding the presence of antibodies. Is seven percent a lot or a little in that context?

\- We know that the antibodies do not reflect everyone who has had a disease. We do not see it as a figure that shows the accumulated number of people who actually had the infection. After two to three months, the breakdown of antibodies begins. We can not draw any conclusions whether it is high or long, she says.",,1599205824,{},g3yjnsb,False,t3_imbpd6,False,False,t3_imbpd6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/imbpd6/2_500_randomly_tested_in_sweden_no_one_had_covid19/g3yjnsb/,1599211543,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

However there is lots of ""socialist esque"" things going on. People have a hard time to believe that you can get people to do things without punishing them. 

Sweden choose to not make a forced lockdown because the agency responsible thought it would cause more suffering in the long run. It was not to save the economy, the Public Health agency is not responsible for the economy, they dont care about the economy. They are however responsible for public health in a broad sense, they can not only focus on the coronavirus. For example the reason they didnt shut down schools are because lack of education will have serious consequences in the long run on both society and individual children. Increasing inequalities, child abuse, asocial behavior, decreased mental health, increased wealth gap etc.

They used carrots instead of sticks to change peoples behavior. 

For example during april there was the highest number of people ever (twice as high as 2019) staying home getting paid to take care of their sick children. This is not because children were sicker, its because the guidelines says that you should stay at home of you have the slightest symtoms. Similarly the government made it so that you get paid more If you stay at home when youre sick than before. Riskgroups gets paid If they stay at home etc.

Sweden has  fairly few restrictions compared to other countries. People have a hard time to believe that you can get people to do things without punishing them. Sweden used recomendations and positive reinforcements instead. Carrots instead of sticks. 

For example during april there was the highest number of people ever (twice as high as 2019) staying home getting paid to take care of their sick children. This is not because children were sicker, its because the guidelines says that you should stay at home of you have the slightest symtoms. Similarly the government made it so that you get paid more If you stay at home when youre sick than before. Riskgroups gets paid If they stay at home etc.

Another dangerous myth is that Sweden refused to do a forced lockdown to save the economy. 

The Public Health agency is not responsible for the economy, they dont care about the economy. They are however responsible for public health in a broad sense, they can not only focus on the coronavirus.

The choose not to lockdown because they thought that it would cause more suffering in the long run.

Maybe it’s because they had a massive holiday at just the worst time - just like the Stockholm area. Hundreds of thousands Swedes being abroad during the worst possible time before borders started closing created an explosion in cases similar to the one in Belgium.

I sincerely do believe that vaccines has a place among medicines. They are like all medicines to have side effects and are not the safest medicines ever administred. Not even natural remedies are without side effects. Vaccines have helped to eradicate illnesses like measles and smallpox. 

I think it is valuable and important to get more knowledgeable about vaccines and more knowledge about rules and other regulations and laws surrounding vaccine use. 

The vaccine ie medical and pharmaceutical companies has EUA in at least USA that says that they do need to take responsibility for vaccine injuries and the harmful effects of vaccines. The companies are shielded by laws from lawsuits about vaccines and their effects. That is harmful and leads to negative effects such as neglect to find side effects and end the use of harmful substances like tiomersal in the vaccines. I have a faint recollection that our laws and regulations in Sweden and in other countries in the European Union are similar. But the US rules are more company friendly than the European rules and regulations and free-writes the companies totally from any responsibilities in regards to vaccine side effects. 

The rush to get a vaccine ready RSN has the consequences of that we might get vaccines that is both being ineffective and perhaps harmful.
Vaccines wreak havoc with our immune system. We want to improve our immune system not degrade it. We want to get the blasted virus to be rendered ineffective by a efficient and as safe as possible vaccine with as few side effects as possible. That takes time and consideration to formulate and test. 

This SARS-COV-2-virus pandemic can become as deadly as the 1918-1920 Spanish Flu Pandemic. It is not there yet. I sincerely hope that we all around the world together stop this virus. Everybody need to do what they can do to stop the speed and spread of the virus. Wear masks, keep social and physical distance and wash your hands and sanitize surfaces. Those simple but hard restrictions are together with the coming vaccines what hopefully will stop the SARS-COV-2 all together. But until the vaccines are here those measures are all that 

I want pharmaceutical companies to take responsibility for the side effects of their vaccines and other products and not just rake home that profits and give huge dividends to their shareholders. 

I would say that the metabolic syndrome with obesity and diabetes and the cardiovascular disease are killing many people around the world. The non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that is behind most of this is a prevalent silent killer.

Yes, he should have communicated how serious it is from the start and I will admit that was a mistake on his part. He also should have pushed masks and social distancing more sternly. But even then, that’s about what he could do. He doesn’t have authority to force states to lock down or require masks. All of that fell on the states themselves and the data shows that even those measures didn’t make a difference because the states that had the most deaths per capita were a mix of states that took it serious and states that didn’t. The two worst were New York and New Jersey and they shut down almost completely. The virus was going to spread regardless and take its toll. Do I think the lockdowns and stuff were necessary? Yes, because who knows how bad it could have been, but looking at the numbers, this wasn’t an issue of red vs blue as much as it was an issue of most other natural factors. This is getting off topic slightly, but overall, Trump provided states with the resources they needed when they needed them (even democratic governors admitted that much). His one flaw was downplaying the disease, but looking at the trends, it was bound to spread regardless and it was already on our turf. Look at other countries. They are a mixed bag. Some that locked down are over this and some that locked down are in just as bad of shape as us. Some that didn’t lock down are fine and same the other way.

The mitigation tests are probably currently done through Vault - that will move to in-house at the IUB campus at some point this fall.

New drug and vaccine development times typically last between 10 and 20 years. In this case, large-scale manufacturing of mRNA-1273 has already begun, even before we know if it is safe or efficacious. This is a huge financial risk for the manufacturers that the government is offsetting. Otherwise they would never do it. Luckily, much of the ground work for the technological development of this innovative new vaccine approach had been done years ago in response to the SARS-CoV-1 virus and was mothballed when that threat was brought under control. This has saved years of development time and allowed the phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials to start almost immediately in the spring of this year and progressing through now and into October. This is still incredibly fast and if a preliminary review of the data indicates the vaccine works, deployment may even happen before the end of the year.

As for why do this? If there are adverse effects from the vaccine that may be very serious (nearly as bad or worse than the infection itself) that haven't been seen in the small samples of healthy volunteers who have taken it in phase 1&amp;2, giving it to millions of people could be disastrous to many peoples health. Morally and ethically, if we can prevent harming large numbers of people without providing them any benefit, we are obligated to do that. Hopefully you would agree.

Also, with your ""China made it in a lab"" theory, it also came out about the time there was an international military competition in Wuhan.  So also likely that the US made it in a lab in the US and transported it to China and released it there.

That’s right. You can’t. Because there aren’t any!

I follow the literature. I don't think vaping is 100% safe. There are all sorts of issues, from nicotine being a vasoconstrictor that has cardiovascular effects, to solder elements being in inhaled vape. But its still way better than the tar and tobacco specific nitrosamines produced by tobacco leaf combustion.

To date, there's only case studies noting nicotine users are less likely to present to medical care (than the population), and that when admitted, chronic smokers (not nicotine users) have worse prognosis. This has lead to still unpublished studies on medical nicotine patches as prophylactics against Covid-19. As for vaping, we just have one voluntary internet survey, done by a academic that has sought to find evidence against vaping for years, and which didn't or couldn't statistically adjust for the fact that those who vaped tested themselves more frequently, or perhaps had more social interactions.

I've tried vaping (repeatedly), but snus worked better for me in self-medicating side effects of Rx medications.

Has anyone else taken days off from their job that they're required to be present at and engage with a lot of people at? I have this year.. and I was called into an informal disciplinary meeting today about it. Have you experienced extreme anger and resentment at needing to work somewhere you could get infected?

I was on medication earlier this year that left me immunocompromised. The sheer panic this was causing me around March/April felt unbearable and lasted much longer since then. Even though I knew people were losing their jobs and would kill for mine, the fear of catching this thing while immunocompromised paralyzed me and from time to time I just couldn't face the day, let alone get through everything a work day involved without dissolving into panic attacks, tears, resentment at needing to choose between my health and paying the bills (I financially support myself. Not working isn't an option for me.) My apartment that I live in alone with my cat felt so much safer and I had no option to work from home.

The panic that being immunosuppressed in a pandemic caused me made me choose to discontinue the medication (which has led to the problems the medication was suppressing returning) but even with that discontinued medication and hopefully a better immune system, the panic had well and truly set up camp in my mind. I have experienced everything from not leaving my apartment for 2 weeks at a time, feeling insanely jealous of people who get to quarantine because they are safe, my hair was falling out, I was melting down. When I did return to work after missing some work, I would experience hostility from my co-workers.

I have improved on that front enough to be back in the swing of things but now after this meeting I am required to submit a medical certificate/ Doctor's note for every day that I miss for the next 6 months, got spoken to about how a team can't function with me being so inconsistent (probably understandable. That's not untrue.) I was referred to the person who manages the health and disability concerns of people in the workplace to speak to her about what caused me to miss so much work. I'm nervous to say 'sheer paralyzing fear' even though that's the root of all of it. 

Being resentful doesn't get me anywhere, dwelling in the feeling of powerless gets me no where, I get told often how lucky I am to still have a job even though it comes at a huge cost to my mental health and possibly my physical health. 

I'm sorry for the long winded post. I just wanted to know if anyone had been through this- any of these feelings, or been reprimanded for missing work.

Treatment includes stopping vitamin D intake and restricting dietary calcium. Your doctor might also prescribe intravenous fluids and medications, such as corticosteroids or bisphosphonates.

Taking 60,000 international units (IU) a day of vitamin D for several months has been shown to cause toxicity. This level is many times higher than the U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for most adults of 600 IU of vitamin D a day.

Doses higher than the RDA are sometimes used to treat medical problems such as vitamin D deficiency, but these are given only under the care of a doctor for a specified time frame. Blood levels should be monitored while someone is taking high doses of vitamin D.”

You don't get to know what people are using that data for or when. Most of the time it's sold to people who will use to try to manipulate you in some way. Other times it's used to help separate you from your money. For example, health insurance companies can collect this data and if they decide you eat out too much (or even just that people who live in your geographic area eat out too much) your rates may go up. They won't tell you that's why they went up. they just will. 

&gt; Why is the data burger king is selling better then what facebook or google or starbucks ?

What data is ""better"" is subjective and dependent on what someone plans to do with it. What matters is that *every* data point is valuable, and the value of all data increases as additional data can be associated with it. If burger king's data on is sold to facebook, the data facebook has on you becomes more valuable. If Burger king buys data about you from the people starbucks sold your data to Burger king's data increases in value.  

The more information you give out, the more it can and will be used against you. Right now we're only [starting to see](https://futurism.com/america-social-credit-system-china) where this is headed. The data being collected is increasingly being used to decide [all kinds of things](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/business/secret-consumer-score-access.html) like how long you wait on hold, how much you pay for online purchases vs your neighbors, what return policies a store will tell you they have etc.  

As much as people like to think they're lives are boring and their data not worth anything, the buying and selling of it is a huge and growing industry for very good reasons. The impacts it has your life are difficult to trace back to any one event so it all happens without your being aware of it but you are impacted by it all the time.

Summary

Background

We developed a heterologous COVID-19 vaccine consisting of two components, a recombinant adenovirus type 26 (rAd26) vector and a recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) vector, both carrying the gene for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein (rAd26-S and rAd5-S). We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two formulations (frozen and lyophilised) of this vaccine.

Methods

We did two open, non-randomised phase 1/2 studies at two hospitals in Russia. We enrolled healthy adult volunteers (men and women) aged 18–60 years to both studies. In phase 1 of each study, we administered intramuscularly on day 0 either one dose of rAd26-S or one dose of rAd5-S and assessed the safety of the two components for 28 days. In phase 2 of the study, which began no earlier than 5 days after phase 1 vaccination, we administered intramuscularly a prime-boost vaccination, with rAd26-S given on day 0 and rAd5-S on day 21. Primary outcome measures were antigen-specific humoral immunity (SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies measured by ELISA on days 0, 14, 21, 28, and 42) and safety (number of participants with adverse events monitored throughout the study). Secondary outcome measures were antigen-specific cellular immunity (T-cell responses and interferon-γ concentration) and change in neutralising antibodies (detected with a SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay). These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04436471 and NCT04437875.

Findings

Between June 18 and Aug 3, 2020, we enrolled 76 participants to the two studies (38 in each study). In each study, nine volunteers received rAd26-S in phase 1, nine received rAd5-S in phase 1, and 20 received rAd26-S and rAd5-S in phase 2. Both vaccine formulations were safe and well tolerated. The most common adverse events were pain at injection site (44 [58%]), hyperthermia (38 [50%]), headache (32 [42%]), asthenia (21 [28%]), and muscle and joint pain (18 [24%]). Most adverse events were mild and no serious adverse events were detected. All participants produced antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein. At day 42, receptor binding domain-specific IgG titres were 14 703 with the frozen formulation and 11 143 with the lyophilised formulation, and neutralising antibodies were 49·25 with the frozen formulation and 45·95 with the lyophilised formulation, with a seroconversion rate of 100%. Cell-mediated responses were detected in all participants at day 28, with median cell proliferation of 2·5% CD4+ and 1·3% CD8+ with the frozen formulation, and a median cell proliferation of 1·3% CD4+ and 1·1% CD8+ with the lyophilised formulation.

Interpretation

The heterologous rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based COVID-19 vaccine has a good safety profile and induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses in participants. Further investigation is needed of the effectiveness of this vaccine for prevention of COVID-19.

I think that the authorities that governs and formulate regulations and provides oversight on certain industries should paid for by the governments of states and national governments as opposed to the situation today. Today the very industry and companies pays for the governing and regulatory body that provides oversight over those companies.

There is a possible small uptick because school start and work restart after summer vacations and summer holidays. The uptick is not yet seen in the statistics, it takes a while, a couple of weeks, since there are a really small societal spread at the moment in Sweden.

You dont get a ""peer-reviewed study"" telling you that apples are not oranges.  Or that 2 + 2 = 4. That was the director of the Illinois Department of Public Health telling you how Covid deaths are classified.

&gt;But, generally, somebody with a brain tumor, in treatment for a brain tumor, who gets the flu and dies of pneumonia is listed as dying of pneumonia, caused by the flu, with a comorbidity: brain tumor.

UG.  RIGHT.  But if &gt;they didnt die from pneumonia&lt; and just die from their brain tumor, while they are sick with the flu, then they are said to have died from the brain tumor.

HOWEVER if you *die from a brain tumor while you are sick with Covid* you will be called death from Covid with a previous condition of brain tumor.

(Actually, I'm not sure about a brain tumor. Substitute diabetes though and my point is valid. If you die from diabetes while sick with Covid that is ""Covid with diabetes precondition"".  But it wouldnt be ""Flu with diabetes precondotion"")

Covid deaths are to be coded if they caused or *contributed* to death. And even without a positive test, if the doctor presumes it's present.

Flu deaths are not coded as ""generously"".

If they were, that would obviously increase the number of reported flu deaths, which would increase the flu IFR.

&gt; but you’re not providing evidence for your comparison. 

I did. You just do not accept it, instead demanding to see something that doesnt exist in something like this.

Right now, we are allowed to meet again with safety precautions and despite having followed all rules to a t, I totally went and hugged some friends after about four months of seeing no one face to face. 

Technically, it still isn't within the guidelines, but while I was happy having a lot of fulfilling zoom meetings at work and with colleagues, I too was absolutely craving touch. I am single and do not mind going without physical closeness for weeks and months, but hugs are different and were deeply needed. I found that spending a day with friends (including a hug) helped in keeping me going for another few weeks. This is the risk I am willing to take - hugging friends each few weeks to maintain my mental and emotional stability. 

I also think it is harder during the reopening phase. For example, dance classes are slowly being reinstalled where I live, but you need to come with a partner (understandably), so others can move back to normal at a faster pace while you're still left out.

Basically, he feels there is only a very very small chance that there is a vaccine that will be available by end of October or early November, but given that even it's only a very small chance, it's better to be prepared. But I can't underscore enough how often he basically throws cold water on the idea that any vaccine will qualify for an EUA by end of October or early November.

Rather, he does believe that there will be a valid safe vaccine available to 20 to 25 million Americans by the end of the year. he is speaking of prioritizing Frontline workers and high risk individuals as the first ones to receive an end of year vaccine, with the rest of the US population being able to follow and get vaccinated by mid-2021.

Someone is going to be first, and yeah they might take shortcuts, but you know damned well they're still not going to take so many shortcuts that they give cancer to their entire country.

That's why there's trials. They've moved past version one already by testing it. Version one would be being the one out of five hundred that take it first, not those that got the end result when they're handing it out to the general population.

It's not like I trust USA shit that much more at this point. If any super power starts vaccinating their entire population, I'm going to assume they are pretty damn sure it's safe enough to not give them all a disease. No one wants to genocide their own homeland.

Type 1 narcolepsy (the one everyone knows about) has cataplexy, where your body suddenly goes into REM sleep during the day (though even that can be as subtle as your hand going limp for a couple seconds from laughing too hard), but it's still much more obvious than Type 2 (without cataplexy), and there's a spectrum, as there is with most illnesses, and most people fall somewhere in the middle, so it gets misdiagnosed a lot, or you don't know how bad your situation is until someone points out to you that it's not normal to wake up feeling tired most days. The biggest and most common symptom is literally Excessive Daytime Sleepiness-- that's the medical term-- and there are so many other things (like vitamin deficiencies in the comments above) that make you excessively sleepy in the daytime lol. Believe it or not, narcolepsy gets misdiagnosed as insomnia all the time.

All sleep disorders are hard to catch and diagnose correctly, and individuals just think they're a really heavy sleeper, or they snore a lot, or they need 9 hours every day or else, because that's what they're used to and that's the ""normal"" they've built their life around.

https://twitter.com/profdfrancis/status/1298499595056668673?s=21

This is a thread from Dr. Darrel Francis, an Oxbridge educated cardiologist who now works at Imperial College London. If you have a high knowledge of cardiology, his writing will probably mean more to you, but my knowledge of statistics allowed me to follow along. What he points out is some major flaws in one of the most popular papers about heart conditions associated with COVID-19. These flaws render the findings of this research statistically insignificant. Later, the authors of this paper revised their work to show that the heart conditions they identified were more likely due to a patient’s lifestyle choices than their COVID infection.

There have been four major papers that received a lot of press coverage on the heart effects of COVID. Of those four, two have been retracted, one has been edited, and the fourth, and most recent, one is a case study on I believe three patients that can’t be used to draw any sort of conclusion for the vast majority of people. Today there’s been a lot of coverage on what one Penn State doctor said. That doctor claimed that upwards of 30% of all Big Ten football players infected with COVID had myocarditis. That would seem at first highly concerning, but there are a few major issues with this analysis:

1.	⁠⁠Big Ten football players are in no way representative of the general population. Big Ten football players are all male, much larger than the general population, both in height and in weight, and have different levels of activity than the general population. If everybody walking around looked like Quenton Nelson, we might have good reason to be concerned. However, that is not the case.
2.	⁠⁠There is no control arm to this study. We don’t know if 30% is an abnormal number because we don’t have a similar control group to compare it to. That should be enough for any scientifically literate individual to dismiss this claim outright.
3.	⁠⁠The only thing we’re going off here is what one person said in one meeting. So far, no paper to back it up. At least none that I could find.

In the end, the studies that point to heart concerns all seem to be heavily flawed, and then propagated by people with little expertise in the required fields to understand such work.

(Also, I wrote this before the info came out that the Penn State thing was completely false. Literally no evidence to back that claim up whatsoever.)",,1599227303,{},g3zeml9,False,t3_im7r70,False,True,t3_im7r70,/r/Coronavirus/comments/im7r70/evidence_slowly_building_for_longterm_heart/g3zeml9/,1599227641,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

In this context,75% is ""good enough"" for effectiveness (and we will see different vaccine candidates' likely effectiveness from the clinical data) but obviously not as good as 95%.

https://twitter.com/profdfrancis/status/1298499595056668673?s=21

This is a thread from Dr. Darrel Francis, an Oxbridge educated cardiologist who now works at Imperial College London. If you have a high knowledge of cardiology, his writing will probably mean more to you, but my knowledge of statistics allowed me to follow along. What he points out is some major flaws in one of the most popular papers about heart conditions associated with COVID-19. These flaws render the findings of this research statistically insignificant. Later, the authors of this paper revised their work to show that the heart conditions they identified were more likely due to a patient’s lifestyle choices than their COVID infection.

There have been four major papers that received a lot of press coverage on the heart effects of COVID. Of those four, two have been retracted, one has been edited, and the fourth, and most recent, one is a case study on I believe three patients that can’t be used to draw any sort of conclusion for the vast majority of people. Today there’s been a lot of coverage on what one Penn State doctor said. That doctor claimed that upwards of 30% of all Big Ten football players infected with COVID had myocarditis. That would seem at first highly concerning, but there are a few major issues with this analysis:

1.	⁠Big Ten football players are in no way representative of the general population. Big Ten football players are all male, much larger than the general population, both in height and in weight, and have different levels of activity than the general population. If everybody walking around looked like Quenton Nelson, we might have good reason to be concerned. However, that is not the case.
2.	⁠There is no control arm to this study. We don’t know if 30% is an abnormal number because we don’t have a similar control group to compare it to. That should be enough for any scientifically literate individual to dismiss this claim outright.
3.	⁠The only thing we’re going off here is what one person said in one meeting. So far, no paper to back it up. At least none that I could find.

In the end, the studies that point to heart concerns all seem to be heavily flawed, and then propagated by people with little expertise in the required fields to understand such work.

(Also, I wrote this before the info came out that the Penn State thing was completely false. Literally no evidence to back that claim up whatsoever.)",,1599227243,{},g3zegxw,False,t3_im7r70,False,True,t1_g3za7o7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/im7r70/evidence_slowly_building_for_longterm_heart/g3zegxw/,1599227569,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

This is pretty accurate.  I live in the rural Midwest so we haven't had too crazy of numbers but there was a town nearby me that had an outbreak of 25 people getting Covid in 2 days so they actually recommended everyone to wear masks.  But then once they didn't get any new cases for a couple weeks they changed their minds and now don't require them anymore (coincidentally when the 6% lies came out).  There's still 3 active cases in the county and it's about to get worse because no one is taking precautions anymore.

Schools have opened now and my dad had to go over to the football game last night (hes involved with the school) and he said he just stayed in his pickup the whole time while he was there because the bleachers were packed, the streets up to the field were packed, and not a single person was distancing or wearing a mask.

It drives me nuts, but it has also given me a goal to work and save up to move out of this state where people are behaving like spoiled delusional kids.  I'm embarrassed to be lumped in with them.

All of the candidate vaccines had fully fledged phase 1 and phase 2 trials, which are the phases where safety is primarily tested.  Phase 3 doesn't disregard safety, it still monitors it, but is far more focused on efficacy.  In other words, all of these vaccines are already reasonably certain to be safe, and the current testing in tens of thousands of more subjects will confirm that beyond a doubt.

The only remotely legitimate concern about safety is the one which worries about potential long-term effects that could be missed.  However, this is really no different from any normal vaccine. Tons of vaccines get approved after a successful phase 3 and THEN go into a continued phase 4 where participants are monitored for years to come, and even that is not really long enough to reliably detect some random longterm side effects.  

Honestly I don't even know what the fuck people are so worried about.  I could understand being concerned about this if you know absolutely nothing about it, but even a modicum of research into the subject will tell you that most of the time being saved here is due to the absolutely gigantic amount of money and manpower we're throwing at this, the cutting of bureaucratic red tape in the process, and the incredible ease of finding participants to study as well as how readily they'll then be exposed to the virus (i.e. it's a thousand times easier to figure out whether your covid vaccine is effective by releasing 5 thousand vaccinated participants into the south right now, than to figure out the efficacy of your vaccine for some random obscure virus with a thousand cases in the whole country).  

This entire situation is totally unprecedented.  The amount of weight being thrown behind this one goal that we all want to see happen is unbelievable, I've never in my lifetime seen something so massively and unanimously strived for.

Sometimes I think the generations have forgotten or never known a really pissed off virus. We used to do the obvious. Bring the kid to the PCP, get diagnosed, with lab results to come if needed.

The time in July when HHS took over hospitalization data is a perfect example of this.  I must have read about 500 different highly voted comments since then about how the decrease in daily cases is fake because it started around the time that happened so they're obviously tampering with the data.

And then a few weeks later when the change was reverted and hospitalization data went back to the CDC, somehow every top post on this sub managed to argue THAT was also bad.

There are lots of ways to cool off.  Consider air conditioning wasn't even widespread until somewhere around the WWII period or maybe a bit earlier with the Tennessee valley authority or something.  I'm not saying schools should be held outdoors in death valley.

In summer camps there were plenty of strong storms, they are held during the thunder-stormy summer period.

**One third who state that they have covid symptoms say that they have been ill for more than 10 weeks. According to a survey from Novus, there may be as many as 150,000 who have long-term illness in covid -19.**           
**The health centers are now allowed to receive many with persistent symptoms.**                   
How many are long-term sick in covid-19, no one knows. According to Novus' latest survey in August, there may be around 150,000 people who themselves believe that they have been ill for a long time. General practitioner Sofia Hellman at the health center in Vaxholm has received about ten patients during the summer. She says that primary care is now pulling a huge load.                      
- Yes, I think we will see more, and I think it is primary care that will take care of them, she says. 
##Been seriously ill
The same picture is shared by Magnus Isacsson, general practitioner in Tensta and chairman of the Swedish Society for General Practice.                      
- We now see that there will be a plethora of those patients. But we do not really know how to relate to them, he says.                     
Most have been seriously ill but have not been hospitalized. Many symptoms are common. They still have difficulty breathing, the heart is racing, there is fever and lack of energy and an increased risk of blood clots. Many people report neurological symptoms such as loss of taste and smell, numbness, tingling, dizziness, headaches and difficulty concentrating. 
##""Phenomena we do not know""             
But the knowledge gaps are big. This autumn, the National Board of Health and Welfare and the Swedish Agency for Medical and Social Evaluation will investigate which symptoms are typical of long-term illness and which treatment is best.                    
- The difficulty here is that it is a completely new phenomenon that we do not know about, and we can not give them a forecast. Many times I may not have been able to do much about the symptoms, but you can believe them, and I have been able to be there, says Sofia Hellman.              
##150,000 long-term sick
The survey of over 2 100 people was carried out by Novus between 10 and 23 August. They have answered whether they are ill at the moment and, if so, how ill they were. 40% say they have been ill for more than 10 weeks, but some of these have different symptoms. Of those who say they have or have had covidi-like symptoms, about one third have been ill for more than 10 weeks. The survey indicates that around 150 000 people feel that they are long-term ill in the covid-19. The most common symptoms are fatigue, rhinitis, pain, headache and cough. The survey also shows that, of the vast majority of people with established cows, they were at home. Sixty-nine per cent did not have to go to any hospital, not even the 1177. 20% called the health guide, while 5% needed emergency care in hospitals. 13% of adults think they have had the disease, but only 2% have confirmed the disease with samples, which means that 15% of Swedes have been infected.",,1599248374,{},g414gz4,True,t3_immrg5,False,True,t3_immrg5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/immrg5/many_longterm_patients_with_corona_come_for_care/g414gz4/,1599256187,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

1. It's been pushed out 10× quicker partly because we've thrown hundreds of times the money at the problem.
2. We've used partially developed methodology already - no one complains when we add a new flu strain to this year's flu vaccine, and while there is a whole lot more science involved, the reproducibility of previous results (e.g., from the MERS vaccine) still stands;
3. One of the reasons vaccines take so long to develop is because you're waiting for enough of your trial subjects to get sick. When double-digit percentages of some countries are getting sick naturally, that's not a concern;
4. In order to keep costs down, you start with one assumption, collect your results, and then re-run the trial to optimise the output. If you have unlimited money and limited time, you test all possible parameters at once.

So if your vision of vaccine development is:

1. Decide that the world needs a vaccine against x. 
2. Immediately have all the funding and resources to do everything as quickly as you wish.
3. Come up with ideas as to how to deliver them.
4. Trial and error until you find the one safe way to deliver it (Phase 1 and 2 trials).
5. Test all the options in parallel and wait for the unsafe ones to kill people over the next decade, rather than ""run one small trial, expand the scale, tweak the parameters, lather, rinse, repeat, while waiting for enough subjects to get sick of the disease, then start again).
6. Pick the safe one and go to market.

Then yeah, you can't really speed that up.

Here, it's more like:

1. Decide that the world needs a vaccine against Covid 19.
2. Skip the stage where you spend months or years demonstrating a financial case and finding a funding body. You've got functionally unlimited resources.
3. Use a pre-existing delivery platform.
4. Don't worry about trial and error because you've already got the platform, but perform safety tests regardless to the usual standard.
5. *Actually* test all the options in parallel. Don't worry about waiting for a few subjects to get sick - you've got thousands of them, and they're all highly exposed because of the raging pandemic. Don't do the usual ""lather, rinse, repeat,"" because you're already testing everything possible due to your functionally unlimited resources and the high prevalence of the disease, giving you an abundance of data. No one dies because the safety testing phase is already complete, and your Phase III trial is massively larger in case there was any doubt.

3. Last years influensa season hit the nations differently. Sweden was hit very lightly, resulting in the lowest death per capita ever measured over a year.

Then we can perhaps also talk about the differences that has to do with how prepared the nations where, as in Sweden was badly prepared but that can be seen as different to the respons to covid. For example Finland had a large stockpile of protective gear that the health care could use while Sweden abandoned such stockpiles to save money years ago. An other example is how the employees in Norways elderly care has a higher education than those in Sweden.

Taiwan got 490 cases, including 7 deaths. Not zero.

Despite what you're implying, Taiwan isn't a snowflake and didn't get any advantage over any neighboring country because of their CDC. Speaking broadly, Taiwan didn't handle such low number by warning anyone with a h2h transmission proof, but they did exactly what Hong Kong, Korea, Vietnam etc. have done: they implemented their SRAS protocol as soon as possible. Hong Kong in particular has also been quite reactive in the early stage of the outbreak.

Anyone that ever went to an airport in such country *pre*-covid knows they don't fool around (mask for personel, temperature check, disinfecting mat are standard). And again, that is pre-covid (note that I am not sure about Vietnam since I've never been there unlike the others countries).

The H2H transmission was *confirmed* on the January 20, after review of scientific data. It's not about admitting something, but proving it. The WHO was notified on December 31, which is incidentally the same day the Taiwan email requested more information. The initial cases in Wuhan were in majority related to the meat market (closed down on January 1st), and it wasn't clear if the transmission could be done via food or an other way.

While the Public Health Emergency of International Concern has been declared in January, I'll acknowledge the WHO should have declared a pandemic earlier, as soon as the new outbreak in Lombardy was becoming clear in late February. Hell, nobody was surprised when they did it (at least in Europe), which tells something.

&gt; They had influence previously, until they removed their only US appointed member.

Good point. They indeed really made sure to be able to complain about it, didn't they? Self fulfilling prophecy to justify leaving the WHO, for political purpose.

&gt; Taiwan has been requested to join the WHO for a while, but yet they are denied every single time.

Yes, and as I mentioned in the above comment, this is *ridiculous*. If Taiwan can get a place in the ""useless"" Olympic Games, I don't see any justification why they couldn't get at least a ""Chinese Taipei"" observer status at the WHO. China needs to be called out for this critical bullying, and this needs to change.

Lastly: I do believe one has to hold oneself to a higher standard before calling out the bullshit of the other party. If calling out the anti-China bullshit makes me a pro-China guy in the view of some people in this über polarized political context, then so be it.",,1599258313,{},g41xgv8,False,t3_imii76,False,False,t1_g41kpmo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/imii76/its_the_worst_disaster_of_the_pandemic_but_who/g41xgv8/,1599269384,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I have isolated since mid/late februari so I have not got infected. (I live by myself and do not work so it is easy for me to isolate. I made some money in the computer business 20 years ago so I do not need to work).

Since I am not out in the society much I don't know exactly how much people are avoiding the virus but I think a lot of people are social distancing quite a lot. There are two restaurants close to where I live and sometimes I walk by and try to peek inside to check how many guests there are. They do have some guests but far from normal. I belive many restaurants have a rough time now.

One anecdote is that I talked with a friend and he often have barbeque parties in his garden. He told me that I might have seen his parties on facebook but nowadays he only invite 6 people instead of 12 and he is also very careful to invite the same people all the time and that is people he know is also worried and careful about the virus. 

Some people (younger people) seem to live their lifes more or less as normal but most people are social distancing. At least in my age group in our fifties. 

The virus does not seem to be especially infectious now. We had a little outbreak a month and a half ago where I live (Varmland) and around 10 people got infected at a party but they did not continue to infect much more people so the outbreak died out. It was a little superspreading event even though it was outdoors and they tried to keep distance.

My guess is that quite few people are especially infectious and without opportunities for superspreaders to superspread not so many get infected. (When living like this that is),

I do not belive population immunity makes that much difference because in my region there is not much immunity and still there are very few cases now.

Yes, of course there is *ample* evidence of immunity at this point.

What they cannot do, though, is take over for the DSMB and make the decision on whether to end the trial on that independent group's behalf.

According to accepted medical ethics, healthcare professionals should not harm their patient and take into account the current state of medical science. Healthcare employees who do not wear mouth guards can violate the Patient Safety Act, writes doctor Björn Lindström.**
                                
Three of the largest infection control authorities in the world - the EU ECDC, the US CDC and the World Health Organization WHO - believe that in communities where the new corona virus sars-cov-2 is spreading , caregivers should always wear mouth guards at close patient meetings.                        
                 
The reason for this is to reduce the risk of the care worker infecting his patient. It is scientifically proven that you can carry the virus and carry it on, without having any symptoms.         
                        
In Swedish healthcare and geriatric care, however, it varies whether the care workers protect their patients with mouth guards. In large parts of the country, this is not done.               
                  
**This is probably** a consequence of the Public Health Agency's peculiar view that this form of asymptomatic spread of infection would be negligible. But several studies now suggest that almost half of the spread of infection occurs from people without symptoms.                    
              
Arm-length distances are rarely maintained at patient meetings because they often involve physical examination or nursing. In addition, more and more studies suggest that the virus can be transmitted via the air at a distance of several meters under the right conditions.           
               
Mouth protection reduces the infection zone and the dose of virus you are exposed to. An oral protection on the care worker, and optimally also on the patient, together with basic hygiene routines is considered to significantly reduce the risk of infection.                              
                   
**But it is not only** by refraining from wearing mouth guards that large parts of Swedish care expose patients and relatives to unnecessary risk of infection. According to the recommendations, healthcare workers who themselves have no symptoms, but whose household members have contracted covid-19, should continue to go to work to meet their patients as highly potential spreaders - often without mouth guards.         
                   
Today we have a societal infection of sars-cov-2 in Sweden. Of 21 counties, 19 are ""red-listed"" for travelers by the Norwegian National Institute of Public Health.               
                
According to accepted medical ethics, you should not harm your patient and take into account the current state of medical science. There are now healthcare professionals who buy their own medical mouth guards in order not to violate the professional ethics that they believe are above individual authorities and local guidelines.        
                   
**But in addition to ethics**, there is also the Patient Safety Act. According to it, healthcare professionals must ""carry out their work in accordance with science and proven experience"". It further states that ""the person who belongs to the health and medical care staff is responsible for how he or she fulfills his or her duties"" and is ""obliged to contribute to maintaining high patient safety"".                
               
According to the law, care providers must ""take the measures necessary to prevent patients from suffering care injuries"". Care providers include state authorities, regions, municipalities and legal entities or sole proprietors who provide health and medical care.             
                   
**In light of** the scientific situation, what is internationally considered ""best practice"" and the fact that we currently have an ongoing societal spread of covid-19, it must be assumed that this may be a crime when you do not use mouth guards in healthcare, or when healthcare workers are encouraged to go to work even though household members are ill.                 
                  
The latter has recently been announced by the Swedish Public Health Agency that it is considering changing through quarantine rules for household members to covid disease. In that case, it is positive, but mouth protection should also be a matter of course.

And your saw how Trump reached whenever a state said they needed supplies. He simply denied the needed was there and claimed healthcare workers were stealing. The same healthcare workers who were getting sick and dying in New York while trying to care for patients. 


He decided to not implement any national testing plan even when multiple people suggested he should. 

Kushner's team came up with a plan. Rather than have states fight each other for scarce diagnostic tests and limited lab capacity, the plan would have set up a system of national oversight and coordination to surge supplies, allocate test kits, lift regulatory and contractual roadblocks, and establish a widespread virus surveillance system by the fall, to help pinpoint subsequent outbreaks. 

That plan was scrapped. Instead, he offloaded the responsibility onto states again so there were 50 different plans trying to function at once.

But anyway, that wouldn't have helped countries that disregarded the lockdown situation in Wuhan in late January (and criticizing it on ""Human Right"" concerns - I'll remember you forever NYT), or countries that even ignored the February outbreak in Lombardy till the very last moment (Europe), or countries that ignored Europe after that, by continuously ignoring, downplaying, announcing to quit the WHO and still playing politics at the very moment.

The transition to socialism is a formally defined concept within Marxism; Marxism after all defines socialism principally by the economic transition to use-value under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

This transition is described as an ambiguous process in which ""lower stage socialism"" embodies forms of both the capitalist mode and the socialist mode of production and organization.

&gt; What we have to deal with here is a communist society, not as it has developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges.

- Karl Marx, *Critique of the Gotha Programme*

&gt; That whole nonsense with reading some writing by (your?) Favourite Leader and then sticking to it like crazy is bloody ancient.

Then you haven't actually read any of the writings of prominent socialist leaders as Marxist-Leninists and their offshoot tendencies are categorically opposed to dogmatism. Marxism is a structural critique and a formulation of an analytic philosophy based on material dialectics, it is not a rigid body of work and not an instruction manual. It provides the theoretical basis for practical action, not a dogmatic set of actions to be performed.

Mao talks about this in *On Dogmatism*, Kim Il Sung talks about this in *On eliminating dogmatism and formalism and establishing Juche in ideological work*, etc. 

These people's writings are respected not because they are a ""favourite leader"", but because of the theoretical impact of their work and the nature of their work being a documentation of their historic attempts at socialism.

You are arguing a point of opinion or belief that is not held either by me or by socialists in general (not even by the socialists you seem to think originated this) - that of the infallible leader.

&gt; Socialism is a democratic system

Yes! We are in agreement, socialism is a democratic *class* dictatorship.

&gt; have to allow room for difference in opinion

Difference in opinion as it relates to the rule by the proletariat, not all opinions are equal in value.

The state is an instrument of class oppression and is to be wielded by the proletariat to oppress and proletarianize the bourgeoisie in order to bring about the end of class division and therefore the withering of the state.

&gt; The state is a product and a manifestation of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms. The state arises where, when and insofar as class antagonism objectively cannot be reconciled. And, conversely, the existence of the state proves that the class antagonisms are irreconcilable.

- Lenin, *The State and Revolution*

&gt; Between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.

- Karl Marx, *Critique of the Gotha Programme*

&gt; When at last it becomes the real representative of the whole of society, it renders itself unnecessary. As soon as there is no longer any social class to be held in subjection; as soon as class rule, and the individual struggle for existence based upon our present anarchy in production, with the collisions and excesses arising from these, are removed, nothing more remains to be repressed, and a special repressive force, a state, is no longer necessary. The first act by virtue of which the state really constitutes itself the representative of the whole of society – the taking possession of the means of production in the name of society – this is, at the same time, its last independent act as a state. State interference in social relations becomes, in one domain after another, superfluous, and then dies out of itself; the government of persons is replaced by the administration of things, and by the conduct of processes of production. The state is not “abolished”. It withers away.

- Engels, *Anti-Duhring*

&gt; you are just very hung up in idealism

Again, you don't seem to understand this word and I recommended a work to you already that describes the differences and historical approaches that lead to the divergence of scientific/material socialism from utopian/idealist socialism.

You are right about essential services and you are right about the desire to implement such a solution.  

I say 4 days but it would have to be a series of expanding bubbles.  The NHL started with a 3 day ""personal home bubble"" with two tests, then a 4 day in ""hotel room bubble"".  Players could roam the hall of their ""team bubble"" after a negative test after a total of 7 days.  Then they could enter the ""NHL Bubble"" after three days and daily testing.  

10 days, 5 tests.  14 days is only if you cannot test.  And of course, we have nowhere near the testing capacity.   It would need to be fecal testing as its been proven viable virus can be shed up to 6 weeks after infection.

* About 18 people are in ICU across the country. Other about 130 are hospitalized in other health units. 
* Results from several antibody studies were presented yesterday. Stockholm region has distinctly higher prevalence of antibodies than Västra Götaland or Skåne - in week 24 about 12% vs 6% vs 4% - results similar among blood donors (so ""healthy"" group) or people that visited the healthcare system (öppenvård, ""sick"" group). In the **Rinkeby-Kista** are in Stockholm a different study showed up to 17% antibodies, robust between participants' ages or sex. All these different studies have different specifics (in more detail described in the briefing notes from [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ils2h5/sweden_public_health_authority_update_84729197/g3u4bbs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) ). 
* Results from the third infection prevalence study (PCR tests send to a number of randomly selected people across the country for self-testing) showed rather encouraging results - over 2500 people (out of 4000 contacted) participated in the study this time and all samples were negative. Previously this study showed 0.9% ongoing infection rate in April and 0.3% in May.
* Yesterday 13 deaths were reported, out of them 10 were actually older july and august death reports from Östergötland region which has had several such bulk reports over the summer (they report low for long period and then catch up). This week we still had few corrections from last weeks false positive confirmed cases and also on Monday there were corrections from the region of Skåne which noticed that the difference in reporting between FHM and the region resulted in 16 deaths being counted erroneously in the official statistic. 
* Week 35 testing statistics also had good news. The number of tests has increased again after the summer slump and actually recorded the most tests perform in a single week so far - over 85k, which brings last week's positivity ratio at 1.4%. Sources and statistics available in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/il6b3i/sweden_week_35_85k_pcr_tests_performed_positive/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

Comparison between the different death metrics from this week's updates. 

* FHM most recent data - 4/9 - [https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/b5e7488e117749c19881cce45db13f7e/data](https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/b5e7488e117749c19881cce45db13f7e/data)
* Socialstyrelsen most recent data - 31/8 - [https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/globalassets/1-globalt/covid-19-statistik/statistik-over-antal-avlidna-i-covid-19/statistik-covid19-avlidna.xlsx](https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/globalassets/1-globalt/covid-19-statistik/statistik-over-antal-avlidna-i-covid-19/statistik-covid19-avlidna.xlsx) (the data where instead of number there is X indicates that there are less than five deaths on that day and to preserve patient's privacy they don't indicate exactly how many. But the total deaths for the period is reported on the top)
* Statistic Sweden most recent data - 31/8 - [https://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter-amne/befolkning/befolkningens-sammansattning/befolkningsstatistik/pong/tabell-och-diagram/preliminar-statistik-over-doda/](https://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter-amne/befolkning/befolkningens-sammansattning/befolkningsstatistik/pong/tabell-och-diagram/preliminar-statistik-over-doda/)

Socialstyrelsen data is until 26/8. Statistic Sweden data is until 28/8 but the days after 25/8 are obviously incomplete yet. So if we compare death numbers between 1/3 and 25/8:

* FHM reports **5821** people have died within 30 days of being diagnosed with COVID-19.
* Socialstyrelsen reports **5692** people have died where their attending or examining doctor have indicated in their death certificates they were diagnosed (with or without test) with COVID-19 and COVID-19 was connected to their cause of death.
* Statistics Sweden reports **4812** people have died in excess to the baseline average deaths that have occurred in the same period in 2015-2019

===

**Please, remember there is lag in reporting and deaths reported on a certain day are usually mostly deaths that happened on previous days. On average it takes up to 11 days to report 90% of the deaths for a certain day (see in the links graphs about how that looks)**

Here’s Dr Fauci’s take on it:

&gt;In an interview with Kaiser Health News published Tuesday, Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, which is composed of research experts that review data from clinical trials, has the power to end the trials early.

&gt;The independent board, Fauci said, could decide ""the data is so good right now that you can say it's safe and effective."" If the clinical trials were to produce results that are overwhelmingly positive, scientists would have a ""moral obligation"" to stop the trial early and make the vaccine available to all participants in the study, speeding up the process to make it more widely available.

&gt;""If you are making a decision about the vaccine, you'd better be sure you have very good evidence that it is both safe and effective,"" Fauci said. He added that he is ""not concerned about political pressure.""

As always, I urge people to listen to [experts respected by their peers](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1242019425135493121) and not dismiss anything from the CDC or FDA right away. The US can still produce (or at least procure) a vaccine that's safe and effective to some degree against COVID-19, even with the administration's interference and the extensive corruption involved.

However, the interference and corruption can absolutely sabotage attempts to gain vital data on a vaccine (a premature EUA, for instance, would jeopardize current and future randomized clinical trials, as people would rather sign up for a guaranteed vaccine rather than a placebo).

And I have serious doubts as to whether this regime can distribute a vaccine efficiently to the people who need it the most.

It also means you already have an established relationship with the healthcare system (as opposed to someone previously healthy who has been forced into seeking treatment). This makes it more likely you'll seek treatment earlier. For example, patients on deep immunosuppression are advised to seek treatment immediately upon getting the flu given the potential for complications.

That said, I think it's fully likely that being on steroids, thus suppressing your immune system, will allow COVID to, in itself, cause stronger symptoms. You will have a tougher time fighting off replication and elimination of the virus, meaning more virus to cause havoc. Unless you're heavily immuno-deficient, though, you'll eventually fight it off even if it does take longer.

Anecdotally, having been on steroids for some years now, I don't find I get the cold more often than those around me but when I do I find it to be worse, and it takes longer for me to get over it than it did before being on steroids.

The images were shared by one of the students on social networks and removed after a few minutes at the express request of their families and students. In the video, two students asked him what his home address was to send him an ambulance. The teacher only managed to answer: ""I can't.""

On August 28, on his Twitter account, De Simone had responded to a post that talked about the difficulties of the coronavirus. “It is very complicated.

This is why I do my own research as you suggested, because you definitely should be researching every statement because often it is incorrect or misleading. 

Here is a better german paper on covid 19 and myocarditis  in 100 patients.  

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2768916

Some conclusions from that article. 

Conclusions and Relevance  In this study of a cohort of German patients recently recovered from COVID-19 infection, CMR revealed cardiac involvement in 78 patients (78%) and ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60 patients (60%), independent of preexisting conditions, severity and overall course of the acute illness, and time from the original diagnosis. These findings indicate the need for ongoing investigation of the long-term cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19.

So nothing definitive as of yet.   The above study of course involves people who had symptoms.   So 60% of which had some signs myocarditis.   But as I tell friends and family.  Why risk it at this time.   We are only 9 months into a novel coronavirus. We know that MERS and SARs has had lasting effects on patients who caught the virus.   Better to be safe than sorry.

Some conclusions from that article. 

Conclusions and Relevance  In this study of a cohort of German patients recently recovered from COVID-19 infection, CMR revealed cardiac involvement in 78 patients (78%) and ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60 patients (60%), independent of preexisting conditions, severity and overall course of the acute illness, and time from the original diagnosis. These findings indicate the need for ongoing investigation of the long-term cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19.

So nothing definitive as of yet.  But as I tell friends and family.  Why risk it at this time.   We are only 9 months into a novel coronavirus. We know that MERS and SARs has had lasting/long term effects on patients who caught the virus.   Better to be safe than sorry.

‘Stress cardiomyopathy. Viral infections can cause cardiomyopathy, a heart muscle disorder that affects the heart’s ability to pump blood effectively. When attacked by a virus, the body undergoes stress and releases a surge of chemicals called catecholamines that can stun the heart. “Once the infection resolves, the stressor has ended and the heart can recover,” Michos says.’

I disagree with your point because it’s ridiculous. We can’t go back to normal as long as people are dying from covid? You realize people do die from the flu and other viruses every year, right? I’m not saying covid is just the flu, but my point is, all we need to do to be able to go back to normal is manage the virus, not eliminate. 

On to your second point, we cannot eradicate the virus. The only possible way is if a vaccine is 100% effective and 100% of the population gets it now and in the future. This virus will continue to circulate the globe. I do think we will have an effective vaccine and I do think it will be effective, but almost no vaccine is 100% and I highly doubt 100% of the population will get the vaccine. 

And your last paragraph doesn’t make any sense, at least the first two sentences. You think in a year or two, we’ll have no more covid deaths ever?

It is likely that it didn't come from a pangolin, but that coronaviruses circulating in horseshoe bats for decades evolved to infect pangolins and now humans.

The idea that ""someone ate a bat"" though is nonsense and always was.

The ""wet"" part of ""wet market"" refers to live animals, so you have live bats in cages with humans coming into contact with them.  It would have been transmitted via respiratory route there as well (although possibly through aerosols breathed in by humans from being around large amounts of bat feces, etc).  Of course the bats are there to eventually be eaten, but a cooked and eaten bat won't spread the virus, or even if you ate it raw (although if it was freshly killed then that's the same thing as being around a live bat).

The specific wet market where we thought this happened is likely not the correct one for where the interspecies hop occurred.  The virus was too well adapted to human spread at that point and its mutations have been relatively minor since then, even given the spread of the pandemic (see for example https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/08/28/2008281117), with the D614G mutation being the only real significant one.

It is likely that it was spreading in Wuhan for weeks before it was first identified.

&lt;speculation mode on&gt;  
I'm kind of guessing that the initial hop to humans happened a month or two earlier.  It then infected a few thousand to ten thousand people in Wuhan evolving to better spread.  Eventually it picked up the ability to ""superspread"" in humans and to acquire an R0 of &gt;3.0 which is where its detection was only going to be a matter of a week or two.  It was probably imported into the wet market, possibly by a human supplier that was infected from another wet market.

If you add the fact that Robert Pattison is a healthy individual with no co-morbidities, then you can safely say that he's going to be 1000% fine. 

Using the USA's average IFR across all age groups is misleading since someone under 40 who is healthy has nothing in common with a 80-year old obese old man. Not to mention that America's health system situation will lead to way more deaths than any other first world nation. 

Each specific age group has a different IFR and if you further segment it to consider co-morbidities you will reach a more specific IFR instead of a vague general one-size-fits-all IFR.

Apperantly not trusting new experimental technology, is the same as wanting people to die. I don't even know how you made that leap of logic.

&gt;You would realise the optimal solution would be to vaccinate high risk groups.

Vaccinating high risk inviduals, to protect them, doesn't work. You also need to vaccinate the people around them. 

&gt;The oxford vaccine that's also heading from approval later this year? 

My god, are you doing this on purpose? Or do you truly not understand the difference between different vaccination technologies? The Oxford vaccine is basically a modified dead cold virus, the american version is an active virus that enters cells to create viral particles that trigger the immune system. No such vaccine has ever been developed for humans. 

&gt;Almost like viruses are adapted to usual human behaviour and prey on the fact we are social creatures.

What!? This is a zoonosis, it ain't adapted to humanity. Frankly it doesn't seem to care what creature it infests. As long as it's a mammal.

&gt;Shame about all the negatives social isolation has on normal human beings that makes your introverted shut in wet dream incredibly problematic long term. 

Wearing masks seems to be bloody freaking hard. It's a global pandemic, how hard is it to not travel for a year. How hard is it too not shake hands with people. At this point, you are defending selfish bastards. 

&gt;This would save thousands, we could then do a larger scale vaccination program next year so long as the data still looks good.

Yes, let's force the high risk inviduals to be guinea pigs for the experimental mRNA vaccine./s

I can't wait for my family to get it. I live in Texas where most of the folks don't want to wear masks and want to continue doing stuff like going out to restaurants and whatnot.

One woman posted a screenshot of how a kidnapper could easily disguise your ""little girl"" as a ""little boy"" because of masking. It was so ridiculous. Like what are the chances your kid is going to be snatched and in that specific way?

There were over 80 replies. Some agreeing. Some disagreeing. And the more arguments I saw, the more I knew we needed that vaccine. Because no matter how much I stay at home and my immediate family stays at home, things are not going to go back to normal until we have the vaccine.

That being said. I doubt I will be among the first to receive it simply because I'm not super rich nor a frontline worker nor in a high risk group.

So, even if I did want it first, I know that I will get a chance to see the news media on the side effects of the vaccine before I receive it.

The majority of the news over there is in guoyu, I doubt many redditors are able to translate this.

Thanks to Taiwan's CDC I knew before WHO wanted to admit:

1. That it is human-to-human
2. That is spreads through airdrops
3. That masks work
4. That testing everyone who enters the country DOES work to limit the spread (instead of just opening the border and doing no screenings at all, no precautions etc).


Taiwan CDC's has been grateful, up-to-date and should be given more recognition.

You mention that US was the biggest funder but fail to mention that the US had no presence in the meetings because Trump removed the US-appointed member. The US had NO influence in the WHO during the outbreak. They had influence previously, until they removed their only US appointed member. 

WHO removed that alternative Chinese medicine heals COVID. Then once they got a 15 mil donation they removed that part, but only on the Chinese domain. Next to this, there are reports that WHO was pressured to NOT classify it into a pandemic yet.

There are so many rules, regulations, and so much oversight that even throwing a party is a huge pain in the ass for us so most of the chapters at our school barely even allow BYOB which has obviously killed that party scene. Hell, like you said, we face real legal consequences even up to losing our house. Meanwhile, parties that start in a dorm are just told to stop. Maybe someone gets in trouble.

I can't imagine that the current covid rules will really change that at my school. The administration was always out to get fraternities.

Greek life is on the downturn and it's really sad.

Excess deaths (from week 13) in Sweden is 6448 but only 5733 is counted as Covid deaths.

UNC Chapel Hill is just one of many universities in the public University of North Carolina system, though it also happens to be the most well known. 

All of the public NC universities were forced to return to campus this fall. This decision was not made by the  individual universities themselves, but rather by the Board of Governors of the UNC system. 

All the individual universities could do was create the best plans possible for mitigation of spread and “off ramps” to use once spread became impossible to stem. The universities have been following those plans and metrics. The fault does not lie with them; it lies squarely on the shoulders of the Board of Governors. 

I highly suggest you check out the scathing letter written to the Board and supported by the editorial staff of several UNC system universities. I have linked it below.

Dog eating happens today. It's not historical it's a modern day reality. It's not everywhere, it's not even ""most people"" in the places where it happens most often, but yes, it happens. Wet markets are full of butchered dogs.  It seems disingenuous to frame something as historical when there's footage of it captured on iphones and uploaded to youtube in HD. 

I agree it's generally arbitrary to decide which animals are okay to eat and which are not. Dogs I think are a particular sore spot because dogs and man have existed together in a close symbiotic relationship since our earliest days. For more than 14,000 years we've deliberately and selectively bred them to love us and to be loyal and obedient. We've lived and worked beside them all this time. We've taken them into our homes and made them members of our families. It'd be strange *not* to be offended by their slaughter.

So.  Only a small percentage of Covid-19 patients died of Covid-19 alone.  Most died of pneumonia, respiratory failure, renal failure, etc.  Obesity and diabetes are also factors that can cause death.  However, if the patient had not caught Covid-19 she probably would have lived a much longer lifespan.  And yet it wasn't technically Covid-19 that killed her, but the other problems that she had?

This goes along with people saying that any and all deaths are being counted as Covid-19 deaths even if the person died of something unrelated to Covid-19, and right now I'm saying that that is backwards, that if patients hadn't caught Covid-19 it's unlikely that they would have died this year.

I keep saying that it's like how AIDS patients didn't die of AIDS, they died of catching diseases that they would have ordinarily shrugged off, or cancers they could have fought off with their immune system if they had an immune system instead of having AIDS.

You then have to qualify all of your test methods on each sample that you will take from throughout the process (chemical assay, bioassays, microbiological assays, etc), to make sure there are not components throughout the process that will disrupt one of your test methods (such as endotoxin testing. A lot of biological components cause enhancement or inhibition and will give invalid results or will give false positives or begatives). You have to do that for a minimum of 3 separate lots to have a qualified test method for each individual step (number of steps depends on the process, but roughly 30 different samples per product is pretty typical).

A few years back, the World Bank started offering something called a Pandemic Bond, which was supposed to help developing countries respond to and get control of pandemic. It could only pay out to these countries when the WHO, specifically, declared that a disease was a pandemic, and not before then. The people who buy this bond get lots of financial benefits during the time the bond is unusued, until the time it ends, when they ALSO get all their money back.

The most recent round of Pandemic Bonds were set to end July of this year. If the WHO had managed to hold off calling Covid a pandemic until then, all the investors would have gotten their profit and their money back, altogther. Obviously, they didn't delay that long, but I know folks were giving the WHO the side-eye over how long they took.

Socialism seeks to abolish direct taxation.

Taxation under capitalism is the result of the state not fulfilling socially necessary production. Some portion of the output of private production is taxed in order to provide incentive for socially necessary production not met by private enterprise, under socialism all production is performed based on social necessity or desire and all productive enterprise is owned in common.

You also have to look at side effects and how serious they are, and which population groups get them.  So is it okay for an elderly person with heart disease to get it?  Is it okay for a middle-aged person with diabetes to get it?  etc.  

Typically, in the trials my company has done, the biostatistics (especially for large trials) takes a long time.

&gt; For COVID-19 vaccines these (Phase 3) trials involve anywhere from 10,000 to 60,000 people and will need a total of about 150 cases of disease to determine whether a candidate works.

Source: https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/here-s-how-us-could-release-covid-19-vaccine-election-and-why-scares-some

The upside here is that we can reach that 150 very quickly due to two things that we rarely have individually, let alone together: 

- The very large testing pool
- The ongoing rapid spread of the virus

What isn't public at this time are the preset numbers that would trigger a success. 

For example, 115 of the cases could be placebo users while 35 are vaccinated, meaning that the success rate (very approximately) could be estimated at 70% -- because ~80 people in the vaccine group appeared to not be infected due to the vaccine versus the control group -- and that either might be good enough evidence, or it might not.

The FDA slightly explains this here, but not in specifics:

&gt; Study sample sizes and timing of interim analyses should be based on the
statistical success criteria for primary and secondary (if applicable) efficacy
analyses and realistic, data-driven estimates of vaccine efficacy and incidence of
COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2 infection) for the populations and locales in which
the trial will be conducted.

There are psychological reasons why a lot of people will not suddenly become care free no matter what happens here. 

The linked NY Times article talks about how prolonged experience with isolation changes people. The longer people are isolated, the more they prefer isolation. Or, I should say, the more socially dysfunctional some become. Being around groups of people will provoke anxiety in a not insignificant number of people. The psychologists in the article say it will take many people time to adapt to life as it was before and that we will need to be patient with ourselves and one another. Some may be permanently changed. 

I don’t know anyone who has sacrificed visits with friends and family, vacations, sports, casual shopping, etc. who is not a little socially withdrawn at this point.

In other words, I wouldn’t worry about mass spread due to the careful people becoming suddenly care free over night. A lot of people have adapted to protect themselves, and it will take time to shed that armor.

Not necessarily, and that's not a good thing.

For the wealthy, private schools will be a great option (of course, they already are); for the middle-class, it will likely be a mixed-bag. For lower-income families, it will almost certainly be a very lacking experience, and will just contribute to their cycle of poverty. That is, of course, exactly what wealthy conservatives want:

1. Defund public education.
2. Cause public education to collapse.
3. Institute a tiered system to education, where you get a worse education the less money you have.

What will be enough for you guys? 

I’m not a fan of how this virus has been politicized. For those who question my beliefs, I have donated to the malarkey dude and currently volunteer for him. 

We need a vaccine to get back to normal. You achieve herd immunity through vaccines. That’s what protects people who aren’t able to get vaccinated. I trust in science. The Phase I/II results for the vaccine front runners are available to read for yourself. I know it’s really dense and can be difficult to read through at times, but the science is pretty clear that these vaccines haven’t shown any abnormal, unexpected, or serious side effects. Visible scientists are talking about how they think having a vaccine candidate by the fall is reasonable. They’re telling us that they will not be politically motivated and that they would link their jobs to their free will. 

So I can read the information on my own AND higher ups will resign if they think the government is fishy? How are people still doubtful to the point where they say they won’t trust any vaccine because of politics?

I was watching MSNBC last night and the guest speaker on Rachel Madow was talking about how we would need tens of millions of people and many years to determine if a vaccine is safe. Exactly how do we do that without the vaccine being approved?  That’s not a trial, it’s a rollout! She was going on and on about how the swine flu vaccine can cause Guillain-Barré and how horrible of a risk that would be. She said it was as common as 1 in 10 million and that we could never have a sample size big enough to account for it. So what is her plan exactly? What’s the exit strategy? Lest we forget that Gullain-Barré can appear after bacterial or viral infections, including Covid! It’s an autoimmune response that we don’t fully understand. 

So I’m genuinely curious here. What will be enough for people? For those of you who won’t trust a vaccine depending on who the president is, what’s your exit strategy?

**It has long been** clear that many who have survived the acute phase of covid-19 have suffered from complications that can cause both long-term and severe symptoms. Exactly how large the group is is unclear, but in the worst case it could be two out of three of those who had both air and oxygen gas and respirator support.

The municipalities and regions are differently equipped to cope with the rehabilitation efforts needed to detect, assess and treat these patients.

\- It can be about cognitive impairment, long-term pain and post-traumatic stress disorder that can affect patients who have had a severe covid-19 infection. For them, it is important that the rehabilitation is adapted based on the current state of knowledge and that we reach out with clear information about this to Sweden's municipalities and regions, says Minister of Social Affairs Lena Hallengren.

**In most regions,** there is a more or less extensive covid rehabilitation. At the University Hospital in Uppsala, it started already 48 hours after the decision on April 9, and so far 130 patients have been treated.

But past August it was closed due to too few patients. It has been perceived as very early when no one still knows how the infection develops during the autumn.

\- We have normalized care and returned to our regular organization. What is lost is the fine collaboration we developed between different specialties. But of course the hospital will continue to carry out rehabilitation, says chief physician Per Hamid Ghatan, who was head of the special rehab department for covid patients.

**He welcomes Thursday's** government decision but at the same time thinks it should have come sooner.

\- The important thing now is to take advantage of all the experiences of the interventions made in the last six months for patients with sometimes very severe complications. Those who had difficulty breathing, clots in the lungs and impaired smell and taste. Or they have suffered from kidney failure, liver problems, had hormonal changes or had gastrointestinal problems. Here it is important that the National Board of Health and Welfare listens and not top management, he says.

**Professor Kristian Borg,** a specialist in rehabilitation medicine at Danderyd Hospital, believes that many who now have long-term complications and symptoms after covid-19 will be very happy.

\- I know that there is a Facebook group with 11,000 members who are fighting for a good covid rehabilitation. Many have severe symptoms and others have recurring symptoms of an infection that comes and goes. Today, we do not always know exactly what we are going to do, but it is excellent if the National Board of Health and Welfare receives such an assignment, says Kristian Borg.",,1599217360,{},g3yv136,True,t3_imdwf4,False,True,t3_imdwf4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/imdwf4/sweden_new_efforts_for_rehab_should_have_come/g3yv136/,1599217372,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

It's probably because it wouldn't work there, since the labor laws are so different. In Sweden you get paid by the state if your kids are sick and you have to stay home to take care if them. You have paid sick leave and you can't be fired for being sick (almost by nothing else either compared to the US/some states). This was normal before the virus, and now all those things are even easier/better, like doctors note from day 21 instead of 7 and you are encourage to stay home with even the slightest symtom. Joining unemployment insurance were also sped up a a lot, need six months, but now every month count as two, and the payout is also larger. Companies can also furlough staff, for example work 80% less with a 12% reduced pay and the state pays 60% (the highest allowed), so people could also stay home and work a little without loosing their jobs. All this made it possible to do physical distancing.

For this to work in the US, they would first have to implement these basic labor protections, which would probably be the largest reform in history, in Sweden they was just enhanced.",,1599217245,{},g3yuuxt,False,t3_imbpd6,False,True,t1_g3yocjw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/imbpd6/2_500_randomly_tested_in_sweden_no_one_had_covid19/g3yuuxt/,1599217256,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

You clearly are

&gt;Your petty and prissy self taking the time to downvote these comments that you had to go deep into a silly thread to even find--I don't know what emotion you're feeling, but I suspect you're feeling way too much of it.

I didn't go looking for them, I was reading reddit and found them. The fact that you think I'm petty and prissy for pointing out that collecting insults for future encounters is lame, is very telling.

&gt;I think the phrase is funny. I still think the phrase is funny. I think I'm funny, too, and I think the sippy cup thing is funny.

Yes, I'm aware.

&gt; [u/alabamdiego](https://www.reddit.com/u/alabamdiego/) and I are conversing in a very different tone than you are, and you've decided that means we're angry. I think it means we're having more fun than you are.

I'm not talking about him, I'm talking about you, and clearly I'm pointing out that I can tell you're angry because you're collecting insults against future perceived threats.

&gt;Accusing everyone of anger just because they're not using the same conversational style you are is no more helpful to ""solving the cultural divide"" than any condescending phrase.

This is some classic postmodern linguistic crap. I'm not accusing everyone of being angry, you accused me of being angry first and I'm pointing out that it's you who is clearly angry. The fact that you characterize your attitude as a ""conversation style"" and try to equate it with me calling you out is again, telling.  

&gt;It's reductive and divisive. Why bother? You're not solving any problems and you just sound supremely sensitive and un-fun. How do you even survive on reddit, with people constantly joking about everything?

DPRK scary, so bad clearly can’t be socialism because it’s so scary and bad.

Here is how the DPRK manages labor:

----

&gt; **The Taean Work System**

&gt; The industrial management system developed in three distinct 
stages. The first stage was a period of enterprise autonomy that 
lasted until December 1946. The second stage was a transitional 
system based on local autonomy, with each enterprise managed 
by the enterprise management committee under the direction of 
the local people's committee. This system was replaced by the ""one- 
man management system,"" with management patterned along 
Soviet lines as large enterprises were nationalized and came un- 
der central control. The third stage, the Taean Work System (see 
Glossary), was introduced in December 1961 as an application and 
refinement of agricultural management techniques to industry. The 
Taean industrial management system grew out of the Chongsan- 
ni Method. 

&gt; The highest managerial authority under the Taean system is the 
party committee. Each committee consists of approximately twenty- 
five to thirty-five members elected from the ranks of managers, workers, engineers, and the leadership of ""working people's or- 
ganizations"" at the factory. A smaller ""executive committee,"" 
about one-fourth the size of the regular committee, has practical 
responsibility for day-to-day plant operations and major factory 
decisions. The most important staff members, including the party 
committee secretary, factory manager, and chief engineer, make 
up its membership. The system focuses on cooperation among 
workers, technicians, and party functionaries at the factory level. 

&gt; Each factory has two major lines of administration, one headed 
by the manager, the other by the party committee secretary. A chief 
engineer and his or her assistants direct a general staff in charge 
of all aspects of production, planning, and technical guidance. De- 
pending on the size of the factory, varying numbers of deputies 
oversee factory logistics, marketing, and workers' services. The 
supply of materials includes securing, storing, and distributing all 
materials for factory use, as well as storing finished products and 
shipping them from the factory. 

&gt; Deputies are in charge of assigning workers to their units and 
handling factory accounts and payroll. Providing workers' services 
requires directing any farming done on factory lands, stocking fac- 
tory retail shops, and taking care of all staff amenities. Deputies 
in charge of workers' services are encouraged to meet as many of 
the factory's needs as possible using nearby agricultural coopera- 
tives and local industries. 

&gt; The secretary of the party committee organizes all political ac- 
tivities in each of the factory party cells and attempts to ensure 
loyalty to the party's production targets and management goals. 
According to official claims, all management decisions are arrived 
at by consensus among the members of the party committee. Given 
the overwhelming importance of the party in the country's affairs, 
it seems likely that the party secretary has the last say in any major 
factory disputes. 

&gt; The Taean system heralded a more rational approach to indus- 
trial management than that practiced previously. Although party 
functionaries and workers became more important to management 
under the new system, engineers and technical staff also received 
more responsibility in areas where their expertise could contrib- 
ute the most. The system recognizes the importance of material as 
well as ""politico-moral"" incentives for managing the factory workers. 
The ""internal accounting system,"" a spin-off of the ""independent 
accounting system,"" grants bonuses to work teams and workshops 
that use raw materials and equipment most efficiendy. These finan- 
cial rewards come out of enterprise profits. 

&gt; A measure of the success of the Taean Work System is its lon- 
gevity and its continued endorsement by the leadership. In his 1991 
New Year's address marking the thirtieth anniversary of the crea- 
tion of the system, Kim II Sung said that the ""Taean work system 
is the best system of economic management. It enables the producer 
masses to fulfill their responsibility and role as masters and to 
manage the economy in a scientific and rational manner by im- 
plementing the mass line in economic management, and by com- 
bining party leadership organically with administrative, economic, 
and technical guidance.""

&gt;Canada and Australia are not really meaningful comparisons.

I disagree.  The point is large areas without necessarily extensive travel between urban areas.  In any event, no developed country had such a quick succession of other waves b/c no country with major outbreaks somewhere was stupid enough not to do a broad lockdown.  UK started down the path like the US, but quickly pivoted.  Sweden tried as well, albeit they didn't have a major outbreak before testing was more widely available.

Comparing to developing countries with a fraction of economic resources is nonsense.  We know this is disproportionately impacting poor areas in the US, obviously they are not a meaningful benchmark for comparison.

&gt;How Long Does a Phase 3 Clinical Trial Take?

&gt;The length of study for phase 3 clinical trials is usually 1 to 4 years. This phase involves 300 to 3,000 patients, with tests designed to determine the drug's longer-term effects.

Insurify’s data science team referred  to publicly-accessible data to determine the states whose K-12 teacher  populations’ health and safety are at the highest risk due to COVID-19  this fall. They evaluated each state across three dimensions: **public school infrastructure** (school crowding, funding per student), **teachers** (teacher age, teacher union influence, teacher salary, substitute teacher salary), and **healthcare quality and readiness to reopen safely**  (healthcare quality, recent changes in COVID-19 case counts and death  counts, ICU bed availability, COVID-19 testing capacity, and daily  COVID-19 cases per capita).

Statistics on school crowding and  funding per student were gathered from the National Center for Education  Statistics’ latest release of the Digest of Education Statistics.  Teacher age data were collected from the National Center of Education  Statistics’ Schools and Staffing Survey, while teacher pay data came  from the National Education Association. Teacher union data was gathered  from the Thomas B. Fordham Institute’s Teacher Union Strength Report.  Overall healthcare quality by state was determined using the U.S. News  and World Report’s state rankings, which ranked each state on ease of  healthcare access, healthcare quality, and public health. Percent  changes in COVID-19 case counts and death counts for each state (as of  August 21) were retrieved from the State of the Outbreak Report  published by Reuters. Data on ICU bed availability, COVID-19 testing  capacity, and daily COVID-19 cases per capita were collected from  Vox.   

Given that a dollar goes further in  some states than it does in others (the cost of living varies  significantly state by state, due to differences in the price of  housing, goods, and services), all salary and funding data in this study  were adjusted using the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ regional price  parities index. 

From these statistics, a weighted  composite score out of 100 was calculated for each state. Higher  composite scores were indicative of safer states for teachers during the  pandemic, while lower composite scores were indicative of states that  were less safe for teachers during the pandemic.

Ivermectin proposes many potentials effects to treat a range of diseases, with its antimicrobial, antiviral, and anti-cancer properties as a wonder drug. It is highly effective against many microorganisms including some viruses. In this comprehensive systematic review, **antiviral effects of ivermectin are summarized including in vitro and in vivo studies over the past 50 years. Several studies reported antiviral effects of ivermectin on RNA viruses such as Zika, dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Hendra, Newcastle, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, chikungunya, Semliki Forest, Sindbis, Avian influenza A, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome, Human immunodeficiency virus type 1**, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Furthermore, there are some studies showing antiviral effects of ivermectin against DNA viruses such as Equine herpes type 1, BK polyomavirus, pseudorabies, porcine circovirus 2, and bovine herpesvirus 1. Ivermectin plays a role in several biological mechanisms, therefore it could serve as a potential candidate in the treatment of a wide range of viruses including COVID-19 as well as other types of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. In vivo studies of animal models revealed a broad range of antiviral effects of ivermectin, however, clinical trials are necessary to appraise the potential efficacy of ivermectin in clinical setting.",,1599247280,{},g4119sm,False,t3_imlse9,False,True,t1_g40xl0u,/r/Coronavirus/comments/imlse9/miami_herald_should_a_decadesold_lice_medication/g4119sm/,1599254740,2,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

More seriously, it amazes me that Russia and other countries arent more ruthless in some of this stuff.

It would have been much faster, cheaper, and easier for the country to find a few dozen people and give them the job of cleaning the place for an 8-hour shift for one day, knowing that their body will begin falling apart and they won't be able to work the next day, and will die a few days after.
