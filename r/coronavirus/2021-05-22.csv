My confusion started a few days ago, when I was poking around the US Census Bureau site and was floored by this page, which says that 74.6% of Americans over 18 have received at least one shot of the vaccine: https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/household-pulse-survey-covid-19-vaccination-tracker.html

I thought this had to be wrong, but when I go to www.covidactnow.org (which I consider reliable), and divide the number of vaccinated people (159,834,407) by the US population over 18 (	209,128,094), it indeed works out to that percentage.

This confused me for two reasons.  First, we‚Äôre all focused now on whether we will meet the President‚Äôs goal of vaccinating 70% of adults by July - doesn‚Äôt this suggest we‚Äôve already met that goal? Or is that goal a fully vaccinated number? News articles I‚Äôve read continuously say this goal is one dose for 70% of American adults, so to me the only way to reconcile the two is that either I‚Äôm missing something, there is something wrong with the census data above, or the news reporting is wrong.  

Second, a lot of articles are touting that we‚Äôve only hit 48% total vaccinations. If we are at 48% overall, but 74.6% over 18, doesn‚Äôt that imply that it is just that a disproportionate number of people under 18 aren‚Äôt being vaccinated (which would make sense given (i) only one vaccine was authorized this crowd, (ii) it was only authorized about two weeks ago, and (ii) even then it‚Äôs only 12 and up)?

Personally, what you call ""weird elitism"" is for me a very important ideal. The issue isn't so much that the J&amp;J vaccine isn't good, it absolutely is. The issue is that scientists are essentially lying. Remember when scientists said that masks didn't help, and then it appeared that they only said that to discourage hoarding? Remember how much that undermined public trust and how much damage that did for people who were on the fence? This is potentially that all over again only worse. The importance of this is not about this time, it's about the next time we have a pandemic, people will have an unfortunately valid reason to not believe the scientists, which is very bad long term.

I'm fine with the arguments that J&amp;J is good enough and that you should get the first vaccine offered to you - I certainly did. The biggest issue for me is the argument that we can't compare efficacies between vaccines. This is complete propaganda, as we do compare efficacies all the time - we compare them to a bar of 50% to see if they work. It is true that comparing efficacies is a hard problem and that you have to take factors into account and that small differences in numbers don't matter. However, what I'm seeing is the argument that because it is a hard problem, then we should throw away all the data we have and not bother comparing vaccines. To me, this seems a false argument meant to discourage vaccine shopping, instead of real science.

The other issue I have is that it doesn't seem that they are releasing data on the breakthrough cases by vaccine type.

A lot of completely normal people are afraid of vaccines because there is a massive difference in the amount of energy required to making and spread misinformation compared to doing proper research while trying to avoid bias. It‚Äôs a huge investment of time and energy just to be able to tell someone ‚Äúyour fears are unfounded‚Äù, because they can make up anything to support their beliefs. 

It‚Äôs so easy and normal to ridicule them because to people who don‚Äôt have those fears the logic appears childish. Unfortunately ‚Äúnuh uh!‚Äù Won‚Äôt make a fearful person less afraid, and ridiculing them only entrenches the idea that the person attacking them is ‚Äúa big meany‚Äù. No one likes to listen to or consider the opinions of a person who they perceive is being mean to them. 

The best way to combat fear is not to ridicule or lambast the person who is fearful. It is much better to shine a very bright light on the fear itself, thereby revealing the fear to be baseless or the source to be minuscule. Without that revealing light people will retain beliefs formed in fearful ignorance. The best way to reveal the issues with those ignorance based beliefs is also to shine a bright light on them and reveal that they are baseless or fundamentally flawed.

No, not really.  Vaccinations in January were also going out to healthcare workers.

It wasn't until February and March that we saw the older populations race above the younger populations.  The gap by February still would have been murky to see in the data.

But if you look at single dose data in early to mid March?  (That would be when you'd need to be vaccinated by to avoid a hospitilization in April.  Two weeks for immunity to set in and then another ~5~10 days for when most people get hospitilized after contracting it)  There, in March is when you see staggering differences in the age demographics.


Hospilization data also can get goofed by triage.  Hospitals will take less severe cases now than in Nov/Dec/Jan due to lower availability concerns.

Taiwan is dealing with a spike in cases after months of keeping the pandemic well under control, with restrictions in place across the island to limit gatherings.

On Saturday and Sunday, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung announced a total of 570 new cases whose positive tests had not been included in previous reports due to reporting delays following thesurge in cases.¬†

Chen said they were working to resolve the ""traffic jam"" problem by simplifying the reporting system and adding more machines that can perform quicker and more accurate tests.

""I believe that we will quickly be able to resolve this systemic issue.""

He added this week would be a crucial one in terms of observing how well the virus was being brought under control, with the peak day for cases being seen last Monday.

Chen has said the ""regression calibration"" of case numbers was needed to more accurately reflect the state of infections.

But the move has gone down poorly with Taiwan's opposition parties, who say Chen is inventing words and spreading fear.

""Today the command centre created a new expression, 'regression calibration', adding 400 new infections,"" Johnny Chiang, chairman of the main opposition party the Kuomintang, wrote on his Facebook page late on Saturday.

""This information has terrified everyone, as the daily numbers being received were inaccurate.""

The small Taiwan People's Party, led by Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je, called on the government not to engage in ""cognitive warfare"", riffing off accusations Taiwan has levelled at China about spreading propaganda and misinformation.

Ko said the rise in tests and infections was causing delays in reporting numbers to the central government for collation, but added the reporting system needed improving, rather than ""creating new expressions"".

The term ""regression calibration"" has also caused some amusement online, and black humour.

In one joke, a woman asks her boyfriend how many girlfriends he has had before, to which he replies ""just you"".

""After getting married, with regression calibration I'd had about 50.""

I sleep wonderfully every other day of the year, yet I always have difficulties sleeping the night before the draw.

I take two Xanax to help get me in the car, and two once I get to the office; it helps a lot, but doesn't stop the panic.

Each has shown clear differences vs control (no vaccine) but because all the underlying variables are quite different we cannot directly compare the results from the differing trials. 

The J&amp;J study almost certainly involved more variant infections for example, which would go a long way in explaining it's lower efficacy figures.

With cases dropping about 20% a week for the past several weeks, and vaccination rates plateauing, I believe looking at week over week changes are more important than daily changes. Others have been posting daily overall updates for age groups, and other than the recent jump in 12-15 vaccinations, there's not much recent change in vaccinations rates between various age groups.

They have been able to administer a first dose to more than 3% of the unvaccinated population in eligible age groups each week, even in groups with a high number of vaccinated people. I expect that public health officials in different jurisdictions will be able to see what works in other regions to continue to improve vaccination rates over time.

In these counties, we found that for every 100 deaths directly assigned to COVID-19 in official statistics, an additional 20 deaths occurred that were not counted as direct COVID-19 deaths.  
The proportion of excess deaths not counted as direct COVID-19 deaths was even higher in counties with lower average socioeconomic status, counties with more comorbidities, and counties in the South and West.

After **1st dose** of either Pfizer or AstraZeneca, protection is 33% from symptomatic disease for the Indian variant and 51% for the British variant.

After **2nd dose**, Pfizer efficacy increased to 88% for Indian variant(!), 93% for British variant.

1) Variants. Most of their cases were probably the UK variant and their data looked weaker than other mRNA vaccines already on the market. They announced a while back they wanted more data on variants, and this was probably to have an explanation for a lower efficacy. 

2) participant drop out. As people started being offered approved vaccines they were given the option to drop out of the trial. That means that the older participants, the ones who really matter, were offered approved doses earliest and could've been dropping out within a few weeks of their second injections. Without robust data in older age groups they had to start up trials in Latin America.

I kind of barely remember it with how bad it was, but I have the general memory of ‚Äúoh, fuck this, this is god awful.‚Äù Missed my friend‚Äôs graduation too, but what can you do? 

A lot of folks I know had a bad time for a few hours or a day and then felt fine, but with how easily I get hit *hard* with colds I wasn‚Äôt surprised at all with how hard I got knocked down from it. Just trying to plan ahead for shot 2. 

It‚Äôs worth it though. In February of 2020 I got so sick I really thought I was going to die. I physically couldn‚Äôt move- like LITERALLY had to be carried room to room. I couldn‚Äôt even speak. I just laid there in pain and cried for a few weeks while the fever raged and my throat was swollen. Doctor had no clue what was wrong with me once I managed to get to one and said it was ‚Äújust some respiratory illness.‚Äù They told me to go to the ER if the fever got really bad again, but by that point I was on the mend and over the counter medicines were actually working. Looking back, it was almost definitely COVID. I wouldn‚Äôt wish that on anyone, it was terrifying. And I‚Äôm a young person, and at the time I was exercising regularly. My heart was good. But that really took a toll on me. My mom had it at the time too and I‚Äôm amazed she survived, it took her months to get back on her feet.

So if getting sick for three days... or feeling unwell for a while... if that means preventing someone from hurting like that, then it‚Äôs worth it.  I don‚Äôt want to feel that close to death again.

It is very true that we cannot compare efficacy \*easily\* and that we should keep the differences in mind. However, 95% is so different from 77% that the difference is highly unlikely to be from differences in testing methodology. Moreover, efficacy is the only way we have to compare these vaccines. If we threw out efficacy numbers just because they are ""hard to compare"", then we may as well not compare them against the 50% number that we've been using to determine if they are worth using, because that comparison would be invalid as well.

To add to that, by now real world observations can be made that can actually compare these vaccines in the wild. And yet, I've seen almost no one give the breakthrough details on what vaccines the virus is breaking through Instead, all I can get is the vague quote from the CDC that ""To date, no unexpected patterns have been identified"". Reading between the lines, my guess is that an expected pattern of J&amp;J being worse has been identified but that they are keeping quiet about this. I really hope I'm wrong though.

To add to this, even with this view, my family and I got the J&amp;J vaccine. We had a chance to get it about a month before we could get any other vaccine, and I knew we had some upcoming medical appointments and I wanted us to be vaccinated for them. J&amp;J isn't bad at all, as one person said, it is basically A tier while the mRNA ones are S tier. Additionally, the one argument that I do think is correct with J&amp;J is that the efficacy seems to rise over time, with one tweet indicating that waiting 8 weeks instead of 2 might get it up to the efficacy of the mRNA vaccines. However, there are almost no details about this, and as someone used to reading the actual data behind things, it is very frustrating that no one is releasing the data that I could use to come to my own conclusions about J&amp;J. If anyone has actual data about how J&amp;J is doing in the real world, I'd love to see it, and I am sure hope that I am wrong about my guess that the CDC is lying through omission about J&amp;J.",,,1621739010,{'gid_1': 1},gz4h01x,False,t3_nit1sr,False,False,t1_gz4bs3t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nit1sr/covid19_pfizer_vaccine_nearly_90_effective/gz4h01x/,1621824571,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

&gt;‚ÄúNACI recommends that the vaccine series be completed with the same COVID-19 vaccine product when possible. If the vaccine product used for a previously received dose is not known, or not available, attempts should be made to complete the vaccine series with a similar type of COVID-19 vaccine,‚Äù according to a statement released Friday.

&gt;For example, the committee says a vaccination series started with a mRNA vaccine should be completed with another mRNA vaccine and the series should not be restarted. By contrast, NACI said if a second dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is unavailable it could be supplemented with the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs Janssen vaccine.

&gt;‚ÄúIn the event that an individual receives one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine and is unable to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine for the second dose, one dose of Janssen vaccine (if available) can be used as the second dose to complete the vaccine series,‚Äù the statement reads.

In India you have an overburdened health system with doctors who are both overworked and unfamiliar with administrating the type of steroid treatment to fight multi-systemic inflammations. Fungal infections can also spread more easily by a lack of proper routines for infections control in the hospital, which is another thing a strained healthcare system might be slipping on.

If you are immunosuppressed you might be vulnerable to opportunistic fungal infections. But this is unrelated to COVID19. You are just as vulnerable as you were before the pandemic. Unless you get severely ill in COVID19 and receive an improperly administrated steroid treatment.

&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) \_ ***President Reagan*** is under heavy pressure from doctors, drug makers and parents to sign legislation that would bypass the courts and set up a federal fund for children injured by vaccinations.  
Approved by Congress just before adjournment, the measure results from a ***nationwide campaign in 1978*** that ushered in strict enforcement of state laws requiring immunization. It also resulted in increased injuries to children.

Many games give you ranks on certain tasks: A, B, C, D, so on, similar to grades in school. However, if you do extremely well, then many games give you a (sometimes secret) rank of S tier that is a rank above A tier.

As far as the vaccines, an A tier vaccine would be one that could safely end the pandemic. If you told everyone at the start of the pandemic that we'd have J&amp;J in a year there would be cheering in the streets. Compare this to the flu vaccine, which I'd call B or C tier - efficient enough to save lives but not enough to get to herd immunity to protect people who didn't get the vaccine. So the mRNA ones seem like they might be better than J&amp;J, but J&amp;J is already enough to end the pandemic.

I don't believe that they (Vermont) are ignoring CDC guidance.  Like, where's this CDC guidance that says that states should immediately terminate all mask mandates?

CDC guidance VERY clearly says that those that are unvaccinated should continue to wear masks.  Since Vermont is well aware that people will abuse an honor system, they've chosen to keep everyone masked.  That's not ""ignoring the science.""

We're basically in a grey area where one can, in bad faith, argue that both lifting mask mandates and keeping mask mandates are both ""ignoring the science"" because either way you'll have some group of the population having the wrong mask configuration.  Lift the mask mandates and unvaccinated people will be unmasked.  Keep the mask mandates and vaccinated people will be masked.

Neither one is really ""ignoring the science,"" it's just a decision: Do you want unvaccinated people unmasked or vaccinated people masked?

Because the vast majority of countries do not accept it for travelling or attending large events, but they do accept it for sending the plebs back to work. Either the demand for PCR tests has nothing to do with safety and is just to make travelling or large events unfeasible while not explicitly banning them, or lateral flow tests are not accurate enough and governments are being reckless on using them as evidence people are ""fit to work"". They are being dishonest at least once here.

Second, more than half of the UK is vaccinated with at least one dose. Why should they keep the paranoia on with two largely useless tests per week? Why they develop policy under the assumption vaccines do not work despite massive real life evidence saying the opposite? Are we going to make mandatory PCR and Antigen test permanent ""just in case""? 

Third, the correlation between positive tests and the numbers that really matter, deaths and hospitalizations, has vastly changed even with partial vaccination and there has been no change in their policy to address it. If anything, they get more panicky over a positive test now than one year ago.

&gt;Germany has 3 times as many confirmed cases whilst testing more than 4 times less than the UK. that‚Äôs about a 12 times higher incidence in covid

Obviously this requires uniformity assumptions but I can't find anything on prevalence estimates for Germany. I expect it's more on the generous side for Germany considering other approximations show even bigger differences such as 33 times greater test positivity, and 19 times greater 3% adjusted case rates (I cannot find the methodology for this latter one though).

Regardless, the logic of the analysis is simple. The UK has a Covid prevalence that is 12 times less (generous) than Germany's. However, the % of these cases that are the Indian variant are 12 times greater in the UK.  Thus, the percentage of each population that is harbouring the Indian variant is the same. 

Let me explain this with an example:

Say the UK has 100 cases of coronavirus. That means Germany has 1200 (pop adjusted of course). 24% of the UK's cases are Indian, so there are 24 cases of the Indian variant in the UK overall. 2% of Germany's cases are Indian, so Germany also has 24 cases of the Indian variant.

There are multiple reasons for why the US has chosen a different model, including vaccine hesitancy - the UK has more people willing to take the vaccine so they can do it in the effective order instead of opening for everyone and hoping someone takes it. It's great for the &lt;30 folks in the US, but it will result in more people dead than going in age order.

As for the gap, remember they did not try multiple gaps between doses and find 3/4 weeks the best, they chose a short gap so the trials would finish on time. That was a good idea as the results were needed asap, but now later results are showing that longer is better for [Pfizer](

Regardless of this, my family and I got vaccinated with J&amp;J as we had an opportunity several weeks before we could have gotten vaccinated otherwise. J&amp;J is still a fantastic vaccine and I think the best summary is that J&amp;J seems A tier while the mRNA ones seem S tier. I'm also interested in arguments that J&amp;J seems to get more effective over time.

I would love real world data to see if J&amp;J seems to be as effective as the mRNA ones, but no one is sharing that data. Instead, the CDC says that ""no unexpected patterns have emerged"". Reading between the lines, it sure seems like J&amp;J is less effective but that they are going to lie through omission to encourage vaccine use and suppress any data that would reveal how J&amp;J is compared to the other vaccines. I believe that the facts should stand on their own and that they will likely show that J&amp;J is an amazing vaccine but that the mRNA ones are even better.

It's not a have it and not need it thing. Viruses mutate. That's what they do. Covid, Mers, the flu, they all do at different rates. So, if a virus mutates enough in a certain way then your body cannot recognise it anymore. That's why there is a new flu vaccine every year. The flu mutates fast so in one year, your body cannot recognise it anymore and you no longer have immunity. This is what they are preparing for. 

The USA is getting better because of vaccines. If the vaccines stop working it will get worse. To make sure the vaccines do not stop working, they are making boosters. It is not an if. It is a when. Viruses mutate. It is what they do as long as they are allowed to survive. 

And I want to be very clear: this one will be allowed to survive. Not because of anti maskers or anti vaxxers but because it can JUMP SPECIES. covid 19 is a mutated version of SARS from the early 2000s. Covid is also known as SARS-CoV-2 for this reason. WE as a species (humans) eradicated it in our population. Not the world. It fucked off into bats mutated then came back. So we need to be prepared with boosters and protocols and all being on the same goddamn page about this.

1) We tend to have little information on how a lot of diseases started for many years due to the time it takes to sift through the sheer amount of data that is involved. There is still debate about where the flu strain originated from that caused the 1918 pandemic.

2) That has been going on for over a decade. Taking advantage of a disaster does not point to them causing the disaster. 

3) Governments sterilized SPECIFIC populations and are actually doing this to imprisoned people to this day without having to do anything that hidden. This is the most glaringly flawed point in that this vaccine is being given to all races and classes and that privileged people definitely got it before other folks in some states.

4) As someone who seems so keyed into history, I'm surprised you have this so wrong. The study involved lying to the men about what was being treated and just seeing what would happen if they weren't treated. The researchers concealed positive syphilis status from subjects and even had a control group of uninfected individuals. The best treatment for the disease was discovered DURING the study and they continued to refuse to stop the study and treat the infected men.

It was weird. I asked him if he was almost done. He said it would be a little longer. I had had plenty of time to chat with him whilst he tried to remove the broken off needle from my arm. 

I‚Äôve never had a vaccination like that. Didn‚Äôt realize what happened until a friend sent this article. 

I had caught a shard of glass in my thumb a few days before, in the garden. The similarity to the sensation and aftermath of a very sore site (plus the arm was bleeding way more than is typical for a shot) is a dead giveaway. 

My first shot was with a syringe with retracting needle. It was much quicker and there wasn‚Äôt a line in the cvs on that day. 

I can‚Äôt imagine how stressful it must have been for him to try to vaccinate all these people and have to retrieve loose needles from a random sampling. 

I wonder why they used plain needles from China at cvs for early May shots when they had used fancy retractable ones early in April. And what cvs charged my insurance company.

&gt;But, she continued, one also must ""**think about people in the community who either can't get vaccinated, like kids who don't have the option yet who are younger than 12, or who might be immunocompromised, and in whom we don't have great data on vaccine efficacy yet**.""

&gt;The IDSA, the largest infectious diseases society in the U.S., issued a much more tempered statement on May 17, generally saying that the CDC's new guidance ""should not send the message that the pandemic is over.""

&gt;But when speaking with the media Thursday, the society's officials didn't hold back.

&gt;There's still reason to be extremely cautious, Marrazzo said. ""Can you go to your favorite large bin store and not wear a mask? If you're fully vaccinated and you have no other conditions that compromise your immunity, and the rates of COVID are relatively low where you live and the vaccination coverage is high, I would be 100% fine pretty much going anywhere without a mask.""

&gt;However, one must consider many other factors in calculating risk.

&gt;""Remember, we are a global community,"" she continued, noting that only a small portion of the global population has received at least one shot.
