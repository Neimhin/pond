Belgium has applied 109.6 doses per 100 people, the Netherlands 106.6, Spain has applied 105.9 

It does not seem significative. Further, this is really impressive of Spain, which has a much much larger area and some parts of it are really empty. Belgium, or the Netherlands or Denmark getting their vaccination speeds fast and efficient, come on that is easy for them. Belgium has got 12 million people in a 30 k km^2 area, a lot of spanish regions are much bigger. Just googled and Castile and Leon area is 94k km^2 and has 2.5 million people in many many isolated villages.

Further Spain seems to be in a much better position regarding likely final vaccination numbers. They got literally 100% of the over 80s fully vaccinated

https://vaccinetracker.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/vaccine-tracker.html#age-group-tab

Belgium seems to think 86.9% of the over 80s with one dose is good enough.  Spain is still vaccinating strictly by age group, and has higher vaccination rates among the elderly - this will help a lot with ICUs 

so in short, do not be too impressed by belgian or dutch numbers.

The issue with the CDC dropping mask mandates is very few businesses made it a point to ensure that those who were without masks *actually got vaccinated.* That's why we're seeing an uptick in the U.S.: anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers saw this as a free pass to throw the mask away, and now those with poor health conditions have to worry *even more* about their health and safety.

To sort of tag onto what the other poster said: evolution happens with random mutations. Heritable variations are retained over time if those mutations don't harm the virus' chance of surviving long enough to be passed to new hosts.

The vaccines cause your immune system to kill the virus off before it can replicate very much‚Äîmost frequently noticing and killing it off before you even have enough of the virus in your system to develop symptoms.  As such, within individuals themselves there is less opportunity for the virus to replicate and thus mutate. Since individuals are many times less likely to pass the virus to other people, as people are vaccinated the reduction becomes exponential

The herd immunity threshold increases as the R0 of the virus increases (as it has with the variants of concern) and when efficacy of vaccines/immunity from infection with a prior strain drops. So after a certain point in uptake, in countries with widespread vaccination we'll see COVID Classic‚Ñ¢ die off and only vaccine-efficacy-reducing strains remaining.

Obviously, in some cases this is true; the CDC has a lot of power in areas like transportation (especially air travel, but also cruises, trains, and buses). 

As you point out, they have no direct power in areas like mask use in areas like state and local government buildings, grocery stores, and other retail environments. I think they would be further ahead to use language that would make it more clear that they are making recommendations. 

But I think that saying that there is no penalty for ignoring CDC guidance is a bit disingenuous. Local governments heavily rely on CDC guidance to make their local rules, which are enforced. This is the primary role of the CDC and main reason that it is dangerous when people stop believing what they say. 

And to be clear, I was an advocate of mandatory mask wearing indoors up until vaccines became readily available to all eligible adults and teenagers. I don't have any problem with doing what is necessary to maintain our community's health, but I don't really see that fully vaccinated people wearing masks to protect people who have refused to get vaccinated fits into that bucket.

In April 1955, soon after mass polio vaccination began in the US, the Surgeon General began to receive reports of patients who contracted paralytic polio about a week after being vaccinated with Salk polio vaccine from the¬†[Cutter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutter_Laboratories)¬†pharmaceutical company, with the paralysis limited to the limb the vaccine was injected into. The Cutter vaccine had been used in vaccinating 200,000 children in the western and midwestern United States.[[76]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine#cite_note-MC1383764-76)¬†Later investigations showed that the Cutter vaccine had caused 40,000 cases of polio, killing 10.[[76]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine#cite_note-MC1383764-76)¬†In response the Surgeon General pulled all polio vaccines made by Cutter Laboratories from the market, but not before 250 cases of paralytic illness had occurred. Wyeth polio vaccine was also reported to have paralyzed and killed several children. It was soon discovered that some lots of Salk polio vaccine made by Cutter and Wyeth had not been properly inactivated, allowing live poliovirus into more than 100,000 doses of vaccine. In May 1955, the National Institutes of Health and Public Health Services established a Technical Committee on Poliomyelitis Vaccine to test and review all polio vaccine lots and advise the Public Health Service as to which lots should be released for public use. These incidents reduced public confidence in polio vaccine, leading to a drop in vaccination rates.[[77]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine#cite_note-Juskewitch2010-77)",,,,1626667481,{},h5prip8,False,t3_on0m1j,False,False,t3_on0m1j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/on0m1j/fauci_us_might_still_have_polio_if_media_back/h5prip8/,1626826690,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Here is the reality: masks help, but they aren‚Äôt a magic shield that will prevent people from getting COVID. If there were no vaccines and we simply relied on masks, eventually everyone would contract the virus and seroconvert; it would just be a question of whether or not the person was lucky enough to be asymptomatic and develop a mild infection or was unfortunate and develop severe COVID. 

That‚Äôs pretty much the path we are on anyway because people won‚Äôt take the damn vaccines. We could install a permanent national mask mandate and it would just prolong the inevitable. Vaccines are the only way to truly save lives.

This is the big part. When it maims people, but leaves them alive, every single person who is maimed acts as a reason for others to take it seriously.

For covid, the media wasn't allowed to show all the bodies of everyone dying, of everyone on ventilators, etc, for obvious patient privacy reasons, but I think it would have done a lot of good to show just how awful covid is for people who are hospitalized. I think we should have been showed all the morgues and trucks full to capacity with bodies, the mass graves dug on that island in New York, etc.

People need to see reality to know how to deal with it. We here in Korea took it seriously, so even now it's not that bad even though it's the worst its ever been right now.

There is no actual scientific evidence for this claim whatsoever.

The short answer is that we don't know.  The clinical trials used 3 weeks between doses for Pfizer and 4 weeks for Moderna.   The UK went for 12 weeks between doses in order to get more people with first doses quicker (a strategy that was very logical at the time given data showing a single dose could provide up to 70% benefit, but one that seems less optimal now with the Delta variant that pretty much requires both doses to be effective).

Also why do these shitty articles never link directly to the paper, so annoying.

here is the actual study, https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.28.21259420v1.full.pdf

It states that the effectiveness of the vaccines is as low as ~44% for one dose and as low as ~64% for two doses of pfizer (these being the lower bounds of the 95% CI, the range is massive which you conveniently neglected to mention).

Also if you had actually read the study properly you would also have read the following statement from the authors:

""For the Delta B.1.617+ variants of concern, the study‚Äôs authors had to rely on much smaller and less reliable sample sizes, as Delta cases are only confirmed through whole genomic sequencing which is too expensive and laborious to apply to all positive cases.""

So it is in complete agreement with the results being reported in Israel,

No argument here. This is evident to anyone that is familiar with the Chinese government. Doesn‚Äôt seem to be limited to them, though. See: Florida, even attempts by the Trump admin to suppress numbers. Friends that work at the CDC were afraid to speak the full truth and there were information pages that were edited after staff published to be more misleading about the virus. NY with hiding or minimizing what happened with senior living facilities. 

This is what all governments (hell, all people) do. Minimize bad things to look better to people. 

&gt;I never said they should know about ""all the long term health effects.""  Unless you're being intentionally obtuse, which you may be, I said ""the degree of severity and potential long term effects.""  Which they were very aware of because they had convalescent field hospitals.

I believe you‚Äôre being intentionally hyperbolic. Yes, China shares a lot of blame. This pandemic could maybe have been largely avoided had they done things differently. ‚ÄúThey‚Äù being a lot of people from the local city officials on up. But I don‚Äôt understand the thought process of pointing fingers when that a) won‚Äôt help us prevent the next time and b) shifts focus away from our own mistakes and becoming better prepared for future pandemics. 

&gt; They were classifying people that needed therapeutic rehabilitation as ""mild"" in mainstream media.  They were closing off the city to prevent press from publishing videos of overwhelmed hospitals and people dying in the streets.  They arrested doctors who tried to publish information about the actual effects and level of danger from the virus.  

And yet, by mid-January, the whole world knew what was happening (the heroic doctor who later died got the word out, and we noticed the nonstop cremations, and the halting of movement nationwide). Taiwan started health screenings for incoming China flights on Dec 31, 2019. By early Feb the US government and many western governments knew something bad was coming. We did not take action until first week of March. 

I‚Äôm in NYC and have been here from when we all thought ‚Äúoh just wash our hands‚Äù to suddenly the NBA ending it‚Äôs season and then citywide shutdown. Alarms and sirens all day and night. Not knowing if leaving your apartment meant a death sentence or if it ‚Äúwas just a flu‚Äù. When we thought maybe it transmitted on surfaces too. That‚Äôs scary in a place like NYC. None of us knew what was happening clearly until well into April and May. Even then, long Covid wasn‚Äôt really being talked about because we all thought (including scientists and doctors) that it was just a respiratory disease, not a vascular one. 

So please, tell me again how the country first hit hard with this unknown-at-the-time virus could have known it would have long term effects (other than lung issues, which *was* talked about very early)? And how exactly would knowing sooner about long term issues have changed the course of things? People were dying in larger numbers than a 9/11 event every day and many people still refused to social distance and wear masks. 

&gt;They intentionally and knowingly published misinformation and incorrect numbers related to the virus, infection rates, and its lethality.

&gt;The faster spread of COVID-19 in at-risk neighbourhoods is largely attributable to the social, economic and demographic composition of these areas. Essential workers, some racial minority groups and immigrants continue to have greater exposure to the COVID-19 virus.

&gt;The overall implication is that vaccination rates in at-risk communities did not rise fast enough to counteract their higher risk of infection. This higher risk emerges from structural disadvantages that render residents of at-risk neighborhoods more vulnerable to COVID-19 infections. Our earlier research, which is also undergoing peer review, identified some of these factors as overcrowded housing and need to travel ‚Äî often via public transit ‚Äî for necessities like food and health care.

&gt;‚Ä¶

&gt;In Toronto, the average vaccination rates across neighbourhoods with varying COVID-19 risks are nearly equal. In the absence of herd immunity, having the same vaccination rate in populations with different degrees of exposure to the virus will not result in the same infection rate. Under such circumstances, COVID-19 will continue to spread faster in at-risk neighbourhoods.

&gt;With the emergence of COVID-19 variants, whether or not Canada will ever achieve herd immunity is unclear. Therefore, reducing disparities in COVID-19 infections may require greater allocation of vaccine dosages and higher vaccination rates among groups at greater risk.

&gt;Greater efforts should also be made to understand and reduce the barriers to vaccine access among immigrant communities, including travel time and language barriers. Addressing these factors may hold the key for Toronto to reduce inequalities in COVID-19 rates.

&gt;Finally, vaccines should not be viewed as a silver bullet that can end the pandemic. Equitable distribution of vaccines should occur in tandem with other safety measures to slow the spread of COVID-19.

This isn't to downplay the pandemic or loosen safety guidelines.  I'm just trying to figure out relative risk.  These numbers use hospitalization rates as the metric.

The weekly hospitalization rate of 5-11yr from **Covid ranges from 0.1 (current) to 0.8 (peak) per 100k per week** [CDC](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/covidnet/covid19_3.html)

Rhinovirus causes [30-50% of colds](https://www.compoundchem.com/2020/01/22/colds/).  Studies show rhino hospitalization rates range from [3/1000 in kids &lt;5](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/195/6/773/876889) with no conditions (asthma/wheezing) to [3/1000 in adults](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4744574/).  I assume Elementary age is 3/1000 as well.  This converts to show **rhino hospitalizes 5.7 per 100k/week** (3x100/52).  

Dividing the rates indicates that Covid peak was 7x less dangerous (5.7/0.8) and current Covid is 57x less dangerous (5.7/0.1) for children than rhino, when considering hospitalization rates.  Adding in the other 50-70% of cold causes, would at least halve the relative risk of Covid.

So with Covid it's worrying me still that I got two shots and still that there's no shots for kids under 12 in sight (at least no guarantee Pfizer has it ready and a green light from governments in the fall).

Tons of misinformation campaigns from a certain eastern neighbor that has spilt all over Ukrainian social sites. Sad and concerning to see it play out in real-time. 

Looking at my wife's socials, there is no pandemic in Ukraine. It is 'over'. Everything is open. Masks are at a minimum. All official numbers are fudged. Testing is a joke. We went there in March to elope just the 2 of us, and it was night and day difference compared to where were are in the EU in terms of one country taking it seriously, and one not giving a shit.

My MIL just got her Pfizer jab today and it took the threat of her not being able to visit us in the EU to do so. My wife and I also decided to get double AZ jabs recently to prove to her friends and family that the AZ jab was completely safe to do. We both could have had Pfizer as it appears most people prefer, but we decided to take AZ instead because that vaccine specifically is getting raked all over the coals in Ukraine. We hoped that if we both got AZ jabs and were all OK, wife's friends and family would follow suite. Even one of them doing it, we would consider that a small victory.

2 months later the wife and I are fully jabbed, fine, and ready to move on with life. We want my MIL to come visit us in the EU, but no way she's getting here without an EU approved vaccine. Furthermore, her boss told her and all the employees at the hospital she works at that they are all required to get vaccinated or lose their jobs. Apparently 900+ doses of Pfizer were ""lost"" on the way to Kharkiv last week, which were the doses designated for that hospital. Instead they were offered Sinovac vaccines with the same stipulation; take it or lose your job. My wife found a walk-in clinic online offering Pfizer walk-ins jabs for free. MIL decided to wake up early this morning and got hers a couple hours ago, with jab #2 in about 3 weeks time. 

Ukrainians have reasons to not trust their government and Russian trolls take advantage of that (to their own detriment as well it seems). So not surprising they aren't as enthusiastic about vaccines as the rest of the Western world is.

It's basically impossible to say.  I think that Delta is causing a lot of additional consternation over the Games.  We could have another variant pop up and cause issues 12 months from now.  Maybe that variant is even more effective against the vaccinated. Maybe Japan finishes up their vaccination campaign and opens up and the baseline level of spread rises.  That's happening in a few different places in this world, it could also happen in Japan.

Point being?  We don't really know.  Is it likely to be better? Yes.  Is it guaranteed? No.

That's not my ""justification for the Olympics.""  It's my argument against your specific issue that getting COVID will wreck an athlete's performance. (Which itself is an argument against ""Delaying will hurt athletes"")

So, yes, I am on board with the argument that it will hurt athletes to delay and I think COVID risk to athletes is reduced, not increased  by hosting the games this year as opposed to next.

In the first case the lethality *is* orthogonal to infectiousness and depends on how the immune system is stimulated and how quickly, not on transmissibility.

In the second case if the virus is more infectious because of a higher transmissibility (it moves from person to person or lives on surfaces longer) then the lethality should be unchanged as long as the immune system is able to fight it equally as well.

That‚Äôs a pretty common misunderstanding of the way various properties of a pathogen interact with evolution. 

The method of spread and ability for a given dose of virus to cause an infection, its probability to kill or disable an infected person, and the time for it to do so all interact to go be you the number of people a given infected person infects. Think of a control panel with a knob for each property. These will also be interacting with the environment via things like social distancing, mask/ppe, and vaccinations. 

Evolution is constantly twiddling those control knobs, mindlessly and automatically. A virus like HIV can be 100% lethal (before modern treatments) and still spread like wildfire if it takes long enough. A virus like Ebola can be highly lethal and kill you quickly but be easier to spread. Variants aren‚Äôt evolving to be less lethal, only to spread better in whatever environment they‚Äôre encountering. 

So basically you can turn up the lethality as long as you also turn up how contagious it is.

Vaccines may certainly be a helpful tool in our tool kit, although they will take several years to be deployed to the point where the existing virus is likely to start dying down on its own.  The US is at something like 48% fully vaccinated, while globally we are at something like 12%.  We need to be at something like 90% or 95% percent with the Delta variant.  The expectation is that it will be 2023 or 2024 before we have widespread vaccination globally. So I don't think vaccines are going to be as helpful as everyone thinks in the short run.  And of course the first covid shots will start losing their efficacy after 6 to 12 months, and new variants are likely to be coming along all the time.

I think we need to stop putting all our chips on vaccines, and start thinking in terms of a suite of measures that we deploy to keep the effects of the virus manageable. One strategy is obviously things like masking and improving indoor ventilation substantially, and avoiding high-risk behaviors and venues. Another is looking for more and better treatments to help people who have been infected by the virus recover more quickly and with fewer long-term symptoms.

A tool box with one tool in it is pretty useless.",,,,1626671170,{},h5px40z,False,t3_on224o,False,True,t1_h5pkehg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/on224o/bidens_surgeon_general_backs_localized_mask/h5px40z/,1626829689,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I was watching those days Gibraltar the british enclave in Spain, their population is 99,99% vaccinated with Pfizer (from the statistics they said more fully vaccinated than the population but there are still a few hundreds of no vax or I don't know what), delta arrived a few weeks ago, cases are rising. The first days most cases were between unvaccinated, the last days are mostly between vaccinated. That means probably that all the few unvaccinated have been contaged even with so much immunity. Luckily the result of those cases are almost all just a cold or less. Only one put in ventilation (my guess is that is not vaccinated but we don't know).

So, if you are not vaccinated and in a urban area delta will most probably get you. It's really stupid to refuse a vaccine now even more than ever.

This is actually something interesting and it's also my experience, you know people who lost family/friends and you know people who haven't but how about you? Have you lost someone due to covid?

That‚Äôs not the same as people not suffering any harm from the disease.

However, it is not giving AZ out to anybody under 40 due to the reported side effects (and probably also balanced against the lower efficacy of AZ). This means that effectively all vaccination right now is with Pfizer and Moderna, which the UK has much less supply of.

The truth of the matter is, the U.S. hardly went into proper lockdown. From the start, there was a strong anti-mask sentiment and despite *particular* institutions like schools and government offices closing down, most businesses and the like continued to run, and without masks or social distancing - even after a CDC mandate. So many people prioritize their own convenience over the well-being of others. COVID had every opportunity to spread in the US because we allowed it. The CDC lifted mask restrictions back in May, only after just a couple months of the vaccine being available to the public? While only a portion of the population was vaccinated? With no way for most establishments to know for certain who was fully vaccinated and safe to take off their mask, and who was just another anti-mask/vaxxer waiting for an excuse? That's why we've suffered spikes here and there. Thankfully, not to the severity of last year, but it is still concerning.

While I'm grateful for the vaccines we got and how effective in prevention they are, their greatest boon is lessening the severity of the symptoms if we were to still get infected. They have prevented hospitalizations and saved lives, but you can still be infected and become a long-hauler with complications down the road. That's what I worry about with my high-risk loved ones.

While I accept that COVID is never truly going away, I understand that it *will* be manageable like the flu, polio, etc, in time and with *more effort*. I'm sure 5-10 years from now, we'll all be in a position where we'd hardly think about it, but we're not there yet. None of those illnesses immediately became afterthoughts once the vaccines were introduced - there's still the grace period of getting it to the majority of the public. That's where we are now with COVID, but the precautions are being dropped way too soon.

What's the vaccination rate of incoming athletes?  North of 80%?

None of those people are going to die.  Breakthrough cases that lead to death are almost completely in the older and sicker age ranges.

So, that leaves us with another 2000 athletes that are unvaccinated.  What's the CFR for that age range assuming extremely healthy people?  Less than 0.05%?  [This is the source I found.

A WHO definition for the elimination of measles in a country allows for importation of cases, as long as endemic transmission of the measles virus strain does not continue for more than 12 months. So far, there is no internationally agreed definition for the elimination of SARS-CoV-2.

You want to talk about silly comparisons?  It's comparing a single flight with the entirety of a cruise ship's operations over weeks and months.

As soon as that flight lands, it's bringing on another group of passengers to do it all again.

[Average emissions per passenger](https://www.tourismdashboard.org/explore-the-data/cruise-ship/) are 0.82 tonnes of carbon.

Unfortunately, that data doesn't give me a number of days.  That would be necessary to really delve in deep.

A flight from Newark to Heathrow produces 0.64 tonnes of carbon per passenger.

Now to be clear, the vaccine itself (through different mechanisms both MRNA and DNA depending on vaccine) tells the body to create the spike protein, which the immune system then recognizes as something foreign to attack and antibodies are formed as a result.

1. Twitter profits from creating safe-space echo chambers, separating a number of distinct political groups to their enclave so that they don't see each other in the same website. Then encourages people to block information that is uncomfortable--and encourages people to like/retweet information that is confirmation biased. They also suspend people *without* explanations or appeals if they continuously try to barge into the opposing echo-chambers purposefully.
2. Reddit used to show upvotes+downvotes \[with a popular extension for reddit\], this allowed alternative dissenting opinions to go up in rank among the comments and create nuanced perspectives. Then they removed that ability. Now once again, echo-chambers reign supreme. Not to mention the conspiracy theorist &amp; political subreddits that are controlled by hostile moderators who censor any dissent.
3. Facebook creates unaccountable narratives and storylines (conspiracy theory) posts that can form a natural echo-chamber and because they disabled ""anonymous accounts"" the only ones who can really troll political/conspiracy-theory posts are the trollfarms that can create fake identities for politics. This fake-identity/phone requirement is great for well-resourced nation-states but not so encouraging to someone who just wants to anonymously discuss controversial politics or puncture information bubbles.

Silicon Valley companies are profiting off of confirmation bias and misinformation. Creating information bubbles where opposing viewpoints can't succeed but crazy people can defend their thoughts without having rational debate. They don't have to confront the opposing side and settle a debate with a victory or loss result.

On top of that policies surrounding politeness are used as an excuse to further silence people who are prone to debate as debate isn't so nice, calm, and tidy. The enragement of passions in a debate is seen as ""a problem"" which in turn is converted to silencing all debate.

Why? Because debate leads to people leaving social media.

There have been moments in past social media where the conversation shifts entirely because someone made good points and rose to the top of the upvotes.

Entire conspiracy theories would get DEBUNKED, because someone make a top tier comment or reply.

What do you think will happen if we keep getting crazier variants?

What do you THINK happened last year when hospitals were in triage mode, but didn't triage based on whether the person took proper precautions against COVID?

IMO - they should have been ignoring people that got sick from a party, or people screaming about how masks are unconstitutional.

Let them die when the choice is between worthwhile humans and actual dogshit.

----------

Over 55% of adults in Germany have received both shots of their vaccine, and an additional 16.6% have had their first shot.

- people over 60 have been double-vaxxed to 73.7%, with another 10.5% having received their first shot.

- for people of 18-59 years of age, just 43.7% have been double-vaxxed, and 15.4% have received their first shot.

As a reminder, the RKI estimates that in order to avoid a Delta wave, 90% of people over 60 need to be fully vaxxed, as well as 85% of those aged 18-59. But there are studies that suggest even higher numbers may be required.

-----------

As for the slowdown:

In the week ending today (July 18th), Germany will have given just over 4 million jabs (1st as well as 2nd doses); the week before that, it was just under 4.3 million; the week before that 5 million; and the week before that 5.6 million.

49.6 million people in Germany have received at least one shot of the vaccine (as of July 16th); since conservative estimates say that only 52.7 million adult, eligible people are willing to be vaccinated at this point, a slowdown is almost inevitable.

Summer holidays, etc., are also possible additional causes of the slowdown.

------------

Rising case numbers:

Incidence numbers in Germany are much lower than in many other European countries, but they are rising fast. The lowest point was two or three weeks ago at around 5 new cases (rolling 7-day-average) in 100.000 people. Now it is around 10. The government is speaking of a 50 to 55 % rise week-to-week.

Journalists who have broken down the numbers a bit more, say that over the past two weeks these case numbers have actually been rather stable within most age-groups, but that in the 20-29-year age group the number were rising significantly.

In the (even more narrow) age-band of 20-24, the incidence-rate rose from 10 to 19 (per 100.000 people), whereas in the age-group 75-84, it stayed continuously at 1.

*[note: some people assume that, as Delta has different sypmtoms, and might not hit most double-vaxxed people hard, many elderly people might just assume they have a bad cold and not get tested, because they think it is unlikely/impossible that they have the virus due to the fact that they are fully vaccinated]*",,,,1626665417,{},h5po2dg,False,t3_omq283,False,True,t1_h5n2k9c,/r/Coronavirus/comments/omq283/eu_vaccination_campaign_catching_up_with_us/h5po2dg/,1626824836,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

* More than 2/3rds of the active cases are young men. This is good evidence that the sports ball tournament was the big superspreading event, when everyone crammed into pubs to watch it on the tv with beer. (Note: our pubs have been open through most of the pandemic unlike the UK, because we closed our borders).

I know two people who are symptomatic, one is my 25 year old step brother (only 1 vax) although their cases are mild it's still pretty miserable (loss of taste, loss of energy, generally feeling nasty - typical viral infection symptoms).

Now using that as an arguement against vaccines is obviously bs, like you need any protection before it encounters you and potentially harms or even kills you. And obviously, a body produces better anti bodies knowing the whole virus rather than just its spikes.

But at that point, I think - if you survived covid once, you have enough protection so the worst won't happen, but a booster shot will give you a big plus. Some people argue that some people might dealt easier with Corona because of contracting other corona-viruses before. But in the end every body deals differently with it and creates different amounts of anti-bodies that last differently. And with mutations like Delta, the body needs more anti bodies to neutralize it. That is the main issue.

Because in the same way Corona spreads massively, it multiplies massively. So within short time, it can create out of 10 viruses 1000000000 or something idk, so when our immune system interfers at 100 the body won't notice it like when he has to  start neutralizing it at 10000. 

Now Imagine original corona would need 3 ab to neutralize, delta 9 ab. Let's say you have 500 antibodies from the first dose corona got you loaded and your body detected it at 100. 300 ab neutralize the virus, so you don't have to reload in this case. Now imagine Delta got detected at 100 and you would need 900 ab but only had 500 ab from the first dose. Then you might get infected, but deal with it better than having none. That's why you need the 2nd dose more against Delta, so you'll have then 1000 ab. Now idk how high the protection from infection is, compared to that, but it should be somewhere around that range, maybe with even better or more ab. Also with vaccines, moderna is slightly better than BnT/Pfizer, probably because it's a bit higher dosed so there will be more ab.

Now those are made up numbers which also simplify the process really hard.

&gt;The analysis found that antibodies from a natural infection were less able to neutralize the delta variant, particularly a year after infection. But among samples from people fully vaccinated, 95 percent retained sufficient antibodies to thwart the virus, said Olivier Schwartz, lead author of the Nature study and head of the Virus and Immunity Unit at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.

study referenced:

&gt;We further show that Delta is less sensitive to sera 
from naturally immunized individuals. Vaccination of convalescent 
individuals boosted the humoral immune response well above the 
threshold of neutralization. These results strongly suggest that vac-
cination of previously infected individuals will be most likely protective against a large array of circulating viral strains, including variant Delta.

I'm genuinely curious if it's backed by data -- all current data I can find (especially with regard to Delta) suggests the primary efficacy is in preventing cases (where it's 75-95%\* effective or so). Breakthrough COVID-in-vaccinated cases appear to get hospitalized maybe 25-50%\* less than COVID-in-unvaccinated. That's better, but the upshot is ""you are far less likely to get it, and if you do, you'll be moderately at an advantage"". 

Instead, a lot of recent messaging is largely ""it's not supposed to prevent cases, it's supposed to make them mild"". I find this to be disingenuous. Am I mistaken in this?

Data: I'm using public UK vaccine-vs-delta numbers as shown here (note very wide confidence intervals because Delta is still new, but that's exactly why I bring this up -- we're actually far more confident about cases being prevented than about them being milder):

That's not far off their share of the population, which would imply little to no vaccine effect.

If you take the numbers from [this article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/just-one-serious-covid-patient-in-israel-is-both-vaccinated-and-under-60-tv/), that would suggest that 37 of 47 hospitalized 50+ COVID patients are vaccinated, which is 78.7%.

Again, there are a bunch of variables that could be driving this, but it's hard to reconcile the idea of 90% protection against hospitalization with those numbers, even if the sample is small.

To make this argument, he links to an  article from *The Lancet* (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00978-8/fulltext) that disingenuously included Japan and South Korea in a list of ""elimination"" countries, even though neither country ever pursued an elimination strategy at all. They used exactly the same strategy as most of the world: try to live with the virus and accept that there will be many new cases every day, but don't let it get out of control.

Why this worked (at least until Delta) I don't know; I think there are clearly regional differences in how easy it is for the virus to spread, but I don't know why. But the whole problem with the COVID suppression movement is that it looks at any country that seems to be doing well and assumes it's because they tried harder than the countries that aren't doing well.

I don't know why some places have controlled COVID more than others but I know it's not just a case of wanting it more.

(BTW, I didn't downvote this reply. Not sure why someone did.)

As far as getting a positive test ""without actually getting sick,"" I think different people mean different things by this. Is there such a thing as someone testing positive and not quite qualifying as having COVID-19?

All I know is that the efficacy numbers have been broken down exhaustively into things like death, hospitalization, severe disease, disease, minor disease, and asymptomatic cases from the start. Actually, these things, including whether a successful vaccine would result in vaccinated people not transmitting, have been discussed exhaustively since well before the start.  

I was thinking you'd heard of this, especially browsing subs like this one, and would know that the main stats we've talked about being 100% or close are deaths. In short, I'd have thought you already knew the ""without getting sick"" part.

Of course, there are plenty of elements of this pandemic others think are obvious that I don't know. In any case, what is a shame is this progression of expectations that has happened with a large, educated(!) portion of the public:

1) We'll be lucky to have a vaccine in 5 years

2) If we get one, hopefully it's 40% effective or more

3) Now that we have one, I expect 100% of recipients to never test positive

Vaccines.  We have them this year, we didn't have them last year and I think mid 2021 was a reasonable estimate for them to be available.  We way over-performed on speed to develop, but the IOC banking on vaccines to allow a much safer Olympics than in 2020 was a reasonable line of thought.

&gt;Perhaps the uncertainty of the future is not an argument against the certainty of the bad situation today.

I mean, this entire thread is about athletes not getting to compete.   Every year you push increases the certainty that some athletes will miss their window to compete.  So while the COVID risk or wrecking an athlete's performance is relatively flat between the two events, the additional year will result in many athletes missing their window.


&gt;The problem I'm pointing at is that this argument only works if athletes only exist in the Olympics.

Which argument?  Because I think your entire argument rests on that.  ""Don't hold the Olympics, the athletes might get COVID and that would wreck their athletic abilities.""  But like... every day they have COVID risk.  They don't suddenly become safe from COVID by being in their home country for another year.  My argument acknowledges that they exist outside of the Olympics and by keeping them unvaccinated in their home countries for another year, the risk of their athletic performance being negatively affected by COVID rises substantially.

&gt;then why not improve the access of third world countries to vaccines instead of organizing a multibillion dollar massive event in the first world benefiting mostly first world brands as an excuse to donate a couple thousand doses?

This isn't a choice between these two things at all.  We can do both.  We can do neither.  We don't have to delay the Olympics to improve third world access to vaccines and delaying the Olympics isn't going to do anything to improve access to vaccines for the third world.

1. Fully vaccinated students and teachers (the article you linked to.)

2. Unvaccinated people.

The CDC is saying that unvaccinated people should wear masks, and since children below 12 are unable to that includes them.  Lots of kids 12-17 aren't allowed to be vaccinated by their parents, so it's not really fair to expect them to be responsible for getting vaccinated until they are an adult.  What the American Academy of Pediatrics is suggesting is stricter than what the CDC says due to (per the article):

&gt; Reasons for this recommendation include but are not limited to: a significant proportion of the student population is not yet eligible for vaccination; masking protects those who are not vaccinated against Covid-19 and reduces transmission; and potential difficulty in monitoring or enforcing mask policies for those who are not vaccinated.

So I don't really think it's that the AAP is saying, ""vaccinated people aren't safe"" but rather, ""so many students can't be vaccinated that those who were already vaccinated should follow masking and social distancing rules a little while longer too.""",,,,1626719661,{},h5s65n8,False,t3_ong4ic,False,False,t1_h5rzx4u,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ong4ic/american_academy_of_pediatrics_recommends/h5s65n8/,1626871512,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The outcome of these patients was similar to that of non-vaccinated hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Additional prospective longitudinal studies are urgently needed to identify predictors for vaccine breakthrough infection and simple correlates of vaccine protection, to enable identification of individuals at higher risk, who would require continued strict precautions, and possibly repeated active vaccination or other prophylactic measures, such as passive vaccination.

Mechanistic studies near the bottom (this is measurement of particles in the lab for eg). Observational studies aren't great because of the sheer number of confounding factors that can bias the results.  


Randomized Controlled Trials are the gold standard, because the difference between groups is primarily limited to the intervention (masks for eg). For a population level effect like this, it's hard to do, and the one study that was done (the Danish one) was underpowered so a statistically significant result couldn't be obtained.  


Beyond that, systematic/meta analysis of studies (of which RCTs are again by far preferred, with observational/mechanistic studies often just completely excluded) form the best evidence. A bit bunk with covid-19 as there only was the one RCT, but if masks and influenza like ilness is looked at, with systematic/meta analysis done by respected groups (Cochrane for eg) find no statistically significant difference with or without masks: [https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub5](https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub5)

Compare the description of the Covid trial I posted earlier to the one you posted:

""Study Description

Go¬†to¬† 

Brief Summary:

This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA¬Æ) versus standard treatment (methotrexate, docetaxel or cetuximab) for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either pembrolizumab or Investigator's choice of standard treatment. The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab treatment prolongs Overall Survival (OS) when compared to standard treatment.""

Not the same, eh? So, I do not know of you don't know better and you mean well, or you are obfuscating on purpose.

&gt;We recently shared research that provides insight into how the immune system protects the body after a confirmed COVID-19 infection. The study followed Cleveland Clinic caregivers over five months as the vaccination process was beginning. The data showed that the vaccine was extremely effective in preventing COVID-19 infection. In addition, we found that none of the previously infected employees who remained unvaccinated were re-infected over the duration of the study.  This information could help guide vaccination efforts should there be a shortage of vaccine supply and in countries where vaccine supply is limited.  

&gt;This is still a new virus, and more research is needed. It is important to keep in mind that this study was conducted in a population that was younger and healthier than the general population. In addition, we do not know how long the immune system will protect itself against re-infection after COVID-19. It is safe to receive the COVID-19 vaccine even if you have previously tested positive, and we recommend all those who are eligible receive it.‚Äù
