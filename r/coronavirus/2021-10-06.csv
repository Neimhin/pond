Lots of links in there to actual studies which again includes the one that suggests 20-36% of natural infections result in zero antibodies meaning zero immunity.  That pretty much puts the question of natural immunity vs vaccination to bed.

I thought we agreed the “twice as likely” study wasn’t an equivalent comparison so I dropped it.  I instead pivoted to the previously mentioned study that specifically addressed what you asked about.

What makes you unwilling to accept that data and more willing to accept the (again, roundly rejected) study you found?

And no, who uses a study doesn’t invalidate it on its own but I do think it should raise an eyebrow if anti-vaxers are the only ones taking that particular study seriously.",,,,1633563839,{},hfo0vlq,False,t3_q2ckda,False,False,t1_hfnnccv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q2ckda/hospital_system_says_it_will_deny_transplants_to/hfo0vlq/,1633693626.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our medical system is full of people hanging on by a thread.  We have been going HARD for well over a year now.  We can't sustain this.

At least one person has died of a illness that is normally pretty trivial to treat because he couldn't get a bed in an ICU that was full of unvaccinated covid patients.

I know you think individuals are totally responsible for themselves and there are no externalities to their suspect decision making, but I am here to tell you that you are full of it.  Every person who doesn't get vaxxed and gets covid is likely to make the lives of those of us actually fighting this thing a little closer to hell.

Also, those breakthrough infections are hardly ""just a light headache/sore throat""  One of my EMT friends (40s, fit, vaccinated, triathlete, mountaineer) spent 10 days in bed with the worst body aches he's ever felt after getting a breakthrough.

This is a PUBLIC health problem, your suggestion that all solutions be private is implausible on it's face.  Please stop.

If you don't stop, never tell anyone how much you support nurses, or paramedics, or EMTs...  The thing you can do to support us is end this thing.  The way to end it is more vaccinations.  And there are too many selfish and ill informed idiots out there to count on people doing the right thing to end this so we have to escalate.

vaccine adjuvants that could specifically stimulate T-cell responses should be explored. In addition to its ability to promote trained immunity, beta-glucan could also augment cellular immunity, and has been previously touted to be promising as oral anti-infective vaccine adjuvants (Jin et al., 2018). β-Glucans as vaccine adjuvants have been found to enhance the immunogenicity of hepatitis B vaccine and influenza vaccine in animal studies (Dong et al., 2007; Le et al., 2011). Indeed, the potential of oral beta-glucans supplementation to stimulate cellular immunity upon administration of COVID-19 vaccines to provide long-term protection is suggested in an observational study of healthy adults aged 50 or older, whereby supplementation with active hexose correlated compound (mixture of alpha- and beta-glucans; 3 g/day for 60 days) increased the frequency of peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing interferon-gamma and/or tumor necrosis factor-alpha at 30 and 60 days compared to baseline and such findings were still observed at 30 days upon discontinuing the supplementation (Yin et al., 2010).",,,,1633581764,{},hfozsa3,True,t3_q31gwc,False,True,t3_q31gwc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q31gwc/ingestion_of_betaglucans_could_stimulate/hfozsa3/,1633712901.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,taishiea,,,[],,,,text,t2_hhn8cc,False,False,[],"most of this is based off the sci-fi we produce as well as our human history. lets start with some terms 

Altered - anyone that has been modified pre birth

Naturals- anyone that has not been modified pre birth

This is based on the idea presented that modifications are mandated by the government to help improve the overall health of the population and that the modifications improve things greatly (basically making Captain America in the womb) (Can't see any reason the government wouldn't want all citizens to be combat ready whether for growth of the country or deterrent against another country making super babies).

I suggested that a natural person could be considered a second class citizen based on a world where modifications are done. This second class perception would start based on just the basic differences between the 2 groups, lets say the modifications pre birth not only improve overall health but also improve things like overall ability such as being stronger and faster retaining youth for longer etc. Basically in terms of a workforce the altered person would have all the advantages thus being valued higher as time goes on since they would be seen as overall the better person to hire should you choose between a natural or an altered.

this is easily seen in todays society where for decades degree based jobs were seen as superior (law, medical) to skill based (electrician, plumber) however it seems the trend is now showing skill based jobs now catching up in pay and well as providing more happiness for their workers.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the reason i feel doctors in such world would be considered a lower profession is that even though people can still get hurt the technology to fix such things would most likely exist and be very accessible to those that were altered as their families would have the means to pay for it. Doctors would still exist to care for those that could not afford such advance treatment thus over time the profession would be associated with the poor thus the diminished status. during this same period there would be medical professionals still however they would be more tasked with running such advanced facilities or focused on the altering of new embryos with little to no contact with the people.

An example of a profession that has had a major change in perception is the Garbageman, they use to be hailed as heroes for the work they did cleaning up cities but as time goes on and the service they provide changing it is now seen as a lower profession (despite being paid quite well).

Our history is filled with examples of us segregating people based on the smallest of things from a slight difference interpretation of a holy book to the color of a persons skin to the ideology of how the government should work. we are a very dramatic species.

As for religion i feel that like today there would be people that would refuse using religion, for example Jehova's witnesses will not take the blood of others into themselves. i could see a religious movement stating that altering the body damages or corrupts the soul or goes against god as it is unnatural. though there could also be a religion that worships the alterations as a means to become closer to God thru a continued approached to perfection.

a good example of people seeing religion in a bad light can be found in Dead Space with many in colonies not in good terms with the Unitologist and their views on humanity. even other works like Star Wars show that the Order of Jedis is not seen in a good light among many in the systems.",,,,1633581441,{},hfoz2wa,False,t3_q2ckda,False,True,t1_hfn0psh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q2ckda/hospital_system_says_it_will_deny_transplants_to/hfoz2wa/,1633712519.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In wars it's the young who die, with COVID it's the older who die, a sizable portion of older people who dies were already weakened (I know I sound like an wanker but English is not my native language and I'm not sure how to phrase it in a different way).

I mean looking at the hard numbers of people who died it takes things out of proportion, you need to look at the excess mortality, [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess\_deaths.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm)



It's still a lot but it's significantly lower than what you'd expect, though the main problem with COVID is the hospitalization rate. The vaccine doesn't have to prevent you from getting COVID, but it SIGNIFICANTLY reduces the odds from getting hospitalized. If people don't get vaccinated then hospitals will run out of beds and then things get worse and then people will die.

So get vaccinated, not because of the deaths but because of the hospital bills which are notoriously high in America :)",,,,1633595878,{},hfpgvrl,False,t3_q2z3hh,False,True,t1_hfouc0t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q2z3hh/the_mandalorian_star_giancarlo_esposito_is_fed_up/hfpgvrl/,1633722568.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Question  What was the COVID-19 vaccination coverage and estimated mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) among US veterans in the first 3 months following vaccine rollout?  
  
Findings  In this case-control study including 6 647 733 veterans, 23% of veterans received at least 1 COVID-19 vaccination during the first 3 months of vaccine rollout. VE against infection was estimated to be 95% for full vaccination; estimated VE against COVID-19-related hospitalization was 91%, and there were no COVID-19–related deaths among fully vaccinated veterans.  
  
Meaning  These findings suggest that early vaccination rollout for veterans was efficient, and estimated VE was high for this diverse US population.  
  
Abstract  
Importance  Effectiveness of mRNA vaccinations in a diverse older population with high comorbidity is unknown.  
  
Objectives  To describe the scope of the COVID-19 vaccination rollout among US veterans, and to estimate mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) as measured by rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection.  
  
Design, Setting, and Participants  This matched test–negative case-control study was conducted using SARS-CoV-2 test results at Veterans Health Administration sites from December 14, 2020, to March 14, 2021. Vaccine coverage was estimated for all veterans. VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19–related hospitalization and death were estimated using electronic health records from veterans who routinely sought care at a VHA facility and had a test result positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases) or negative for SARS-CoV-2 (controls). Cases and controls were matched on time of test and geographic region. Data were analyzed from May to July 2021.  
  
Exposures  Vaccination status, defined as unvaccinated, partially vaccinated (≥14 days after first dose until second dose), or fully vaccinated (≥14 days after second dose), at time of test.  
  
Main Outcomes and Measures  The main outcome of interest was a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 on a polymerase chain reaction or antigen test. Secondary outcomes included COVID-19–related hospitalization and death, defined by discharge data and proximity of event to positive test result. VE was estimated from odds ratios for SARS-CoV-2 infection with 95% CIs.  
  
Results  Among 6 647 733 veterans included (3 350 373 veterans \[50%\] aged ≥65 years; 6 014 798 \[90%\] men and 632 935 \[10%\] women; 461 645 Hispanic veterans of any race \[7%\], 1 102 471 non-Hispanic Black veterans \[17%\], and 4 361 621 non-Hispanic White veterans \[66%\]), 1 363 180 (21%) received at least 1 COVID-19 vaccination by March 7, 2021. In this period, during which the share of SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha, Epsilon, and Iota had started to increase in the US, estimates of COVID-19 VE against infection, regardless of symptoms, was 95% (95% CI, 93%-96%) for full vaccination and 64% (95% CI, 59%-68%) for partial vaccination. Estimated VE against COVID-19–related hospitalization for full vaccination was 91% (95% CI 83%-95%); there were no deaths among veterans who were fully vaccinated. VE against infection was similar across subpopulations (non-Hispanic Black, 94% \[95% CI, 88%-97%\]; Hispanic \[any race\], 83% \[95% CI, 45%-95%\]; non-Hispanic White, 92% \[95% CI 88%-94%\]; rural, 94% \[95% CI, 89%-96%\]; urban, 93% 95% CI, 89%-95%\]).  
  
Conclusions and Relevance  For veterans of all racial and ethnic subgroups living in urban or rural areas, mRNA vaccination was associated with substantially decreased risk of COVID-19 infection and hospitalization, with no deaths among fully vaccinated veterans.",,,,1633615831,{},hfqaxvu,True,t3_q39xda,False,False,t3_q39xda,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q39xda/coverage_and_estimated_effectiveness_of_mrna/hfqaxvu/,1633738828.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND  
Reports have suggested an association between the development of myocarditis and the receipt of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), but the frequency and severity of myocarditis after vaccination have not been extensively explored.  
  
METHODS  
We searched the database of Clalit Health Services, the largest health care organization (HCO) in Israel, for diagnoses of myocarditis in patients who had received at least one dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer–BioNTech). The diagnosis of myocarditis was adjudicated by cardiologists using the case definition used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We abstracted the presentation, clinical course, and outcome from the patient’s electronic health record. We performed a Kaplan–Meier analysis of the incidence of myocarditis up to 42 days after the first vaccine dose.  
  
RESULTS  
Among more than 2.5 million vaccinated HCO members who were 16 years of age or older, 54 cases met the criteria for myocarditis. The estimated incidence per 100,000 persons who had received at least one dose of vaccine was 2.13 cases (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 1.56 to 2.70). The highest incidence of myocarditis (10.69 cases per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 6.93 to 14.46) was reported in male patients between the ages of 16 and 29 years. A total of 76% of cases of myocarditis were described as mild and 22% as intermediate; 1 case was associated with cardiogenic shock. After a median follow-up of 83 days after the onset of myocarditis, 1 patient had been readmitted to the hospital, and 1 had died of an unknown cause after discharge. Of 14 patients who had left ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography during admission, 10 still had such dysfunction at the time of hospital discharge. Of these patients, 5 underwent subsequent testing that revealed normal heart function.  
  
CONCLUSIONS  
Among patients in a large Israeli health care system who had received at least one dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, the estimated incidence of myocarditis was 2.13 cases per 100,000 persons; the highest incidence was among male patients between the ages of 16 and 29 years. Most cases of myocarditis were mild or moderate in severity.

&gt; Research at a hospital swamped by people with COVID-19 has confirmed that portable air filters effectively remove SARS-CoV-2 particles from the air — the first such evidence in a real-world setting1. The results suggest that air filters could be used to reduce the risk of patients and medical staff contracting SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals, the study’s authors say.

&gt; Despite the proper use of personal protective equipment, hospitals have reported substantial spread of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to health-care workers. One suspected cause of such cases is viral particles in the air, which are one of the main drivers of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

&gt; Earlier experiments that tested air filters’ performance assessed their ability to remove inactive particles while operating in carefully controlled environments2. As a result, “what was not known was how effective they would be in a real-world ward setting for clearing SARS-CoV-2”, says study co-author Vilas Navapurkar, an intensive-care unit (ICU) physician at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, UK.

&gt; The COVID-19 pandemic has caused US males' life expectancy at birth in 2020 to drop by 2.2 years from the 2019 level, the largest among the 29 countries involved in a paper published Sunday by the Oxford University.

&gt; As many as 27 countries analyzed saw life expectancy losses, with losses of longer than one year in 11 countries for males and 8 for females, it found.

&gt; For western European countries, ""the last time such large magnitudes of declines in life expectancy at birth were observed in a single year was during WWII,"" said Jose Manuel Aburto, a co-lead author.

&gt; The research was led by scientists at Oxford's Leverhulme Center for Demographic Science and explores COVID-19's impacts on life expectancy in most European countries, Chile and the United States.

&gt; **In the United States, increases in mortality at working-age (under 60) contributed most to the life expectancy decline**, while in most European countries, the above-60 group contributed most, the research said, adding that despite having a younger population, the Unites States also has ""higher co-morbidities in these age groups.""

&gt; Other factors, such as ""unevenness in healthcare access in the working-age population"" and ""structural racism,"" also contributed to the mortality increase, said the research, citing a recent US research showing that ""socially disadvantaged populations,"" including Blacks and Latinos, witnessed higher life expectancy losses.",,,,1633633437,{},hfrhcl8,False,t3_q3fv03,False,False,t3_q3fv03,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q3fv03/us_males_life_expectancy_drops_by_22_years/hfrhcl8/,1633760322.0,52,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — Anti-vaccine residents of a village in Guatemala seized and held a team of nurses who were trying to administer coronavirus shots Monday, authorities said.

&gt; The team was held for about seven hours in the village of Nahuila, in the province of Alta Verapaz, north of Guatemala City.

&gt; The villagers said they didn’t want the shots, and later blocked a road and let the air out of the nurses’ tires. A cooler and about 50 doses of vaccine were destroyed.

&gt; Police and local officials later negotiated their release.

&gt; Officials said they had previously encountered villages that rejected vaccination teams, but Gabriel Sandoval, the director of the provincial health department, said it was the first time they faced such physical opposition.

&gt; “Other communities have refused, but what they usually do is draw up papers saying we went to offer to vaccinate them, and they take responsibility for refusing it,” Sandoval said.

I actually rounded that down to 90% in an attempt to build room for error.  That’s still higher than 60-80%.

It’s actually ironic that you linked that study again.  Maybe I didn’t read it close enough the first time (or realistically I’m not qualified to read it and draw conclusions) but it actually does seem to be providing the exact data you want to see.

That study compared individuals with a previous infection who remained unvaxed with  individuals who had a previous infection and WERE vaxed and concluded that the unvaxed had a 2x higher rate of reinfection.

It’s literally the first paragraph and states it clearly (emphasis mine):

“In today’s MMWR, a study of COVID-19 infections in Kentucky among people who were previously infected with SAR-CoV-2 shows that **unvaccinated individuals are more than twice as likely to be reinfected with COVID-19 than those who were fully vaccinated after initially contracting the virus**. These data further indicate that COVID-19 vaccines offer better protection than natural immunity alone and that vaccines, even after prior infection, help prevent reinfections.”

I’m not sure what you mean by:

“Surely if they had evidence ALONE that vaccination ALONE gave higher protection than previous infection ALONE they would have released a report …”

That’s what that study is demonstrating no?  It’s comparing natural antibodies to natural antibodies plus vaccination and concluding the vax offers better protection by nearly double so I don’t know what more evidence you want.

And sorry but trusting experts without pouring over data I wouldn’t understand anyway isn’t doing myself a disservice.  Grasping at straws and dismissing expert advice in favor of uneducated conclusions is a disservice.

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02183-8/fulltext , and the only way to compare the protection afforded by either is through a comparative study.

You seem to be of the belief that vaccination ""guarantees"" an antibody response- so in 100% of cases. This is simply not true and has never been for any vaccine.
""two doses of BNT162b2 achieved &gt;90% seropositivity 28–72 days after the first vaccination regardless of age""

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00947-3/figures/1 - graph c shows the probability of antibody response in double vaccinated individuals- not 100%.
Do you have a source that shows a 100% antibody response following vaccination?

Why would the CDC say you should be vaccinated even if you've been infected? Read the ""Already complicated rollout"" section of the link I included in my last comment for some possible non-health reasons https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n2101

My probability of a bad outcome from covid having been previously infected and experiencing a mild case, being young, not over weight, and with no other health issues is absolutely tiny.
The probability of a bad outcome from getting vaccinated is also tiny, however having been previously infected I am greater risk of side effects 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33930320/?dopt=Abstract 
And as a young male I am a greater risk of myocarditis, and the understanding of this risk is still evolving - only yesterday Sweden stopped moderna vaccination in young adults https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/covid-vaccine-sweden-pauses-use-of-moderna-for-younger-age-groups-1.4692751

Note that in the article you quote, Dr. Spencer says that ""vaccinated people are *far less likely* to have the coronavirus"" (my emphasis) and not ""vaccinated people *can't* have the coronavirus"". (I don't think we know for certain exactly *how* far less likely, but it's certainly been enough to make a difference.) He's not actually disagreeing with the expert that I was referring to.

I do like the analogy that Spencer gives for how the probabilities work out:

&gt; Among the unvaccinated, the virus travels unhindered on a highway with multiple off-ramps and refueling stations. In the vaccinated, it gets lost in a maze of dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs. Every so often, it pieces together an escape route, but in most scenarios, it finds itself cut off, and its journey ends. It can go no further.

He does also mention the Provincetown outbreak from this last summer:

&gt; An outbreak in Provincetown, Massachusetts—in which 74 percent of the 469 cases were in the fully vaccinated—forced the CDC to update its mask guidance and issue a sad and sobering warning: Vaccinated people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant can be [just as contagious](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm?s_cid=mm7031e2_w) as unvaccinated people.

If you're interested, This Week in Virology had a [discussion](https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-789/) about that back in August; the commenters were of the opinion that the CDC was wrong on declaring the Delta variant to be ""more contagious"" or that vaccinated people were necessarily ""just as contagious"" as the unvaccinated.

This isn’t a study but rather is a summary of publicly reported data on all child cases since reporting began and the current outcomes. It’s from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association. 

https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/

In summary, data as of 30/9/21:

Since reporting began (up to 30/9/21) 5,899,148 children have tested positive in the US. 

Of those reported cases:

Up until 30/9/21, 520 have died (88 per million), which is 0.009% of total child cases

Up until 30/9/21, 22,429 have been hospitalised (3,802 per million), which is 0.380% of total child cases

Obviously the results aren’t complete as not all 5M+ cases have recovered so deaths and hospitalisations will end up higher than currently reported, but it still shows a very low risk to children.

- age breakdown
- what treatments or interventions were used

&gt;""First and foremost, vaccination is highly effective for people with substance use disorders, and the overall risk of COVID-19 among vaccinated people with substance use disorders is very low,"" study co-author Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse, said in an institute news release.

&gt;She said it's important to encourage folks with drug and alcohol problems to get vaccinated and to acknowledge that even after they do, they have a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and must take steps to protect themselves.

&gt;For the study, the researchers analyzed electronic health records of nearly 580,000 people in the United States who were fully vaccinated against COVID-19 between Dec. 1, 2020 and Aug. 14, 2021, and who had not previously had COVID.

&gt;Seven percent of those with drug or alcohol problems had breakthrough infections, compared with 3.6% of those without substance use problems.

&gt;Infection rates ranged from 6.8% for tobacco users to 7.8% for those with cannabis use disorder.

&gt;Among people with substance use disorders who had a breakthrough infection, 22.5% were hospitalized, and 1.7% died, the study found. The rates were 1.6% and 0.5%, respectively, among people with drug and alcohol problems but no breakthrough infection.

&gt;The researchers also found that the risk of severe outcomes after a breakthrough infection was higher in patients with substance use disorders than in others.

&gt;The increased risk of breakthrough infections in people with substance use disorders appears to owe largely to coexisting health conditions and poor health linked to poverty, according to findings published Oct. 6 in the journal World Psychiatry.

&gt;""From previous studies, we knew that people with substance use disorders may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 and severe related outcomes,"" said study co-author Rong Xu, director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.

&gt;""These results emphasize that, while the vaccine is essential and effective, some of these same risk factors still apply to breakthrough infections,"" Xu said in the release.",,,,1633558560,{},hfnpykf,True,t3_q2uua0,False,False,t3_q2uua0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q2uua0/breakthrough_covid_more_likely_in_people_with/hfnpykf/,1633688022.0,31,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enough credit, based on *what?* 

Re-infection rates are low, but it's still early so those numbers are likely to go up.  What is known is that while low, it's still possible, and early studies are showing that vaccination reduces the chances further.  We also know re-infected individuals can carry a much higher viral load without showing any symptoms.  In other words, you could have people not showing up in reports as having been re-infected, despite the fact that not only are they, but they're spreading the virus at a high rate.

&gt;and it's easy to jump on the wagon of alleged certainty of officials.

Or maybe realizing you know shit-all about a subject and so it's worth listening to people who have studied the subject for many years, conducted actual research in the field for many more, published their findings and had them peer reviewed.

&gt;I'm pretty sure studies showed incredible efficacy with Thalidomide.

I'm sorry, I though we were talking about a vaccine with \~6.5 BILLION doses administered world-wide with trivial reports of significant adverse reactions despite massive scrutiny by organizations and agencies around the world.

Thalidomide on the other hand was a drug used by thousands of pregnant women despite never been tested or strictly controlled for use under those conditions because in 1957 there wasn't data to show that the chemicals used in the drug could pass through the mother and on to the fetus.

We know the ingredients in the Covid vaccines are safe, even for fetuses.  They've been used in other vaccines for a very long time now.  

Drugs like Thalidomide when used for morning sickness in the 1950s along with medical practices in medieval times is why we have such rigorous and thorough testing today.  We have the data and we can compare safety of the vaccine to infection rates and outcomes.

Population totals in states are large enough that 1% of a state's population is by no means a small number. In an even split case scenario it may not affect the proportion of votes that much, but if it hits the right people (politically active, donor, advocate, etc) then that one death has the potential to lose more for a political party than the death of someone more politically apathetic. 

In a 100:0 scenario, it would be a massive hit even with 1% dead because of the aforementioned reasons, but the difference grows because one side, in this scenario, hasn't lost *anything* in potential fundraising, persons to vote, and people to run their political machines. 

It gets even more concerning for a political party when you have a situation similar to what the Republican party finds themselves in: it's just a simple fact they have won the popular vote for the presidency *only twice* in the past 32 years (Bush SR. and 2nd term GWB) so any losses they suffer in likely voters eats into their margins deeper than someone working with a clearer majority. Voter laws can make the outcome more fuzzy but at the end of the day if you have less people to turn out and vote for you that's never a good thing and it's potentially disastrous if you capture less people to begin with. 

Frankly I don't know if the US is 'more blue' now or not, but the population dynamics of who's getting the covid vaccine and who's suffering the most deaths should be enough to make *anyone* grit their teeth in concern and sharply inhale through them looking at it. I think the most honest assessment of the situation of which political party will lose more to covid is it's unclear except whoever does end up losing more is going to politically eat dirt over it

Someone was just trying to argue the other day that Covid isn't worth the vaccination, but smallpox was, because smallpox had a 30% kill rate.

Imagine if instead of a pandemic, the emergency was that there were global floods. Some of your “rights” would probably be taken away right? Life wouldn’t be “normal” and any measures we took to fix these problems would most likely be extreme, but everyone would understand and come together for the greater good. People wouldn’t be fighting against the solution. What if only 700,000 people in America drowned from these events, would people be screaming and protesting that only 0.01% died and that they should be able to go about their lives? If the government issued a lifeboat (vaccine) and said 95% of people will be protected would you not take your lifeboat because the 5% chance you could still drown?

For a non-COVID example, check out the CDC's [page](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/hcp/vaccine-derived-poliovirus-faq.html) on polio which can be *caused* by the old-school attenuated-virus Oral Polio Vaccine. The people who are vaccinated don't get sick, but there's a one-in-a-million chance that the attenuated viruses revert back to being able to cause polio in others around them. (Note that all of the cases in the US which the CDC was aware of were in people who were either unvaccinated or had compromised immune systems.)

However, it's also important to note that your infection generally doesn't last as long if you're vaccinated, and you're generally also less able to transmit to other people during the period of your infection (many viruses are more effectively spread by disease symptoms like coughing and sneezing). Think of it as like dumping [fire retardants](https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/What-is-fire-retardant-and-how-does-it-work) on part of a forest before a wildfire burns it.

If you're interested in learning more, watch Racaniello's [video on vaccines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55R09egthg). It's a lecture from last March for his virology class for medical students at Columbia U. He's also got a [livestreamed version](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGhmZX2NKiNnVlm_lAvk50Qy_wWh_7tPL) of the lecture series (with audience Q&amp;A) which just recently started up, so if you wait a few weeks there will be an updated lecture about vaccines.",,,,1633623767,{},hfqtonr,False,t3_pz7g8v,False,True,t1_hfq4h7x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pz7g8v/justice_brett_kavanaugh_has_tested_positive_for/hfqtonr/,1633748466.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't understand why people don't get this.  

There is always a certain population, albeit small, of people who cannot get vaccinated.  Allergy to a vaccine ingredient, whatever.  There are people whose immune systems are too compromised for a vaccine to be safe, for the same reason they can't risk exposure to the virus itself.

Further, there's the *fact* that viruses do mutate.  And herein lies the major problem.  It is *unvaccinated* people who drive the risks of mutations.  What do mutations mean? They mean viruses can evolve to a) be resistant to a vaccine developed for a previous strain, or b) to be more contagious, or c) to be more lethal.

God help you if a virus mutates to be both more lethal *and* more vaccine resistant.

Again, it is unvaccinated people who drive the risk of those more dangerous mutations.  Due to the absence of vaccine-derived antibodies already in place, the course of the virus in an unvaccinated body is longer than in that of a vaxxed person.  The longer the course, the greater the likelihood of a mutation.

And that's before you deal with the reality of medical care for the unvaccinated population.  

If you have a hospital with x number of beds, and those beds fill up with Covid patients, those are fewer beds for other patients who have acute emergencies: someone has a heart attack, a work injury, a car accident, some kid fell off a ladder and landed on something sharp and dirty.  People who need *immediate* medical attention but the local hospitals don't have the resources because all the beds are taken by people who have Covid who likely *wouldn't* have it if they'd gotten the vaccine, almost certainly wouldn't have needed hospitalization if they did get sick.  And this isn't even getting into people who need routine healthcare for chronic conditions (cancer, diabetes, etc.)

So no, it's not enough to just say ""get it if you want, don't get it if you don't.""

[],,duddyface,,,[],,,,text,t2_48fff0kt,False,False,,"The Lancet article has a lot of issues that make me less willing to accept it even if it supports my position.  I think I’d be hypocritical to accept it at face value based on my personal criteria.

The biggest issue I found is that it was paid for by Phizer to study the Phizer vax and they also “approved study design and participated in data interpretations and writing the report”.  Even if the study is legit it’s not independent which makes it suspect.

It was also a retrospective cohort study so they were just interpreting data gathered from elsewhere which can often lead to biased outcomes and this one in particular seems susceptible to that result.

It also weirdly defines “unvaccinated” as someone who didn’t get the Phizer vax but may have received one of the others.

I’ll agree the vaccine also fails to confer 100% immunity and I shouldn’t have used the word guarantee.  As you’ve said, a more apt comparison is *how* effective they are which I feel like we’ve covered already and seems clear that the vaccine is better but I’ll agree that the studies about natural immunity would benefit from more participants (though they do get points from me for being independently reproduced observational studies instead of retrospective).  That also lines up with CDC recommendations so I’m more inclined to trust those results.  We might just have to agree to disagree on this one.

That BMJ article is highly problematic because it references two studies we’ve already discussed here including that Israel study that produced the “13x as likely” number and the one I mentioned where none of their unvaccinated participants contracted COVID a 2nd time and yet they still concluded that natural immunity was nearly 100% effective.

I did however read the section you highlighted and I’m wondering if you read it closely or if you just latched onto an (almost assuredly out of context) quote from Dr Ghandi at the very end that essentially contradicts the entire section including her own conclusions.  As far as I can tell Dr Ghandi is very pro-vax so that seems like a misleading cherry-picked quote.

The actual conclusion of that section is that many “previously infected” are self diagnosed so they don’t know if they’ve really had COVID or not so a “better safe than sorry” approach is recommended.  For the most robust protection people need a combination of vaccine AND natural immunity.  It’s a lot safer to go from vaccine to natural infection than to try to risk natural infection without a vaccine.

Myocarditis risk is approximately 10x higher from getting COVID than from the vaccine.  I wasn’t able to confirm your claims about your risk as a previously infected person from that article you linked though it’s notable that one of the vaccines tested was the AstraZeneca one which is known to have a higher chance of causing heart issues.  Some of the study authors were also paid by Phizer.

Truth is we don’t know what your mycocarditis risk from a 2nd infection is either or if you even have immunity.  We do know that natural COVID can cause all of the same side effects as the vaccine but in a much more severe way so it stands to reason that any reaction to the vax could manifest as a much worse reaction from a future COVID infection.

Ultimately this conversation boils down to you not wanting to get the vaccine because you don’t feel like it will help you and are worried it might harm you, which I understand completely, but doesn’t seem supported by actual data.

It’s interesting you show concern for the well being of people around the globe by offering to forfeit your shot to them (even though a lot of those shots will expire/be discarded before they get shipped somewhere else thus wasting tax dollars) but you’re ignoring the potential well being of people in your own community including yourself.

Also I appreciate you debating in a civil way and actually backing up your claims to the best of your ability.

[],,danysdragons,,,[],,,,text,t2_36453,False,False,,"I agree that it's difficult to draw conclusions from that kind of self-reported data, and stress could be a factor. But there are other types of evidence that are more objective -- a British study involving actual brain scans looks especially alarming.

The researchers were able to take advantage of a unique resource, the database UK Biobank, which has brain imaging data from over 45,000 people, taken before the pandemic. They then conducted new brain scans for the purpose of the study.

This allowed them to compare the brains of:

1. The same individuals, pre-pandemic and at the time of the study, who have never contracted COVID-19.
2. The same individuals, pre-pandemic and at the time of the study, who ***had*** contracted COVID-19.

There was evidence of loss of gray matter in the second group. The greatest loss was in the olfactory lobe (related to smell), and in the brain regions most closely connected to that lobe, but was not limited to those areas.

What’s especially concerning is that these losses were not limited to those people ill enough to be hospitalized, but also occurred with those who had only mild cases. And the brain imaging data was supplemented with tests of cognitive ability, showing that those who had suffered from COVID-19 were slower at processing information.

[Brain imaging before and after COVID-19 in UK Biobank](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.11.21258690)

[Cognitive deficits in people who have recovered from COVID-19](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.101044)

&gt;People who had recovered from COVID-19, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits versus controls when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group, pre-existing medical disorders, tiredness, depression and anxiety. The deficits were of substantial effect size for people who had been hospitalised (N = 192), but also for non-hospitalised cases who had biological confirmation of COVID-19 infection (N = 326). Analysing markers of premorbid intelligence did not support these differences being present prior to infection.

I've been immuno-compromised for more than a decade now, I have crohn's and MS, but more's the reason that I needed to get vaccinated. In fact, I had to time it extremely specifically. That just so happened to require me to drive ~7 hours to get a vaccination but y'know what? I did it. My MS drugs alone, with no co-morbidities, reflected a 4x fatality rate compared with the general population. And y'know, I have multiple co-morbidities. And multiple immuno-suppressants. Not great. 

I'm sure that there are in fact people who cannot be vaccinated, but as a guy who has a lot of health conditions I gotta say: hard pressed to believe there's so many people medically worse off than I am.

Moderna seems to have better stats against delta but it doesn't seem clear there's one reason why: could be the 100mcg dose vs the 30mcg dose or it could be more effective or maybe it had to do with slight differences in when pfizer vs moderna was released (at least as far as I can glean from different articles.)

thank you for the correction and comparison on the various R0s of different strains. 

One saving grace, morbid as it is, is Delta once it puts you in the hospital, is killing people in 3-4 weeks (anecdotal reporting) versus 2 months. That is good in terms of flipping beds and having the staff and machine to be able to ""save"" the few people who actually make it out the other side, typically with shot lungs, probably on long term anti blood clot medicines, and lots of physical therapy in your future. Oh, and often with a tracheostomy from being intubated for a long time. 

Other differences I've read are obviously it's targetting younger people much more severely but due to vaccination it's hard to tell if it's actually deadlier for younger people or if it's just younger people who are likely to be unvaccinated. 


The numbers are supporting pregnant women being an easy target. Mississippi released numbers a couple weeks back that their fetal deaths have doubled but I find this a little on the low side because it says the numbers are only something like 78 versus 36 individual fetal deaths. As a percentage change, yes that is big. But considering something like 30% of natural pregnancies precovid result in a miscarriage I have to wonder if a lot of miscarriages are being uncounted. If possible it would be nice to have some sort of public awareness campaign to start counting miscarriages but due to the emotional pain of that and the now divisive nature of idiots acting like covid doesn't exist, that just will not happen. 


As far as the pregnant women go, a lot more of them are dying as well. Anecdotally it seems like the babies are often able to be saved, but that's still supremely fucked. The easiest way (if you are pregnant or know someone who is) to explain it is your body is so busy being pregnant that you basically are classified as immunocompromised because your immune system will not work the same as it did when you were not pregnant. On the upside, if you are vaccinated, nothing so far has shown harm to the fetus or to the babies post-birth. In fact there seems to be some antibodies conferred from the mother's body to the baby which is why breastfeeding also may confer antibodies. So getting vaccinated at any stage, before pregnancy, during or after can be good for you and your baby (though obviously talk to your obgyn or you GP if you have them.)


Sadly, more stories about kids and teenagers dying are popping up but they still are in the low, discountable stages for people still willing to believe it won't happen to them or their kid. If it was a roving gang of serial killers, no kid would be let outside their house. But because it's a virus, well let God protect us. Orbelieve that kids die much less often (which they do) but still may suffer long term effects (I'm suuuper curious about the ""asthmatics"" category going forward, in terms of numbers, percentage rates, and various quality of life adjustments. Student sports may very well take a huge hit from lowered available pool *able* to play, let alone interested.)",,,,1633592227,{},hfpd2oe,False,t3_q2owwg,False,True,t1_hfoau51,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q2owwg/more_americans_died_of_covid_this_year_than_all/hfpd2oe/,1633720430.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the things we're dealing with now is trying to figure out how to grant temporary exceptions for people who claim to have recently been infected and need to wait the set time before vaccination, but their positive test results are unavailable. (Side note, it's also super fun learning how many people who never took a day off work claim to have had a recent positive test result). Antibody testing is an option, but then the question becomes who is responsible for providing the testing. And as another poster said, we don't want to encourage people to get infected to avoid the vaccine.

Here is what I think.

1.	⁠People lie. They say they have had COVID and haven't.
2.	⁠People are stupid. They truly believe they have had COVID and haven't.
3.	⁠Blood serum tests to determine antibodies are expensive and time-consuming.
4.	⁠Getting one of the vaccines after having COVID doesn't hurt you.

I asked what data this was and you provided a link to a study that showed the protection provided by both previous infection AND vaccination was greater than previous infection alone. I therefore pointed out that this does not show that vaccination alone provides greater protection than previous infection alone, as this was not what was being studied. If you see that as moving the goal post then so be it.

So Dr Lawlers first argument is that there are significant differences between the two groups due to selection biases. The researchers accounted for this by:
""These groups were matched in a 1:1 ratio by age, sex, GSA and time of first event. The first event (the preliminary exposure) was either the time of administration of the second dose of the vaccine or the time of documented infection with SARS-CoV-2 (a positive RT-PCR test result).

His second argument is about survivorship bias- that it does not include those who died from first infection. This is only relevant to a theoretical question of ""what protection does previous infection provide, if we were somehow able to measure how protected dead people are aswell"" 
It is not relevant if you are asking ""how protected are those who have been previously infected compared to those who have been vaccinated?"" This is the question that needs to be asked when creating policies that allow certain rights to vaccinated people, but not previously infected.

Have Dr Lawler's comments been peer reviewed? Have his own biases affected his judgment of the paper? Should you take in more than one analysis of the paper? 

Finally,  just because the CDC uses a study, does not mean that the statistical importance of large sample sizes no longer exists. Just because they don't post a study doesnt mean it isn't reliable. There's thousands of valid studies that the CDC havent posted.

That may be a downside of the vaccine, yes. In the future there may be new preventative measures in place to replace the existing covid-19 vaccines. We're working with what we have here.

If I need to stop in to get vaccinated 3x a year instead of 1x a year (Covid + Covid + Flu, vs Flu) that's not that big of a deal.

&gt;Also if we get to 100% vaccination rate then 100% of the people that are hospitalized for Covid will be vaccinated

Yes. Because that's how percentages work. Want to know how else percentages work?

Let's say there's a population of 200,000 people. 50% are vaccinated, 50% aren't. In the vaccinated group, there are at any time 15 people in the hospital. In the unvaccinated group, there are at any time 300 hospitalized.

At any given time, 95% of the hospitalized population is unvaccinated and 5% are vaccinated.

Over time, all 200,000 members of the population get vaccinated. That means that all 300 members that belonged to the unvaccinated group of hospitalization are gone, and in their place 15 more vaccinated people are hospitalized.

As you said, now 100% of the hospitalized population is vaccinated. But the amount of people hospitalized? 30 vs 315, or 9.5% of the original amount and 5% of what the population would be if there were no vaccinations.

So I hope you see that ""but now 100% of the hospitalizations will be vaccinated!"" is an empty, stupid rebuttal.

Moderna developed a booster tailored to Beta (the B.1.351 or South African variant) and put it through limited testing.  It worked better against that variant than the original vaccine used as a booster, but the original used as a booster also worked very well.  They never applied for FDA approval for it.  The original as a booster also works extremely well against Delta, and I don't believe anyone is working on a Delta specific booster.  If a new variant emerges that warrants a specific booster, it will take time to develop one, test it, and get it through the approval process.

Not only do the vaccines help protect those who are vaccinated against hospitalization/death, it also lowers the rate of hospitalizations overall.  This keeps resources free at hospitals to treat other medical issues, such as stroke or heart attack.

Imagine a world where you have something relatively routine like an appendicitis but there's no where you can get treatment because the hospitals are overwhelmed with covid patients. They tell you to check back in a few hours, or even a few days, to see if they have resources available.  However, in that time, your appendix ruptures, you go into shock, and pass away from the infection.  The treatment, initially, should have been a relatively routine and easy fix through minimally invasive surgery.  In the end, you pass away from something modern medicine has completely solved but just didn't have the capacity to handle because, largely unvaccinated, covid patients were using the hospital's resources.    It's worst case scenario for sure, but also not as far fetched as it sounds in some areas of the country/world.

[],,sharkinwolvesclothin,,,[],,,,text,t2_91r0t,False,False,[],"The second study is problematic because it's a cross-sectional observational study: it's not comparing people before and after covid, but people who didn't have covid and people who did, attempting to make the groups similar by statistically controlling for the factors listed. So, essentially, they look at a 30-year old male with a HS diploma and $35k salary etc who didn't have covid to similar who did, and see the mean difference between similar people. This difference could be because those who got covid got dumber or because those who did not get covid were smarter to start with (maybe reflected in better adherence to mask use etc).

They do say the analysed premorbid intelligence, but that wasn't by having the same people do the tests - that was by separate model predicting cognitive performance by age (to the third order), sex, handedness, ethnicity, first language, country of residence, occupational status and earning. So that model can only find out differences that are due to those issues. There's a small group they have pre and post tests for, but they don't really report anything on it.

And the cognitive deficit they find for the stayed at home cases is not very substantial: it is -0.07 standard deviations. Depression had a very similar effect (0.061) but positive (also statistically significant). Feeling nervous or on edge also offset the covid effect almost exactly (0.068). Why aren't we seeing headline about how depression makes you smarter? It's because with the huge numbers, even small, meaningless effects can be statistically significant. And statistically significant doesn't mean ""causal"" or even ""likely to persist to the next study"". In fact, studies on depression generally find a negative effect, so why this data happens to show a positive effect should be evaluated (or, just discarded as a data quirk with practically 0 effect, along the mild-covid cognitive deficit).

They got their data by going on tv and promoting an online questionnaire, and their argument is that because they don't mention covid in the promotion, it's a good sample with no selection issues.

So that study comes with many massive asterisks for the result. The first study is much better because it has pre- and post-imaging and the question is set more reasonably, but like they say, ""Whether this deleterious impact can be partially reversed, for instance after improvement of the hyposmic symptoms, or whether these are effects that will persist in the long term, remains to be investigated"".",,,,1633631651,{},hfrd0z0,False,t3_q33gn1,False,True,t1_hfq7yvh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q33gn1/daily_discussion_thread_october_07_2021/hfrd0z0/,1633758211.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Last year they reported 57k covid deaths, but had 362k excess deaths.

I don't think you can trust daily new cases either. E.g. no correlation of nr of cases and share of positive test.

Not sure if 30% are vaccinated either. There are ways to buy fake vaccination certs. Not sure how many got Sputnik light (first dose in the Sputnik V), or got other vaccines like EpiVac. Some people signed up for Sputnik, but figured out later they got EpiVac.

[],,HyprSl0th,,,[],,,,text,t2_4sfhkjjx,False,False,[],"As someone that watches the stats almost on a daily basis at first then weekly, it would seem to me that the % of hospitalizations and the % of deaths, prior to any vaccine, was equal to what we are seeing with breakthrough cases in a recent study for pfizer vaccine showing a significant fall off after 2nd dose.  IN fact, the study says after 2 months the drop of if very significant for protection from getting covid, 90% do not get hospitalized and the death rate is below 2% but not sharply..which is about the rate prior to the vaccines.

I wonder if , retooling the vaccine to match delta would be a better option.  Or is the thought process, as soon as we prepare a vaccine for delta there will be another variant?

The other thing that concerns me is, the numbers of infections.  SURE people are going about their lives like there is no pandemic, not wearing masks in crowded situations.  If this was prior to the vaccine Im sure our numbers would be through the roof, but at this point with the numbers of people that have had covid and the number of vaccinated, why are the numbers so high?  Deaths seem slightly lower than the last wave in April in the US but overall the numbers seem to match.

Edit: I should note that I received the Pfizer vaccine, but opted to space my 2nd shot out by two months which was a VERY unpopular thought prior, but now it would seem was a very wise decision.  I also recall many in the subs freaking out when anyone would state they know someone that was vaccinated and still got sick, without pre existing conditions, telling them they were lying.

On top of that, he messes himself every time this happens and someone has to clean the feces off of him at the hospital.

We thought that because he agreed to go to treatment, he would no longer need his one room place. Of course he reneged on going the next day when it was time for his transport. It was a one-year treatment facility that would have really helped him. This has been offered again and again and again. He will sign himself out, walk out the front door, pass out, and be taken to the emergency room again. It is a vicious cycle.

 We went over to clean his place this last time because we truly thought he would go to the treatment facility. I personally cleaned up about 4 in of feces in the bathroom, in the shower, and trailed into a common room.

I am done. He can live in a pile of feces for all I care. Of course my parents do not feel that way, as he is their kid. They will continue to support him, which means he will continue to do whatever the hell he wants.

The process to get approved for a transplant was insane. He had to:

1. Agree to give up drinking and all drugs. He didn't do much beyond drinking, but it was all out the window. 

2. His family had to be part of this agreement. They had to support him in not drinking, the transplant process, the recovery, and with any financial issues that might arise. His family had to agree to pay for the anti-rejection meds if he was unable to do so. 

3. He had to turn over his bank records to prove he was financially capable of supporting the ongoing treatments after the transplant. 

4. He had to agree to give up his driver's license for a year and limit all travel. This was to prevent him from being in a car accident during the healing process.

5. He had to have all other medical conditions addressed, including being fully vaccinate. He had to agree to live a completely healthy life style.

6. This was all put in a contract that he and his family had to sign. 

He told me they do all that because 300 people a day die waiting for a liver. The whole process was over $2m. You have to prove you deserve to be one of the people who deserve a second chance on life. At one point the doctors told him he had maybe 5 days left if he didn't get a transplant.

I told him that not everyone gets that chance and he better make it count. He has done everything required and is still going strong several years later.

[],,duddyface,,,[],,,,text,t2_48fff0kt,False,False,,"I never said study A was valid and study B wasn’t … in fact, they actually seem to be coming to the same conclusion which is that anywhere from 20-36% of natural infections do not result in long term immunity:

“however, we observed that 25% of donors had neutralizing levels that dropped to an undetectable titer over time.”

The same effect only seems to be in the 2-10% range for vaccinated individuals.

I completely disagree that listening to CDC guidance and giving more weight to their conclusions is confirmation bias because that’s literally their entire job and until you can produce a compelling reason for me to believe they’re fabricating data I’m going to defer to actual experts over unfounded studies that contradict them.

It’s hard for me to believe “we just don’t know which is better” when actual experts are definitively saying that being vaccinated is better than not; even for those previously affected.

I’m not some Dunning-Kruger type who thinks I’m smarter than I am.  I recognize I’m massively unqualified to be interpreting this data myself so I’m going to listen to the people who have studied this their entire lives.  Unless you’re an epidemiologist or infectious disease expert (like many of the people you’re disagreeing with) then I think it’s ridiculous you think your interpretation and ‘research’ has equal weight to theirs.

The burden of proof is on you to refute expert medical advice and not on me, an unqualified amateur, to prove they’re right.

You chopped off the most relevant part of my quote as well.  What I said was:

“The actual conclusion of that section is that many “previously infected” are self diagnosed so they don’t know if they’ve really had COVID or not **so a “better safe than sorry” approach is recommended.  For the most robust protection people need a combination of vaccine AND natural immunity.** It’s a lot safer to go from vaccine to natural infection than to try to risk natural infection without a vaccine.”

This conclusion was derived from this quote in your BMJ article:

““As we continued to put effort into vaccination and set targets, it became apparent to me that people were forgetting that herd immunity is formed by both natural immunity and vaccine immunity,” says Klausner.”

Who made that quote?  Dr Jeffrey Klausner, an infectious disease expert, and adviser to the CDC.  He *does* seem to be an outspoken advocate for treating natural immunity the same as vaccination however his opinion is not widely accepted among the medical community and the steps necessary to factor natural infections into the equation outweigh any potential benefits.  As another doctor said in the same section:

“It’s a lot easier to put a shot in their arm,” says Sommer. “To do a PCR test or to do an antibody test and then to process it and then to get the information to them and then to let them think about it—it’s a lot easier to just give them the damn vaccine.” In public health, “the primary objective is to protect as many people as you can,” he says. “It’s called collective insurance, and I think it’s irresponsible from a public health perspective to let people pick and choose what they want to do.”

You only seem interested in using the parts of the article that support your bias and ignoring the fact that almost every single person quoted, even ones arguing for natural immunity, still concede that getting vaccinated is better than not.

I actually tried to find that last piece of information you asked for before I made my last post but there just doesn’t seem to be any data on the topic.  Again, I’m just an amateur, but logically it would seem like having 2 forms of protection is better than one and that also seems to be supported by data and expert opinion.

The reality is that if you want to get by on natural immunity then you’re going to have to essentially confirm your negative results on an almost constant basis which is going to be expensive, inconvenient, and potentially deadly because a lot of “previous infections” are self diagnosed whereas the vaccine is documented and verifiable.

If I had to bet my life on something I wouldn’t want to bet it on the honor system because the anti-vax/mask crowd has demonstrated they’re more than willing to lie and ignore precautions to avoid even a minor inconvenience.

If we open up natural immunity then what’s to stop someone from just saying “I already had COVID”.  It couldn’t ever be verified the way vaccination can and that’s not good enough for me (and seemingly the majority of the medical community as well).",,,,1633628218,{},hfr4nx1,False,t3_q2ckda,False,True,t1_hfqrtsv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q2ckda/hospital_system_says_it_will_deny_transplants_to/hfr4nx1/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,,aacccff36d293fa91d6fd55c2e8c6abb145f1bc0,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1633628231.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Both vaccines build and create the memory cells responsible for creating a response against the virus, which is key for fighting off Covid. It does seem that those who took Pfizer will need a booster shot, but the same will apply to Moderna as well.

[],,danysdragons,,,[],,,,text,t2_36453,False,False,[],"Neurological symptoms from Long Covid don’t seem to get enough attention. I find particularly concerning some of the research coming out of Britain:

One study claims to demonstrate a significant loss of the brain’s gray matter among people who have recovered from COVID-19, and this *does* include people who had only mild cases. This shrinkage is reportedly greatest in the olfactory lobe and directly connected regions, but is not limited to those regions.

[Brain imaging before and after COVID-19 in UK Biobank](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.11.21258690)

Another study claims to show a decline in cognitive function, with “substantial effect size”, among people who had COVID-19 — again, *not* limited to those who severe cases.

[Cognitive deficits in people who have recovered from COVID-19](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00324-2/fulltext)

&gt;People who had recovered from COVID-19, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits versus controls when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group, pre-existing medical disorders, tiredness, depression and anxiety. The **deficits were of substantial effect size for people who had been hospitalised (N = 192), but also for non-hospitalised cases who had biological confirmation of COVID-19 infection (N = 326)**. Analysing markers of premorbid intelligence did not support these differences being present prior to infection. **Finer grained analysis of performance across sub-tests supported the hypothesis that COVID-19 has a multi-domain impact on human cognition**.

Being fully vaccinated reduces the risk of becoming infected, and reduces the predicted severity of the illness. But in these studies there didn’t seem to be a strong relationship between the severity of the acute illness and the loss of brain tissue and cognitive function. And right now the prevailing view seems to be, “We’ll be living with Covid forever, everyone’s going to get Covid at some point”.

Do we have any grounds for confidence that a vaccinated person suffering a mild case of COVID-19 will be much less prone to acquiring this neurological damage and decline in cognitive function, compared to an unvaccinated person with a case of the same severity? There’s been only very limited research on whether vaccination provides significant protection from Long Covid. Even if it turned out that vaccination provides a moderately reduced risk of brain damage, this would not be *that* reassuring.

There’s a lot of uncertainty here, but it seems like there’s a realistic possibility that a very large fraction of the population could literally end up with brain damage from COVID-19 breakthrough infections. And meanwhile, public health authorities are reassuring the public that once vaccinated, COVID-19 is nothing to worry about, just like a bad cold basically.

We can look at Portugal and see that the vaccine is having a much larger positive effect than the negative effect of Delta.  Cases are a good clip lower than their pre-vaccine/Delta peak.  Same story with deaths.

In the US?  

It's probably a little tipped towards the vaccine, but it's definitely closer and we won't really know until we make it through the holiday season.  But we can definitely conclude that ""far far worse"" is an overhype because deaths and cases are still lower than pre-vaccine/Delta peak.  And I'd argue that people are distancing/masking/etc. a lot less than they were during the Oct/early Nov build-up to the peak.  Obviously come the holidays we threw caution to the wind and we'll see what happens this year.

And then you've got Romania where the vaccination rate is still low and Delta is having a more negative effect than vaccines a positive one.  ""Far Far Worse?""  Idk, depends on exactly what you mean, but it's definitely worse at their current vaccination rates.


Edit:

&gt;   whereas vaccination is much more linear.

Please expound, because I think you're wrong here but am not quite sure what you are saying.

There is already enough problems with compliance post transplant. I see it first hand, weekly.

Imagine trusting the medical system enough to put yourself and your friend through major, life altering surgery, but not enough to get a simple, effective inoculation. 

Religious exemption? Guess what-  all the treatments and anti rejection meds you’ll need after your transplant involve drugs that were tested on the same stem cell lines you’re probably refusing the vaccine for. The required anti-rejection drugs have serious and KNOWN long term side effects… not the theoretical ones you’re refusing the vaccine for. Your life post- transplant is forever changed now with the addition of strict drug regimens, doctor follow ups, and frequent blood work. And yet for the rational person, all of that is still worth not dying of organ failure.

Therefore, because of your inability to risk assess and listen to the scientists and doctors/nurses who would work their ass off to do even this transplant for you, UCHealth can’t be sure you’re even going to be willing to take care of the kidney after it’s gifted to you. Not to mention that you and your kidney are statistically unlikely to survive a preventable, serious COVID infection without MINIMUM a vaccination… especially after transplant (assuming you’re taking the proper immunocompromising drugs).

So why would they put forth ANY effort to give you a kidney?

We think of continuous debilitating symptoms when we hear long covid, and that is a thing - but it's rare. 

In the study I linked for example they used any appearance of a symptom from their list between days 90 and 180 since infection, as long as it was diagnosed by a doctor. The list included anxiety, undefined pain, and many other things people just get regularly. The study did not analyze whether the symptom was caused by covid. So some of the patients just had anxiety/depression (the top symptom in the study), nothing else, and many people do in the pandemic. 

The study has scientific value, as the actual result is in the comparison between covid patients and flu patients, and yes, covid patients have more post viral issues. Unfortunately, the headline reading of 37% get long covid is pretty worthless, as it's such a massive spectrum of situations, and leads people to think it means 37% are continuously ill and have organ damage and all that. 

As for reddit, that's called selection bias. You don't get a random sample of people talking about their corona experience, you get those who have continued symptoms.

&gt;The agency said that its shipments of medical supplies, together with international supplies destined for North Korea, had become stranded in China after Pyongyang sealed the country’s borders in January 2020 when Covid-19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern.

&gt;North Korea’s Ministry of Public Health told the agency several months ago that it would allow the stranded supplies to be transported through the northern Chinese port of Dalian, a W.H.O. spokesman, Tarik Jasarevic, said in an emailed statement.

&gt;As a result, the agency had sent some of the medical supplies and equipment to the North Korean port of Nampo, he said.

&gt;North Korea has not reported any Covid-19 infections, and it turned down several offers of vaccines, including ones from the United Nations-backed Covax facility and from Russia. But North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, said in June that lapses in his country’s anti-pandemic campaign had caused a “great crisis” that threatened “grave consequences,” according to the state media. He did not clarify whether he was referring to an outbreak within the country.

&gt;The W.H.O. said its shipments to North Korea included health kits, medicines and other medical supplies that would support essential health services at primary health care centers.

&gt;Merck said in June that the United States had agreed to buy enough pills for 1.7 million treatments, at a cost of $1.2 billion. This week, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea said that they had reached agreements with the drug maker to buy the pills, even though their regulatory agencies have yet to approve the drug. Thailand and Taiwan are also in talks with Merck to buy them, Reuters reported.

&gt;While many nations in Asia had a slow start at vaccinating against Covid-19, countries including Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea have now administered more vaccine doses than the United States per capita. Merck’s treatment, the first oral antiviral drug that can be taken at home, is expected to help limit the impact of future outbreaks and reduce the need for costly hospital treatment.

&gt;A patient would take four capsules twice a day for five days, or 40 pills total.

&gt;Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia said on Tuesday that his government had agreed to buy 300,000 courses, pending regulatory authorization, which could happen in early 2022.

&gt;”Vaccines and new treatments like this will boost our national plan to safely reopen Australia and keep Australia safely open,” he said in a statement.

&gt;Malaysia has struck a deal to secure 150,000 treatments, its health minister, Khairy Jamaluddin, said on Thursday. “This complements our successful vaccination rollout,” he said in a tweet, adding that the ministry would continue to buy more treatment options.

&gt;South Korea secured enough pills for more than 20,000 treatments and is continuing talks with the company to secure more, the office of Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum said on Wednesday. The government has budgeted to buy 38,000 doses of the drug in total this year and next year, it said in a statement.

&gt;Singapore also secured a deal to purchase the drug, Merck said in a statement on Wednesday, according to Reuters. The health ministry confirmed the deal to Reuters but did not disclose the number of pills citing commercial sensitivities.

&gt;Merck did not immediately respond to an early morning request for comment by telephone and email.

&gt;Merck has said it plans to seek emergency authorization for the pills to be used in the United States. Initially, the drug might be available only for people considered high risk, such as older people or those with comorbidities, though experts say that the pills could eventually become more widely available.

&gt;White House officials have said that people should get vaccinated even if Merck’s pill cuts deaths.

&gt;At the Visiting Nurse Service of New York, the state’s largest home health care organization, about 400 workers are expected to be unable to work after the mandate takes effect. And in the New York City area, a union leader for home health care workers says he expects thousands of his members will be put on leave.

&gt;”We need more time,” said Joe Pecora, the vice president of Home Healthcare Workers of America, a union that represents about 32,000 home health care workers in New York City and its suburbs. “It’s unrealistic to get all these people vaccinated by the deadline.”

&gt;One week after requiring more than 650,000 hospital and nursing home workers to get at least one dose of the vaccine, New York State’s pioneering mandate for health care workers is moving into a second and likely more difficult phase: requiring at least 250,000 home health care workers to get at least one dose of the vaccine before Friday or face the threat of losing their jobs.

&gt;While the first phase of the mandate was widely viewed as successful in pressuring thousands of nurses, doctors, technicians and orderlies to get the vaccine, many industry officials say they fear this second phase will result in thousands of workers simply quitting their jobs and finding new work in restaurants, retail or other industries. Most home health care aides, many of them immigrants, are paid about minimum wage and could find jobs paying similar wages elsewhere.

&gt;Without enough workers to go around, patients recovering from stints in the hospital or elderly New Yorkers who rely on long-term aides for assistance with everything from grocery shopping to bathing could find their care reduced or ended. The shortage could also exacerbate patient backlogs at hospitals, which often discharge patients with the support of in-home care.

&gt;”Even a small percentage of home care workers no longer working will impact thousands of homebound individuals,” said Dan Savitt, the president and chief executive of the Visiting Nurse Service of New York. “The rough math here is for every 1 percent of full-time aides unavailable, there are about 1,500 Medicaid members that will be impacted.”

&gt;Some industry officials estimate that only seven of 10 home health care workers in the state are vaccinated, causing many of the agencies that employ the workers to brace for staffing shortages starting Friday. Many leaders are also calling on Gov. Kathy Hochul to extend the deadline.

&gt; Campaigners for the drug point to a number of scientific studies and often claim this evidence is being ignored or covered up. But a review by a group of independent scientists has cast serious doubt on that body of research.

&gt; The BBC can reveal that more than a third of 26 major trials of the drug for use on Covid have serious errors or signs of potential fraud. None of the rest show convincing evidence of ivermectin's effectiveness.

&gt; Dr Kyle Sheldrick, one of the group investigating the studies, said they had not found ""a single clinical trial"" claiming to show that ivermectin prevented Covid deaths that did not contain ""either obvious signs of fabrication or errors so critical they invalidate the study"".

&gt; Major problems included:

&gt; • The same patient data being used multiple times for supposedly different people

&gt; • Evidence that selection of patients for test groups was not random

&gt; • Numbers unlikely to occur naturally

&gt; • Percentages calculated incorrectly

&gt; • Local health bodies unaware of the studies

The scientists in the group - Dr Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, Dr James Heathers, Dr Nick Brown and Dr Sheldrick - each have a track record of exposing dodgy science. They've been working together remotely on an informal and voluntary basis during the pandemic.

&gt; They formed a group looking deeper into ivermectin studies after biomedical student Jack Lawrence spotted problems with an influential study from Egypt. Among other issues, it contained patients who turned out to have died before the trial started. It has now been retracted by the journal that published it.

&gt; The group of independent scientists examined virtually every randomised controlled trial (RCT) on ivermectin and Covid - in theory the highest quality evidence - including all the key studies regularly cited by the drug's promoters.

&gt; RCTs involve people being randomly chosen to receive either the drug which is being tested or a placebo - a dummy drug with no active properties.

&gt; The team also looked at six particularly influential observational trials. This type of trial looks at what happens to people who are taking the drug anyway, so can be biased by the types of people who choose to take the treatment.

…

&gt; Out of a total of 26 studies examined, there was evidence in five that the data may have been faked - for example they contained virtually impossible numbers or rows of identical patients copied and pasted.

&gt; In a further five there were major red flags - for example, numbers didn't add up, percentages were calculated incorrectly or local health bodies weren't aware they had taken place.

&gt; On top of these flawed trials, there were 14 authors of studies who failed to send data back. The independent scientists have flagged this as a possible indicator of fraud.

&gt; The sample of research papers examined by the independent group also contains some high-quality studies from around the world. **But the major problems were all in the studies making big claims for ivermectin - in fact, the bigger the claim in terms of lives saved or infections prevented, the greater the concerns suggesting it might be faked or invalid**, the researchers discovered.

… 

&gt; A recent study in Lebanon was found to have blocks of details of 11 patients that had been copied and pasted repeatedly - suggesting many of the trial's apparent patients didn't really exist.

&gt; **The study's authors told the BBC that the ""original set of data was rigged, sabotaged or mistakenly entered in the final file"" and that they have submitted a retraction to the scientific journal which published it.**

&gt; Another study from Iran seemed to show that ivermectin prevented people dying from Covid.
But the scientists who investigated it found issues. The records of how much iron was in patients' blood contained numbers in a sequence that was unlikely to come up naturally. And the patients given the placebo turned out to have had much lower levels of oxygen in their blood before the trial started than those given ivermectin. So they were already sicker and statistically more likely to die.

&gt; But this pattern was repeated across a wide range of different measurements. **The people with ""bad"" measurements ended up in the placebo group, the ones with ""good"" measurements in the ivermectin group**.

&gt; The likelihood of this happening randomly across all these different measurements was vanishingly small, Dr Sheldrick said.

&gt; But the Lebanon and Iran trials were excluded from a paper for Cochrane - the international experts in reviewing scientific evidence - because they were ""such poorly reported studies"". The review concluded there was no evidence of benefit for ivermectin when it comes to Covid.

…

&gt; The largest and highest quality ivermectin study published so far is the Together trial at the McMaster University in Canada. It found no benefit for the drug when it comes to Covid.

…

&gt; Calls over suspected ivermectin poisonings in the US have increased a lot but from a very small base (435 to 1,143 this year) and most of these cases were not serious. Patients have had vomiting, diarrhoea, hallucinations, confusion, drowsiness and tremors.

&gt; But indirect harm can come from giving people a false sense of security, especially if they choose ivermectin instead of seeking hospital treatment for Covid, or getting vaccinated in the first place.

&gt;The company said that a new “state of the art” facility would eventually produce up to 500 million doses a year of Moderna’s mRNA vaccine, which has shown an efficacy rate of more than 90 percent in preventing Covid-19. The plant will, in time, also produce other Moderna vaccines, the company said.

&gt;Building vaccine manufacturing sites in Africa will increase the continent’s future access to the drugs. But it does not answer calls from African leaders and activists to waive patent laws that would give more drugmakers access to details on how coronavirus vaccines are produced. It also does not address the continent’s immediate Covid-19 vaccine shortages.

&gt;”It doesn’t necessarily solve our problems today,” Dr. John Nkengasong, the director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a regular news briefing on Thursday. “The problems we have are quick access to vaccines, redistribution of vaccines, making sure that certain licenses are provided so that manufacturing can start regionally.”

&gt;The drug makers Pfizer and BioNTech said in July that they had partnered with Biovac, a public-private partnership pharmaceutical company in Cape Town. In Gqeberha, the South African coastal city formerly known as Port Elizabeth, Johnson &amp; Johnson has partnered with Aspen, a local manufacturer, in a fill-and-finish manufacturing process.

&gt;Moderna said that it expected to invest up to $500 million in its future site, and that its facility would manufacture the doses with fill-and-finish capacity, in addition to packaging facilities.

&gt;It said it would now begin the process of identifying which country would host the plant.

&gt;”While we are still working to increase capacity in our current network to deliver vaccines for the ongoing pandemic in 2022, we believe it is important to invest in the future,” said Stephane Bancel, Moderna’s chief executive.

&gt;African leaders had already established the Partnerships for African Vaccine Manufacturing, which works within an existing “ecosystem” of Africa’s vaccine needs. Launched in April, it has political backing from the continent’s leaders, including Presidents Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and Paul Kagame of Rwanda.

&gt;Ten countries have already expressed interest in developing and upscaling their manufacturing capacity through the partnership, Dr. Nkengasong said.

&gt;”We can bring them all together and put Moderna at the center,” he said, “and that will really speak to the need to be transparent but also to be cooperative and to coordinate on efforts.”

&gt;Moderna’s announcement comes amid mounting pressure on biotech firms to share their expertise with manufacturers in countries that desperately need more coronavirus vaccine doses.

&gt;Moderna, an American drug company, developed its coronavirus vaccine with billions of dollars in taxpayer money. The Massachusetts-headquartered company also received initial research and development funding from Covax, the vaccine sharing facility supported by the global vaccine alliance Gavi and the World Health Organization.

&gt;Moderna also signed a purchase agreement with Covax in May that has delivered over eight million doses to African countries, according to a Gavi spokesman. Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, has received nearly half of the consignment of the double-shot vaccine, and Ghana, Kenya and Tunisia have each received over a million doses.",,,,1633621338,{},hfqnpk4,True,t3_q3bsul,False,False,t3_q3bsul,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q3bsul/moderna_says_it_will_build_a_vaccine_factory_in/hfqnpk4/,1633745385.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on what evidence?!?! At no point have you provided any evidence that this is true. The only way you can prove this is true is through a comparative study. I am not going to agree to disagree that the vaccine alone is more effective than previous infection alone without such evidence. Please back up this claim to the best of your ability.

""That also lines up with CDC recommendations so I’m more inclined to trust those results.""

That is the definiton of confirmation bias. Please question why the CDC are having to use studies with such obvious limitations (such as small sample size), rather than assuming the flaws are irrelevant because the CDC have used the study. 

There is no logical reason to believe the findings of study A: [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/9/21-1042\_article](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/9/21-1042_article)

Over the findings of study B:

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34089610/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34089610/)

n=228

This is important as your belief that vaccination provides better protection than previous infection is largely based on your belief of the findings of study A, over the findings of study B.

""It’s a lot safer to go from vaccine to natural infection than to try to risk natural infection without a vaccine.""

I have never argued otherwise. I, and millions of others, were infected before the vaccine was available and this point is completely irrelvant in those instances.

""The actual conclusion of that section is that many “previously infected” are self diagnosed so they don’t know if they’ve really had COVID""

I am not self diagnosed. I had symptons associated with coivd infection and I then had a positive PCR test result. The same PCR test result that was used to determine previous infection is this CDC study [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/9/21-1042\_article](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/9/21-1042_article)

Yet for three crucial months this summer, Nebraska did not report any county-level information to the public. State officials stopped sharing counts of new coronavirus cases by county with the public on June 30, just as the Delta variant began surging in the United States.

That was by design. Gov. Pete Ricketts, a Republican who opposes both mask and vaccine mandates, allowed his emergency order to expire in June, and the state’s unusually strict privacy laws were reinstated, which he said prohibited the continued release of the data.

At the time, the number of new cases in Nebraska had reached a low in the state, and Test Nebraska, which gave free virus tests to hundreds of thousands of residents, ended its operations shortly after the emergency ended.

The virus continued to spread in the state, however, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant. Hospitalizations increased tenfold from the end of June through mid-September. New cases rose sharply in August. Deaths increased as well.

On Sept. 20, after coronavirus hospitalizations surpassed 10 percent of the state’s capacity of staffed hospital beds, Mr. Ricketts announced that county-level case data would once again be made public on a new “hospital capacity” state dashboard.

But he said the data will disappear again if the number drops below 10 percent on a 7-day rolling average. And the state is still not reporting county-level deaths.

Public health experts in Nebraska were dismayed all summer about the decision to delete the dashboard, and state legislators wrote a letter requesting that it be restored.

A handful of the state’s 93 counties continued to provide daily data on their websites throughout the pandemic because they have more than 20,000 residents.

That meant that the only real-time data on the virus across the state that doctors like Dr. David Brett-Major, an infectious disease specialist, had during July and August was watching sick people stream into the emergency department of the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.

“If the tests are only happening when the cases are more severe, then you’re not getting a broad look,” he said in a recent interview.

Susan Bockrath, the executive director of the Nebraska Association of Local Health Directors, said her group brought up the missing dashboard repeatedly with state officials, pointing out it was also a necessary tool in the campaign against pandemic misinformation.

The dashboard was removed just as Stephanie Summers, board of education president in David City, was trying to determine the best policy for students and families in her rural community one hour west of Omaha. Mr. Ricketts has told Nebraskans to get vaccinated, but declined  to require masks, despite pleas from some public health officials.

“The state cannot insist on an individual’s freedom to choose to wear, or not wear, a mask, or whether or not to get vaccinated, and then also withhold the data needed for citizens to make informed decisions,” she said, adding that she fully agreed with state leaders in emphasizing those individual freedoms.

While the dashboard has mostly been restored, some doctors  doubt the current testing system is capturing the reality on the ground. Two dozen doctors sent a letter in early September to Mr. Ricketts asking for the return of Test Nebraska.

“Our access to testing is so bad right now, and the turnaround so bad, that these numbers are probably vast underestimates, and not accurate just because there is not enough testing,” said Dr. Bob Rauner, chief medical officer of OneHealth Nebraska, a group of 65 locally owned medical clinics across the state.

The governor and his aides have defended their decision to stop the flow of data on privacy grounds, saying publishing county-level data could violate the state’s version of HIPAA, which prevents the release of patients’ personal health information without their consent.

Experts say privacy becomes a concern in releasing data from counties with only a handful of cases, and for that reason, states generally suppress information in jurisdictions with fewer than five cases or deaths.

&gt;The condition came to be called Covid toes. They were seen, like the loss of smell and taste, as yet another strange telltale sign of the disease, even though most of the patients tested negative for coronavirus. Physicians were hard-pressed to explain the association.

&gt;The lesions are red or purple in white people, and often purplish or brownish in people of color. They cause painful burning or itching sensations, and sometimes make it difficult for people to wear shoes or walk.

&gt;Now a study from France, published in the British Journal of Dermatology, sheds some light on the causes of Covid toes. The research indicates that the lesions may be a side effect of the immune system’s shift into high gear in response to exposure to the virus, which can damage cells and tissues in the process.

&gt;The French researchers analyzed blood samples and skin biopsies from 50 patients who had chilblainlike lesions for the first time in April 2020, and who were referred to St.-Louis Hospital in Paris. Slightly more than half of the patients had other symptoms suggestive of Covid-19, like coughing, shortness of breath and loss of smell, but all of them tested negative for the virus on PCR tests.

&gt;The samples showed high levels of Type 1 interferon, a protein that activates the body’s immune system to fight viruses, but which may also cause damage. The researchers also found high levels of an antibody that can inadvertently attack the body’s own cells.

&gt;Abnormal changes in the linings of the blood vessels may also play a role in the lesions, the study suggests.

&gt;Although the relationship between coronavirus infection and chilblainlike lesions “is still controversial,” the authors wrote, the “peaks of chilblainlike lesions concomitant with peaks of Covid-19 deaths in 2020 strongly suggest that this disorder is closely related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.”

&gt;The explanation for Covid toes is not entirely surprising; one of the hallmark features of the disease is an immune system overreaction called a cytokine storm, which may ultimately cause more illness than the virus itself.

&gt;German scientists published a paper last year saying they had found a strong localized interferon-driven response in three young men who came in with chilblains. That paper suggested that the men, who tested negative for the coronavirus, may have developed chilblains several weeks after an initial infection caused mild or asymptomatic disease, and that the interferon-driven immune response may have led to early control of the virus and prevented respiratory disease.

&gt;Dermatologists say that people with Covid toes generally do well and are unlikely to develop severe Covid, and that the symptoms reflect a healthy immune response to the virus.

&gt;The new study suggested treating Covid toes with local or systemic anti-inflammatory agents may be effective.

Delta has an insane R0, and does actually more damage when just 50% of population is vaccinated, than w.t./D614G used to do on 0% population vaccinate, just by the infection rate increase. *Then* there's also the fact that hospitalizations rate per infection is like 2x higher with Delta, so it doesn't just infect more people at the same time, but it also sends more of them in the hospitals than previous variants would have done with the same rate of infections.

Likely an even higher rate of losing their transplant on top of that, since step 1 in treating covid transplant patients is to cut anti-rejection meds.

I’ve always been pro-mask and I consider myself to be pro-vaxx, I’m happy it is out there and I think it certainly is helpful, especially for those most at risk (obese, over 65, diabetic, immunocompromised, other comorbidities). I live in Los Angeles and it just really rubs me the wrong way that we are essentially being forced to get the vaxx if we want to continue to feed our families (I’m an actor and a bartender - both industries are under heavy pressure and being effected by the new mandates). I’m only 29 years old. I work really hard to be extremely healthy. I don’t consume simple carbs, processed foods, or sugary drinks. I intermittent fast daily. I don’t drink or smoke regularly, I do anaerobic exercise at least 3 times a week and live a super active lifestyle. My wife had COVID (Delta variant - most infectious) and was sick for 10 days. I slept next to her every night and kissed her goodnight and tested negative 3 times that week. That has to mean I either was an asymptomatic carrier at some point and had antibodies or I am immune. Why must I be forced to get the vaxx if I know my body can handle the exposure? That should be my choice. I’m not an immune system denier, and science shows natural immunity works better and lasts longer than the vaxx. Why should I be ok with big government forcing me to do things to my body that could potentially have side effects if I know I can handle catching the virus just fine? Those at risk need to protect themselves 100%. If I was my dad (over 65, BMI putting him in overweight category) I would get the vaxx. But I’m ME!

&gt; Colorado hospitals made the decision to deny transplants to most unvaccinated patients, and University of Washington Medical Center is following suit.

&gt; UW Medicine requires transplant patients to have the vaccine, otherwise they will be removed from the waitlist and deemed ineligible for a transplant, unless they have a specific medical exemption. UW told FOX 13 News this policy started ""a few weeks ago.""

&gt; Health officials say the reason for this is safety; when a patient gets a transplant, their immune system is suppressed and in a weakened state for a long time. During this time, they are vulnerable to infections, and COVID-19 can be extremely dangerous for immunocompromised people, if not fatal. Being on a transplant is the ideal time to get vaccinated, UW Medicine says, when patient's immune systems are more likely to respond to the vaccine.

&gt; The most important thing to note, however, is that this is nothing new.

&gt; **UW Medicine says they have for years required up-to-date vaccinations for all patients on transplant waiting lists. The difference now is COVID-19 vaccination is on the list, too.**

Do you have a source that supports this? If vaccine induced immunity is so long lasting why are booster shots being introduced?

""It’s hard for me to believe “we just don’t know which is better” when actual experts are definitively saying that being vaccinated is better than not; even for those previously affected.""

Then why have these actual experts not shared the source from which they have drawn this conclusion? Do you not think if there was a comparative study that showed vaccination alone provided greater protection that previous infection alone they would be eager to share this? The whole basis of scientific conclusions is evidence, if you believe their claims without evidence then you are doing yourself a disservice.

""New CDC Study: Vaccination Offers Higher Protection than Previous COVID-19 Infection"" [https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0806-vaccination-protection.html](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0806-vaccination-protection.html) Surely if they had evidence that showed vaccination ALONE gave higher protection that previous infection ALONE, they would have released this in a report such as this. Instead they use a study that showed individuals who had both previous infection and vaccination, were better protected than those who had just been infected. They then used a misleading headlining- I say misleading because I have seen dozens of people online that have assumed from the headline that it means vaccination ALONE provdes higher protection that previous infection ALONE.

We are 18 months into the pandemic, and between 6-10 months on from the beggining of vaccination programmes, surely you must question why there is no comaprative study that proves that vaccination induced immunity alone provides greater immunity than vaccination? There is clearly the motivation to prove such a point- ""New CDC Study: Vaccination Offers Higher Protection than Previous COVID-19 Infection"".

It is not unreasonable to not believe things until they are supported by evidence.

I also liked it at the time because it meant playgrounds to ourselves/no kids around but now I'm thinking maybe outdoor activities with a little distance is okay (I've seen many docs - and our pediatrician - say this is fine outdoors but we've been mostly fleeing other kids all summer). 

And we've said the same, feeling for families of older kids. We have a few friends who have been a little looser with restrictions because they have a toddler but also a middle-or-high schooler, and it's impossible to lock them down. We were lucky in some ways that our baby was born last year, as stressful as it was. It gave us a good excuse to kind of lay low and hunker down anyway, since that's probably what we'd do regardless of COVID. We did open up a little bit like you did; I recall a few outdoor restaurants before Delta started tearing this state apart. Now they say we're at 85-87% immunity/herd immunity since it just ate up the populace so quickly. So maybe we'll think about doing the same again.

And you nailed it with regards to childcare and what it'd look like if we got sick. My parents are our only family here, and they're also my sister's sole caretakers during chemo. So we can't really use them for support because they could expose her (and even vaxxed, it's not like we want to expose them). \\

This is how pandemics work. What we've seen in terms of pandemic response is to wait until case numbers get high to implement countermeasures, then to let up on them as soon as numbers start going down, which is just about exactly backwards. As soon as R is greater than 1, you know numbers are going to continue to rise unless something changes. A successful response is getting R&lt;1 while numbers are still low. If you've missed that chance, and case numbers have gotten high before you responded, letting up on the response as soon as things are headed in the right direction means they won't continue heading in the right direction, or will do so much more slowly, so wait till case numbers, not reproductive rate, is where you want it before easing up.

Original comment:

It’s confusing because I thought we were talking about the benefits of vaccination for those with previous immunity but then you want to know the breakthrough rate for someone who is vaccinated and maybe never had COVID.  I don’t see the relevance in that information in this context and it’s impossible to ascertain because someone who was asymptomatic would never know and would self-report as “never infected”.

The numbers I gave you were from a quick Google search.  I did barely any validation on those numbers because again, it doesn’t seem to matter to you, and you were going to abandon the discussion anyway so my effort level is low at this point.

The 0.5% number was from a study done by the state of Washington and doesn’t exclude people who may have been infected previously because it’s impossible to filter uninfected from asymptomatic unless have access to a time machine and can go back in time and capture a group of people for a live experiment.  At this point too many people have ‘pissed in the pool’ to effectively filter groups that way.

It really doesn’t matter though because the more relevant data is whether the vaccine helps prevent reinfection versus natural immunity alone and the answer is yes.  It’s 2x more effective.

Source for the 0.7% number for unvaccinated reinfection:

https://medicine.missouri.edu/news/study-finds-covid-19-reinfection-rate-less-1-those-severe-illness

“The researchers teamed up with the MU Institute for Data Science and Informatics and the Tiger Institute for Health Innovation to review data from 62 U.S. health care facilities. They found 63 of the 9,119 patients (0.7%) with severe COVID-19 infection contracted the virus a second time, with a mean reinfection period of 116 days. Of the 63 who were reinfected, two (3.2%) died. Patients categorized as non-white were at greater risk of reinfection than white patients.”

Source for the 0.5% number which again I expect you dismiss because it’s not filtered in an impossible way but here you go:

https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/data-tables/420-339-VaccineBreakthroughReport.pdf

“Washington state data shows there were 21,757 vaccine breakthrough cases among more than 4.1 million vaccinated people from January 17 — August 21, 2021. Although that might sound like a high number, it means that only 0.5% of vaccinated Washingtonians had breakthrough infections. Of the breakthrough cases that we have data for, just 9% required hospitalization and less than 1% died of a COVID-related illness.”

The only way you’re going to get the answer to your question is if someone literally raises a large batch of humans in isolation for their entire lives for the purpose of human experimentation and that’s never going to happen so you’re going to have to settle for comparing breakthrough cases of vaccinated versus reinfection rates for unvaxed.

&gt;The first study is much better because it has pre- and post-imaging and the question is set more reasonably, but like they say, ""Whether this deleterious impact can be partially reversed, for instance after improvement of the hyposmic symptoms, or whether these are effects that will persist in the long term, remains to be investigated"".

Yes that’s very true. But finding out whether the damage is reversible, permanent, or at least long-lasting, could very well take years. So if that question, and the question of how vulnerable the vaccinated are to such effects, end up having unfavourable answers, by that time the damage will have already been done. More effective vaccines can't come soon enough. How about this nasally administered, live virus vaccine attenuated by codon pair deoptimization and removal of the furin cleavage site: [Scalable live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate demonstrates preclinical safety and efficacy](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/29/e2102775118)?

I guess no one likes hearing someone raise the prospect of dire outcomes. But it seems like complacency in the face of such possibilities has been a recurring pattern throughout the pandemic. Think of how it took months to acknowledge the reality of transmission by people not showing symptoms, hindering efforts to contain transmission at a critical stage. And even now, fully a year and half into the pandemic, public health authorities are only grudgingly, half-heartedly acknowledging the reality of airborne transmission, rather than giving it a central place in containment strategy and making a concerted effort to raise public awareness. There's a good quote from Dr. William Haseltine of Harvard Medical School, from back in August:

&gt;We have underestimated the force that is SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on global society since the beginning. Our miscalculation of everything from how the virus spreads to how much it can adapt and change has led to the loss of millions of lives worldwide, with infections and deaths still on the rise to this day. You think we would have learned our lesson by now—and yet in the face of increasingly dangerous variants, a rhetoric of relentless optimism undergirded by complacency and inaction continues to cloud our better judgment.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last year, neither the first appearance of the virus in Wuhan in late 2019 nor the dire situation that capsized Italy in March and April 2020 constituted a wake up call. Only after the first waves of Covid-19 cases hit Europe and the United States hard did either population begin to take the pandemic more seriously. This year, once again, the catastrophic outbreaks that slammed through India this past spring didn’t seem to be a sufficient warning that worse was to come. Instead many countries, the US among them, began to systematically dismantle the web of protective measures they spent the better part of last year building.
