The Covishield version of the AZ vaccine is accepted by the EMA. I've checked the laws recently for Austria and Italy, where I drove through (no parents with me), and they both listed Covishield as a valid brand.

If we could have found a way to make gatherings safer- by moving as many gatherings as possible outdoors, for example, or helping gathering spaces improve their ventilation- a lot of people would have tolerated other kinds of interventions for a lot longer. 

I believe that a lot of the resistance we‚Äôve been seeing to things like masks and even vaccinations are nothing more than post hoc justifications by people with a desperate need for in-person human connection. 

I believe it‚Äôs fair to say that many Redditors are the type to require much less human contact than the average person, leading them to severely underestimate the lengths most people would go to obtain that contact (I‚Äôve tried pointing out multiple times that lonely depressed people make bad decisions only to be told that video chats should be good enough, because for a lot of Redditors, it genuinely is). 

So, bars and restaurants and small retail stores and schools and churches and barbershops are closed down. People start going weeks, and then months, feeling isolated, rarely seeing other people or only seeing a small number of neighbors. Eventually people snap and start hosting small gatherings at home, without any guidance on how to do that as safely as possible‚Ä¶ and we have a second wave, and then a third, fueled mainly by small in-home gatherings. 

I‚Äôm not even going to touch on the inconsistent way certain things were labeled essential and other things labeled non essential, or the way public officials kept getting caught breaking their own rules, leading to people incorrectly assuming that they rules had no empirical basis and could safely be ignored. 

I remember when we first heard about the AIDS crisis, and how abstinence was the only way to guarantee ones safety against AIDS. Which is true‚Ä¶ but not super helpful, because not a lot of people are willing to practice abstinence for an unknown time period, possibly forever. Telling people to use condoms and get tested regularly worked a lot better, even if abstinence is much much safer than condoms. 

In the same way, we could have been advising churches and bars on the best way to improve their ventilation or helping them move outside. We could have been telling people to open up all their windows and set up box fans if they were going to host Thanksgiving. We could have treated people like intelligent grownups with agency instead of children who needed to hide under their blankets until the danger had passed. Because what actually ended up happening was too many people ignored the maximalist positions that public health officials advocated, and now nobody trusts anybody anymore. 

If you can‚Äôt force people to do what you want- and you can‚Äôt, there aren‚Äôt enough cops in America to force everybody to behave reasonably if they really don‚Äôt want to- you have to *convince* them to behave as close to the way you want them to as possible.

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.27.21256193v1

&gt; We compared the infection rate of 2,195 individuals who received a single dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) to the infection rate of 21,950 unvaccinated, propensity-matched individuals between February 27th and April 14th 2021. Of the 1,779 vaccinated individuals with at least two weeks of follow-up, only 3 (0.17%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 15 days or more after vaccination compared to 128 of 17,744 (0.72%) unvaccinated individuals (4.34 fold reduction rate). This corresponds to a vaccine effectiveness of 76.7% (95% CI: 30.3-95.3%) in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection with onset at least two weeks after vaccination. This data is consistent with the clinical trial-reported efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days after vaccine administration (66.9%; 95% CI: 59.0-73.4%).",,,1624855568,{},h3aeknv,False,t3_o8docz,False,True,t1_h359isk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o8docz/who_chief_corona_delta_variant_spreading_rapidly/h3aeknv/,1625117096,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

&gt;Now they were battling a rare, inflammatory and potentially life threatening condition called multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). This condition usually develops four to six weeks after children and teenagers have recovered from Covid-19.

&gt;At the Kasturba Hospital, two of the sick children have recovered, while the other two are being treated in intensive care. ""I would worry about this condition. We simply don't know how deep this problem is. It is worrisome we still don't have data on the burden of this disease in India,"" Dr SP Kalantri, medical superintendent of the hospital, said.

&gt;As the deadly second wave of the coronavirus abates, paediatricians across India are reporting more cases of this rare but serious condition. Since doctors are still reporting cases, it is not clear how many children have been affected so far. The US has reported more than 4,000 cases and 36 deaths from the disease so far.

&gt;Students visiting from the mainland went to a music concert at a bullring in the capital, Palma, as well as parties on boats and in hotels, and officials said on Saturday they wanted to find out if venues had adhered to virus-control measures.  
    
&gt;The outbreak comes as the Balearic Islands gear up for an expected influx of tourists after the British government put the islands on its ""green travel list"" from June 30.  
           
&gt;All of the students who tested positive for coronavirus were Spanish and had travelled from different parts of the country to celebrate the end of university qualification examinations.  
     
&gt;At least 1,000 students have had to go into isolation, the Balearic Islands' health authorities said, and some of the teenagers showed mild symptoms of COVID-19.  
         
&gt;Spaniards were allowed to stop wearing face masks outdoors on Saturday after more than a year as coronavirus cases fell, but they must continue to wear them inside or when social distancing is impossible.

""In the vaccination point established in Ankamall within the scope of the 'on-site vaccination application' initiated in nearly 30 shopping malls in Ankara, the employees and citizens of the center started to receive their vaccinations.  
Citizens who come to the vaccination point are vaccinated after a consent form is prepared and they are logged into the system. While citizens are asked to rest for a while, 112 Emergency Service teams are kept ready in case of any negativity.  
Kotanoƒülu, Head of Public Health Services, said that their aim is to vaccinate employees, those who come to the shopping mall and those who cannot get an appointment, so that the wheels of the industry turn.  
Stating that they have started on-site vaccination at the High Speed ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãTrain Station, Esenboƒüa Airport, bus station, industrial zones, large military units and factories as well as shopping malls, Kotanoƒülu said, ""I hope we will solve the pandemic with this vaccine by providing this service to our people with this on-site vaccination.""  
Stating that they made nearly 4 million vaccines in Ankara for the first and second doses, Kotanoƒülu said:  
""We have vaccination centers in hospitals, family health centers, private medical centers and universities. There is great interest from the public. They go there by appointment. A large part of the amount we make is there. We bring the service to the employees who cannot go to these places but who are at work. This is a total of what we do. ""One fourth or one fifth of the day. Our goal is to reach 80 percent of Ankara in vaccination. We will continue to provide on-site vaccination services until we reach our target.""

Why?

2. Protect others. Masking up helps cut down on transmission to unvaccinated (whether by choice, age &lt;12, or health reasons).

The hospital I work at has seen an uptick of pediatric COVID hospitalizations over the past month, which is concerning.

I have seen questions about vaccines answered with lazy ""#VaccinesWork"", which I do not like. I know that vaccines work and that they're not an evil device intended to hurt us. Also, that just seems like avoiding the question, so I would like a bit of detail if possible, although I don't want to ask for too much from others either.

The vaccine I am considering is Pfizer, since it looks like it has the highest efficacy.

I am concerned about the side effects. I have received other vaccinations before but I have not experienced many side effects besides slight pain. I mostly want to know what causes the side effects and how, more than the side effects themselves. Basically, from what I understand about vaccines, they carry a sample of the virus so our body produces antobodies, hence effectively learning how to fight it. I would like to understand where the side effects come from, because I don't see how an inert virus can cause them.

I don't know much about biology, so I'm a bit wary of a vaccine that has been developed so quickly.

Not only that, many of Anderson‚Äôs collaborators in Wuhan came to Singapore at the end of December for a gathering on Nipah virus. There was no word of any illness sweeping the laboratory, she said.

‚ÄúThere was no chatter,‚Äù Anderson said. ‚ÄúScientists are gossipy and excited. There was nothing strange from my point of view going on at that point that would make you think something is going on here.‚Äù

The names of the scientists reported to have been hospitalized haven‚Äôt been disclosed. The Chinese government and Shi Zhengli, the lab‚Äôs now-famous bat-virus researcher, have repeatedly denied that anyone from the facility contracted Covid-19. Anderson‚Äôs work at the facility, and her funding, ended after the pandemic emerged and she focused on the novel coronavirus. 

‚ÄòI‚Äôm Not Naive‚Äô
It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs impossible the virus spilled from there. Anderson, better than most people, understands how a pathogen can escape from a laboratory. SARS, an earlier coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2002 and killed more than 700 people, subsequently made its way out of secure facilities a handful of times, she said. 

If presented with evidence that such an accident spawned Covid-19, Anderson ‚Äúcould foresee how things could maybe happen,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not naive enough to say I absolutely write this off.‚Äù 

And yet, she still believes it most likely came from a natural source. Since it took researchers almost a decade to pin down where in nature the SARS pathogen emerged, Anderson says she‚Äôs not surprised they haven‚Äôt found the ‚Äúsmoking gun‚Äù bat responsible for the latest outbreak yet. 

The Wuhan Institute of Virology is large enough that Anderson said she didn‚Äôt know what everyone was working on at the end of 2019. She is aware of published research from the lab that involved testing viral components for their propensity to infect human cells. Anderson is convinced no virus was made intentionally to infect people and deliberately released‚Äîone of the more disturbing theories to have emerged about the pandemic‚Äôs origins.

Gain of Function
Anderson did concede that it would be theoretically possible for a scientist in the lab to be working on a gain of function technique to unknowingly infect themselves and to then unintentionally infect others in the community. But there‚Äôs no evidence that occurred and Anderson rated its likelihood as exceedingly slim.

Getting authorization to create a virus in this way typically requires many layers of approval, and there are scientific best practices that put strict limits on this kind of work. For example, a moratorium was placed on research that could be done on the 1918 Spanish Flu virus after scientists isolated it decades later.

Even if such a gain of function effort got clearance, it‚Äôs hard to achieve, Anderson said. The technique is called reverse genetics.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs exceedingly difficult to actually make it work when you want it to work,‚Äù she said.

Anderson‚Äôs lab in Singapore was one of the first to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from a Covid patient outside China and then to grow the virus. It was complicated and challenging, even for a team used to working with coronaviruses that knew its biological characteristics, including which protein receptor it targets. These key facets wouldn‚Äôt be known by anyone trying to craft a new virus, she said. Even then, the material that researchers study‚Äîthe virus‚Äôs basic building blocks and genetic fingerprint‚Äîaren‚Äôt initially infectious, so they would need to culture significant amounts to infect people.

Despite this, Anderson does think an investigation is needed to nail down the virus‚Äôs origin once and for all. She‚Äôs dumbfounded by the portrayal of the lab by some media outside China, and the toxic attacks on scientists that have ensued.

One of a dozen experts appointed to an international taskforce in November to study the origins of the virus, Anderson hasn‚Äôt sought public attention, especially since being targeted by U.S. extremists in early 2020 after she exposed false information about the pandemic posted online. The vitriol that ensued prompted her to file a police report. The threats of violence many coronavirus scientists have experienced over the past 18 months have made them hesitant to speak out because of the risk that their words will be misconstrued.

The elements known to trigger infectious outbreaks‚Äîthe mixing of humans and animals, especially wildlife‚Äîwere present in Wuhan, creating an environment conducive for the spillover of a new zoonotic disease. In that respect, the emergence of Covid-19 follows a familiar pattern. What‚Äôs shocking to Anderson is the way it unfurled into a global contagion.

‚ÄúThe pandemic is something no one could have imagined on this scale,‚Äù she said. Researchers must study Covid's calamitous path to determine what went wrong and how to stop the spread of future pathogens with pandemic potential.

Virologist Danielle Anderson paints a very different picture of the Wuhan Institute.

Danielle Anderson was working in what has become the world‚Äôs most notorious laboratory just weeks before the first known cases of Covid-19 emerged in central China. Yet, the Australian virologist still wonders what she missed.

An expert in bat-borne viruses, Anderson is the only foreign scientist to have undertaken research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology‚Äôs BSL-4 lab, the first in mainland China equipped to handle the planet‚Äôs deadliest pathogens. Her most recent stint ended in November 2019, giving Anderson an insider‚Äôs perspective on a place that‚Äôs become a flashpoint in the search for what caused the worst pandemic in a century.

The emergence of the coronavirus in the same city where institute scientists, clad head-to-toe in protective gear, study that exact family of viruses has stoked speculation that it might have leaked from the lab, possibly via an infected staffer or a contaminated object. China‚Äôs lack of transparency since the earliest days of the outbreak fueled those suspicions, which have been seized on by the U.S. That‚Äôs turned the quest to uncover the origins of the virus, critical for preventing future pandemics, into a geopolitical minefield.

The work of the lab and the director of its emerging infectious diseases section‚ÄîShi Zhengli, a long-time colleague of Anderson‚Äôs dubbed ‚ÄòBatwoman‚Äô for her work hunting viruses in caves‚Äîis now shrouded in controversy. The U.S. has questioned the lab‚Äôs safety and alleged its scientists were engaged in contentious gain of function research that manipulated viruses in a manner that could have made them more dangerous.

It‚Äôs a stark contrast to the place Anderson described in an interview with Bloomberg News, the first in which she‚Äôs shared details about working at the lab.

Half-truths and distorted information have obscured an accurate accounting of the lab's functions and activities, which were more routine than how they‚Äôve been portrayed in the media, she said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that it was boring, but it was a regular lab that worked in the same way as any other high-containment lab,‚Äù Anderson said. ‚ÄúWhat people are saying is just not how it is.‚Äù

Now at Melbourne‚Äôs Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Anderson began collaborating with Wuhan researchers in 2016, when she was scientific director of the biosafety lab at Singapore‚Äôs Duke-NUS Medical School. Her research‚Äîwhich focuses on why lethal viruses like Ebola and Nipah cause no disease in the bats in which they perpetually circulate‚Äîcomplemented studies underway at the Chinese institute, which offered funding to encourage international collaboration.

A rising star in the virology community, Anderson, 42, says her work on Ebola in Wuhan was the realization of a life-long career goal. Her favorite movie is ‚ÄúOutbreak,‚Äù the 1995 film in which disease experts respond to a dangerous new virus‚Äîa job Anderson said she wanted to do. For her, that meant working on Ebola in a high-containment laboratory. 

Anderson‚Äôs career has taken her all over the world. After obtaining an undergraduate degree from Deakin University in Geelong, Australia, she worked as a lab technician at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, then returned to Australia to complete a PhD under the supervision of eminent virologists John Mackenzie and Linfa Wang. She did post-doctoral work in Montreal, before moving to Singapore and working again with Wang, who described Anderson as ‚Äúvery committed and dedicated,‚Äù and similar in personality to Shi. 

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre both very blunt with such high moral standards,‚Äù Wang said by phone from Singapore, where he‚Äôs the director of the emerging infectious diseases program at the Duke-NUS Medical School. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very proud of what Danielle‚Äôs been able to do.‚Äù

On the Ground
Anderson was on the ground in Wuhan when experts believe the virus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, was beginning to spread. Daily visits for a period in late 2019 put her in close proximity to many others working at the 65-year-old research center. She was part of a group that gathered each morning at the Chinese Academy of Sciences to catch a bus that shuttled them to the institute about 20 miles away.

As the sole foreigner, Anderson stood out, and she said the other researchers there looked out for her.

‚ÄúWe went to dinners together, lunches, we saw each other outside of the lab,‚Äù she said.

From her first visit before it formally opened in 2018, Anderson was impressed with the institute‚Äôs maximum biocontainment lab. The concrete, bunker-style building has the highest biosafety designation, and requires air, water and waste to be filtered and sterilized before it leaves the facility. There were strict protocols and requirements aimed at containing the pathogens being studied, Anderson said, and researchers underwent 45 hours of training to be certified to work independently in the lab.

The induction process required scientists to demonstrate their knowledge of containment procedures and their competency in wearing air-pressured suits. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very, very extensive,‚Äù Anderson said.

Entering and exiting the facility was a carefully choreographed endeavor, she said. Departures were made especially intricate by a requirement to take both a chemical shower and a personal shower‚Äîthe timings of which were precisely planned.

Special Disinfectants
These rules are mandatory across BSL-4 labs, though Anderson noted differences compared with similar facilities in Europe, Singapore and Australia in which she‚Äôs worked. The Wuhan lab uses a bespoke method to make and monitor its disinfectants daily, a system Anderson was inspired to introduce in her own lab. She was connected via a headset to colleagues in the lab‚Äôs command center to enable constant communication and safety vigilance‚Äîsteps designed to ensure nothing went awry.

However, the Trump administration‚Äôs focus in 2020 on the idea the virus escaped from the Wuhan facility suggested that something went seriously wrong at the institute, the only one to specialize in virology, viral pathology and virus technology of the some 20 biological and biomedical research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Virologists and infectious disease experts initially dismissed the theory, noting that viruses jump from animals to humans with regularity. There was no clear evidence from within SARS-CoV-2‚Äôs genome that it had been artificially manipulated, or that the lab harbored progenitor strains of the pandemic virus. Political observers suggested the allegations had a strategic basis and were designed to put pressure on Beijing.

And yet, China‚Äôs actions raised questions. The government refused to allow international scientists into Wuhan in early 2020 when the outbreak was mushrooming, including experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who were already in the region.

Beijing stonewalled on allowing World Health Organization experts into Wuhan for more than a year, and then provided only limited access. The WHO team‚Äôs final report, written with and vetted by Chinese researchers, played down the possibility of a lab leak. Instead, it said the virus probably spread via a bat through another animal, and gave some credence to a favored Chinese theory that it could have been transferred via frozen food.

Never Sick
China‚Äôs obfuscation led outside researchers to reconsider their stance. Last month, 18 scientists writing in the journal Science called for an investigation into Covid-19‚Äôs origins that would give balanced consideration to the possibility of a lab accident. Even the director-general of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the lab theory hadn‚Äôt been studied extensively enough.

But it‚Äôs U.S. President Joe Biden‚Äôs consideration of the idea‚Äîpreviously dismissed by many as a Trumpist conspiracy theory‚Äîthat has given it newfound legitimacy. Biden called on America‚Äôs intelligence agencies last month to redouble their efforts in rooting out the genesis of Covid-19 after an earlier report, disclosed by the Wall Street Journal, claimed three researchers from the lab were hospitalized with flu-like symptoms in November 2019.

What the World Wants China to Disclose in Wuhan Lab Leak Probe

Anderson said no one she knew at the Wuhan institute was ill toward the end of 2019. Moreover, there is a procedure for reporting symptoms that correspond with the pathogens handled in high-risk containment labs.

They are still going to be the majority of deaths, even when vaccinated, because the risk of being old is more than the efficacy of the virus. This is why the uk has more vaccinated deaths than unvaccinated, with the young unvaccinated, and the old overwhelmingly vaccinated.

It's easy to say they are exceedingly unlikely to have an issue, but that just depends on your definition of risk. You are more likely to die as an old vaccinated person than a young unvaccinated person. I didn't like my personal risk during covid, and it motivated me to get vaccinated, and stressed me out.  my actual risk was miniscule compared to a vaccinated elderly person in a location with zero mitigation. The problem is they are exceedingly likely to have exposure in the south, especially in congregate care, and they aren't going to be in any way protected by any mitigation.  Far fewer will get sick, but still hundreds of elderly people who are vaccinated will die. And they all did the right thing, but vaccinations aren't really meant to just be a personal prophylactic, they're meant to be a societal cure.

Also, while their communities won't brook any impact on their personal freedom, it's much easier for an institution that does elderly care to impose limits on those in its care. So elderly people, with more risk, will be more stressed and make more sacrifice, because the generations after them are betraying their duty of care.

A really interesting aspect was many large companies in the US (particularly in the tech sector) who seemingly had a much better understanding of what was happening in February/March than the US government - they were switching everyone to remote work well ahead of state and federal government.

Testing was a disaster at the start, no one had accurate intelligence on how bad things were. The Federal and State response was often contradictory, local healthcare systems multiple times came close to collapse - *and this kept happening throughout the 15 months!*

Most damaging - and something many other similar countries managed to avoid - was the deep politicisation of the crisis. This led some states to be over zealous in locking down for long periods of time, and other states were flippant in removing restrictions at the first opportunity.

Where the US really outshone the rest of the world was the pharma capacity to produce so many vaccine doses in a short amount of time - something that no other developed country was able to do.

Our economy is a house of cards. We don't manufacture much. If you look at our export profile, it is heavily dominated by raw minerals and agricultural products. It actually resembles a developing nation rather than an industrialised nation. 

The backbone of our economy is basically 'houses and holes'. In formal English, this means that our economy is structurally dependent on housing and mining. Mineral resources are rather volatile in pricing. What is unique to Australia, is how dependent the economy is on buying and selling houses to each other. The government and the Reserve Bank are kicking the can down the road and doing everything to inflate house prices. Why?

1) Politicians own at least 2 houses. They are pigs in the property trough.

2) Many older Australians are *incredibly* obsessed with housing and by ensuring that their house prices increase on an exponential scale, their electoral loyalty is easily secured. 

3) Housing is not viewed as a roof over one's head by policy makers and financial institutions. It is viewed first and foremost as an investment.

[],,001235,,,[],,,,text,t2_4du8hxds,False,False,[],"I'm not saying everyone here is, but I'm third generation and my parents put me into private school as a kid. My ex-wife went to a public school for a few weeks because her parents didn't know better. Some of the things I've heard and seen from the public schools include ""I don't believe in this, but I'm required to teach it..."" and the teacher covers the entire theory of evolution in a single class period while rolling her eyes.

I went to a college prep school that costs about $200,000 for unaided tuition. The college acceptance rate is 100%, the full-ride scholarship rate is 95%, the Ivy League acceptance rate is about 85%. We had PhDs teaching English and Math and learned to write collegiate level essays. 

My ex-wife's first job in college was trying to help 101 students learn to write college essays at a writing-center type thing for one of the college bookstores. It was a shit show like you've never seen. 

I worked in Mobile, Houston, Nashville, Huntsville, Atlanta, Phoenix, Nogalez, and all over the south because I work doing factory inspections in pretty rural areas. 

My coworkers and I are now outside of Montgomery. Most of the white-collar kids are attending private schools and enjoying an education more in line with what you would get from the nicer schools in AL. I am not saying that all of the public schools are absolute shit, but many are. 

My real point is that if you just threw money into Alabama's school system right now as it is, schools that are in wealthy areas of towns would get amazing benefits and the poor schools would get worse.

One of the things Alabama does (and I saw this in every city where I lived) is that if they build a new school in the white area of towns, they will build it at current capacity or just under. So if there are 3,000 kids attending the current overcrowded high school, the new one will serve 3,100 kids. They do this because the law is that if you are a minority and want to move into a school that is majority white, you may --except now the schools can reject you because they are overcrowded.

Additionally, what Alabama does is they build these nice communities and then gate them up and build schools that are too small for the neighborhood so that it is effectively a private school for that area. 

What Mobile did was they built a school that serves about 95% of the old money neighborhoods by building a ""new"" school (they renamed an existing shitty school and added a gym) and then re-zoned to capture the newest nicest neighborhoods into the new school and the run-down areas of town into the bad ones. They offset this obvious racism by capturing some really huge beach and resort homes into the new low-income school banking on the fact that no one who is paying $3,000,000 for a house really cares about having to pickup the cost of private school as they would put their kids in private school anyway. 

Final point, Matt Massey made headlines in Alabama because he refused to build a new school because the parents in Madison County **blatantly** wanted to draw zoning lines based on income. I can't find the Facebook posts with the comments, but parents basically got into it as to why did their kid have to go to school with the poors since the poors already had a school that's 50% free lunch, they should drop the new school right next to these neighborhoods with the million-dollar homes and the people living in the $40,000 houses should continue to go to the schools built in the 1960's.

**TL;DR:** I'm not saying that ALL of the public schools in Alabama are garbage. I could name a few I would put my kids in. I'm saying that if you went to Alabama and picked a school at random, you're chance is about 1% that you would pick a school worth attending and that if you dumped money into AL school system, you would likely be funding more wealthy schools and the average education in Alabama wouldn't improve.",,,1624880069,{},h3b6ajy,False,t3_o91x2j,False,True,t1_h3ayeyc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o91x2j/gottlieb_says_parts_of_us_could_see_very_dense/h3b6ajy/,1625130774,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

The card, dubbed ‚Äúfreedom-pass‚Äù by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis,  
will cover costs in travel and entertainment, such as plane and ferry tickets, hotel bookings, music, theatre and cinema, museums and archaeological sites.  
  
Presenting the card at the start of a meeting with ministers on Monday, the prime minister said he acknowledged the toll the long months of lockdown have had on the social life of young people.  
  
‚ÄúThis is a debt to our youth, a gift of gratitude, particularly ahead of the summer. \[It is\] a ‚Äòthank you‚Äô for their patience and perseverance,‚Äù he told the ministers at the televised message.   
  
‚ÄúAt the same time, however, it is also an incentive for young people in particular to be vaccinated, who, by their very nature, contribute more to movement. And the more they are shielded \[against the virus\], the more we will limit the transmission of the virus.‚Äù  
  
Mitsotakis said this is especially true as countries are facing the more transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus, which targets primarily those who have not been vaccinated ‚Äúbut is threatening everyone.‚Äù  
  
Those who take up the offer, will be able to subkit their application for the card though the government online platform gov.gr, a day after they receive their first dose, Digital Policy Minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis said at the presentation.  
  
The card will be available by the end of July.

The daily number was the lowest since May 19, when the CECC first issued a nationwide Level 3 COVID-19 alert, and the overall coronavirus numbers are trending down, said Health and Welfare Minister Chen Shih-chung (Èô≥ÊôÇ‰∏≠), who heads the CECC.

Meanwhile, the number of infections in a Pingtung County cluster that originated from a woman and her grandson who recently returned to Taiwan from Peru remained at 12, according to Chen.

Eight people in the cluster have been confirmed as being infected with the Delta variant, which is believed to be the most transmissible variant yet, according to the CECC.

Although the overall trend is on the decline, larger than expected crowds at public venues over the weekend has raised concerns over an infection control breach, Chen said.

Among the 60 local cases recorded Monday, 26 were males and 34 were females, aged from under 10 to over 90, with the onset of symptoms occurring from June 19 to June 27, according to Chen.

In the two cities considered to be Taiwan's COVID-19 hotspots, New Taipei had the most new domestic cases reported Monday, at 33, followed by Taipei with 22.

Outside of the two cities, Taoyuan reported two new cases, and Keelung, Nantou and Changhua reported one case each.

Of the 60 new cases, the sources of 32 cases have been identified, while the sources of 25 are being investigated, and three have been determined as having unclear infection sources, CECC data showed.

The three deaths were two men and one woman in their 70s to 90s, who passed away June 25 and June 26, the CECC said.

The new cases brought the total in the country to 14,694, of which over 13,200 are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 cases in a single day for the first time since the beginning of the outbreak in early 2020.

To date, 635 people in Taiwan have died from COVID-19, including 623 since May 15.

Ended up getting out after a couple of weeks. Still had supplemental oxygen for a few months after I came home. 

I am fully vaccinated, but I'm still scared of catching it again and not surviving. 1st dose sent me back to the hospital for observation for two days because they though I was in danger of a heart attack, also my oxygen dipped below 95 again. Second dose was fine, just fever and soreness. 

Covid left me with long covid symptoms. Tachycardia, brain fog, worse issues with my memory, scarred up lungs, my back hurts more than before, changed my periods to lighter more painful periods that last 4 days instead of my normal heavy 7-8 days periods, extreme fatigue to the point I can barely walk for 10 minutes. At least it's better than when I just got out of the ICU. I could only walk a couple of feet before I would need to sit to recover, my heart beats would be above 130 and my oxygen would be in the low 90s. In the ICU and a couple of weeks after I came home, my mind still wasn't working right. I had hallucinations and spoke nonsense to my husband or when I was alone.

If, out of all the viruses in the world that affect humans, only one has ever been eradicated that should speak to you as to the extreme difficulty and unique circumstances needed to eradicate a virus. Smallpox is a slow mutating virus without non-human reservoirs. One exposure to smallpox or to the vaccine gives LONG lasting immunity (on the scale of decades), and if wiped out among humans there are no other animals it affects to harbor the disease and pass it back to humans at a later time.

Covid fits neither of these categories. It is already being seen to evolve to at least in part escape immunity from prior infection or immunization - though much more slowly and much less completely than influenza for instance - and it has known animal reservoirs. This would make any attempt at complete eradication orders of magnitude more difficult, if not impossible. It is also FAR less deadly than smallpox and the effort required to attempt total eradication may simply not be worth it. It should be telling that diseases like influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, diptheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, hepatitis, rotavirus - diseases we mass vaccinate for on an ongoing basis - have not been eradicated. They're just controlled to the greatest degree reasonably possible.

Even with some escape from sterilizing immunity, people who are reinfected or infected after vaccination are seen to have far less severe cases than people who are immunologically naive. Mass vaccination to prevent hospitalization and death, coupled with natural immunity from the large fraction of people who have already been infected, will reduce by orders of magnitude how dangerous a disease covid is to society. But the cat's out of the bag and the disease is endemic in the human population, with animal reservoirs.

More than likely a booster will be needed for everyone within 2 years due to the virus mutating not because your body is ineffective.  The virus has a chamce to mutate because enough pple are vaccinated giving it a large pool to grow and change on. When the majority have had the vaccine the pool shrinks. 

But if the virus mutates enough to where the vaccine is say.. 75% then it gives it a chance to continue to mutate in that 25% pool. (Plus the unvaccinated )

Give everyone a booster and that number goes back up to95% covered and shrinks it enough to possible have herd immunity but very likely too small a pool for mutation growth. 

Then maybe a booster every ten years because it still will be growing and shifting over time in unvaccinated pple.

It seems that for the EU, the ""kitchen"" in which the ""dish"" was prepared will become part of the criteria for determining eligibility of incoming non-EU citizens later this year.

The problem is that [Canada has to date received about 2.9 million doses of AZ](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/covid-19-vaccine-treatment/vaccine-rollout.html#a4a) coming from COVAX (made in South Korea), Serum Institute (made in India as Covishield) and the USA (through Biden's loan of unused and unapproved American inventory). As far as I'm aware, [500,000 doses of the Indian-licensed AZ arrived in Canada in the second half of March](https://www.kamloopsthisweek.com/five-million-canadians-now-have-at-least-one-dose-as-vaccine-rollout-gathers-steam-1.24302150) with pretty much all of them used up as first doses by the beginning of April.

Strictly speaking, the EU would need to scrutinize every incoming Canadian's vaccination history to determine what his/her actual dosing regimen has been. In this case, the EU would (should?) filter out incoming Canadians found to have received their first dose of AZ in March or early April since that was drawn from the Indian delivery. Biden's loan of AZ didn't start getting used until around the middle of April and later on was followed by South Korean loot via COVAX.",,,1624914264,{},h3d66k1,False,t3_o9ihqc,False,True,t3_o9ihqc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o9ihqc/no_eu_green_pass_for_indiamade_astrazeneca/h3d66k1/,1625171103,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

1. Funding. 
Funding cycles usually happen after results are gathered after each phase of the trial. Starting at the lab (phase 1) level. This can take years. Obviously funding wasn't an issue here.

2. Due to the above, phases are often completed then reviewed, funded, designed, recruited for then undertaken. Obviously this takes years. This was able to be undertaken concurrently. Phase 2 was still running while phase 3 was. Does this make phase 2 rushed? No. It had the exact same process, just run at the same time as phase 3.

3. Notified bodies (FDA, MHRA etc) worked on a rolling review system. Usually all trials would need to be completed and reviewed etc then compiled into a report and submission document. This would be reviewed by the notified body. Due to the urgency, these notified bodies reviewed each stage as it was completed. They did not need to wait until everything was completed. So was this rushed? No as every bit of data was reviewed, as it would have been in the traditional format but this was done simultaneously. Why doesn't this always happen? Money and resources.

The same applies to the deaths, where 7 of the 9 in the vaccinated group happened before the 2nd dose would have had any effect.

Further, given the extremely limited time frame of the studies they reference (4-6 weeks), the NNTV is obviously quite high because the attack rate in a 2-month period is going to be relatively low. They even admit this:

&gt;In the Israeli field study, the observation period was six weeks, and in the U.S. regulatory studies between four to six weeks, a period commonly assumed to be sufficient to see a clinical effect of a vaccine, because it would also be the time frame within which someone who was infected initially would fall ill and perhaps die. Had the observation period been longer, the clinical effect size might have increased, i.e., the NNTV could have become lower and, consequently, the ratio of benefit to harm could have increased in favor of the vaccines.

But we've seen what uncontained spread of COVID looks like, and there are areas that saw 50-70% attack rates and 0.3-0.5% of the population dying (and both are likely not the top end with more infectious variants). Trying to argue that you need to vaccinate 16K people to save 1 life in light of that is asinine. 

Taking the lower of the two (0.3% Population Fatality Rate) which is what NYC saw, and a vaccine that's 95% effective at preventing death, that would be an Absolute Risk Reduction of 0.285% between matched vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. NNTV is the inverse of ARR, so that would be 1/0.285% which is ~350 vaccinations to save a life, about 45x lower than the number this paper uses.

Do you have a citation? Check the numbers at VAERS. They do not support your assertion. If this is indeed the case, why have multiple nations around the world given the green light for 12+?     

&gt;Myocarditis is common enough in those that have received the vaccine in that age range for it to be a legitimate issue that should cause some pause.    

393 confirmed cases in the United States of myocarditis and pericarditis subsequent to vaccination of 12 and above and &lt;30 so far, ~32,200,00 million vaccinations (at least first shot) given to ages 12 and above and &lt;30 = 0.001220496% risk.    

If you use the words ""common enough"" to describe a 0.001220496% risk, you are misrepresenting the facts. That's nearly an order of magnitude less than the classification for ""very rare,"" which is less than 0.01%.    

There have been 2,704 deaths of people under 30 years of age in the United States from COVID-19. The population of the under 30 cohort is 212,542,320. Percentage of the under 30 cohort that has died from COVID-19 = 0.001272217%.    

As a person under 30 years of age in the United States, you are more likely to die from COVID-19 than you are to develop myocarditis or pericarditis after receiving a COVID-19 vaccination.    

Based on this fact, there is good reason to *not* delay vaccination because of concerns regarding myocarditis and pericarditis.

Second, I thought this was food poisoning. Day 4 after exposure, I got a sore stomach that migrated to an all out gastrointestinal attack, I was passing pure bile. Sat on the toilet and couch doubled up in pain.
After 3 days, called the Dr, again, this was assumed good poisoning from sushi, she advised to get a covid test right away, the hospital she worked in had seen a big uptick in gastro covid, I went and sure enough, positive.

&gt; Do I still need the vaccine if I‚Äôve already had COVID-19?

&gt; Absolutely. While we know recovering from a COVID-19 infection means you will have circulating antibodies in your system, we are still learning about how the immune system handles the antibody response after a natural infection. We‚Äôre not sure how protective the antibodies are from different kinds of infections ‚Äî such as an asymptomatic infection versus a symptomatic infection. With vaccination, we know that people with healthy immune systems are getting a great antibody response. So I would recommend vaccination even after a COVID-19 infection to get the best protection.

We'd be better off pushing to make programs that made sure that no one was homelessness and hungry back like they were before. People want simple, but ""hey give people I don't like a bucket of money"" is an easier target for politicians to attack than ""give people I don't like money for food"" or ""let's set aside particular places for poor people to live"". Those are much easier sells which is why they already exist and even when all the fear mongering and national and state level pushes only got cut back so far, but there is no such thing as a bad housing voucher when you need it. There is a such thing as a crappy UBI payment that won't pay rent anywhere in town and they got rid of housing vouchers and food stamps and disability and basically all assistance because hey this 1K/mo (let's be generous) is totally going to cover everything you could have gotten under the old system. Except it doesn't.

People who push for UBI don't actually understand the safety net we have now as shitty as it is and they most certainly don't know about the one that used to exist before the welfare queen idea came into existence. I know how much money the poorest of my family are getting out of the system in direct or indirect ways. No amount of UBI is going to cover what they get for ""free"" and that's why UBI is a trap. Tax the rich yes, but to bring back what we had before not set up a situation that will never be good for the people who need it most and always be a fight that people who are better off won't even necessarily connect with. 

People who believe in UBI should look up how much social security has paid out through the years and then ask themselves: If I had no job could I live on that? If you were disabled and that was it forever and forever?  People who push for UBI I think forget about people ""on the bottom rung"" who are just never going to leave or not for years. The disabled, people caring for other adults or children, the unskilled. UBI fucks those people over. No one has ever been able to explain to me what world would UBI exist in that those people would be able to survive on it. There's the assumption that our current safety net will be there for them always, but for all that we might as well expand it so that it covers all the people it used to cover.

I've got smart but unfortunately easily manipulated friends who refuse to get vaccinated for various, and IMO nonsensical reasons.  It's heartbreaking for me to see this.

One very smart friend insists it's unethical to use a vaccine ""created by stem cells"" - even though these cells were harvested 40 years ago and the cells used in the testing are 1000s of generations removed from the original tissue.  No different in his mind from babies being aborted and directly injected into vials.  But apparently thinks people unnecessarily suffering and dying *today* is okay.  He also watches podcasts saying how the vaccine is dangerous, and has sent me articles from a veterinary virologist trying to suggest all this risk from the jab, or other pseudoscience from podcasts he's listening to that just reiterate his confirmation bias.

Another stays locked up inside his house, is afraid to go outside and hasn't done anything social for maybe 16 months.  He still is afraid of transmission via fomites (disproven) and has neglected his personal health by putting off some important medical procedures.   BUT he won't get vaccinated.  He claims ""all pandemics end, so did the Spanish Flu"" - yet doesn't seem to realize that we could have it end faster and with fewer dead than if we get to herd immunity, nor does he seem to realize the improvement he'd see in his quality of life if he were able to go out and be protected.

I've got others who *still* think it's just a form of the flu and not serious, and have argued with people claiming it's a hoax and that the stories of overloaded hospitals are all made up/exaggerated.

What we have to realize here is that we are fighting a war of misinformation, eagerly spread by Russia and China, understanding that as the world rejects vaccines and stays sicker longer, it stays weaker longer.  These smart people have been misled, and have doubled down on staying unvaccinated because they can easily communicate online with other people living in the same bubble of misinformation, and resent any insinuation that they are indeed manipulated, gullible or flat out wrong.

Don't get me wrong. Vaccines do work, and if you're unvaccinated right now, you should still definitely try your best to secure a vaccination appointment as soon as possible. However, my problem lies more in the CDC's guidance, which may no longer be adequate in light of new information. The pandemic is a constantly changing situation, after all.

Wonder whether the CDC revert back to a mask recommendation for all people regardless of vaccination status (as the WHO has recently done, but I'm aware these two organizations do not necessarily have to agree). I used to think this would be almost certain, but now I'm not entirely sure. Even if they do, I doubt many states, even ""stricter"" ones such as New York or California, would be willing to reimplement mask mandates. *Definitely* not Florida, Texas, etc. The social end is here, after all.

I am a huge introvert and rarely go out anyways, so I rarely see anyone or do anything, I didn‚Äôt feel it was necessary - **If you rarely go out you could have a weaker immune system in general and therefore the vaccine is even more important.

I had to do some reflecting and practice what I preach and realize I was being stupid - **Let's say something did happen (it won't as we have had trials), you would be one of BILLIONS of people in that situation so something would obviously get designed to fix any issues.**  
  
I thought ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm young and healthy and personally not afraid of catching covid, and anyone who is scared already has their vax so it‚Äôs only me and anti Vaxxers I‚Äôm risking, so it‚Äôs not a big deal.‚Äù But than I went back to thinking I need to practice what I preach and it was kind of me going ‚Äúlisten, if I‚Äôm going to tell other people to do something and listen to the scientists, than I should also, because they say it‚Äôs the right thing to do and they know more than I do‚Äù - **If only...

That said, many of those areas in the US with low vaccination rates aren't low because of lack of availability, and I certainly don't think it would be fair to expect people who have been fully vaccinated to further inconvenience themselves for months on end on behalf of those who will never be willing to protect themselves.

If you pay attention to both sides you will see that they will use scientific claims up until it is of no use to them and notice how other facts (conclussions) they avoid that distance accuracy of their point of view.

Gavin Newsom called the ‚Äúlargest and most comprehensive renter protection deal in the United States.‚Äù  
           
&gt;California placed a moratorium on evictions after Newsom imposed the nation‚Äôs first statewide shutdown in March 2020 and ordered most businesses to close and people to stay home to slow the spread of the coronavirus.  
    
&gt;That protection is scheduled to expire Wednesday. The new agreement between Newsom and legislative leaders will extend the eviction moratorium by three months and pledges to pay off all unpaid rent and utility bills for qualifying renters from April 2020 through Sept. 30 of this year.  
         
&gt;No one knows exactly how many people will qualify and how much it will cost. But the state has $5.2 billion to spend on back rents, enough to provide $10,400 each to a half-million tenants, all of it coming from the federal government.  
           
&gt;Newsom‚Äôs administration believes the pot of money is more than enough to pay off rental debts for everyone eligible. Another $2 billion in state money will cover people‚Äôs unpaid utility bills.  
          
&gt;The proposal, which will be voted on in the Legislature next week, also gives tenants more time to apply for assistance after a landlord tries to evict them while also masking their credit and rental history so those debts won‚Äôt show up and prevent them from getting future housing.  
           
&gt;To qualify, people may only earn 80% or less of their area‚Äôs median income and must have been affected by the pandemic ‚Äî a nondescript requirement everyone can meet.

Call me paranoid, but here is what I think about:

1. Anyone who already sent their kids to school prefers to continue to do that.
2. Parents are already a group we know will knowingly bring their sick kid(s) to school/daycare. 
3. In the fall, there were already reports of families having ""pacts"" to not test their kids who had covid symptoms, so that their kids could continue to play whatever highschool sports
4. Put all these things together and we are for sure under testing kids. Kids can be completely asymptomatic, or have something so mold as a sniffle, it's easy to overlook
5. We know all governments are under reporting cases
6. We know adults with even mild covid-19 can have long haul health complications - I assume so can kids
7. I suspect that kid's side effects have been under reported. If you're little, can you vocalize that all of a sudden your no longer have the same endurance to run that you had one month ago? If you tell your parents, will they tell your pediatrician? If that happens, is that reported?
8. We know what people have been doing to avoid covid-19 hasn't really been working. Duh! Temp checks? What part of ""incubates and can spread for 2 weeks before symptoms are shown"" is not understood? The places that have successfully controlled this are either lying (Russia) or very strict (Thailand, NZ). So yeah, what most of the world has been doing hasn't been working - why are we pretending that people will be ""doing the right thing"" this time when it hasn't happened for 1.5 years yet?
9. Covid-19 fatigue. Not only have people not done the right thing collectively, but we are all fucking sick and tired of this bullshit. Do I want to go out and do half the things I used to? Yes. With vaccines, summer in the northern hemisphere, etc, we are getting a huge veneer of ""the way things were"" that will lull us into a false sense of security. Once fall hits, with kids not vaccinated and all the reasons started above?BAM!
10. And as covid mutates, we will likely see worst outcomes for kids. I really hope I'm wrong here, but your see it already in Brazil and India.

So yeah, my school district says no online classes for my kid's age group. I'm lucky I can afford a babysitter (it's been a financial struggle this year, but we can manage), and we can probably pull off home schooling if necessary. I would rather look back in 5 years and think, ""fuck me, I overreacted during COVID-19. Haha"" than, ""hey Timmy, I'm sorry you're now almost a teen with scarred lungs and a propensity for early heart disease given to you by covid because I was just so tired of covid that I did not read the writing on the wall and sent you back to the known petri dish that is called school during a global pandemic that was not at all under control."" *deep breath*

These are all just symptoms of your immune system going to work responding to what it sees as a pathogen.  It's like having a mild flu for a day or two.

A less common reaction is an allergy to one of the components of the vaccine.  In rare cases this can lead to hives, swelling, wheezing, or anaphylaxis.  You'll be asked to wait about 15 minutes post-injection to be monitored for these or other symptoms.  Most clinics will probably have epinephrine to treat you if you have a reaction.

Most recently, advisories have been added about myocarditis and pericarditis (inflammation of the heart or the surrounding tissue) following vaccination.  This is quite rare, on the order of ~10 cases per million.  We don't know the cause yet but it's a condition that can occur with a viral infection.

As for long-term effects, the first trial cohorts have been observed for over a year now with no signs of concerning effects.  There's not really anything in the vaccine that would accumulate or linger.  The primary components are lipids which your body processes all the time and mRNA which is relatively fragile and gets broken down soon after it's used to make protein.

Usually by the time it makes it to public awareness, there's a degree of consensus in the scientific community. There's no time for that with this stuff. 

So then you take a discourse that's evolving and apply it to public policy. 

Government communications team is given information by their public health experts and is then expected to transmit it to the general public. Messaging is designed to be definitive and consistent across platforms. Government leaders are briefed then expected to help carry the message to media sources.

General public gets carpet bombed with information from official sources, local jurisdictions, journalists that pick up the press releases, elected officials, and public health rep's.

By this time you've received information from sources that you generally trust for reliable information. You trust the information because you trust the source, and you trust that the source is generally definitive with other information. Soon, you're friends and family receive similar information and after awhile a public consensus starts to develop. 

And then the academic discourse shifts. 

It's not hard to see why some people become skeptical when sources that they generally consider to be consistent and monolithic change with the discourse. They see it as lacking in consistency. If they doubt the consistency of the information coming out, then they will be less receptive to new information.

The warning update follows an extensive review of information and discussion by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC‚Äôs) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting on Wednesday, the FDA said.

At end of the second week of June, more than 1,200 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis have been reported to the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.

Then, the schools closed down and I realized this was serious because our government would not close schools unless it was dire because of all the economic impacts of doing such a bold act. I immediately took this very seriously.

Largest dose of pride I've had for my country in my 45 years of life.  So, my attitude changed drastically once I be experienced a pandemic. I was very naive regarding vaccines prior to this. I still don't trust doctors or government truly care about my wellbeing, life, and experiences, but in regards to vaccines, I am a believer. And clearly they work. Once we started giving them, the numbered dramatically decreased.  I am looking forward to being able to get my children vaccinated, so we can start to interact with the world again.

All combinations worked well, priming the immune system.

Hospitalisation and deaths are the ones that actually matter especially in the elderly, symptomatic disease is too vague of a metric.

Not to mention PHE specifically stated they believed the single dose averages were taken too soon after people got their first dose to be fully accurate for AZ as it takes longer to develop a full immune response.

No scientist can honestly say that a given covid vaccine will produce no negative side effects 5 years from now. The vaccines have simply not been around for 5 years, therefore any predicition as to their long term effects are not based on science (as you claim they are) since science involves actually testing a given hypothesis and observing the results to arrive at a conclusion to support the hypothesis or null hypothesis. When 5 years have passed and the vaccine has been studied for that period of time that's when scientists can claim that there are no long-term side effects for a 5 year period associated with the given covid vaccine if that is indeed the case.

Two doses are better than one, but in this case you can't get 2 doses of Jnj in a short time period.  Maybe next year they can use a booster, idk.

By comparison, roughly 4,000 minors die in car accidents every year in the United States.

During the past fourteen months - the height of the pandemic - your unvaccinated child was 15 times more likely to die in a car accident than of Covid. As Covid cases dwindle due to increasing natural and vaccinated immunity, this will probably grow to something like 50x or 100x more likely.

There are roughly 600 pediatric flu deaths in the US in a typical year. - thats more than twice as many as have died from Covid since March 2020.
