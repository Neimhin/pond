Students in navy gowns and mortarboards sat in crowded rows, without social distancing or face masks, beneath the sign that read: ""Welcoming the graduates of 2020 back home. We wish you all a great future.""

  
Covid-19 first emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei province, sending the city of 11 million into one of the world's strictest lockdowns.

  
Restrictions were not eased until April when the city started to re-open after 76 days closed off, although schools remained shut for longer.

  
The city held limited graduation ceremonies last year, with Wuhan University hosting a mostly-online event in June last year, with the students and teachers who did attend all in masks.

  
More than 2,200 students at Sunday's ceremony were graduates who could not attend their graduation last year due to tight virus restrictions.

  
China has since largely contained the outbreak while keeping precautions high, including tight border controls, quarantines, mandatory online ""health codes"" and varying restrictions on domestic travel.

  
There were 20 new cases on Tuesday, including 18 imported from overseas and two in a local outbreak in southern Guangdong province.

  
There have been 4,636 deaths officially reported, the majority in Wuhan.  
Quoting a line of ancient Chinese poetry, the banner offered students advice for the future: ""The ocean is boundless for leaping fish.""",,,1623741276,{},h1toidr,True,t3_o08clx,False,False,t3_o08clx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o08clx/wuhan_holds_maskfree_massive_graduation_ceremony/h1toidr/,1624027456,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Of the fifteen clients, nine tested positive for the coronavirus. They were all already vaccinated. As a precaution, the nursing home has imposed a visitor's block until Thursday.
One client tested positive for corona last Friday, after which the outbreak started. According to a spokesman for De Eschpoort, which falls under care facility De Liberein, the clients are showing no or only mild symptoms. ""They are a little hay fever-related complaints,"" she says.

&gt; In addition to the nine clients, two employees of the care department were also tested positive for corona. Other colleagues from the team have also been tested; they are still waiting for the results.

&gt;Origin of contamination
&gt;The source of the corona outbreak is not yet known. Liberein is investigating the origin of the contamination together with the GGD and a doctor-microbiologist.

&gt;The non-infected clients will also be tested again next Thursday, five days after the discovery of the contamination. As a precaution, visits to the ward where the corona outbreak took place will not be possible in the coming days.

&gt;According to a Liberein spokesperson, a corona outbreak of this magnitude has never occurred before. In the past, one or two residents occasionally tested positive, but that was all.

It sucks and yea hopefully some of them change their minds but it really does seem cultural. In BC we have more than 75% of adults vaccinated and 74% of all eligible (12+) vaccinated with the first dose. Demand is still high, we're gunning for Vermont levels and want to overtake.

Also our vaccination rate is tied to re-opening stages. The problem I see is a lot of these states didn't even have restrictions. There is no incentive for them to get vaccinated. It doesn't really affect their lives until someone they know gets hospitalized and/or dies.

SAN FRANCISCO — San Francisco will **eventually require** workers in hospitals, nursing homes and jails to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, with limited exceptions.  
The order is notable as some companies have internally debated whether to impose vaccination requirements for workers.  
The order by San Francisco, as well as the UC and Cal State systems, will go into effect only after the **U.S. Food and Drug Administration gives formal approval to one of the vaccines.** Currently, all three vaccines being distributed in the U.S. have received “emergency use authorization.”

Yes it is. After seeing BC's response specifically, (not sure how other provinces are doing in comparison tbh) Canada's model should be used as an example by other countries. 

The time interval for the doses were 21 days for pfizer and 28 days for Moderna. These are the minimum number of days that are required to make the second dose an effective booster. We didn't (and still don't to my knowledge, but correct me if I'm wrong.) have the maximum length inbetween doses, but it's estimated to be about 4 months or 16-18 weeks. 

*However* giving people a first shot to reduce the spread was incredibly effective. Even if a good portion of the population needs a third booster later because they've passed the maximum delay and end up with essentially a ""first dose"" again, it's not a huge deal because of how much the spread was reduced.

then there's the group of people who are waiting to make sure that the vaccine doesn't cause horrible side effects because they are worried something so quickly achieved (either not knowing or not caring that this was based on a decade or more of research and then fast-tracked because pretty much every medical scientist *in the world* was working on this.) so that's another group who will have a lot of their numbers probably get vaccinated.


then you have groups who have genuine worries about how their groups have been fucked over in the past medically and need more educational outreach. I'm a little iffy on whoever uses this as a reason against getting vaccinated for a number of reasons I've seen first-hand re: not wearing masks, being in big groups where it's impossible to social distance, etc. But for those who genuinely worry about this (perfectly understandable) then yeah, with educational outreach and time, then some of these could change their minds about becoming vaccinated.

&gt; A single standard dose of vaccine provided 76% protection overall against symptomatic covid-19 in the first 90 days after vaccination with protection not falling in this time frame. It is not clear, however, how long protection might last with a single dose as \*\*there were too few cases after 90 days to make any meaningful judgment\*\*.

https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n326

\*You mean to say, that after 90 days with a single dose, symptomatic cases were so low you couldn't reliably measure how low they were?\* Sounds very promising. Why don't you try to study that again, with a bigger sample size?

And unless I'm misreading it didn't answer the question I wanted answered: it measured the effectiveness 2 weeks after the second dose, which was given between 4 and 12 weeks. It found that protection was stronger with the 12 week regimen. i.e. it found that effectiveness was greater 14 weeks after the first dose, with a second dose given at 12 weeks than it was at 6 weeks after the first dose, with a second dose given at four weeks. What I would have wanted to see is effectiveness 14 weeks after first dose, with no second dose, a 4 week second dose, and a 12 week second dose.

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00528-6/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00528-6/fulltext)

Nobody has measured or reported this directly, but I still strongly suspect that time from first dose is what's most important here. Fourteen weeks after first dose, you're going to have a great immunity response whether you get a second dose or not. You're probably better 14 weeks after 1st dose than you are 2 weeks after 2nd dose if your 1st was only 6 weeks ago. The study hinted at that, reporting 74% efficacy after 1 dose before at 90 days, but only 55% efficacy with 2 doses at six weeks sicne 1st dose. But again, they're analyzing different trials under different conditions so it's not concrete.

Yeah, a second dose probably helps, but none of the studies have shown that the second dose is doing substantial really. They show that efficacy is higher after the second dose than it was after the first dose, but they don't compare it to what it would've been with first alone if they had simply given the first dose more time to do its thing.",,,1623752896,{},h1u0l2e,False,t3_o007yf,False,False,t1_h1txhfb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o007yf/2_pfizer_covid19_vaccines_more_effective_than/h1u0l2e/,1624035735,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

But USA uses mainly Pfizer and Moderna, whereas Britain used mainly Astra Zeneca, which seem to be much less effective against variants (up to 30% less against the indian delta variant)... so my thought process is that countries like Israel, USA, whole EU and others who have primarily used Pfizer will have much simpler time during this year's fall, as the pfizer efficiency is still close to 90% against mutation wheres astra zeneca and johnson fall down to 50-60% or less.

Masks in the US are usually single layer cloth. Results have shown that those are at best 40% effective. Let's assume 90% of the total population is wearing masks. That's a bit high but allows a bit of leniency in mask type, with some being more effective than others. At best we are looking at a 36% reduction in spread. Enough to slow it down, but not to stop it. We saw this during the winter wave, that didn't subside till behavior changed after Christmas. These numbers don't account for incorrect wearing of masks though, which would lower that reduction in spread.

Now let's look at vaccines. 43% of the population has been vaccinated if the vaccines are low end 90% effective, then we see a 38.7% reduction in spread. Add in partially vaxxed and post infected individuals (estimated at 30% of the US population by the CDC), you have an effective immune percentage of 65ish%. If we assume natural immunity is a bit weaker and do a Fermi estimate that average immunity is about 85%, we are looking at over a 55% reduction in spread.

Masks have been replaced. We aren't abandoning them, we are swapping an active mitigation for a passive one.

France, Germany, Italy, and Canada all faced early spring waves that peaked in early to mid april. The US, too, also had an early Spring wave that peaked in mid April, though this wave was far more mild than the Winter one obviously, but was still significant, especially in States like Michigan. All of those listed countries are still trending down in cases as more and more vaccines are distributed. 

India did not face an early Spring wave, but their massive wave ramped up in April and peaked in May. The UK also did not have any Spring wave or surge, and is facing a significant uptick right now. However, it seems to be slowing down quite a bit and I predict it will plateau next week, and the wave won't be nearly as bad as the Winter one.

The woman carried the Covid-19 virus for 216 days and during this period, the virus gathered more than 30 mutations.

The case report was published as a preprint in the medical journal medRxiv on Thursday (This paper has not been peer-reviewed yet). According to the report, the woman was diagnosed with HIV back in 2006 and her immune system has weakened consistently over time. After she contracted Covid-19 in September 2020, the virus accumulated 13 mutations to the spike protein and 19 other genetic shifts that could change the behaviour of the virus.

Some of these mutations have been seen in variants of concern, such as E484K mutation, which is part of the Alpha variant B.1.1.7 (first seen in the UK), and N510Y mutation, which is part of the Beta variant B.1.351, (first seen in South Africa).

According to the researchers, it was not clear if the woman passed on these mutations to others. However, researchers said it’s probably not a coincidence that most of the new variants have emerged from areas like KwaZulu Natal in South Africa, where more than 1 in 4 adults is HIV positive.""",,,1623780833,{},h1vj4z2,False,t3_o0krn8,False,True,t3_o0krn8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o0krn8/woman_with_hiv_carries_covid19_infection_for_216/h1vj4z2/,1624073609,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,True

UK seems like most people want the vaccine, in older population it is 95% and middle and younger is around 80%, is it true.

Efficacy is the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated. Because most unvaccinated people haven't caught COVID in the last few months.  You can't just attribute all not-COVID cases to the vaccine when most unvaccinated people didn't get it during that time.  That's astoundingly ludicrous.

Listen, 95% efficacy means that a vaccinated person has 1/20th the chance of getting it compared to an unvaccinated person. The vaccines are helpful. I am vaccinated and I like that I have a 1/20 change compared to if I wasn't vaccinated.  But it doesn't make you freaking immortal, ok? Stop saying stuff that is misleading, please.

Lets say that I'm one of the people who isn't protected by the vaccine and can have a breakthrough case. Lets say that I contract COVID 7 months from now.

What with the many variants we’ve already experienced and the long lasting nature of this virus, it’s a sound conclusion to assume that it’s not going to vanish.

My point is that I’m as protected as if I had a vaccine due to having antibodies, we know that natural antibodies are lasting at least between 6-8 months so far (see WHO link below), and that’s only because we haven’t got more research studies going beyond that time frame.

You need to get to a point where when one person gets the virus, they spread it to less than one new person on average.  So, for instance if R0 is 2, you have to get 50% of people immune to get to herd immunity.  You can do that with a vaccine that is 100% effective, and you give it to 50% of people, or you can do it with a vaccine that's 50% effective, and you give it to 100% of people.  

For R0 of 6, you need to get to the point where 5 out of 6 people are immune, 84%.  But if a vaccine is only 80% effective, you can't get to herd immunity through vaccination, even if you vaccinate 100% of people.  Eventually, about 4% of people get infected, and you do hit herd immunity.  

In real life, it's a lot harder to predict exactly what will happen since some people are already infected, and you won't get close to 100% vaccinated, but the point is that a virus with an R0 of 6 versus a vaccine that is 80% effective means that there's going to be a lot of virus, for a long time.

Yeah - they talked to immunologists and figured a 21 day (pfizer) and 28 day (moderna) delay was the minimum needed before a booster would be effective.

The *exact same fucking logic* that Canada used in delaying second dose, which *also* included seeing how the body responded and the antibodies they produced.

Which is, again, based on classic vaccine responses and boosters. Once we knew mrna *worked* (which the clinical trials showed), then the matter of extending the booster out was purely elementary.

Yeah and that's not how data works - someone could have a bad experience with a vaccine - it's just one data point.

Overall, unless you are well off, the US healthcare system is far inferior than the Canadian system. And I say this as someone who has also lived in the US (Pasadena, Burbank, Houston, El Paso, Phoenix, and NYC).

Second, my discussion of Canada’s healthcare system is based not on what I’ve read on the internet, but my experience in Canada as an American. To put it simply, I’ve had much better care in the US and I haven’t had to wait anything close to what I’ve had to wait in Canada. I know many people in Quebec that have been waiting for *years* to get a family doctor. I know many people that have been waiting *months or even years* to get surgery in Canada. A friend of mine suffered a large heart attack because he couldn’t get his heart surgery scheduled within a reasonable time (before Covid, mind you). It resulted in a far more traumatic experience for him including cracked ribs from emergency CPR, which he had to recover from before he got open heart surgery. I am not saying the US has an absolutely wonderful healthcare system—you can definitely get fucked with prices if you don’t have insurance, and you don’t always get to pick your doctors if they aren’t in your insurance—but **I am saying that I’ve had a much better experience in the US healthcare system than in the Canadian system**.

By fall it is likely/possible people in Israel or USA will need a third shot.  If vaccine production flattens out at a 3 or 4 billion doses per year that means large sections of the globe are not getting vaccinated.  It should be a long term 7 billion dose per year long term production plan.

Over producing vaccine will cause a glut.  Some regions will have nearly no cases and people will feel little or no motivation to take the vaccines.  The vaccines will rot and pharma will make a lot less money.  We would suffer the horror of higher health security and low profit margins.

It is not just ""the right thing to do"" though there is that.  USA needs to maintain (regain?) a reputation.  It is not trivial.  We benefit from printing the global financial currency.  Flying in hundreds of millions of vaccine doses when people desperately need it sends a strong message.  Monty Python: ""[What have the Romans ever done for us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xad5Rl0N2E)"".

The bottom line is that for USA citizens it is cheaper to attack Covid19 globally.  The virus eventually mutates into vaccine resistant strains and gets back into USA.

1) AZ is only 60% effective against Delta. (Same as previous studies)    
2) Pfizer is only 80% effective.  (Previous study estimated 90%)  


Let's say that 80% number is correct.  We don't know the R0 for Delta, but 6 is a common estimate.  To get herd immunity with R0 of 6, you need 84% of people vaccinated.  That means that a population with 100% vaccination with Pfizer is STILL not at herd immunity.  Even if we get to high levels of vaccination, we can expect delta to spread.  (That said, you personally will be safer if vaccinated, and the more people who are vaccinated, the slower it will spread and the fewer who will eventually die - so get vaccinated!)  


And in places that use AZ, or vaccines that are likely to be of similar effectiveness or lower (like Sinovac), they could get to 100% vaccination and not be anywhere close to herd immunity.  


When I look at CDC variant data, and CDC infection data, I see delta doubling about monthly, with wide error bars.  At that rate, it's going to be a few months before it really takes off.  There's also increasing evidence for a seasonal effect.

Many Post-Covid Patients Are Experiencing New Medical Problems, Study Finds


An analysis of health insurance records of almost two million coronavirus patients found new issues in nearly a quarter — including those whose Covid infection was mild or asymptomatic.




Karla Jefferies, 64, tested positive for Covid-19 in March 2020 and has been bothered by puzzling symptoms ever since. First it was fatigue, fever, and no taste or smell. Then came brain fog, insomnia, a nagging smell of something burning and intermittent ringing in her ears.

Hundreds of thousands of Americans have sought medical care for post-Covid health problems that they had not been diagnosed with before becoming infected with the coronavirus, according to the largest study to date of long-term symptoms in Covid-19 patients.


The study, tracking the health insurance records of nearly two million people in the United States who contracted the coronavirus last year, found that one month or more after their infection, almost one-quarter — 23 percent — of them sought medical treatment for new conditions.


Those affected were all ages, including children. Their most common new health problems were pain, including in nerves and muscles; breathing difficulties; high cholesterol; malaise and fatigue; and high blood pressure. Other issues included intestinal symptoms; migraines; skin problems; heart abnormalities; sleep disorders; and mental health conditions like anxiety and depression.


Post-Covid health problems were common even among people who had not gotten sick from the virus at all, the study found. While nearly half of patients who were hospitalized for Covid-19 experienced subsequent medical issues, so did 27 percent of people who had mild or moderate symptoms and 19 percent of people who said they were asymptomatic.



“One thing that was surprising to us was the large percentage of asymptomatic patients that are in that category of long Covid,” said Robin Gelburd, president of FAIR Health, a nonprofit organization that conducted the study based on what it says is the nation’s largest database of private health insurance claims.


More than half of the 1,959,982 patients whose records were evaluated reported no symptoms from their Covid infection. Forty percent had symptoms but didn’t require hospitalization, including 1 percent whose only symptom was loss of taste or smell; only 5 percent were hospitalized.



Ms. Gelburd said the fact that asymptomatic people can have post-Covid symptoms is important to emphasize, so that patients and doctors can know to consider the possibility that some health issues may actually be aftereffects of the coronavirus. “There are some people who may not have even known they had Covid,” she said, “but if they continue to present with some of these conditions that are unusual for their health history, it may be worth some further investigation by the medical professional that they’re working with.”


The report, which will be posted publicly on Tuesday morning on the organization’s website, analyzed records of people diagnosed with Covid-19 between February and December 2020, tracking them until February 2021. It found that 454,477 people consulted health providers for symptoms 30 days or more after their infection. FAIR Health said the analysis was evaluated by an independent academic reviewer but was not formally peer-reviewed.



“The strength of this study is really its size and its ability to look across the range of disease severity in a diversity of age groups,” said Dr. Helen Chu, an associate professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the University of Washington School of Medicine, who was not involved in the report. “This is a hard study to do with that much data.”


The report “drives home the point that long Covid can affect nearly every organ system,” said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, chief of the research and development service at the VA St. Louis Health Care System, who was not involved in the new study.



“Some of these manifestations are chronic conditions that will last a lifetime and will forever scar some individuals and families,” added Dr. Al-Aly, who was an author of a large study published in April of lingering symptoms in Covid patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs health system.


In the new study, the most common issue for which patients sought medical care was pain — including nerve inflammation and aches and pains associated with nerves and muscles — which was reported by more than 5 percent of patients or nearly 100,000 people, more than a fifth of those who reported post-Covid problems. Breathing difficulties, including shortness of breath, were experienced by 3.5 percent of post-Covid patients.



Nearly 3 percent of patients sought treatment for symptoms that were labeled with diagnostic codes for malaise and fatigue, a far-reaching category that could include issues like brain fog and exhaustion that gets worse after physical or mental activity — effects that have been reported by many people with long Covid.


Other new issues for patients, especially adults in their 40s and 50s, included high cholesterol, diagnosed in 3 percent of all post-Covid patients, and high blood pressure, diagnosed in 2.4 percent, the report said. Dr. Al-Aly said such health conditions, which have not been commonly considered aftereffects of the virus, make it “increasingly clear that post-Covid or long Covid has a metabolic signature marked by derangements in the metabolic machinery.”


Relatively few deaths — 594 — occurred 30 days or more post-Covid, and most were among people who had been hospitalized for their coronavirus infection, the report found.


The study, like many involving electronic records, only addressed some aspects of the post-Covid landscape. It did not say when patients’ symptoms arose or how long the problems persisted, and it did not evaluate exactly when after infection patients sought help from doctors, only that it was 30 days or more.



The database included only people with private health insurance or Medicare Advantage, not those uninsured or covered by Medicare Parts A, B and D, Medicaid or other government health programs. Dr. Chu said people without insurance or with incomes low enough to qualify for Medicaid are often “more likely to have worse outcomes,” so the findings may understate the prevalence of some post-Covid health problems or may not represent the full picture.


In addition, diagnostic codes in electronic records are “only as good as what is documented by the provider who saw the patient,” said Dr. Chu, a co-author of a smaller study of post-Covid symptoms among patients at the University of Washington.


For example, neurological or cognitive issues like brain fog may be underreported because doctors may not find an appropriate diagnostic code or patients may not be seeking medical help for that specific issue, FAIR Health said.


It’s also possible that some people classified as having asymptomatic Covid-19 infections developed symptoms after they tested positive. And some people who received their first diagnosis of a medical issue like hypertension or high cholesterol post-Covid might have previously had those issues but never sought or received treatment.



Another limitation of the study is that it did not compare people who had Covid-19 with those who did not, making it unclear if rates of post-Covid symptoms were higher than in a more general population. Dr. Al-Aly’s study, which made such a comparison, found that between one and six months after becoming infected with the coronavirus, patients who’d had Covid had a 60 percent greater risk of death and a 20 percent greater chance of needing outpatient medical care than people who had not been infected.


The FAIR Health report excluded patients with certain serious or chronic pre-existing conditions like cancer, kidney disease, H.I.V., liver disease and stroke because researchers said it would be difficult to separate their previous health status from post-Covid symptoms.


The report did not explore connections between other pre-existing conditions patients had and their likelihood of developing post-Covid symptoms. But it said that people with intellectual disabilities or those with Alzheimer’s disease or dementia had a greater risk of dying 30 days or more after their infection.


Overall, experts said, the report’s findings underscore the widespread and varied nature of post-Covid symptoms.


“People with long Covid need multidisciplinary care,” said Dr. Al-Aly, “and our health systems should adapt to this reality and develop capacity to deal with these patients.”",,,1623772967,{},h1v0hkj,False,t3_o0c3gf,False,False,t3_o0c3gf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o0c3gf/many_postcovid_patients_are_experiencing_new/h1v0hkj/,1624061405,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
