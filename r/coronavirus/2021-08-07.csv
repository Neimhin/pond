Typically cancer survivors with good blood counts are not considered immunocompromised. But it stays complicated from there. Blood cancer survivors, like lymphoma, have worse outcomes from disease. The studies are in and they are still trying to find out why. So consider that less of a high risk of getting it but more of a high risk of dying from it. Then add in the lung issues. I have lung fibrosis from the bleomycin in my lymphoma treatments. My doctors said that could put me in both the higher risk of getting and higher risk of dying, emphasis on could. Then finally comes the vaccination issue. People with blood cancers have less of a chance of producing antibodies from vaccination than the general population. And right now it‚Äôs also looking like we‚Äôre not retaining them as long. I‚Äôm in a study on that exact topic. I expect members of our study will be invited into a booster study but nothing has been promised. I‚Äôm in both antibody and t-cell portions of this study. 

At this time, don‚Äôt seek out boosters on your own but the general guidance I‚Äôve seen so far is that when it is offered, we‚Äôre going to be wanting to get them. We should not be living as if we‚Äôre healthy people with the vaccine but instead double/n95 masking and having all household members behaving as if we aren‚Äôt vaccinated so for me, my husband never dropped his mask to protect me. Also, if your dad has any known exposure to a positive person, he likely meets the new guidance on receiving convalescent plasma treatments even before a positive test. It‚Äôs a treatment shown to work and especially improve outcomes in blood cancer survivors so make sure everyone on his care team knows this. I‚Äôm a 16 year lymphoma survivor who is a NCCS advocate but I‚Äôm not a medical professional.

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, data from this report are insufficient to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, including the Delta variant, during this outbreak. As population-level vaccination coverage increases, vaccinated persons are likely to represent a larger proportion of COVID-19 cases. Second, asymptomatic breakthrough infections might be underrepresented because of detection bias. Third, demographics of cases likely reflect those of attendees at the public gatherings, as events were marketed to adult male participants; further study is underway to identify other population characteristics among cases, such as additional demographic characteristics and underlying health conditions including immunocompromising conditions.*** MA DPH, CDC, and affected jurisdictions are collaborating in this response; MA DPH is conducting additional case investigations, obtaining samples for genomic sequencing, and linking case information with laboratory data and vaccination history. Finally, Ct values obtained with SARS-CoV-2 qualitative RT-PCR diagnostic tests might provide a crude correlation to the amount of virus present in a sample and can also be affected by factors other than viral load.‚Ä†‚Ä†‚Ä† Although the assay used in this investigation was not validated to provide quantitative results, there was no significant difference between the Ct values of samples collected from breakthrough cases and the other cases. This might mean that the viral load of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 is also similar. However, microbiological studies are required to confirm these findings.


https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm

Even the Province Towns study author said it had issues. Also even after this study the CDC still said the vaccines are 75-85 percent effective at stopping infection:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/cdc-breakthrough-infections/94390e3a-5e45-44a5-ac40-2744e4e25f2e/?_=1

Even the White House agrees that the vaccines prevent infection well and are reportedly frustrated at the media for making it seem like they don‚Äôt:

&gt; Unfortunately, in some cases, those outreach efforts might have occurred too late. The New York Times, for instance, tweeted early Friday morning, ""The Delta variant is as contagious as chickenpox and may be spread by vaccinated people as easily as the unvaccinated, an internal C.D.C. report said."" Ben Wakana, a member of the White House's rapid response team, responded bluntly: ""VACCINATED PEOPLE DO NOT TRANSMIT THE VIRUS AT THE SAME RATE AS UNVACCINATED PEOPLE AND IF YOU FAIL TO INCLUDE THAT CONTEXT YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG."" The Times ultimately added more context to its tweet in a follow-up.

I just wish we didn't pretend we never had the initial goals for elimination. 

For herd immunity to be effective vaccines need to prevent cases as well as serious outcomes. If vaccines do not provide immunity mutations can occur that can render vaccines less effective. If you have a huge portion of unvaccinated people, and a vaccine that doesn't provide strong immunity, that's a serious problem.

You're correct that the initial worst vaccines we would have allowed to be used provided 50-60% overall immunity. That was never the hope, that was the bare minimum bar to qualify. However, with some of these variants we have seen studies showing 30-50% immunity. Which is something to be concerned about.

It doesn't mean the vaccines are bad, they arent. Everyone needs to get vaccinated or this will get worse. But we cannot lie to ourselves nor give ourselves a false sense of over-security. No one at any point would have been setting a goal of a scenario where 20% of cases are breakthrough cases. This is bad. It shows the virus is getting worse because we aren't doing all we can and it shows that we aren't in a place where we can remove protective measures meant to limit spread.

&gt;With 94 COVID-19 patients, the University of Mississippi Medical Center is currently over-capacity as the healthcare system fights through staff shortages. 


&gt;‚ÄúThe health system, our health system‚ÄîI think I can safely say the other health systems around us in the city and in the state‚Äîis at a breaking point. We are not finite resources.

&gt;Between the loss of staff throughout the course of the pandemic and outbreaks within the system, Dr. Jones told reporters Wednesday afternoon that units of the hospital are empty because they cannot staff them. Dr. LouAnn Woodward, UMMC COVID-19 incident commander, detailed that these shortages include nurses, respiratory therapists, CMAs and ancillary staff members.

You say that your grandma fed her kids a healthy diet. Maybe that's because at the time your grandma had kids, processed foods didn't really exist, sugar was expensive, the food-industrial complex was barely in its infancy, and simple diets of meat and vegetables were actually the most affordable?

Belittling people's understanding by comparing anything that they don't understand to the most complex thing you can think of is not constructive.

I don't know about you, but my parents kicked me out of the house because of the widely-held belief that watching too much TV was bad for your eyes because of the radiation coming from the TV. When my parents were kids in the 50s and 60s, *this was actually true*: the power rectifier in an old TV emitted X-rays. By the time I was born in the early 80s, though, that type of rectifier circuit had been replaced with a safer one.

Fruit Juice is actually terrible for you. It's just sugar water. It may contain traces of vitamins or minerals but without the fat, fiber, or protein of actual food, it will cause an insulin spike in your bloodstream just like drinking a regular coke will. Most people don't know this, though, and I'll tell you why: lobbying. The food pyramid I learned in school (and you may have as well) wasn't based on neutral sources, it was based on research conducted by biased industry sources. The sugar lobby was and is *huge* and we're only now coming to realize how many decades of bad public health policy were influenced by their lobbying. (e.g. heart disease is caused by excess *sugar* intake, not excess fat/cholesterol intake)

And this sort of gets at the root of the problem: Information. I carry in my pocket a device which allows me to access the entire limitless wealth of all human knowledge and expertise. How do I know which source of information to trust, though? Which doctor do I listen to about my diet: the one that says meat is bad, or the one that says meat is good? How do I know who is right? Some people will trust one, other people will trust another, and regardless of which source they trust they **will** find information to support their position.

It's not that people don't care. It's that they don't understand.

RSV has been a big problem in the south this summer due to kids not having exposure to it last fall/winter (from staying inside). My guess is this article is conflated somewhat with the RSV problem being seen in those regions.

2) There is only so much that can be done from a development standpoint to ensure future immunity to currently unknown variants. What is often done (and was the case here) is that they target regions of the virus expected to be the most critical and least capable of being heavily altered without compromising the ability of the virus to propagate. But that is not foolproof and is still intended to function against a background of actually getting high amounts of the population vaccinated.

&gt;Healthway Medical Group's Dr Ng said: ""It is a lot easier for (seniors) to be able to come down from their (homes) to a place that can provide vaccination in the vicinity.  ""And if there are any members of the public that walk past, we have the bandwidth to address their concerns.""

This sounds like a really good approach, pop-up vaccination sites that can serve a local neighborhood, and which then return later to administer second shots. Makes good use of the vaccination personnel, and makes it very easy for local residents.  Staying in the same spot for a few days is a great idea, providing time for word to spread locally.

Second and much more likely is that you can still pass the bug onto a vaxed person and they don‚Äôt die but they still get sick.  I don‚Äôt want to get sick, it sucks.

A vaccine isn‚Äôt a bullet proof shield that prevents all harm.  It‚Äôs one of many protections we take to minimize the spread for the sake of EVERYONE.

Supposedly because Delta is more contagious. I recently read Delta produces 1000x more viral particles in the nose and throat of patients than the original covid. So it infects far more people. 

Having said that, I'm confused too. 

The CDC said the real infection rate is 3-4 times the official rate. So while we may only have 35 million positive infections done via tests, its probably closer to 120 million Americans who have already had covid (that figure was pre delta variant). 


https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html


On top of that 70% of Americans over age 12 have now had at least one shot. Something like almost 170 Americans are now fully vaccinated. 

Theres obviously some overlap between the two groups, but still I'd assume maybe (as a guess) 250 million Americans have either been fully vaccinated or had the virus by now (if you assume 1/3 of people who got vaccinated already had covid). That doesn't leave a lot of people to get the disease. Its confusing to me too.

You are so right about Florida's Southern border it's not touching any other countries at all how could anybody possibly arrive in Florida on the southern area is there any possible way someone could use transportation to move from one area to another if there's no land in between is there some possible apparatus or craft that can move over something that isn't land?

According to the HCMC Department of Health, the city vaccinated more than 262,000 people on Saturday. From July 22 to August 7, the city has administered vaccine doses to over 2.1 million people.  
  
The number of vaccine doses that the city has received from the Ministry of Health since July 22 is around 2.59 million. The health department says that at the current rapid vaccination rate, if more doses are not distributed in time, the city could run out by the end of Monday.  
  
Vaccination in HCMC has been sped up since July 22. In addition to priority groups, the city has opened up access to everyone above 18, with support from private healthcare facilities. Some procedures have been shortened to speed up the process. The number of vaccination teams has been doubled to 1,200.  
  
On August 3, the People's Committee of HCMC sent a proposal to Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam for the provision of another 5.5 million doses of vaccine from August 5 to 31. It has said that the city needs to administer an average of 210,000 doses of vaccine per day to reach the goal of vaccinating seven million adults in the city.  
  
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has asked the Ministry of Health to continue to prioritize provision of vaccines for southern localities, including HCMC; as also prepare a plan to allocate subsequent batches.  
  
So far, HCMC has received the highest number of vaccine doses in the country at more than four million doses. The vaccination distribution rate on the city's population is 21 percent, although only around 1 percent have been fully vaccinated.

We have to do it all the time up here in the Northeast and we have hot and cold cycles between winter and summer. Temperature swings of 100 F is not unusual. I think she's referring to people who do it themselves without understanding proper construction.

&gt;Also no windows, so very little air circulation unless you cut the sides if the container, at which point you would need to reinforce it.

You already have to frame the inside to put up interior walls and insulation. So this is a red herring. The support is already there. A 2x4  wall with studs 16 inches on center is more than enough to support the weight. The load bearing wall in my house is 5 inches wide and supports the weight of a latte and plaster ceiling and roof with tongue and grove boarding for a roof.

My family has been involved in construction for 3 generations before me. My father, grandfather and great-grandfather, I'm the first one that didn't go into that. The house I'm living in now was built by my grandfather. For temporary housing, converted shipping containers work perfectly fine.

The only point that she brings up that is really applicable here is you losing 10 inches wall to wall and about a foot or foot and half from floor to ceiling.",,,,1628440134,{},h86muec,False,t3_p0ffc9,False,True,t1_h86jcdd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p0ffc9/los_angeles_has_built_apartments_for_homeless/h86muec/,1628522252.0,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead, logically, businesses, schools etc can dictate that people inside of them wear masks/be tested/are vaccinated, and they probably should.

If people don't want to be vaccinated they government can't (or rather shouldn't) force them. Your ""right"" to feel no risk isn't a right. It sucks that we are literally likely to be paying for a poor response for years collectively, but you can't just stretch definitions to be convenient for you. You can avoid people, not let them in places you control, etc, but nothing that tells them what to do with their bodies as a government. A right to bodily autonomy is one few that claim to value human rights would state opposition towards.

I also want to point out that your right to public safety, particularly for yourself and others who are vaccinated is a bullshit argument. We have an extremely small chance of dying (as far as I can see for some vaccines its damn near zero) and very low chance of being seriously ill. Vaccines as far as I can tell, at least with the most effective ones, make the symptoms of covid flu like at the worst, so your argument is already one built purely on exceptions.

The real argument to be had is that they will cost us more money in the future, which is probably true because of variants and booster shots, but thats still not you worried about safety, but your having to get boosters/pay for that.

All in all, I find your argument to be disingenuous and hyperbolic",,,,1628389160,{},h84imal,False,t3_ozr842,False,False,t1_h84gtkb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ozr842/vaccine_mandates_are_lawful_effective_and_based/h84imal/,1628483424.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a military town in the sense that military wages go towards local businesses. Like active duty service members, not guys who design bombs and jets. 

And in the state of GA, it‚Äôs not ‚Äúmenacing‚Äù to point a gun at a ‚Äústranger‚Äù on your property. It‚Äôs illegal to shoot someone for merely being on your property, but you are allowed to brandish a gun on your own property as long as it isn‚Äôt pointed at anyone. I say ‚Äústranger‚Äù because that‚Äôs what the crazy people and the local cops will call anyone who goes door to door. ‚ÄúJust a good ole boy, never meaning no harm‚Äù is the mentality that would be applied to such cases.

So you‚Äôre saying the stretch of road between 25th and 45th street might be owned by one group with one set of rules and 45th to 65th is owned by someone else with potentially different rules and its up to the drivers to know all the different rules for each stretch and potentially route themselves completely out of the way to avoid ‚Äúdrunk road‚Äù?

And what happens when someone decides their private stretch of interstate is only usable by them?  You‚Äôd be fine driving 100 miles out of the way every day to get to work?

I‚Äôm sorry but the society that you depend on to survive doesn‚Äôt work that way and, bringing this back on topic, sometimes personal freedoms need to be sacrificed for the good of that society that you depend on.

I don‚Äôt know anything about taxi monopolies and that isn‚Äôt the point of this thread.  The point is unless you think you can function without society (which means no doctors, medicine, public roads, grocery stores, etc) then part of living in that society is sacrificing individual freedoms for the good of everyone.

Lastly and then I‚Äôm done because this isn‚Äôt going anywhere ‚Ä¶ not every unvaccinated person chooses not to be.  My girlfriends mother has health issues and doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable getting it.  People who choose to be unvaxed put her in danger and basically force her to be permanently home bound because it‚Äôs too risky to go anywhere when everyone is turning this into a political or personal freedom thing.  Anitvaxers are essentially taking her freedom away so if you think personal freedom is the ultimate goal for everyone (or just you?) then that should also be a problem for you because you or a family member could find yourself in the same position some day.

There is a reason why no anarchist or semi anarchist state survives for long and it‚Äôs not because people wanted to follow rules.  It‚Äôs because they and everyone else would be in constant danger if those rules didn‚Äôt exist so they recognize the need.

Though eventually the universe ended because that's the kind of story it is, nothing humans can do and nothing that happens here on earth can end the universe. So of course if we want to be extremely pedantic and literal nothing can be apocalyptic and we should never use that word again. In colloquial English it just means an extreme bad and devastating outcome. If you want to be literal, if covid death tolls were made 10x worse it could well literally decimate the global population before it ends. It would certainly be enough to decimate those who become infected. Possibly decimate many times over.

If covid were 10x deadlier that would have meant 6+ million deaths in the US and 43 million globally by now. Which is more than AIDS since the global outbreak really took off in 1980. A fatality rate of 10-30% is enormously high, and for a disease as highly communicable as covid that's pretty apocalyptic. Right now the US is averaging 100k+ cases per day. That would mean 10-30k people getting a death sentence every single day. 

In the US an average of 2.7-3 million people generally die each year. We are talking about doubling the total number of annual deaths, on top of the normal number of deaths. Then combine that with a huge increase in preventable other deaths due to that enormous strain on all health systems, and the number of people who would take their own lives in such a scenario. 

Our leading cause of death is the US is heart disease, and that kills 650k people each year. To have a disease pop up and kill ten times that number in a single year could well be described as apocalyptic. 

If you then add to that a vaccine resistance meaning we couldn't even slow it down? Yeah that's not great.

The shape and size of the virus did not change. Therefore masks did not become less efficient, the Delta variant of the virus is being shed by infected individuals in higher concentrations, and it is being shed by vaccinated individuals, these are the factors which have renewed mask recommendations/mandates in some areas.

The efficacy of masks in reducing transmission is not in question. The tenacity of the anti-mask/anti-vax sentiment in the US is causing people to be needlessly harmed and killed, which is exactly why you shouldn't arbitrarily claim that your un-supported/non peer-reviewed *feelings* about masks should be taken seriously.

If you convince someone who is willing to wear a mask that they should just stop wearing it, and they get infected, they could spread the virus to many others.

They fine you.  It's not like they jail you or cut off a finger - don't go fear mongering and acting as if it could be any punishment other than a fine.  This has been precedent for 116 years, your notion that the government could start punishing however they please is ridiculous.  For that to even be possible would would mean the Judicial branch of the government has fallen. There would have to be a coup for that to be possible.


In the scenario of a compulsory vaccine you are free to refuse and simply pay the fine (something that still looks *very* unlikely to happen).  Meanwhile you aren't even allowed to do this (refuse without an exemption) with school vaccinations as you must have a medical exemption.  In 2002, a federal district court [declined](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/217/938/2484794/) to find an exemption to mandatory vaccinations laws for ‚Äúsincerely held religious beliefs‚Äù or a fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning medical procedures of their children.




Freedom is ‚Äòself-government,‚Äô and self-government requires responsibility.  No one has the freedom to infringe on another person‚Äôs freedoms/rights. This is the very reason why governments &amp; Justice systems are created, and why police departments are needed. 


Human rights give all people the right to be protected from harm. Covid poses a major public health risk - not just to people who are unvaccinated by choice, but to those who cannot yet get vaccinated, such as children under age 12 or people who are allergic to vaccine ingredients or are immunocompromised.

The Delta variant is one of the most infectious respiratory diseases ever known and could overwhelm the healthcare system even worse than the first time, which would prevent people from being treated for other diseases and injuries.  It's so infectious that eventually there will be two groups: the vaccinated and the infected (the infected won't all be infected simultaneously of course).

Even with all that and legal precedent they almost certainly won't impose blanket compulsory vaccination for covid.

 &gt; [The data shows that protection against mortality from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is even higher ‚Äì around 69% ‚Äì for confirmed cases who had their second dose at least 7 days prior to their positive test.](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-vaccines-further-evidence-of-success)

It's kind of like climate change, it's hard to pin any one hurricane on global warming or not.

&gt;To more clearly illustrate the impact of such phenomena, Heuveline‚Äôs mean unfulfilled lifespan measures the difference between the average age at death of individuals who died within a given time frame and the average age these people would have been expected to reach had there not been a temporary shock. 


The paper has some interesting information. 

        https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0254925


&gt;This upward bias is particularly undesirable if individuals dying of the cause(s) of interest might be expected to suffer from other long-term conditions that would increase their risk of mortality from other causes. For COVID-19 victims, for instance, a correctly estimated life expectancy for their exact age would already over-estimate their potential years of life lost by ignoring well-documented ‚Äúco-morbidities‚Äù. As for the open-ended interval, linear approximation requires setting a somewhat arbitrary upper age limit. Relatively minor for premature mortality at relatively young ages, these issues make linear approximation more problematic to apply when the cause(s) of interest affect older individuals. In the case of COVID-19 deaths for instance, close to 60% of these deaths were above age 75 years (Fig 1) and reported in just one ten-year closed interval (75 to 84 years) and one open age interval (over 85 years).

...

&gt;In this respect, working with all deaths in a given period rather than with deaths from a specific cause of interest presents an important empirical advantage in addition to the benefit of assessing both the direct and the indirect effects of that cause of death. Using all deaths in a closed age interval between ages x and x+n, nDx, one may first calculate the contribution to the MUL of the deaths that were expected to occur under the counterfactual mortality conditions, nDx-C. For these deaths, the difference in length of life averages to the difference between the average number of years lived in the age interval under the prevailing conditions, nax, and under the counterfactual conditions, nax-C. The advantage of this approach is that setting an arbitrary upper value for the open-ended age interval becomes unnecessary. Having already reached age N, all the individuals who died in the open age interval in the period would all have been expected to die in the same open-ended age interval under the counterfactual mortality conditions, albeit not necessarily in that same period. For all the open-interval deaths over age N, DN+, the difference in length of life thus averages to the difference between life expectancy at age N under the prevailing conditions, eo(N), and under the counterfactual conditions, eo-C(N). With this approach, only the issue of estimating the average reduction in length of lived lives on closed age intervals from values of life expectancies that vary on these age intervals remains, and pertains to ‚Äúexcess‚Äù deaths, nDx‚ÄînDx-C.

They define their variables in the full paper.

The vaccine absolutely makes people safer. However in a school setting. Common mask usage is not going to be effective. Masks are effective at limiting spread in short time exposure situations. Meeting someone for a few minutes (like a delivery driver). Incredibly effective, especially when paired with open air conditions.

 But in a classroom setting with shared air for a 4-6 hour period. TBH with Delta, zero percent worth it. Mandate vaccines for teachers, mandate vaccines for students old enough. Isolate students too young into pods with one teacher dedicated to the pod, and mandate the vaccine as soon as it becomes available for K+ ages.

Except you are literally back to right before I made the comment explaining the logical conclusion of what you said. Very obviously when you point out the logical conclusion of something you are extrapolating further than what the person said. Its quite literally the point of doing so.

The literal point was to point out the problem with your argument, but you missed that.

&gt;You downplayed this public health issue later in the comment, and a surge in hospitalizations is clearly relevant to that.

This seems like a non sequitur in terms of what its following. Its like you weren't sure what to reply so you went back to a previous comment to address a different point.

Whats more? That point is literally the same logic as the argument I already rebutted.

It also completely ignores alternatives yet again.


&gt;You're assuming the reason for the deletion, even though reposting before the reply contradicts it.

I literally just explained to you that this is based on previous occurrences, yet here you are talking about this again.

&gt;That's a hypocritical thing to say because you haven't even addressed my other point.

??? The point where you make literally the same point but expect a different result ???

If Subway has a machine in the store where .3% of the employees who used it died, but by adding a plastic guard, they reduced that to .003%, then they would need to add the guard. This is the same case for the vaccine. I know that's a simplification, but there's literally no reason not to get the vaccine and millions of adult babies can't do this on their own, so either we decide as a society to just let them die or we make them get vaccinated using the only tools we have, which is employer or government mandated vaccines.

I know it isn't pretty, but one of the things my local hospital just pointed out today is that we have 2100 people in the ICU, 94% are unvaccinated. By simple math, we would have 20.

I'm from Scotland, and it's very odd hearing such a strong anti-vax mentality from where I am, it's been in the news about the US long enough I'm not surprised anymore, but I'm just curious - do you have to pay to get the vaccine in the US?

I'm just trying to figure out why the anti-vax stuff exists there to this level? In Scotland because I have asthma I got my two doses of the vaccine for free, (elderly people, those with other at risk conditions and those at high risk jobs also got it for free, and those who aren't on the list to get it for free it only costs like ¬£10 total). I'm also used to getting the yearly flu vaccine for my asthma from my local GP, again, for free and get all my medical care/medications etc for free (or it feels free, it's paid for by tax-payers). I'd be curious that if Americans had a more human approach to hospitals and doctors (i.e. you go when you're sick and need support and it will be given to you as a basic human right, no costs, no stress, you're covered just for being human) that there wouldn't be such a distrusting relationship?

&gt;  
&gt;Mask mandate is reinstated for Broward County Public SchoolsAnti-mask protesters gathered as Broward County Public Schools held a board meeting about COVID-19 safety precautions and potential mask mandates for the upcoming school year. The School Board voted 9-0 in favor of reinstating the mask mandate. BY MATIAS J. OCNER  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Students and faculty will begin the year masked up in Palm Beach County public schools after the School District of Palm Beach County announced a shift in policy on facial covering.In an open letter posted on the district‚Äôs website, Superintendent Michael Burke said, ‚ÄúI am requiring facial coverings inside schools and on buses for all students attending Palm Beach County District-operated schools, unless the student‚Äôs parent/guardian chooses to opt-out of this requirement.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;To opt out, a parent has to send a signed note telling the child‚Äôs first period teacher.No such option is being given for staff, who will be required to wear a facial covering indoors and on buses.Burke‚Äôs message said this might change 30 days from now when he sees how things are going.

&gt;She was told to eat, sleep and spend time away from her husband as much as possible -- no easy task in their one-bedroom condominium. Three days after this advice, she tested positive for COVID-19 herself.

&gt;The woman's story reflects a feature of Tokyo's latest coronavirus wave: Officials reported Thursday that 61% of new infections in the week to Aug. 2 could be traced to the home. At-home infections had never topped 60% in previous waves.

&gt;‚ÄùThere was no way we could use separate bathrooms,"" said the woman, who asked to remain anonymous. ""I just had to resign myself to the fact that I would probably get infected.""

&gt;Her husband's symptoms were mild, mainly a cough. With hospitals under strain, and the government urging a limit on admissions in some areas to only high-risk cases, a fast-growing number of Tokyo coronavirus sufferers like him have been forced to recover at home.

[],,koshgeo,,,[],,,,text,t2_cyy2b,False,False,[],"I made up the ""freedom sewers"" part, but there was genuine skepticism about the idea that cholera was caused by contamination of the water supply back in the 1800s.  It wasn't until a particular outbreak in the 1850s in London that conclusive evidence of the connection became well-established, and even then it took a while for people to be convinced and even longer for the infrastructure and other changes to occur to prevent it from continuing to happen.  It used to be that water was drawn from and distributed by companies straight from the River Thames with a bit of ordinary filtering.  Can you imagine?

I don't think people have changed all that much in terms of the psychology of pandemics.  It's pretty natural for people to complain about new practices that they do not think are necessary, or where they do not fully understand the scientific reasons behind it.  It's even worse if there are people benefiting from the status quo or promoting misinformation.

Regardless, I think there is much to be learned by looking at a variety of past pandemics and how people handled the societal issues (well or badly).

I don't think it's wise to \*refuse\* the local high risk population booster shots when we already have the infrastructure in place to get it to them easily and relatively cheaply.  Roads are not the biggest problem regarding distribution of mRNA vaccines.  Refrigerated shipping and 100% consistent, large scale, long-term storage at -60-80c very much are.  You can get away with regular refrigerated temperatures for up to 31 days, but that gives you a fairly small window of opportunity to actually get it into people's arms if that's also how you are storing it during last mile distribution.

So instead of accusing me of being selfish, maybe offer up some ideas on how we can solve the refrigeration problem.

[],,Molire,,,[],,,,text,t2_174cr0,False,True,,"&gt;Hopefully, it will be over by October but who knows at this point.  

The most recent (August 4, 2021) [IHME COVID-19 Projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america?view=cumulative-deaths&amp;tab=trend) for the US indicate 648,941 cumulative deaths on December 1, if 95% mask use is adopted in public by August 7 (PDF, [p.3 of 29, para.6](http://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/Projects/COVID/2021/102_briefing_United_States_of_America_32.pdf#page=3)).        
                
Otherwise, the IHME current projection points at a cumulative total of 696,900 COVID-19 deaths on December 1, 2021.  
             
In the IHME projection under the worse scenario, mobility moves toward pre-COVID-19 levels in those who are vaccinated.  
            
Under the the worse scenario, the projection points at 756,497 cumulative deaths by December 1.  
             
For the US, the [JHU COVID-19 Dashboard](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) shows cumulative deaths presently at  616,719.  
            
Thus, if the IHME projections prove to be accurate, the U.S. population would suffer from 32,222 to 80,181 to 139,778 new deaths over the next 115 days.  
          
IHME ‚Äî COVID-19 Results Briefing, United States of America, August 4, 2021 ([PDF file](http://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/Projects/COVID/2021/102_briefing_United_States_of_America_32.pdf  
)): ""The entire US is experiencing increasing transmission due to the Delta variant combined with reductions in mask use to nearly 25% and mobility levels that are near pre-  COVID-19 levels....However, our model does not take into account waning immunity after natural infection and vaccination. Once waning immunity is included in our forecasts, we will likely revise upward our forecasts for infections and cases later in the year. In our worse scenario, due to further increases in mobility and declines in mask use, the peak levels of infection, cases, hospitalizations, and deaths would be nearly 75% higher and would occur in early October.""  
             
In the US, what is going to happen to the population and the economy over the coming weeks and months predictably is being decided by how soon and how many of the estimated [117.3 million](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total) people age ‚â•12 years, who are not fully vaccinated today, get fully vaccinated, without delay.  
         
Presently, [50.1% of the total](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total) U.S. population is fully vaccinated.

&gt;The author of this article is co-authoring a book, VIRAL: The Search for the Origin of Covid-19, with Matt Ridley. It will be published in late 2021 by HarperCollins. The book explores both natural and lab Covid-19 origin hypotheses.  
&gt;  
&gt;Introduction  
&gt;  
&gt;In this work, I summarize and assess the arguments for a natural origin and against a laboratory-based origin of Covid-19 presented in the Holmes et al. preprint \[1\]. The preprint review by Holmes et al. represents one of the most extensive compilations of arguments for a zoonotic origin and was authored by numerous experts in relevant fields. Although Holmes et al. ‚Äúcontend that there is substantial body of scientific evidence supporting a zoonotic origin for SARS-CoV-2‚Äù \[1\], I argue that all publicly available evidence and information are consistent with both natural and laboratory origin scenarios. In the absence of dispositive evidence in support of either a natural spillover or a research-related incident, it is necessary to rigorously investigate both hypotheses \[2,3\]. Only with more data and information can scientists confidently evaluate the likelihood of each origin hypothesis. A credible, transparent, evidence-based, and international investigation of the origin of Covid-19 is not only vital but also feasible \[3‚Äì5\].

It's not as though the CDC is saying, ""hey, we really think offices in NYC shouldn't fully reopen yet... especially just as schools are doing the same after Labor Day."" There's literally zero being said about this 'return to normal' and pumping the brakes a little, at the same time as they're labeling NY a ""high transmission area"". That's talking out of both sides of the mouth, as usual, so how do I know the need for a booster isn't going to get out of control before they actually, ya know, DO something about it and more people die? Before those of us who were vaxxed up early are now at risk? 

IMO, you have to be somewhat crazy to take their confusing levels of advised caution and the slow roll of concern about boosters and then say, ""Imma wait until they say it's okay..."" 

""THEY"" have made it REALLY clear they don't give a shit about anything other than getting the economy restarted. To me, the most glaringly obvious example of this is the way they have not done what is quite literally the easiest 'win' for curbing spread going into Fall and Winter, which is to advise offices to continue WFH on a federal level and to then create protective regulations for employees who now have to be concerned both about their kids bringing an infection home from school or themselves bringing it home from work and having to quarantine. One of these things can go, the other, arguably, can not, but you know what? BOTH probably will - both WFH and remote schooling will return, in full force, because of this insane reluctance to take easy wins for fear of upsetting commercial real estate markets and the employers who insisted upon a full return. 

Doing that now, dying on this hill, will only hasten the recalcitrance of most office workers to EVER return.

The FDA isn't dragging their feet.  Full approval is expected by Labor Day, which is 4 weeks from tomorrow.  That's record time.

As for 5-11 approval, the FDA has already said it's not getting an EUA because the science doesn't support that and instead it will get approved after the full approval for the vaccine, so likely later this year.

&gt;This fourth wave of the pandemic will probably peak in the Bay Area late this month or early next, quickly drop off in September, and almost certainly not come close to causing the deadly chaos of last winter‚Äôs surge. That‚Äôs health experts‚Äô best guess, based on local and national models that take into account how the now-dominant delta variant has raged through other countries and how well vaccines are holding up against it.  
    
&gt;Some experts predict the peak could arrive in just a couple weeks. Others are more grim: One San Francisco model suggests that this surge could peak on Sept. 3 with 336 people hospitalized for COVID-19 in the city ‚Äî almost 100 more patients than the worst day of the winter surge ‚Äî and 237 additional deaths. But even when all the variables are well defined, infectious disease models are about as reliable as weather forecasts, which is to say they aren‚Äôt great looking beyond a week or two. And many variables remain poorly understood with delta.  
        
&gt;Vaccines are critical to containing the virus and finding a way to coexist with it ‚Äî that remains unchallenged. But against a variant as infectious as delta, they probably won‚Äôt be enough to stamp out COVID-19 entirely. That‚Äôs been a tough lesson these past few weeks across the Bay Area, where vaccination rates are higher than most parts of the country and many people assumed that would prevent, or sharply curtail, another surge.  
    
&gt;The irony is that this surge is perhaps the best proof yet that the vaccines are holding strong against the worst outcomes of COVID, preventing severe disease that leads to hospitalization and death. That‚Äôs why this summer shouldn‚Äôt be as deadly as earlier waves. And it should mean that the Bay Area can make it through this wave ‚Äî and the ones that almost certainly will follow in the fall or winter ‚Äî with far less economic and social impact than before.  
    
&gt;But this surge also demonstrates that the coronavirus won‚Äôt be so easily shaken off. ‚ÄúThe goalposts have changed,‚Äù said Stephen Shortell, former dean of the UC Berkeley School of Public Health. ‚ÄúWe thought we were on the 10-yard line and now it‚Äôs 30 yards. It‚Äôs frustrating, but that‚Äôs the reality.‚Äù  
    
&gt;That‚Äôs only increased the urgency to get more people vaccinated, and led to more vaccine mandates. Multiple cities and counties in California are now requiring government workers be vaccinated ‚Äî in some places at risk of losing their jobs. On Thursday, the state ordered health care workers in all settings to be vaccinated by the end of September. Many businesses also are ordering employees, and in some cases customers, to get vaccinated.

&gt;Last week, eight of the nine Bay Area counties issued new mask mandates for everyone, regardless of vaccination status, in large part due to the risk of transmission from those who are vaccinated. That‚Äôs reasonable, many health experts said, even as they acknowledged that like so many aspects of the pandemic, post-vaccination transmission is still poorly understood, and it‚Äôs not clear how much it‚Äôs contributing to this surge.

&gt;‚ÄúWhat delta taught us is that what you know today is useful for decision-making for today, but things can change very quickly,‚Äù said Dr. Robert Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at UCSF. ‚ÄúSix weeks ago, I thought we were sitting pretty. And, within the course of a month, delta went from a blip to the dominant virus in the country, and the more we came to understand it the more we came to realize it was a very different beast.‚Äù

&gt;Roughly two-thirds of all Bay Area residents are fully vaccinated, though rates vary among counties ‚Äî from a low of 50% in Solano to 75% in Marin. That puts the region well above overall vaccination rates for the state and country, which are 54% and 50%, respectively.

&gt;But despite generally high vaccination rates, the Bay Area has been hit hard by delta since reopening June 15. Cases have climbed far faster and higher than predicted. The region has surpassed last summer‚Äôs surge in cases and hospitalizations. About 800 people were hospitalized in the nine-county region as of Friday ‚Äî a more than fourfold increase since July 1.

&gt;‚ÄúI saw some predictions about a month ago from the state suggesting that our hospitals would peak similar to last summer,‚Äù said Dr. Chris Farnitano, the Contra Costa County health officer. ‚ÄúWell, last summer we had about 110 patients in the hospital (in Contra Costa County), and last week we‚Äôve had 140, 150. So we already blew through those summer surge numbers and we‚Äôre still going.‚Äù

&gt;Health experts like Farnitano had hoped that even if cases increased after the state reopened, high vaccination rates would translate to far fewer hospitalizations ‚Äî what they refer to as a ‚Äúdecoupling‚Äù of cases from hospitalizations and deaths. But so far that hasn‚Äôt been the case with hospital numbers.

&gt;San Francisco‚Äôs hospital forecast was especially concerning. Dr. Grant Colfax, director of the Department of Public Health, said the 336-patient prediction assumes that vaccination rates don‚Äôt increase, and it doesn‚Äôt factor in the new mask mandate or other measures people might take to protect themselves. It also assumes that the delta variant causes more serious disease, which is still not clear.

&gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a plausible scenario given reasonable scientific assumptions. But it‚Äôs not inevitable,‚Äù Colfax said.  
          
&gt;Even if that projection comes to fruition, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre in a much better place than last winter,‚Äù Colfax said, noting that models last December predicted San Francisco could have well over 1,000 people hospitalized at once; the actual peak was 259. ‚ÄúHundreds of hospitalizations are being prevented and hundreds of lives are being saved because of vaccines,‚Äù he said.  
    
&gt;There are hopeful signs that community-level immunity will be protective. Fully vaccinated people, though they may be infected by delta at higher rates than previously expected, are rarely hospitalized and even less likely to die. ‚ÄúWhat would really worry me would be a surge in hospitalizations in the immunized,‚Äù said Dr. Steven Goodman, a Stanford epidemiologist. ‚ÄúThat would indicate that the protection from serious disease is weakening.‚Äù  
    
&gt;As it stands, people who are not vaccinated make up from 80% to 95% of hospitalizations throughout California. Fully vaccinated people who end up in the hospital almost always are over age 80 and have one or more underlying health problem.  
    
&gt;Unvaccinated patients who are hospitalized tend to be younger and healthier than those who received hospital care earlier in the pandemic. Farnitano said a slightly lower percentage of hospitalized patients are ending up in intensive care ‚Äî about 20% now, compared with 25% to 35% last summer and winter.  
    
&gt;So far, COVID deaths are not climbing at nearly the same pace as cases and hospitalizations, and experts believe this will continue. Currently, the Bay Area is reporting about five COVID deaths a day ‚Äî about a fifth of last summer‚Äôs peak, and less than a tenth of the winter peak.  
    
&gt;Though this surge is unsettling, there are some important reasons for hope, many health experts said. Most notably, at least in the Bay Area the current situation is proving that with enough people vaccinated it‚Äôs possible to resume near-normal activities without causing widespread severe illness and death.  
    
&gt;Cases and hospitalizations may have surpassed last summer ‚Äî but last summer everyone had been wearing masks, indoors and out, for months, and most businesses were still largely operating under capacity limits. Large gatherings were banned. Fans weren‚Äôt allowed at baseball games and concerts were forbidden. People were navigating small social bubbles and didn‚Äôt know when they‚Äôd next get to hug grandparents and other at-risk loved ones.  
    
&gt;Now, though mask mandates are back and many people are once again feeling timid around crowds, there are few absolute restrictions. The state has been largely open since June 15, and no one‚Äôs talking about locking down again. Reopening schools for full-time, in-person education has become a priority, and experts don‚Äôt anticipate the district-wide shutdowns of the previous 18 months, though some schools may experience temporary closures if outbreaks occur.  
    
&gt;The current Bay Area surge should end in the next four to six weeks due to the natural course of the virus ‚Äî delta in particular has tended to spike fast, then drop off just as quickly in other countries. Experts hope that an uptick in vaccinations and people being more cautious ‚Äî wearing masks and avoiding large gatherings ‚Äî will speed up that process.  
    
&gt;But what‚Äôs happened this summer ‚Äúshould make us all realize that we are in for future waves until we close the vaccination gap,‚Äù said Dr. Abraar Karan, an infectious disease expert at Stanford. ‚ÄúAnd even then, we may need to tap into our other defenses like masks intermittently.‚Äù  
    
&gt;The fall and winter will present new challenges, and there could be another surge before the end of the year. Children will be back in school and college students back on campus. Flu season will arrive, cold weather will drive people indoors and people will gather for major holidays.  
    
&gt;Vaccine immunity may be waning by then, too ‚Äî yet another variable that scientists are trying to understand. There could be another new variant to contend with.  
    
&gt;Wachter said that though he‚Äôs had his dark moments, he can also appreciate how much better off everyone is now than a year ago.

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

However, the headline still is very bad imo, for two reasons.

* **It doesn't contextualize the relative risks for the vaccinated vs. the unvaccinated.** As more people get vaccinated, we should expect vaccinated people to naturally make up a larger share of cases. Now, luckily, just over half of Californians are fully vaccinated, so it's not particularly misleading here, but nevertheless the headline format of ""\_\_\_% of cases of vaccinated!"" has massive capacities to mislead because it ignores base rates.
* **By focusing on breakthroughs, it frames the problem as the vaccinated.** Imagine a headline of ""81% of cases in California are not fully vaccinated!"" Technically, it's saying exactly the same thing!

About 19% of recent documented COVID-19 cases in California are breakthroughs, and state data shows that those who have been fully vaccinated account for an increasing portion of positive tests.
The number, which contradicts a repeated public portrayal that breakthrough cases are negligible, can be easily misinterpreted. To be clear, this is not an indication of some sort of vaccine failure. Quite the contrary.

Breakthrough cases were expected. State data still suggests that unvaccinated people are nearly five times as likely to be infected as those who are inoculated. And almost all the hospitalizations and deaths are among unvaccinated people. Vaccines remain the most important tool for fighting the pandemic.
Rather, the rising proportion of breakthrough cases suggests that even people who have been vaccinated are potentially significant spreaders of coronavirus, especially the delta variant. It reinforces why vaccinated people should also wear masks in public settings.

Breakthrough case rates are a sensitive topic, one that some health officials are trying to avoid and which has sparked a lot of handwringing in the media about how to report it.

The fear is that misinterpretation of the numbers will dissuade people from getting vaccinated. But, without the data, the important push for everyone to wear masks is weakened.

Although vaccinated people are well-protected against serious illness, they can, if infected and even if they‚Äôre not showing symptoms, spread the virus to others. Indeed, people with breakthrough infections of the delta variant might be just as contagious as unvaccinated people, although the science continues evolving on that point.

The call for vaccinated people to don masks is not just for their own protection. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about you, it‚Äôs about everybody,‚Äù says Contra Costa County Health Officer Chris Farnitano. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about keeping the cases down.‚Äù

But, to make that point, it‚Äôs critical to have the supporting data.

Unfortunately, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped tracking breakthrough cases on May 1, focusing only on patients who are hospitalized or die. The thinking was apparently that the risk of transmission from breakthrough cases was negligible. We now know, with the delta variant, that‚Äôs no longer the case.

This past week, much media attention has misleadingly focused on a Kaiser Family Foundation survey of breakthrough data from the 24 states that are tracking breakthrough cases. It found that the cumulative infection rate for vaccinated people since the start of the year is well below 1% in all reporting states. Thus, the narrative has downplayed breakthrough cases.

But cumulative 2021 data is not helpful information for confronting the current surge driven by the relatively new delta variant. Which is why the daily breakthrough case rates are important.
To their credit, California and many county health officials have been tracking new COVID-19 cases and cross-checking them with state vaccination lists to determine the infection rates of vaccinated and unvaccinated.

Thus, for the week of July 31, the statewide average daily rate for vaccinated people was 7 per 100,000, double what it was two weeks earlier, and for unvaccinated it was 33 per 100,000.

But, amazingly, state health officials won‚Äôt say what portion of all the new cases involve vaccinated people. It‚Äôs not rocket science. We know the portion of the population that has been vaccinated. With the numbers the state has already released, the rest of the calculation is simple math.

Officials from Santa Clara, Alameda and Contra Costa counties, who track the same data for their jurisdictions, have confirmed my calculations or provided their own. The state, for three days this past week, refused to do either.

In Contra Costa County, the seven-day average as of July 28 showed that 23% of the new cases were breakthroughs in fully vaccinated people. For Santa Clara County for about the same time period, the portion was 16%. Alameda County estimates 19% of new cases for the month of July were breakthroughs. And, doing the math, the portion for California was 19% as of July 31, up from 15% about two weeks earlier.

State officials note correctly that the portion of breakthrough cases would be expected to increase because more people are getting vaccinated. But the increase is outpacing the rate of newly vaccinated.
To be sure, the data, like most of the COVID-19 case data we have, is limited because it relies on test results. Thus, it probably underrepresents breakthrough cases because infected vaccinated people are more likely than unvaccinated to be asymptomatic and consequently less likely to seek testing.
Randomized testing is needed to understand the prevalence of breakthrough cases more accurately. But now that we have surpassed 10,000 daily cases in California, it‚Äôs no longer insignificant that roughly one in five are from those who have already completed their shots.

The southern city is currently the biggest COVID-19 hot spot with 4,000-7,000 cases recorded daily since mid-July, and the main objective right now is to reduce deaths among severe cases as medical facilities strain to handle large inflows of patients.  
  
The health ministry noted that through donation sources in the past, the drug appears to help reduce the viral load in the infected, but cautioned that members of public should not look for or stock up on these drugs.  
  
The administration and the doses required must be indicated by doctors.  
  
L∆∞∆°ng Ng·ªçc Khu√™, Head of the Health Ministry's Department of Medical Examination and Treatment, said that Remdesivir is still after all a new drug and the administration of this drug must be closely followed to see its actual effectiveness.  
  
On August 6, the health ministry held a meeting on COVID-19 treatment, in which they discussed the use of anticoagulant (oral drug), antiviral drugs including Remdesivir, monoclonal antibody drugs, and prone positioning.  
  
However, it has not officially approved the drug yet.  
  
Future batches of the drugs will be allocated to HCM City and the southern region, and if other localities need some then adjustments could be made.  
  
VinGroup said it had negotiated successfully for 500,000 vials of Remdesivir from Indian pharmaceutical company Cipla under licensing agreement from US-based Gilead Sciences. The first batch arrived at T√¢n S∆°n Nh·∫•t International Airport in HCM City on August 5.

My parents didn't believe in the radiation thing, they just wanted us outside and active instead of being lazy. It's literally what they said, get off your ass and stop being lazy and get outside.

Orange juice and apple juice don't have added sugar. At least not around these parts. You could get milk too if you wanted but most kids got that at school because it doesn't sit well in a lunchbox unrefrigerated.

So you are saying they don't understand yet they have more knowledge at their fingertips than any other time in history? Do you not see the fallacious argument that is? Why don't they talk to their pediatrician? Or use that little device to go look up information on the AAP site?

&gt;During the first full school-year after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, enrollment in U.S. public schools fell dramatically (i.e., a decline of 1.1 million students or 2 percent of prior K-12 enrollment). This enrollment decline is an important leading indicator of the educational impact of the pandemic. In particular, the existence and magnitude of this enrollment decline implies a myriad of potential consequences for schools and students. These include the likely fiscal strain on public schools of declining enrollment as well as the diverse developmental implications for students related to the underlying behaviors driving enrollment declines such as kindergarten skipping and redshirting, school switching, truancy, and dropping out. Arguably, the major policy lever relevant to these enrollment decisions was (and continues to be) the instructional mode states and districts choose for their schools (i.e., in-person, remote-only, or a hybrid). In the fall of 2020, policymakers confronted an exceptionally difficult choice about how to reopen schools; one that required them to balance the public-health risks to their students and communities with the educational and economic harm of remote instruction.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;In this study, we rely on several unique data sources to construct quasi-experimental evidence on how their fall 2020 reopening decisions influenced the disenrollment phenomenon. Our results suggest that the decision to offer remote-only instruction last fall contributed meaningfully to disenrollment from public schools. Specifically, our estimates suggest that offering remote-only instruction increased disenrollment by 42 percent (i.e., a change from 2.6 to 3.7 percent) relative to in-person instruction while hybrid instruction had small and statistically insignificant effects. To frame these effect sizes against the national decline in public school enrollment, we note that public schools previously enrolled roughly 49 million students and that roughly 57 percent of students faced remote-only instruction as of November 2020 (Henderson, Peterson, and West, 2021). The additional enrollment decline in remote-only districts (i.e., 1.1 percentage points) implies that public schools lost roughly 300,000 K-12 students as a result of these decisions (i.e., 49 million ‚®â 0.57 ‚®â 0.011). This implies that the widespread adoption of remote-only instruction explains roughly a quarter of the disenrollment from public schools. Notably, we also find evidence that the effects of remote-only instruction on the decline in public-school enrollment were particularly concentrated in kindergarten and elementary school grades.",,,,1628383812,{},h848trz,True,t3_p04z9x,False,True,t3_p04z9x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p04z9x/new_paper_k12_public_school_enrollment_dropped_by/h848trz/,1628478330.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number that need to be vaccinated increases as each strain gets more transmissible.

The ancestral strain had an R0 of around 3. Lacking any other changes to behavior, you need 67% of the population to be immune before herd immunity even causes the number of cases to start dropping rather than increasing.

Delta strain is estimated to have an R0 of 5-8. You may need as much as 88% of the population to be immune before cases start dropping instead of increasing. The percent of the population that needs to be vaccinated also then increases based on how effective the vaccine is at preventing transmission, which is never perfect.

&gt;Expecting everyone to comply seems strange

That's the idea behind the mandate. Make it as easy as possible and completely free to get the vaccine, and spread as much education as possible to minimize hesitancy; then also make it difficult and expensive to go through life without being vaccinated, enough to overcome most of what hesitancy remains. Will it hit 100% of people? Of course not, but we definitely gotta get better than 80%.",,,,1628451410,{},h87b813,False,t3_ozr842,False,True,t1_h866q6w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ozr842/vaccine_mandates_are_lawful_effective_and_based/h87b813/,1628536356.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Added to that I have a high faith in Western Medicine, did my own research about the vaccines and finally I spoke with my PCP about the vaccines.

However, currently, with public roads and all? Yeah I support laws against drunk driving. Because you are just as much a threat to the others around you as you are to yourself. Unvaccinated people are only hurting themselves and other unvaccinated people. That's their choice. And no one's forcing you to inject yourself with something.

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

[],,whtsths0,,,[],,,,text,t2_5f3eyh3r,False,False,,"You mentioned the reports on VAERS, but understand that many people who get the vaccine are 80+ years old. People pass from a number of things, and the way VAERS works is that *anyone* can report something, even you and I.

So let's say a 90 year old gets the vaccine, then passes a week later, their family could report it under adverse effects. However, remove the vaccine, and it's likely the person would have passed regardless.

One huge thing to consider: look at how quickly they paused the Johnson and Johnson vaccine due to some rare but serious side effects. There was even controversy over the decision since it was so rare, but I agreed that it was smart to pause. 

So, if they were willing to completely pause the J&amp;J rollout during the *height* of the pandemic over a relatively small (but still serious) occurrence, they would have *also* paused either Moderna or Pfizer if any injuries were happening.

To put it into perspective: Pfizer has been used throughout the *world*, and the total number of doses given (for all vaccines) is roughly 4.5 *billion*! That's huge! Yet, in the US, we paused the rollout of J&amp;J for a very very very rare occurrence. With that in mind, there has been nothing found in either Moderna or Pfizer to warrant a pause in the US, and those vaccines are used much more than J&amp;J ever was. 

Despite how uncommon the J&amp;J vaccine is, they still found a problem. Like a needle in a haystack, but they paid attention. That should provide tons of confidence as to the safety of especially Pfizer and Moderna. 

Now, compare that to the total deaths of covid. Not just deaths, but also long-covid which can be devastating. There's simply no comparison: covid is horrific, and the vaccine is an incredible achievement.

Finally, think of it this way: you're getting antibodies one way or another. Everyone will, assuming they survive a real infection. Whether it's soon, or next year, or with another variant, antibodies are the only way out of this for you individually and for everyone at large.

If that's the choice, wouldn't you rather have antibodies from *controlled inflammation* in a vaccine? Some of the smarted people in the world worked on these vaccines, and they are designed to safely give you antibodies. You may feel crappy for a day or two, or not since some people have zero headaches or aches, but at least it's controlled.

A real covid infection? That's uncontrolled inflammation, and you're at the whims of a brand new virus that's mutated into deadlier forms, and a virus that may have even leaked from a lab. Sounds gross.

So, with all that, try to get the vaccine. Tell the doctors your concerns, and maybe wait onsite for an hour or so. They'll make sure you're all good, and in all probability, you will.

If this post helps you or others get vaccinated, then I'll be very happy. You'll be fine, and also very happy you got it! :)",,,,1628452306,{},h87d50w,False,t3_p09zfp,False,True,t1_h86w3kk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p09zfp/daily_discussion_thread_august_08_2021/h87d50w/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,8b8c1e423299635b31c5707824ccb918d7f87e4d,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1628452321.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

The cruise ship still looks more stable in my mind, even though the majority is above the water line, it's width seems to create a center of gravity that would be much lower.   While a container is going to pretty top heavy.

A slight leak on it, and I dont see it sinking gracefully but rolling.  I dont see it tipping while being moored, but moving it from spot to spot or just installing it would be sufficient movement.

But this is something I dont have much knowledge in.  I'm just not a huge fan of these things as cost saving measures, unless the size is exactly what you want.

Mask don‚Äôt work, social distancing is ineffective.  The only thing proven to work is the vaccine and that appears to be temporary and will require additional shots on a routine basis.

Its a simplification that ignores the massive difference between telling an employee what to do with their bodies when alternatives exist and a plastic guard....

That difference is all the difference in the world.


&gt; but there's literally no reason not to get the vaccine and millions of adult babies can't do this on their own, so either we decide as a society to just let them die or we make them get vaccinated using the only tools we have, which is employer or government mandated vaccines.

I've said this in a million different comments but I disagree strongly here so I'll just list the disagreements.

1. They would not simply die. That's not a factual look at what will happen with high rates of people being unvaccinated. Factually while a percentage I find unsavoury would die, it is still a small percentage of them that would die, and a much larger but still less than majority percentage of them that would get very ill.


    The reality is that they would simply incur cost and inconvenience on us due to booster shots for variants.

2. There are many tools to encourage vaccination numbers that don't involve violating people/force such as public messaging that doesn't speak down to people, incentives etc. There are also ways that employers can maintain safety without forcing vaccination, such as strict mask/test adherence. 

    I also want to point out that the rates aren't as bad as reddit pretends they are, as I listed in a previous comment in this thread.  I don't think its as uphill a battle as people here seem to be saying it is.


&gt;We are running out of options to take care of people. 

Your phrasing makes it sound like impending doom, but that's not the case. Again, literally most people in your country are vaccinated. That's not hyperbole or a lie.

This idea that we should be flustered and panicking because everyone is going to do is not supported by fact.

Even the context given with your ICU situation doesn't sound to me like good supporting evidence for this. In fact I wouldn't mind if you posted a source because that could be taken very differently based on the minutiae of what each term means. Like are they all covid patients, what are the usual numbers, have the numbers decreased etc etc.

Even then, I feel pretty absolute in not forcing people. I think this line is an extremely important one. I also think what's important to realize is that as vaccinated people they pose very little immediate or short term threat to us.

It also increases one's own health risk, and as evidenced many times, plenty gets sent to the hospital.  And guess who's footing the expensive hospital bill?  It's always the public, not the unvaccinated patient.

There are scenarios where not getting vaccinated is not a problem whatsoever.  For example, if one never interacts with others people.  Or if one is willing to take full financial and non-financial responsibility if they infected other people, or if they themselves got sick.  How many are willing to make this commitment?  I bet you, NO ONE.

Ever heard of the idea of cause-and-effect?  The aforementioned harm inflicted by the unvaccinated people is the cause.  The limitation in choices (for example not being allowed into indoor dining) is the effect.  Don't want the effect?  It's really easy, don't be the cause.  You want your freedom to choose, I want my right to not risk an exposure from unvaccinated people too.  Why does your right supercede mine?",,,,1628399784,{},h8504x2,False,t3_ozr842,False,True,t1_h849hmg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ozr842/vaccine_mandates_are_lawful_effective_and_based/h8504x2/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,40a69fa1aa09348a47c3e8305cd8ef455d2db774,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1628399799.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Instead it got taken over by the anti-diet crowd as a justification for not trying to lose weight at all, but also not exercising.

Left me shook and in need of answers.  Abandoned the idea of HAES and started trying to lose weight.  Lost 90 lbs permanently (as of 5 years ago), and another 5-10 have been back and forth since I switched to body recomp instead of pure weight loss.  Picked up endurance cycling.  Got into lifting.

Its perfectly fine to limit you from doing something to other people. Its not fine for the method of limitation to be to force you to do something to your body that you don't want done.

Driving? Guns? None of those involve any amount of forced procedures. 

The fact that you tried to compare licenses to bodily autonomy is blatantly in bad faith.


&gt;having a job, etc.

You are being tremendously dishonest if you think forcing people to not be able to provide for themselves isn't literally the same in effect to forcing them to do whatever you are saying the alternative.

It's like saying putting someone under duress is not forcing them to do something. In this case you are literally advising people be unable to work. In a capitalist country that means they simply can't continue to live. Being able to work isn't just a privilege and obviously so.



&gt;You arguing against vaccine mandates is inherently political, especially when based in something as arbitrary and asinine as bodily autonomy, when used in this context.

Arguing for them is also inherently political. Its literally a political measure you are arguing in favour of.... What point did you think you were making here? This topic is inherently political but on topic. Any topic of policy will be.

There are lots of articles saying we ""may"" need boosters down the line. ""The most recent Pfizer-BioNTech data shows 91% overall efficacy falling to 84% at the six-month mark, and a steady 97% against severe disease."" Yale

The CDC always waits for data and discussion before recommending action. We will need to wait for longitudinal studies before the CDC/FDA recommend boosters. I expect that they will recommend boosters in early 2022 when they have enough data on the immune response 12-24 months after initial vaccination.

Meanwhile, today, the public is seeing a huge covid wave and more breakthrough infections in vaccinated adults than expected. We can't rely on here immunity because not enough adults are vaccinated. There are no vaccines for young children. For some it is worth the ""low consequence""  unknown/unexpected risk of a booster shot rather than the ""high consequence"" risk of being a breakthrough infection and potentially harming a child/immunocompromised adult (self or otherwise). 

I got the covid shot while pregnant in January, when the CDC/FDA had no recommendations for pregnant women (thanks guys) because they had been excluded from the trials. The unknown risk was low (to me) vs the known risk of contracting covid (v bad outcome for me, unknown risk for baby). Now they are thinking getting vaxxed while pregnant gave my baby 2+ months of protection after birth.

There is some evidence that breastfed babies have covid immunity for 6 weeks to 80 days after the mom is vaccinated. Past that the antibodies wain/are insufficient. Given that we aren't expecting vaccines to be approved for babies until 2022/3, a booster shot might buy me another 3 months of keeping my baby safe. It might do nothing.

You can have the nuance of understanding the usefulness of vaccines while not thinking people should be forced by their employers to do anything to their bodies.

Employers don't own their employees. I don't want anything resembling that, and so that means where absolutely necessary people still have choice in what happens.


I also will point out to reiterate the ability to have nuance, that Im a double vaccinated person in a country where about 70% of people are, and the number is rising.

1. Masks help prevent the spread of Covid, and requiring them is a good thing.
2. Vaccines help prevent the spread of Covid, and also reduce the severity of the effects of Covid, which is a good thing.
3. Masks are not intended to be a precaution used in perpetuity; but during this time of fairly low vaccination and non-herd immunity, when we don't know who is and who isn't vaccinated, following CDC guidlines of wearing masks to reduce spread to those who could potentially die from it is a good thing.
4. It's a bad thing that politicians have turned masks and vaccines into a political wedge issue.
5. It's a good thing that despite political pressure opposing mask mandates in Florida, this university is still doing everything it can to protect the health of the community, and is imposing a mask mandate regardless of political pressure.

Jailbreaking your phone is essentially exploiting your own security. If you can do it, whose to say that another entity can not also take advantage of that? If you are jailbroken, then you have already done that work for them. Jailbreaks and malicious exploits tend to have a pretty solid overlap in what they exploit and how they work.

Beyond that, you are still at the mercy of all of the proprietary low-level code, software, drivers, blobs, etc built into the OS whose source code that you do not have access to. Same goes for all of the apps you have running on your phone, both official, and jailbroken. Many modern phones have what are basically black box security chips too, like Apple‚Äôs Secure Enclave or Pixel‚Äôs Titan chip. We don‚Äôt really have direct access to what those things are doing, but they‚Äôre still there, silently working in the background. 

The only way that you can truly be sure from the top down that a piece of technology is entirely ‚Äúsecure‚Äù is to supply all of the hardware and code yourself, which just isn‚Äôt realistic (and also carries its own problems, unless you have the ability to create 100% bulletproof, un-exploitable code, which isn‚Äôt really possible either). I mean, Google and Apple don‚Äôt even do that. Their OSes are foundational forks of existing work done on Linux and FreeBSD respectively, and they source their hardware components from all over as well. 

Some people prefer to go the route of flashing a custom Android ROM with most if not all of the Google bits and such removed. That‚Äôs one way to go, but then you‚Äôre putting your trust into the random person or people online who are maintaining the ROM, and you are still running Android and your phone‚Äôs low level drivers, proprietary binary blobs, etc so your phone still works as a phone.

The issue is that your extrapolation isn't even based on what I really said. If I had claimed that the risk of viruses should be eliminated at all costs, then your examples would make sense. 

I explicitly stated that my priority of public safety on this issue isn't limitless. You might as well say ""waterboarding is good"" is the logical extreme of ""drinking water is healthy,"" even after that other person clarifies. A real example of my logic is needing a license to drive, not banning vehicles. 

&gt;Its like you weren't sure what to reply so you went back to a previous comment to address a different point.

It's a point you made in the comment being discussed, i.e., the one you falsely claim that I only read the first line of. ""I also want to point out that your right to public safety, particularly for yourself and others who are vaccinated is a bullshit argument.""

You then go on to the chances of being ill, so I pointed out that it's high enough that there can be surge in hospitals, which may affect those who aren't there because of the virus.

It's based on an assumption you made in previous occurrences. You saw the deletion, and then made up an explanation for it.

&gt;What is already known about this topic?

&gt;The highly transmissible B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2 has become the predominant circulating U.S. strain.

&gt;What is added by this report?

&gt;During April‚ÄìJune 2021, COVID-19 cases caused by the Delta variant increased rapidly in Mesa County, Colorado. Compared with that in other Colorado counties, incidence, intensive care unit admissions, COVID-19 case fatality ratios, and the proportion of cases in fully vaccinated persons were significantly higher in Mesa County. Crude vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection was estimated to be 78% for Mesa County and 89% for other Colorado counties.

&gt;What are the implications for public health practice?

&gt;Vaccination is critical for preventing infection, serious illness, and death associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (including the Delta variant). Multicomponent prevention strategies, such as masking in indoor settings irrespective of vaccination status as well as optimal surveillance testing and infection prevention and control, should be considered in areas of high incidence.",,,,1628425300,{},h85uqbd,False,t3_p0ca8o,False,False,t1_h85qzte,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p0ca8o/vaccines_less_protective_in_colorado_county_with/h85uqbd/,1628507017.0,24,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;Throughout the pandemic rapid antigen tests have been tragically misunderstood. Rapid antigen tests *do not* generate too many false negative results (that is, negative results even though the person being tested is actually positive). They simply are not designed to identify cases in the pre- and post-contagious periods. **Rapid antigen tests reliably indicate whether or not a person is contagious. It may sound jarring, but if someone either just caught coronavirus or is on the tail end of their infection, they pose no threat to others. People who have tested positive for coronavirus can safely go about their normal life provided they are not contagious. That, more than anything, is what matters in controlling a pandemic.**

My uni has an indoor mask mandate in place, and I get it, because there are significant political obstacles to requiring vaccines among the student population when the vaccine only has EUA approval. I‚Äôd say the same thing about high schools or other school environments in which the students are 12+.

However, once the major vaccines achieve full FDA approval, I think we should drop the mask mandates and institute a vaccine mandate instead. Top epidemiologists, including Brown University‚Äôs Dr. Ashish Jha (https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/08/how-keep-kids-safe-delta-variant/619686/ ), agree that the best way to protect children in the pandemic is for the adults and older children around them to be vaccinated, and requiring vaccines at places like high schools and universities would help drive up that vaccination rate. It‚Äôs clear that the vaccines are safe and effective for people 12+, and as soon as it‚Äôs politically possible, we need to stop coddling the concerns of those who are irrationally opposed to the vaccine. Additionally, once a vaccine mandate is in place, we ought to drop the masks. Even though they‚Äôre also effective, they‚Äôre inconvenient, and with a high enough population vaccinated, the effect of dropping the mask mandate should be minimal.

For children under 12, if community spread is low enough, I see no reason why they should have to wear masks. We are clearly not in that situation. Even though children are low risk for the worst effects of the vaccine, they are still vectors for transmission, and would likely worsen spread in a community. When things get better, hopefully they won‚Äôt have to wear masks.

Those of us that have the vaccine available to us are morally bound to take it to protect humanity.

So let's ignore them for the moment.  The harder question is whether or not you allow the local high risk population a booster shot vs shipping those doses to countries with low vaccination rates.  My take is that this is very much a problem of distribution, logistics, and costs.  We can manufacture vaccine fairly rapidly and (relatively speaking) cheaply.  It's really hard to distribute the best (mRNA) vaccines to remote areas given the storage and shipping requirements.  Simply from a logistics point of view it's far easier and cheaper to give people in the US booster shots than it is to try to vaccinate large portions of remote countries.  That doesn't mean we shouldn't try, but I don't think it's wise to ""pause"" booster shots while delta rages here for a potential future vaccination of other countries that may or may not work out.

Ron DeSantis issued an executive order aimed at preventing districts from mandating face coverings for kids.

&gt;However, the mandates -- issued by districts including Hillsborough (Tampa), Orange (Orlando), and Palm Beach -- come with a catch: parents are allowed to opt their children out of them, without providing a reason.

&gt;The state's biggest school district, Miami-Dade, has not announced whether it will mandate face coverings for students. Its latest protocols, issued July 29, require them on school buses but not inside school buildings.

&gt;Florida reported 23,903 COVID-19 cases in a single day on Friday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, making it the state‚Äôs third straight day with over 20,000 new COVID cases.

&gt;As of Saturday, according to the Florida Hospital Association, there are 13,348 people hospitalized across the state -- the highest figure the state has had during the pandemic. Nearly 30% of inpatients have COVID and 43.3% of adult intensive care unit patients have COVID.

&gt;Below are the current mask policies for the 10 largest school districts in Florida, with links to the most recent guidance:

&gt;- Miami-Dade: optional
&gt;- Broward: required, with no opt-out option
&gt;- Hillsborough: required, with an opt-out option
&gt;- Orange: required for the first 30 days, with an opt-out option
&gt;- Palm Beach: required, with an opt-out option

Without speaking to the other merits/demerits of the study (I really don't know meta-analyses, so I can't comment on that), it's basically showing that obese individuals are 58% more likely to experience COVID-19 mortality. However, it has massive standard errors, which means it's not quite statistically significant -- though if you look at the confidence intervals, it's very, very close. It seems like it's more statistically underpowered than anything else.

**tl;dr: this study should not be read to say that obesity is not a factor in COVID-19 mortality.

[],,KinnerNevada,,,[],,,,text,t2_m76zflk,False,False,[],"With infections increasing once more, and hospitalization rising among older adults, health experts offer a timely warning: a coronavirus infection can look different in older patients.

One day in March of 2020, Rosemary Bily suddenly grew so tired she could barely get out of bed. ‚ÄúShe slept a lot,‚Äù said her son-in-law Rich Lamanno. ‚ÄúShe was wiped out for most of a month.‚Äù Ms. Bily, now 86, also developed nausea and diarrhea, along with a slight cough, and subsisted mostly on Tylenol and Gatorade.

A few days later her husband, Eugene Bily, 90, started coughing and became lethargic as well.

Had it not been for a family gathering a few days earlier, the Bilys‚Äôs children would not have suspected the new coronavirus. They might have blamed the flu, or simply advancing age. ‚ÄúWhat we heard on TV was ‚Äòhigh fever, can‚Äôt breathe‚Äô ‚Äî and they had neither,‚Äù Mr. Lamanno recalled.

But about a dozen guests had gathered at a restaurant in Rockville Centre, Long Island, earlier that month to celebrate a niece‚Äôs birthday, and one by one most of them fell ill with Covid, including Mr. Lamanno and his wife.

As the symptoms spread, doctors told the worried family that the Bilys most likely had Covid-19. Because tests were in short supply at the time, neither was tested; the family also feared taking them to overflowing local hospitals. But subsequent antibody tests confirmed that Eugene and Rosemary Bily, who live in Oceanside, N. Y., had contracted and survived the virus.

The population over 65, most vulnerable to the virus‚Äôs effects, got an early start on Covid vaccination and has the highest rate in the country ‚Äî more than 80 percent are fully vaccinated. But with infections increasing once more, and hospitalization rising among older adults, a large-scale new study in the Journals of Gerontology provides a timely warning: Covid can look different in older patients.

‚ÄúPeople expect fever, cough, shortness of breath,‚Äù said Allison Marziliano, lead author of the study. She is a social and health psychologist at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, part of the large Northwell Health system across New York State.

But when the researchers combed through the electronic health records of nearly 5,000 people, all over the age of 65, who were hospitalized for Covid at a dozen Northwell hospitals in March and April of 2020, they found that one-third had arrived with other symptoms, unexpected ones.

The team, searching through records using language software, found that about one-quarter of older patients reported a functional decline. ‚ÄúThis was falls, fatigue, weakness, difficulty walking or getting out of bed,‚Äù Dr. Marziliano said.

Eleven percent experienced altered mental status ‚Äî ‚Äúconfusion, agitation, forgetfulness, lethargy,‚Äù she said. About half the group with atypical symptoms also suffered from at least one of the classic Covid problems ‚Äî fever, trouble breathing, coughing.

‚ÄúClinicians should know, older adults should know, their caregivers should know: If you see certain atypical symptoms, it could be Covid,‚Äù Dr. Marziliano said.

The rate of atypical symptoms rose significantly with age, affecting about 31 percent of those aged 65 to 74, but more than 44 percent of those over 85. These symptoms occurred more commonly in women, in Black patients (but not in Hispanics) and in those who had other chronic diseases, particularly diabetes or dementia.

Because people in the atypical group were less likely to experience breathing problems and require ventilation, they were less likely to need intensive care. But both groups spent about 10 days in the hospital, and roughly one-third of each group died.

‚ÄúThese people were in the hospital for as long,‚Äù Dr. Marziliano said. ‚ÄúTheir mortality rate was as high. So this shouldn‚Äôt be dismissed.‚Äù

The research mirrors findings from other, smaller studies of older people conducted early in the pandemic in the United States and Europe. During a Covid outbreak in a nursing home in Providence, R.I., for instance, a Brown University study found that the most common symptom was loss of appetite, followed by lethargy, diarrhea and fatigue.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not necessarily surprised by this,‚Äù said Dr. Maria Carney, a geriatrician and an author of the Northwell study. ‚ÄúOlder adults don‚Äôt always present like other adults. They may not mount a fever. Their metabolisms are different.‚Äù

Younger diabetics, for instance, may become sweaty and experience palpitations if their blood sugar falls, Dr. Carney explained. An older person with low blood sugar could faint without warning. Older people who suffer from depression may have appetite loss or insomnia but not necessarily feel sad.

In May of 2020, Dr. Carney heard from a daughter worried about her mother, who was in her 80s and had suddenly grown weaker. ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt have fever or a cough, but she was just not herself,‚Äù Dr. Carney recalled. Doctors at a local emergency room had diagnosed a urinary tract infection and prescribed antibiotics, the daughter reported. But five days later, her mother‚Äôs condition was worsening. ‚ÄúShe needs a Covid test,‚Äù Dr. Carney advised.

Diagnosing Covid quickly in older patients can make a world of difference. ‚ÄúWe have things to offer now that we didn‚Äôt have in the first wave,‚Äù said Dr. Eleftherios Mylonakis, chief of infectious diseases at Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, who led the Providence nursing home study. ‚ÄúWe have better understanding, more treatments, better support.‚Äù

Among the improvements: using anticoagulant drugs to prevent clotting and using monoclonal antibodies (the treatment that former President Trump received at Walter Reed Hospital) that strengthen the immune system. But, Dr. Mylonakis added, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs paramount to start any kind of treatment early.‚Äù

Understanding that something as vague as weakness, confusion or appetite loss might signal a Covid infection can also help protect friends and family, who can then isolate and get tested themselves. ‚ÄúIt not only helps the individual, but also can contain the spread of the virus,‚Äù Dr. Mylonakis said.

A Covid diagnosis can also ward off needless tests and procedures. ‚ÄúWe can avoid unnecessary testing, poking and prodding, CT scans,‚Äù Dr. Carney said. CT scans are expensive, burdensome and take time to schedule and analyze; a nasal swab for Covid is quick, relatively cheap and now widely available.

With widespread vaccination, the symptoms of Covid-19 in older adults may become even more subtle. Fevers are easy to measure, and difficulty breathing will send anyone to an emergency room, Dr. Carney pointed out, whereas ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt necessarily notice if someone has stopped eating.‚Äù

Her counsel, for older patients and their caregivers and doctors, is to stay alert for changes that occur quickly, over a matter of days. ‚ÄúWhen there‚Äôs a change in behavior, physical or cognitive, it may not look like an infection, but keep Covid at the top of your list,‚Äù she said.

The woman with the worried daughter had indeed contracted the virus; she died in a hospital.

But the Bilys pulled through and still live in their Oceanside split-level home. Mr. Bily contended with many health problems even before the pandemic. In the past 18 months, he underwent two hip surgeries and several other hospitalizations. In June, he began receiving home hospice care.

Rosemary Bily, however, has fully recovered from the virus. At 86, she drives to the supermarket and the drugstore, visits her hair salon weekly, keeps in touch with family via iPad and smartphone and helps care for her granddaughters.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs doing well,‚Äù Mr. Lamanno said. ‚ÄúShe has resumed her normal life.‚Äù",,,,1628442875,{},h86ssza,True,t3_p0im6v,False,True,t3_p0im6v,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p0im6v/for_seniors_especially_covid_can_be_stealthy/h86ssza/,1628525711.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's not infantilizing to say that after communities have endured hundreds of years of abuse and experimentation that they would be apprehensive to get a vaccine - especially after constant misinformation campaigns designed to breed distrust. Many BIPOC are stating that IS why they're apprehensive.

You're not going to convince anyone to get a vaccine if you don't make a good faith effort to understand where they're coming from. 

And I never said it was hard to get the vaccine. I said it was a financial risk for them to take time off if they got symptoms and couldn't work for a few days. Plenty of jobs don't tolerate call outs even for being sick/vaccine symptoms and either way, missing a few days of work is hundreds of dollars many families cannot spare. If you don't think that's true, then you've clearly never experienced it and that means you're lucky. 

Also if I wanted to continue this conversation I would ask why were *you* the one booking appointments for your low income family and friends if it's so easy and there's nothing to stop, limit, or discourage them. 

I won't be arguing with you. If you really want to get more people vaccinated then you should educate yourself on medical abuse history, generational trauma, and how algorithms perpetuate a pipeline of disinformation. If you want to convince people to get vaccinated you need to have a good understanding of why they aren't. 

If you wanna get the last word in go for it. You're not going to change my mind here.

This week, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that workers in the city hospital system would be required to get the Covid vaccine or submit to weekly testing. If you were surprised by the development, it was almost certainly because you assumed that nurses and doctors and orderlies and administrators ‚Äî those with such an intimate connection to so much devastation ‚Äî had been vaccinated already for months.

In fact, the immunization rate for public hospital workers is lower than the citywide average, and if that weren‚Äôt concerning enough, the Police Department revealed on Wednesday that it had administered vaccines to just 43 percent of its staff. Its ‚Äúnewest internal messaging,‚Äù the department said in a statement, was centered on addressing ‚Äúrumors, misinformation and concerns with vaccination,‚Äù the area where the discourse might have begun a long time ago. Driven by the aggressive Delta variant and an entrenched skepticism or deeply held mistrust, some New York neighborhoods are witnessing Covid positivity rates climb above 5 percent ‚Äî last November, a citywide figure of 3 percent signaled a new wave of the pandemic and occasioned the closure of schools.

While the political class might be firing the ammunition of mandates, fines, or ‚Äî in the case of poor minority communities where a fear of the medical establishment is genuine ‚Äî sensitively focused education efforts, it is going to war with the soft weaponry of stunt and easy rhetoric. It feels like regression. Two years ago, amid a measles outbreak, New York became one of a handful of states in the country to eliminate religious exemptions for school vaccinations. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm shocked we got it passed,‚Äô‚Äô Brad Hoylman, a state senator representing the West side of Manhattan, told me recently, pointing out that the new law came into being without the support of public health officials. A few months later, New Jersey tried to push through similar legislation and failed.

To understand the current moment, it is important to realize the extent to which denialism has been such a powerful current in the history of American public health. In response to mandatory smallpox inoculation in Massachusetts in the late 19th century, a pamphlet titled ‚ÄúVaccination Is the Curse of Childhood‚Äù made its way around Boston, encouraging parents to find doctors who would help them game their way out of safeguarding their children against a highly contagious disease. Nearly 100 years later, those fighting the AIDS epidemic were left to deal with a dangerous movement, prompted by the writing of a molecular biologist named Peter H. Duesberg, who argued that the alleged libertine lifestyle, particularly recreational drug use, among gay men ultimately destabilized the immune system and caused AIDS, not H.I.V., which he considered a benign passenger virus.

I recently spoke about some of this with Peter Staley, who along with Larry Kramer was one of the two most influential activists of the AIDS era, the center of the acclaimed documentary ‚ÄúHow to Survive a Plague.‚Äù Mr. Staley had been a critic of the de Blasio administration‚Äôs slow start to the containment of the coronavirus, and I wanted to talk to him about the challenges of changing behaviors and combating insidious fallacies in a time of so much disruption to public health.

Refer someone to The Times.
They‚Äôll enjoy our special rate of $1 a week.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to sell things to people when you don‚Äôt have any data, but what we‚Äôre learning with Covid is that it‚Äôs also hard to sell things to people with all the data in the world,‚Äù he told me. The year 1985 was a pivotal one in the course of AIDS because epidemiological predictions were coming true ‚Äî the case rate was exploding ‚Äî and the Centers for Disease Control determined that condoms offered good protection against transmission. Before this point, all that existed in terms of a prevention campaign was essentially Larry Kramer screaming at gay men to abstain from sex.

Because of the long lag time with H.I.V. between infection and illness, many young people were removed from the horrors of the crisis in the earliest years. But by 1985 everyone knew someone who was sick or dying, Mr. Staley said. ‚ÄúNothing focuses the mind more than illness and death right in front of you, and if there is any analogy it is that this week we are seeing politicians‚Äù‚Äî Mitch McConnell and others on the vaccine-resistant right ‚Äî ‚Äútelling people to get vaccinated.‚Äù

The data has shown us that the very, very sick are almost entirely those who have forgone inoculation, a reality given explicit emotional illustration in a widely shared Facebook post, which also arrived this week, from a doctor, Brytney Cobia, in Birmingham, Ala., a state where only one-third of the population is fully immunized.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm admitting young healthy people to the hospital with very serious Covid infections,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúOne of the last things they do before they‚Äôre intubated is beg me for the vaccine. I hold their hand and tell them that I‚Äôm sorry, but it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù

Between 1985 and 1986, H.I.V. infection rates plummeted, but Mr. Duesberg‚Äôs debunked theories arrived in 1987, a threat to the progress. Activists and scientists joined forces to battle the deception. ‚ÄúSometimes you have to be ruthless,‚Äù Mr. Staley says today. ‚ÄúFighting denialism is the work of day-to-day combat.‚Äù It persisted for decades. As late as the 2000s, Mr. Staley found himself working to shut down a documentary that promoted the idea that H.I.V. was harmless. It featured an interview with Christine Maggiore, a prominent AIDS denialist and the subject of an earlier, similar film, who ultimately died of complications related to AIDS in 2008. Her daughter, also H.I.V. positive, died a few years earlier.

What killed the lies and misperceptions over time ‚Äúwas experience ‚Äî the antivirals worked so thoroughly; PrEP worked so thoroughly,‚Äù Mr. Staley said, referring to a prophylactic drug against H.I.V.

‚ÄúEveryone knows someone who is healthy with H.I.V.,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe denialists have all died.‚Äù",,,,1628438982,{},h86kdcu,False,t3_p0h4lm,False,False,t3_p0h4lm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p0h4lm/how_to_survive_a_plague_part_2_the_resistance_to/h86kdcu/,1628520881.0,47,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In my point of view, we see too much viruses are living things. While a virus behaves *like* a living creature, technically it's just an object. Sars-CoV2 particles are just boxes. Boxes with an RNA receipt that makes your organism go nuts when they just encounter it in airways. Many ways to counter a virus, now we have a vaccine.

Accepting that people go infecting, it is literally accepting that they drop off possibly lethal objects onto other people, and those objects make their organism go nuts (infected), process repeats.

The virus has no feets to walk on its own, it has ours. It has no wings, nor it can in any way replicate without a host. Excluding infections from animals, infections across humans are 100% preventable depending on the efforts spent in it. Human behavior indifferent to an epidemic is no less epidemic than the virus is.

Approval: The FDA wanted 4-6 months of additional data for the 5-11 vaccine. They may decide they want even more followup data for the under-5 vaccines, or want to wait for more trials to be completed. 

Manufacturing: Teenagers could get vaccinated quickly after approval because they could use the same vaccine as adults; same serum, same dose. Kids 5-11 will hopefully be able to use the same serum, though the dose may be different. 

For the under-5s, especially the under-2s, it's less likely they'll be able to use the same serum as adults. That creates a big ethical conundrum: Given that most of the world is still desperately short of adult vaccine, how much mRNA manufacturing capacity do you shift from the adult vaccine to the young child vaccines? You also run into contractual issues if you want to start producing child vaccines before all the current orders for adult vaccines are fulfilled.

Vaccination isn‚Äôt special, in this regard. Freedom over your body is limited by harm to others. If coronavirus was a purely personal issue, then there would be no conflict. However, coronavirus is a public health issue because a choice to not get vaccinated (freedom) Hasan negative impact on those who *cannot* get vaccinated (public harm). Historical precedent actually makes this a case where public health can override personal freedom.

My point is that he was wrong about UK hospitalization specifically. UK had extremely high immunization among their most vulnerable groups. Their unvaccinated population was largely constrained to under-30s. As such, the hospitalization was much much smaller than might be expected based off the daily case rate. Feigl-Ding was right to be concerned about the case numbers but was actively lambasting people who had confidence that the UK's high immunization rate in vulnerable populations would result in very few hospitalizations. Indeed, this is exactly what happened.

Quite specifically, I'm giving you an example of Feigl-Ding being wrong about the Delta outbreak in the UK. He was wrong about this. Hospitalizations never reached critical numbers as he predicted.

In the US, immunization is much worse. Delta is ripping through communities which are not immunized. Many vulnerable populations remain completely unprotected because political propaganda in that country is a fucking nightmare. I think that Feigl-Ding is right to be very concerned about what will happen regarding hospitalizations here.

He often is correct about what he says. But frequently he hounds people for disagreeing with him even though they may have good foundational reason to disagree with him (as with the UK immunization rates effectively mitigating the huge Delta numbers).",,,,1628387558,{},h84fo7n,False,t3_ozrbby,False,False,t1_h843pb8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ozrbby/so_much_for_hot_vax_summer_delta_puts_a_damper_on/h84fo7n/,1628481894.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is an entire separate section of US codes for EUAs. A good example of fact twisting is the news stating in the headlines ""EEOC says employers can require vaccination"". Well, the EEOC didn't have a law stating that employers can't require it with an EUA drug,  but they also didn't have a law stating they could require it either. The fact is, it was not up to the EEOC to decide because its addressed by the government elsewhere.  Anyway the code is 21 USCS 360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(III)   I guess the thing is everyone is running around stating facts about vaccine requirements, and they forget we are talking about an EUA drug, which people refer to as a vaccine.  A month ago they could have said this pandemic is over, it exists but it is not a pandemic. At that point, pfizer would have lost its EUA and it would have been illegal to administer a shot from that point forward.  But instead they are paying people to get this shot. If there was a true pandemic I wouldn't need the news to tell me it existed.

The weight of politics and misinformation  
Politics has weighed down the immunization process, like many other apolitical a priori aspects of American life. Race, religious ideas or level of education show clear differences in the level of inoculations. A survey carried out in July by YouGov in collaboration with The Economist shows, for example, how the probability that a person is vaccinated in rural areas is almost 10 percentage points lower than the average, which can be explained by the lower risk they perceive and due to less accessibility to distribution centers. Still, according to their statistical model, the biggest predictor of whether the average American got vaccinated is whether they were voters of Donald Trump or Joe Biden.. It is up to 13 points less likely that the former have been vaccinated and up to 18 points less likely that the latter have.  
Epidemiologist Susanne Straif-Bourgeois of the University of Louisiana School of Medicine especially blames misinformation on social media. ""They read things like that it can harm the fertility of women, or their pregnancies, when it is not true,"" he laments. Pastor Spell is one of those explosive anti-vaccine spokesmen, religious extremists, but he does not represent the bulk of the population that has not yet gone for his injection. Most of them are people with doubts. Some have changed their minds this week seeing their state in the news across the country as the new major focus of contagion. Brandon, the practitioner from one of the capital's pharmacies, corroborates this: ""I have noticed that many more people are coming these days, we are vaccinating about 20 people a day."" Jackie, 71, he was waiting his turn on Friday morning. His son had died of covid last year.",,,,1628451963,{},h87cei9,True,t3_p0lg54,False,False,t1_h87ce3m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p0lg54/the_america_that_is_not_vaccinated_and_is_more/h87cei9/,1628537036.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Louisiana, with the current record of covid cases in the United States, is experiencing the toughest moment of the pandemic while half of the population remains without immunization due to fear, neglect or rejection of the Government  


Scott Dowell, a 60-year-old Baton Rouge protective equipment factory employee, in his vehicle.   
The number of hospital admissions reaches a level never seen, the intensive care unit of the main health center in Baton Rouge, capital of Louisiana, you run out of beds. The number of deaths triples in 14 days; that of contagions, doubles. It might seem like news from a year ago, or more, news from March or April 2020, but it is the war part of this southern US state, which is now experiencing the worst moments of the pandemic while spoiling thousands of vaccines that its citizens do not get. It is the territory with the highest number of infections per inhabitant in the entire United States and the third by the tail in vaccination. In Louisiana, only 47% of adults have the complete regimen, only 55% have injected the first dose and, after a thousand requests from the authorities, millionaire draws and 616,000 deaths throughout the country , there are those who, like Scott Dowell, he's not planning on doing it.  
‚ÄúThe vaccine is not yet approved \[the US drug agency has authorized its emergency use\], they have rushed to get it out. The wife of a partner works in the ER and says it has caused strokes, side effects ... Because it has not been proven enough, ""says Dowell. A 60-year-old employee of a Baton Rouge protective equipment factory, he fears the cure more than the disease, convinced that the current variants of the virus are less dangerous and that he is a fairly healthy person. ""I don't really believe what the news is saying either,"" he adds.  
The covid has become a crisis of republican states  
Distrust, hoaxes that run through social networks and coffee conversations, complacency about the general improvement in the situation, allergy to government intervention, laziness. A cocktail of disparate motives has weighed down vaccination in the United States , where the advance of the delta variant has set off alarms. In the United States, 71% of those over 18 years of age have taken at least one dose, but the differences are large between territories: while in Vermont, 87% have done so, in Mississippi, Wyoming and Louisiana, they have done it. 51%, 52% and 55%, respectively.

Tony Spell, pastor of the Tabernacle Evangelical Church in Baton Rouge. / RAEGAN LABAT  
Louisiana, a conservative and religious fiefdom, has true anti-vaccine apostles. Tony Spell, pastor of the Evangelical Church of the Tabernacle in Baton Rouge, has framed the multiple arrest and bail warrants that he has accumulated during this year and a half in which he has refused to comply with each and every one of the rules. from the authorities. He has never stopped holding indoor meetings and has never worn a mask in his church. Of course, neither he nor his customers have been vaccinated. ‚ÄúI do not trust a government that tries to promote a vaccine made in a year when they need decades, and on top of that this does not work for the new variants. God has given us an immune system to resist the virus and social distancing has weakened it, it has not allowed us to achieve herd immunity.  
The queues to receive the injections that were seen at the beginning of the pandemic in stadiums of big cities seem like another world in this piece of America, where hardly anyone is seen by the vaccination centers. With a population of 4.6 million inhabitants, it registers an average of 4,600 cases per day, 99 per 100,000 inhabitants, the highest ratio in the United States.  
The political dispute between progressives and conservatives - the former more inclined to restrictions and the latter suspicious of public intervention - is also manifested in the inoculation process. The governor of the state, Democrat John B. Edwards, has already vetoed three bills of the state House, with a Republican majority, that sought to prohibit different measures to require or stimulate vaccines. The Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady hospital network, the largest in the state, has had to issue an order for all its staff to be vaccinated in the coming months, because laziness or doubts reach the sector itself.  
Joshua Denson, director of the critical care unit at the Tulane Center in New Orleans, speaks in a disheartened tone: ‚ÄúToday I have admitted three more people to the intensive unit and none of them would have to be here, they were not vaccinated. , when they could be. Half of them are quite likely to die, just because they don't have enough confidence in science, it's frustrating. "" Specializing in pulmonary medicine, Denson experienced the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020 with the same stupor as the rest of the profession. ‚ÄúMany of us were afraid of treating covid patients. The community has asked a lot of health workers in this crisis and demoralizes this mistrust now ‚Äù, he adds.  
Meanwhile, outside his building, the streets of the tourist center of New Orleans , the French Quarter, are abuzz with people where the delta variant and those that preceded it roam freely. The tourists, the bachelor parties, the crowded concerts, the hugs between friends are back. Customers are burning to return to that burst of life and hoteliers to keep their businesses alive, in an unbeatable alignment of interests. Some bars, such as the Effervescence club or The AllWays Lounge, in the Marigny, have begun to ask for vaccination tests and masks from whoever wants to enter. The same will not happen in schools, despite the increase in hospitalized children, since the law in Louisiana protects parents who do not want to immunize them for religious or philosophical reasons.  
The incentive route seems exhausted. Governor Edwards announced in June the raffle of scholarships and cash prizes, including one for one million dollars (850,000 euros), for those who were vaccinated before July 31, but that did not move the foundations of the problem. It is a general trend throughout the country, where stimuli of this type have proliferated. Alison M. Buttenheim, a specialist in behavioral economics who develops trials and campaigns for the prevention of infectious diseases, explains that the trend has been studied in the States where they have carried out these initiatives and ‚Äúthere have been no spikes in the numbers of inoculations ‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhat works especially is that people you trust get vaccinated and encourage you to do so,‚Äù he adds.  
For some, such as Jacc Mikel, the awards can even be counterproductive. He is 53 years old, he is African American and he did not get vaccinated until last Thursday because he feared the possible side effects and suspected all that interest from the authorities. ""If you look back, before I was born, the system used black people as guinea pigs to test all things, and there was a lot of ignorance, it was misleading, and many people died, including children,"" he explains from the garden from one of the houses he cares for in New Orleans.  
The black population, poorer and legally segregated until just over half a century ago, was for decades cannon fodder for medicine in the United States. The Tuskegee Syphilis Study is the most aberrant example. It was developed for 40 years in the Alabama population of the same name and consisted, basically, of taking 400 black men with that infection and denying them all possible treatment to be able to analyze the progress of the disease and then, if they died, study their bodies . It began in 1932 and continued until 1972. During all that time in which they made human guinea pigs without knowing it, they were not told about the evil they suffered. The experiment ended right after it came to light in the press and the scandal broke.  
African Americans' mistrust of white doctors lasted for a long time. Jacc Mikel emphasizes that things have changed, but misgivings remain. He recorded a video while getting vaccinated this Thursday and began sending it to all the young people in his neighborhood because he believes it can help. 59% of the population of New Orleans is black.  
‚ÄúThey call me Uncle Jacc here, they respect me, you know? And if I, who am so stubborn, in the end I have put it on, I think it can have an impact ‚Äù, says the man, who is dedicated to taking care of houses, walking dogs and all kinds of fixes and botches that put him in contact with the community. He says that if, after all, he overcame the misgivings, it was because of Leo, a 10-year-old boy from the area who told him: ‚ÄúI don't want anything to happen to you, if I could \[the vaccine is not yet approved for children under 12 years of age \], I would get vaccinated ‚Äù.  
The decisive prescriber may be, for some, a 10-year-old child, after months of turning a deaf ear to the authorities. The trigger may be the death of a close friend. Or the impossible figures that Louisiana lives these days. Republican politicians, too, have begun to reinforce their pro-vaccine message after months of little enthusiasm for the issue.",,,,1628451958,{},h87ce3m,True,t3_p0lg54,False,True,t3_p0lg54,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p0lg54/the_america_that_is_not_vaccinated_and_is_more/h87ce3m/,1628537029.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The issue was not that it was healthy (that ship sailed) they had to fight a court case to call it bread. Irish govt said it had too much sugar and it should be taxed as cake, Subway lost.

I remember about a decade ago watching a documentary about how Subway was rolling out a healthy eating programme across US schools.  I was absolutely appalled until I saw what they were already serving and thought at least it was an improvement.

It is possible even now to get high quality ""9502 ffp2 NR"" and ""kn95"" masks. If you are serious about protecting yourself then do it! Men: shaving when wearing a high quality mask is important, otherwise don't bother, I miss my facial hair too but my masks didn't seal for shit until I busted out the razor so just do it. 

Everyone: use the flexible nose-bridge to create a good seal, this will also help keep glasses from fogging. If you have one of the ""ear saver"" clips for ear-loop masks, any ear loop mask can become adjustable AND comfortable. 

Personally I use a Powecom 9502 FFP2 NR (headband style 94% efficient) with a good old disposable ""surgical"" mask over that, i use an adjustable ear saver to keep the surgical one a bit looser over the FFP2 so it doesn't get pressed on/squished. Having both adjustable nose bridges from these masks means my glasses get zero fog.

If you are fully vaccinated and wearing a high quality mask CORRECTLY, there is nothing theatrical about it.

A) So were there breakthrough deaths? If not, I can't really care. Get a sample size big enough for the expected value to be significantly above zero, or do enough good smaller studies that a meta-analysis on deaths can be done. Otherwise, my takeaway is that vaccinated people arw safe and that any deaths are the unvaccinated encountering the consequences of a bad choice.

B) Did Mesa have a whole bunch of J&amp;J instead of the much better MRNAs? The difference in efficacy could be easily explained by that. Also, since Mesa had low vaccination rates, I might infer that it is relatively low SES and thus relstively obese, which would also explain the difference in efficacy.

Look, my reasoning is highly motivated - I consider the pandemic fully solved by vaccine availability such that the vaccinated can do whatever they want with no moral obligation (I mean, if they got MRNA, right, bro?).

A single dose of vaccine puts them at the same level as the fully vaccinated.

&gt;We analysed samples taken from individuals a median of 188 days after the onset of symptoms (referred to as month-6 samples), and calculated the median half-maximal effective dilution (ED50) for each combination of serum and virus (Extended Data Fig. 7a). With the Alpha variant, we obtained similar ED50 values in this series of experiments to those in our previous analysis11 (Extended Data Fig. 7b). We thus included our published data for D614G and Beta in the comparison. With the Delta variant, neutralization titres were significantly decreased by four- to sixfold when compared to the Alpha and D614G strains, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 7a). This reduction in neutralizing titres was similar against the Delta and Beta variants (Extended Data Fig. 7a).


&gt;We also showed that the Delta variant is less sensitive to sera from naturally immunized individuals. Vaccination of convalescent individuals boosted the humoral immune response to well above the threshold of neutralization. These results strongly suggest that vaccination of previously infected individuals is likely to be protective against a large array of circulating viral strains, including the Delta variant.

Then there's swimming in general. It's exercise and kids are taught to hold their breath. And love to see who can go underwater longest or swim deepest. By their logic lack of oxygen and poising themselves with carbon dioxide isnt good and should be avoided at all costs.

It‚Äôs not rocket science. It almost has no impact on economy. It‚Äôs not everywhere all the time.

- This is not an all or nothing thing.
- we can have strategic mask mandates
- There is a very active outbreak right now with overcrowded hospitals
- once that subsides we can reevaluate.

Covid will burn out in the end. It might accelerate for a few months but in the end enough people will have gotten infected and vaccinated often enough to let this burn out.

It's one reason why they can't sail into a storm, because the roll would make them turtle. But normal ground swell isn't an issue because it's designed around that.

Same with house boats. Ever see a house boat in Amsterdam? They literally build it right to the edges of the barge. Again, righting moment keeps it upright (used the wrong term before but I was in middle of doing something while trying to reply to you). As it rolls, it displaces more water on that side while less water on the other side. What happens is the water itself pushes against the side that lowest more and tends to right the ship or house boat.

&gt;Ignoring the ballast, wide and shallow or narrow and deep means that the ship is very quick to roll and very hard to overturn and is stiff. A log shaped round bottomed means that it is slow to roll and easy to overturn and tender.

House boats are wide and shallow, by their nature they are hard to overturn. You don't have to be a fan, but trust me, they are very hard to tip. In fact a canoe is easier to tip. I've lived by the ocean my whole life, my state is actually nicknamed the Ocean State and if you think house boats look top heavy, you should see America's Cup yachts, which have giant sails that the wind is literally pushing over.

We can handle factual data.

&gt;**About 19% of recent documented COVID-19 cases in California are breakthroughs,** and state data shows that those who have been fully vaccinated account for an increasing portion of positive tests.
&gt;
&gt;The number, which contradicts a repeated public portrayal that breakthrough cases are negligible, can be easily misinterpreted. To be clear, this is not an indication of some sort of vaccine failure. Quite the contrary.
&gt;
&gt;Breakthrough cases were expected. State data still suggests that unvaccinated people are nearly five times as likely to be infected as those who are inoculated. And almost all the hospitalizations and deaths are among unvaccinated people. Vaccines remain the most important tool for fighting the pandemic.
&gt;
Rather, the rising proportion of breakthrough cases suggests that **even people who have been vaccinated are potentially significant spreaders of coronavirus, especially the delta variant. It reinforces why vaccinated people should also wear masks in public settings.**  ...
&gt;
&gt;Although vaccinated people are well-protected against serious illness, they can, if infected and even if they‚Äôre not showing symptoms, spread the virus to others. Indeed, **people with breakthrough infections of the delta variant might be just as contagious as unvaccinated people, although the science continues evolving on that point.**
&gt;
&gt;The call for vaccinated people to don masks is not just for their own protection. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about you, it‚Äôs about everybody,‚Äù says Contra Costa County Health Officer Chris Farnitano. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about keeping the cases down.‚Äù",,,,1628455581,{},h87k83y,False,t3_p0kqhv,False,True,t3_p0kqhv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p0kqhv/19_of_california_covid_cases_are_breakthroughs/h87k83y/,1628541447.0,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,Cory123125,,,[],,,,text,t2_cvjj3,False,False,[],"&gt; It is debatable when your bodily autonomy can directly negatively impact those around you, to the point of legitimately killing them.

There are many ways that this already happens. Driving cars, Owning guns, all of these have the potential to harm other people.

When you start harming people, you get limited. Until you do, you do as you please more or less. In this case, if you have a business, or a place of residence, etc etc, you can prevent people who havent taken reasonable precaution from being around you.

That means ensuring people are properly masking are tested, or are vaccinated.

There is no place for a government to tell people what they must do with their bodies. None.


&gt;Vaccine mandates have been used in the US before to great affect, there's no reason they shouldn't be now 

Just because something was done before doesn't mean it should be again. I also listed a very cogent reason for not doing so that is not at all related to the politicized nonsense you are talking about.

&gt; and being anti-vaxx is apparently the hip and trendy thing to be doing.

People being weary is not new actually. I think you have some recency bias that makes you feel that way, but as far as I can tell, the reactions now are fairly common ways to react to pandemics or at least there is historical precedence for it.

Also, The vast majority of people aren't. Heck, In my country literally the overwhelming majority of people are. Its over 80% for 12+ and almost 70% for double.

In your country even, you are at 60% one dose and double isnt that far under. If you look at the chart, its actually still increasing, so this idea that its super trendy and most people are stupid is largely overblown.

Could it be better?

The vaccine makes it far less likely for you to get sick. Vaccines are never perfect. But if everyone is vaccinated than the likelihood of it spreading is far far less. 

Also the ENTIRE problem with this virus is it‚Äôs infection rate. Every person who gets sick infects 3 more. So it‚Äôs growth is exponential and it quickly overwhelms the hospital system ans when that happens the death rate spikes. For everyone because resources will be taken away to deal with Covid. 

The vaccine helps this in 2 ways. 

- fewer people get sick so the infection rate is brought down to a level below exponential growth. Eg like the flu. 

- those who do get sick don‚Äôt fill up hospitals because the cases are less severe. 

Long story short. Even if the vaccine is not perfect it ends up achieving all the goals we need. Reducing Covid to concern level of the flu.

The article states the exact multiple is 2.34 so efficacy would in fact be (100-2.34n)% which means infection is actually slightly more likely than double. 

So for example the recent J&amp;J results showing that it's 71% effective against Delta infection, that would mean infection alone is at least 32% effective. In practice this is an underestimate, potentially a huge one, because J&amp;J is both a less effective vaccine compared to Moderna and Pfizer and the combination of vaccine and infection will lead to higher efficacies than vaccine alone.

This is like George Bush invading Afghanistan by saying it's just a minor war that would be over really quick.  It leads to a loss of credibility and trust, a perception that the people in charge don't know what they're doing or are deliberately lying, and provides more fuel (perhaps rightly) to conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers.

IMO the CDC should be frank, saying ""we are going to be fighting this virus for some time, probably years. No one is promising a quick victory here.

&amp;#x200B;

Still isolated from the world and poor country, it has proved that when the government subordinates the state apparatus to vaccination, plans the process wisely and communicates responsibly with the inhabitants even in mountainous terrain, all inhabitants can be vaccinated.

&amp;#x200B;

  
In late March / early April, Bhutan, a small Himalayan kingdom sandwiched between India and China, jumped to the top of the world immunization rankings. Within a week, the country vaccinated over 90 percent. adult residents, i.e. over 60 percent. the entire population. In late July, he only needed a few days to distribute the second dose of the vaccine .

  
Let's learn from Bhutan  
Will Parks, a UNICEF representative in Bhutan, said the local vaccination campaign was arguably the fastest-ever campaign of its kind in the world. This still isolated and poor country has proved that when the government subordinates the state apparatus to vaccination, plans the process wisely and communicates responsibly with people, even in mountainous terrain with very underdeveloped infrastructure, an injection can be given to all residents. While the scale is quite different, many countries could follow an example.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
    
""If we can learn something now, it's that a country like Bhutan, with very few doctors and nurses, but a determined king and government leadership in mobilizing society, can vaccinate the entire population,"" said AFP Parks.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
A country from another world  
Bhutan's unique strategy fits with a country that, in many ways, seeks to exist outside the rest of the world. Until the 1970s, the latter monarchy in South Asia (which had never been colonized) was practically closed to foreigners. Although now it is possible to enter it without major problems, the government tries to limit the number of guests very much to prevent the degradation of the unspoiled nature and protect its unique culture. Every tourist, in addition to buying a visa, must contract a local guide for a minimum fee of $ 250. per day (200 out of season). Bhutan finances environmental protection, but also free health care with the income from tourism.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
The country also remains geographically isolated. The only international airport in Paro can only land planes from two local carriers: Druk Air and Bhutan Airlines due to one of the most difficult landing approaches in the world between the Himalayan peaks. The airlines fly mainly to India and other countries in the region, and a small offer automatically limits contact with the world.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
Bhutan is also unique in terms of its system. Since 2008, the constitution has enshrined as a development goal maximizing the Gross Happiness Index, not GDP. It takes into account such variables as the state of the environment or the level of health, although contrary to popular opinion, Bhutan still measures GDP and according to the World Bank it is comparable to Kosovo, Indonesia and Tunisia in this respect.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
All strength for vaccination  
In addition, Bhutan is simply very small - it has approx. 750 thousand. residents, including approx. 530 thousand. adults who can get coronavirus vaccines. But size is not everything, success would not be possible without the wise policy of the authorities.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
Already in spring, before the first vaccination round, the authorities decided that instead of a lengthy trial, they preferred to wait and launch the campaign in a few days. Neighboring India, with which Bhutan has very close ties, gifted the kingdom 550,000. doses of locally produced AstraZeneki. However, Bhutan waited for the entire shipment to reach the country. At that time, the authorities organized vaccination logistics for all residents, including helicopter supply chain to mountain villages where overland transportation would be too time-consuming. Nearly 22 thousand people volunteered to help, incl. informing about the operation of preparations and fighting erroneous news. To help deliver the preparation to Bhutan, UNICEF and the country's authorities sent one of the 20 pilots authorized to land in Paro, to Calcutta,  


&amp;#x200B;

  
After the success of the lightning fast campaign, however, problems began. India, struggling with soaring coronavirus cases , has halted exports of vaccines. It is not the first time that Bhutan has learned that gross national happiness cannot replace hard cash, and that it simply cannot afford to obtain the preparation quickly on the open market. It is true that the authorities bought 200 thousand. doses from Pfizer, but deliveries are expected in the fall. An interval between doses would threaten herd immunity. Ultimately Bhutan managed to obtain 500,000. Moderna doses as part of a donation from the Covax allianceand another 250 thousand. AstraZeneki as a gift from Denmark. Other countries provided a total of another 700,000. doses of different vaccines, so Bhutan may now have not only enough preparations for an equally rapid second round, but even a good supply, including for the planned autumn vaccinations of teenagers .  


&amp;#x200B;

  
The king will be last

  
Logistics and thoughtful strategy helped Bhutan, and authorities went further to persuade residents to accept the vaccine. During the spring first round, King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, who is held in high esteem, said he would take the injection last. While in other countries responsible politicians tried to be the first to convince the inhabitants of the safety of the preparations, in Bhutan the monarch's declaration meant that no one wanted to delay vaccination and thus potentially put the king in danger. The king also traveled around the country during both immunization rounds, accompanying citizens to registration and injection as an added incentive.

&amp;#x200B;

  
However, the real authors of the success are Prime Minister Lotay Tshering, Foreign Minister Tandi Dorji and Health Minister Dechen Wangmo. All three understood the challenges posed by the pandemic perfectly well - Tshering is a surgeon and Dorji and Wangmo are public health specialists. Especially Wangmo, with a degree from Yale University, coped with the challenge perfectly. The rulers probably realized that Bhutan's health care - although free and put on a pedestal as an important component of the level of national happiness - would not be able to cope with the uncontrolled pandemic. The country has less than three doctors in 10,000. inhabitants, less than Sudan or Afghanistan. In addition, the infrastructure is primarily in cities, and mountain villages are difficult to access.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
Vaccinations are a success of democracy

&amp;#x200B;

  
For Bhutans, vaccination success - the country ranks third in the world for fully vaccinated populations, behind the UAE and  Israel - could also be a democratic success. The current government is only the second one since the abolition of absolute monarchy in 2008, and the competence of the leaders will certainly strengthen their popularity. For the world, despite the specificity of Bhutan, it may prove that vaccination can be carried out anywhere. For rich countries, delivering several hundred thousand doses is not a big challenge, and the countries of the Global South with the help of the UN organization can effectively and quickly vaccinate their inhabitants. For this to happen, however, governments must recognize the importance of prioritizing vaccines and strong political support.",,,,1628378273,{},h83yiy0,True,t3_p03lts,False,False,t3_p03lts,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p03lts/bhutan_almost_everyone_was_vaccinated_here/h83yiy0/,1628472855.0,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

IIRC, it's closer to 99.9%.  Irish contact tracing say around 1/1000 cases of outdoor transmission.  I think Singapore suggested it was more common, but they had a weird categorization with ""construction"" being considered outdoors, even though a significant part of ""construction"" involved people being indoors doing plumbing, electrical, etc.

The huge difference between indoor and outdoor transmission is also one of the things that suggests aerosol transmission.  If it's droplets, indoor/outdoor doesn't matter as much because droplets aren't carried as much by air currents, whereas aerosols are easily dispersed by air currents.

For a ship or anything floating to roll over, you have to have the center of gravity go over the strakes. And that's going to apply to any house boat or ship you build, regardless of the material. These things are probably more stable than any ship of the same size and displacement because there's likely no free surface effect (water inside the hull). If they fill them with foam, it would be impossible for water to get inside. I mean container ships have a maximum roll of 22-30 degrees, that's pretty far if you think about how far they stack those containers above the water line. Free surface is usually how ships sink because they destabilize the roll moment. When something tips in water, that side has greater buoyancy because it's displacing more water. With free surface effect, weight shifts to that side negating the greater buoyancy. In fact it can make a ship roll greater than it would otherwise in any given sea.

I mean have you seen cruise ships today? There's not a heck of a lot below the waterline: https://www.marineinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/symphony-of-the-seas-in-dry-dock-1.png The boat doesn't have to support the weight because water does that.

You have agreed 'masks work' (though you claimed they didn't at one point) but then claim 'there is no supporting evidence for masks working via mandate'. Both of these things cannot be true because masks work, with or without a mandate. If that is so, then the mandate should not be thrown out; Modified, perhaps, but not removed as you propose.

Instead, you are hyper-focused on a perceived failing through the mechanism of deployment, rather than the purpose and effectiveness of the thing being deployed; Resulting in a faulty stance rooted in poor logic.

What you are 'baiting' people for is a singular, credible instance, article, etc of 'proof' that 'Masks Mandates work and here are the compiled statistics'.

&gt;The tracking numbers show that the rate of pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations is about the same as it has been for earlier variants, varying between 0.1% and 1.9% depending on the state.

&gt;""While we are seeing an increase in overall cases, our hospitalization rate for COVID has remained the same,"" Green said.

&gt;Despite the dramatic increase in cases, Laham and other pediatric infectious disease experts nationwide tell NBC News that there is no hard evidence yet that the delta variant has transformed the virus into something more dangerous in kids.

&gt;""It's too early to tell,"" said Dr. Bernhard Wiedermann, an infectious diseases specialist at Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C. ""It's going to take time and a collection of data from multiple sites to know"" whether the delta variant is, in fact, more virulent in kids than previous versions of the virus.

And again, I'm vaccinated dude. I still don't think covid is more important than individual freedom and bodily autonomy. No one should have to put something into their body to live a decent life. Even if it's a good and safe vaccine.

I know A LOT of antivax people. I think they're misguided, and I try and convince them that vaccines are safe. But it's horrifying to think that they might be forced to put something in themselves that they truly think is dangerous. 

Or more likely, they would refuse and then can't live a decent life? Why? These people are not getting convinced any time soon. They're hurting themselves and maybe other unvaccinated people. That's it. That's their choice. It is NOT WORTH IT to have 20-40% of a society incredibly detached from life. That will lead to higher depression, anger and violence. Do I wish they would get vaccinated? Sure. Will they? Mostly not. If we're looking at the long term, I really don't see vaccine mandates being worth it under any measure.

The only thing that made me actually hesitate to get the vaccine was when the idea of mandating it was being floated. I am incredibly skeptical of our government, and there is nothing in the world more suspicious to me than that. If they said I HAD to get the jab, I most likely would've refused. So there's that.

[],,Chowdmouse,,,[],,,,text,t2_yc2wl,False,False,,"berrypunch2020, here is my 2cents worth, from a scientist (not in any area of epidemiology, virology or medicine, but can read the research papers, when i have time :/   )

The physical barrier in and of itself of a mask is incredibly good at filtration. BUT when you add in the human factor, it goes downhill. The three things (in my opinion) that reduce the effectiveness of the mask are  1) consistently of wearing it, 2) quality, and 3) its fit on the face.

In terms of consistency of wearing it, of course it is difficult. We all want to take it off. But i also am a bit out-of-the-norm in that i tell people they should be masking at home too, if people are exposed to different vectors. Myself and hubby work at two different places, thus are exposed to different vectors. So being at home around each other is no different than the dangers of being exposed to coworkers or classmates. So in order to not get each other sick, we masked at home till we got the vaccine. We stopped for a while, but we are starting back up now that Desantis has guaranteed it will be rampant with school starting back. At work i am upping the mask game as well by telling my employees that the little cloth masks won‚Äôt suffice &amp; have ordered them better masks. 

Quality- no cloth masks. Their effect much less that even the standard medical procedure-type mask you can pick up at the grocery store. If you choose those surgical type i at least try for an ASTM level III. But the N95 and KN95 are the ones mentioned by the CDC i believe. The surgical type masks are more comfortable and readily available, but the N95 and KN95 are better.

In terms of the fit on the face, you really really need a mask with no gaps the edge of the mask should form a ‚Äúseal‚Äù to your face, so your airflow is forced to go through the mask, not out the side or around your nose. N95‚Äôs &amp; K95‚Äôs seem to be pretty good at this. I have also personally been happy with two brands of reusable masks, from LALinen and Vogmask. They have a higher level of filtration along with a snug fit around the edges, but loose enough on the front of your face to not feel smothered.

I do believe masking helps at least a little, and possibly a great deal. There is some limited data available for covid, but there is more data available for other viral diseases. general rule of thumb is that a lower inoculant load will lead to less severe illness. This is the very basis of historical vaccination, where a very small amount was introduced to the body to provoke a less intense illness. So even if a mask does not filter out all the viral particles, i believe it is a sound hypothesis that it will filter out some, possibly the majority, and the less going into your lungs the better off you will be. There is a good article that discussed the details from last year (J Gen Intern Med 2020 Oct; 35(10): 3063-3066).

And yes, distancing and hand-washing always.

Bottom line, even though delta is much more contagious, all the precautions are still a good idea for the same reasons as before.",,,,1628385314,{},h84bkf2,False,t3_ozk6lb,False,True,t1_h82oz80,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ozk6lb/louisiana_doctor_warns_of_darkest_days_of_covid19/h84bkf2/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,329e3ff8c0fd8c2df05df77b3b8a4ff0fa740c94,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1628385330.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

[],,aquarain,,,[],,,,text,t2_b9g0h,False,True,,"In this sub for between January and July of last year I suffered horrible abuse. People accused me of being a disaster junkie, a raving lunatic, a plague fan. For warning people that what was going to happen was going to happen. Never once did I overshoot a prediction or give bad guidance. The onslaught was incessant. The hate was more virulent than the virus. I was temporarily banned a couple times from this sub and forever from /news and /worldnews for telling people honestly what was coming.

Eventually I gave up not because of the abuse but because people finally started to react to the threat. I learned that you will not believe any amount of medical evidence, no studies, no public health guidance, no math. Nothing I tell you sticks. But when your cousin's roommate's mom suffers in hospital for two weeks and dies, then you will modify your behavior a little. When it's your grandma, a little more. When it's your dad or your wife, usually then - but not always - you will believe. But when death becomes rampant enough, people will modify their behavior on average enough to blunt the curve. We will not embrace death unto the end. There is nothing I can do to change the outcome but I can take solace in the fact that eventually most people will believe their eyes and ears enough to be slightly inconvenienced. I gave up shouting into the wind. At least we tried.

Eventually hundreds of thousands of Americans did die, as I and others said they would, about on the schedule I and others said they would, because of the stupid choices I and others said were stupid at the time. That sounds like a slam dunk 
now but with a few hundred dead it seemed insane to the masses who are literally unable to grasp exponential growth. Our insight was no great wisdom. It was just an honest pragmatic assessment of the facts on hand, a synthesis of the available science and facts, an extrapolation of the exponential curve. They didn't have to die. Almost all of this was unnecessary. We didn't have to do this. People are stupid.

My shouting does nothing. I want to not hate you all. But it's going to take some time to get over the fact that you let so many die for no good reason.

&gt;My comment addressing your point about public safety proves otherwise.

It doesnt seem to address that at all. It seems linked to the rest of the comment aimed at the first line I said.

&gt;Your assumption is nonsensical because I reposted before you responded, which means the argument didn't go in any direction. I commented more than once due to issues with posting.

It's not an assumption. Im saying I have literally observed you do it before, and noted it in a tag to alert me the next time I saw a response.

I have no idea why you would act like what I said was based purely on your singular deletion of this comment. Commenting about that is clearly within the context  of previous behavioural patterns.

[],,Cory123125,,,[],,,,text,t2_cvjj3,False,False,[],"&gt; You aren't owned by the company, but the company should get to decide who they employ, right? 

Flatly no. To an extent this is true, but we obviously have limits and barriers because workers need rights due to the tremendous power imbalance between workers and companies.


&gt;I can't hire any random dickwad off the street and call them a quality engineer.

Absolutely. I await the crazy logical leap that is sure to follow this.

&gt;Well, can't the I apply the same logic and say that employers have the ability to refuse to hire anyone they want, so therefore if you want to keep your job, get vaccinated?

In some states you currently can, but states having poor workers rights isnt an argument for why you should or shouldn't be able to do anything.

The status quo is not an argument for a change.

&gt;The company is picking up risk that an unvaccinated employee gets sick or makes others sicks, so it's a risk reduction measure. 

There are any number of things companies would love to do because they would benefit the company but are limited and prevented from doing because its wrong to give them that power.

The argument we are having here is how deep into someone's medical information a company should be.

If there are alternative measures such as testing and masks available, there is no reason a company should not be perfectly willing to accept alternatives. All the while of course, the medical information they receive should be stored securely and as limited in scope as it could possibly be.

&gt; Why is that something employees should decide to stay unvaccinated, but employers have to deal with?

Because employers don't own employees and its an imbalanced relationship. It's the same reason employers in theory can't simply get rid of *trouble makers* who are rallying up unions or protected groups etc. We have decided that this is something they shouldn't have access to because of that imbalance.

In this case, alternatives exist, so we should default to employers have the least amount of control over employees possible. 

&gt;Already the company can do drug screenings and hire people who are able to lift 60 lbs for line work. 

And the first one listed is a huge problem to me. Ther eis absolutely no reason at all any company should be drug testing anyone who isn't operating dangerous machinery. None. Zilch. Zero.

I don't know why you expected that argument to be convincing to me or why you think the status quo is an argument to continue the status quo. It makes no sense to me.

&gt;we might as well stop drug screening, physicals before hiring, and annual fitness tests, too.

Yes to every one of these unless its a specific necessity of the job with no reasonable alternatives.

For example, the guy who makes your sandwich at subway doesn't need to be tested for weed. Actually just about no one should be tested for weed given how long it stays in your system because it realistically just becomes an employer controlling your time off the clock.",,,,1628391778,{},h84n80d,False,t3_ozr842,False,True,t1_h84m1e9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ozr842/vaccine_mandates_are_lawful_effective_and_based/h84n80d/,1628485704.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,burtzev,,,[],,,,text,t2_3yb2p,False,False,[],"I am personally very hesitant to cede wide ranging powers of censorship to any government or private corporation. It isn't that is 'can' backfire. It is that it 'will' backfire. The pandemic has provided the world with a perfect example. In the first few days of the 'known' (it was probably present before that) pandemic attempts were made to [silence the early whistleblowers in China](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-55355401). News that might produce 'public panic' is an irresistable draw for censors. Mercifully for China and the world in general the real news leaked upwards to those higher in the food chain. It was pure luck that the news was transmitted and also reached people with the influence to act on it. It could have turned out quite differently. The Chinese government reacted with draconian measures that would be impossible in most countries. It worked but not soon enough for the rest of the world. Without the watchful eye of the censor the news could have come earlier, and perhaps reacted to with less drastic measures. 

During warime governments typically react with strict censorship. The 'public panic' excuse operates at full steam in such situations. The difference between then and now is that if an enemy wins a battle nothing much can be done. Dissemination of news about disease, however, reaches the ears and eyes of many, many people who *can* do something. Beyond public panic people will cite the potenial harm that some falsified information may cause. To protect against this problem, however, it is inescapable that censors will see their duty in a much broader context. It's the baby and the bathwater story.

There is an alternative to such censorship. Adding a 'public health warning' to items on the internet can act to lessen the impact of falsified news. Take the example of a highly placed politician who over and over tells falsehoods for his own benefit. Simply tagging a link to sites documenting that said culprit has told 30,573 lies in the course of 4 years is, in the end, more effective than simply blocking out the noise.
