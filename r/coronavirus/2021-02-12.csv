Pretty good chance of that since people letting their guard down too early will just keep things being bad enough to justify it. It’s a self fulfilling prophecy, and the general public isn’t smart enough to realize that.

I am a 22 year old senior in college. I wanted to chime in and echo my friends here that learning an instrument can go a long way. I picked up a guitar freshman year of high school, then set it down for a few months. That cycle repeated a couple of times, until it finally stuck! I realized that the better I got, the more I enjoyed playing. It’s important to realize that as your skill increases, so does your happiness playing the instrument. 

If I could offer a piece of advice, I would say learn music you’re passionate about. My beginning was literally me listening to Banana Pancakes by Jack Johnson and going “wow, this would be cool to play on guitar”. I looked up the tab for the song (after looking up how to read tabs lol) and taught myself. It took weeks, and some practice sessions were only a few minutes because I got so frustrated, but I did finally finish!

I’ve now reached a point that I could have only dreamed of 6 years ago. I can tune my guitar by ear, play songs just by listening to them, write songs myself, and so much more! I just hope my experience can help encourage you to keep picking up the instrument, even if you haven’t played it in days, weeks, or months. Some years down the road, you’ll be thankful you did. :)

Please let me know if you’d like any advice on learning guitar!

Because logistics create a lot of roadblocks, both practical and political. We've been seeing that since January, and it's not likely to dramatically change.

I neither acknowledged nor failed to acknowledge single dose vaccines, which are still in testing with no word if and when they will be on the market.

He's one of the heroic Chinese doctors responsible for getting the virus genome out as fastas humanly possible: it's based on his findings that humanity managed to develop vaccines so quickly and therefore save uncountable lives that would otherwise have been lost. But your media prefers to focus their lens on ""whistleblower"" Li Wenliang who isn't even a whistleblower or a specialist at coronaviruses, just so they could smear more blame on the Chinese government for this unfortunate doctor's death. 

https://time.com/5882918/zhang-yongzhen-interview-china-coronavirus-genome/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Yongzhen#COVID-19_pandemic

&gt;*On 3 January 2020, Zhang's team received a test tube containing swabs from the initial outbreak of a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, caused by what would eventually be known as COVID-19. Zhang and his team were able to sequence the virus's genome by 2AM on 5 January. On that day Zhang uploaded the genome to the United States National Center for Biotechnology Information and notified the Shanghai municipal health authority. Zhang also contacted Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese Ministry of Health, arguing that the virus was similar to SARS and that it spread by respiratory transmission. He advised ""emergency public measures to protect against this disease"" and the development of antiviral treatments.*

Note the dates. This man and his team's actions saved UNCOUNTABLE number of lives especially in China, and China through him INFORMED the United States on 5 Jan 2021, when the very first case China found was on 24 December. A totally new disease, and yet the virus genome was completely sequenced in TEN DAYS from first discovery.

Your claim that if China was ""fully transparent"" anything would be different is frankly your opinion only. The West spent decades smearing everything China ever said and poisoning the well, and you think China being ""transparent"" would make the US stop spreading obvious bullshit as Pompeo did and listen to what China really said? Trump even admitted Xi Jinping told him about the coronavirus early on in his interview with Bob Woodward.

&gt;*And regardless of whether the lab is complicit, the fact is this is the second dangerous coronavirus to come out of China*

Tell me when the US, responsible for the DEADLIEST flu in human history (the ""Spanish"" Flu) as well as its extremely poor handling of multiple pandemics (Swine Flu and now COVID-19) get reforms and ""weapons inspector-like"" teams to comb over its labs and factory farms before you try to pin the blame on other countries for suffering new viruses.",,,1613221113,{},gn7drcj,False,t3_ligi8e,False,True,t1_gn5bdar,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ligi8e/state_department_who_expert_clash_on_coronavirus/gn7drcj/,1613221124,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; Yes.

&gt; As an epidemiologist, my response may seem surprising or hypocritical: I do eat at local restaurants, but only because in April, like more than 17 million Americans since that time, I tested positive for COVID-19 and recovered. According to the latest evidence, I believe I have immunity for now, and perhaps longer. But I am not pushing my luck.

&gt; I have my own list of four restaurants where I eat. I trust these restaurants because each has drastically reduced their number of tables and spaced them at least 6 feet apart, and everyone inside is diligent about wearing a mask. My husband and I also order takeout a lot. It is important to reiterate, however, that evidence shows restaurants are a significant source of infection, and those who have not recovered from COVID-19 should refrain from eating at restaurants until the community gets a better handle on the spread of infection.

Imagine if the initial, day one messaging on covid had been “this is brand new, so we know almost nothing yet. But it’s a coronavirus, so it’s almost certainly airborne, spread by droplets and aerosols. It’s primarily a respiratory virus, so masking is going to be the best protection.”

We’d be looking at half the death rate we got. The folks at the WHO who blatantly lied about masks should be held criminally responsible.

Anyone in marketing or communications will tell you the first message is the only message. That’s the one people hear, and when you change tack, especially on something like this, they either assume you’re lying to them now, or you were then, so why should they trust you now?

I’m not saying the message should be “get the shot, and get a half off voucher for drinks at your local nightclub” but a message of “get the shot, to protect yourself and to protect your community by blocking spread, but we have to keep up precautions until the majority can get it” is both more effective and more honest than what we’re doing.

You're falling into a number game trap.  There is no statistical difference between Novavax's, Pfizer's, and Moderna's vaccines.  J&amp;J is the outlier.  The differences between the Moderna, Pfizer, and Novavax vaccines in terms of effectiveness are driven by the sample size (Novavax had a smaller trial size) and the number of cases in the unvaccinated population.  But, for the vaccinated group, the difference between Novavax and Moderna amounts to a difference of .04 cases per 1000.    

&gt;Now let’s assume SA’s variant carrying E484K was rampant during JNJ’s trial. JNJ was measured at 57% there. Why is your next conclusion that the efficacy for Moderna and Pfizer must be closer to 50-60% rather than say 70-80%?

I don't even look at data for J&amp;J at this point in time because they don't even use the same metric.  They use this metric of severe disease for what I'm interested in knowing.

""Thick air"" prevails at the Vienna AKH, where doctors and especially nursing staff are mobilizing against vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine. In an online petition addressed to the hospital management, which more than 500 nursing staff had already signed on Thursday morning, protests are being made against the fact that the AKH is currently vaccinating exclusively with this vaccine and no longer with the originally intended product from Biontech/Pfizer. Parts of the medical profession are also rebelling.

The hospital management has therefore scheduled an information event with renowned experts for today, 12:00 p.m., which should dispel the concerns against AstraZeneca, a report in the daily newspaper ""Heute"" confirmed. The vaccination schedule had been adjusted after supply bottlenecks occurred at Biontech/Pfizer.

""Not protected until May""

In the petition of the care is against the British-Swedish vaccine in the meeting, it has ""in the ideal case an effect of 58 to 82 percent"" against mild courses and is thus clearly less effective than those of Biontech/Pfizer or Moderna, which are inoculated in this country already longer in the fight against the Coronavirus. The ""next evil"" is ""the long time to efficacy,"" he said, because with AstraZeneca that doesn't occur until 12 weeks after vaccination, compared with three for the other two vaccines.

""Staff who are only now given the opportunity to be vaccinated would not be protected until mid-May - an unbearably long period of time, considering the work they do on patients and the mutants that have been created,"" says the petition, which calls for a shift away from the current vaccination schedule. Employees would have to get ""the highly effective vaccines from Biontech/Pfizer or Moderna"" to be best protected.

Works council calls for solution and testing strategy

In a circular letter, the chairman of the AKH staff council, Wolfgang Hofer, demands a solution from management in the vaccine discussion as well as a clear testing strategy. It is ""unacceptable that there are colleagues with close patient contact who have still not been vaccinated"".

I’m not just listening to cnn and disagreeing arbitrarily as you assume. Although that wouldn’t be a bad starting point because they don’t have a track record of being correct. But that’s a different discussion :)

Glad to hear your background! You should certainly be well versed in both sides then. I do agree with the viral load but suspicion is aerosols are enough to transmit disease from what I’ve read. 

But I disagree that a mask just goes into a mask and never comes out. It’s a stable environment for the virus as you know. Yes, just touching your mask isn’t going to give you COVID, but then you’re very likely to touch eyes nose and mouth before sanitizing. So, you go around wearing a mask which gives a stable environment for virus droplet to land, and then constantly breathe that in and out. And then you’re out of the store so you grab your mask and tuck it in your car before you touch your face. So even if a mask could stop droplets, and virus couldn’t transmit from aerosols (they do), you’d still get sick!

I appreciate the discussion. Have a good and safe weekend! I’d tell you a joke about COVID but 99.997% chance you wouldn’t get it.

Doctors and medical practices in the suit would be able to obtain compensation for having been sold an overpriced monopolized product, and a defective one to boot, in that the mumps vaccine wasn't effective (indeed, the suit alleged that Merck expected outbreaks to occur and, as predicted, they did -- mumps epidemics occurred in 2006 in a highly vaccinated population and again in 2009-2010).

There was a federal program with Walgreens and CVS to vaccinate nursing homes and a portion of the doses sent to the states were set aside for that program, and apparently it went very slowly for various reasons. Some say that nursing homes had not completed required paperwork, others say that there were active outbreaks there and they had to wait to give the shots, others just say poor communication and leadership etc. In Virginia, 232k doses were allocated to this program but apparently just sat for weeks.

Another problem was a 2nd dose being reserved when a 1st dose is given, because the clinics felt that they couldn't count on a steady supply. So if they got 100 doses they gave 50 and set the other 50 aside where they would sit for 3-4 weeks. I read reports of this happening at multiple levels, like at the manufacturer and at Warp Speed but the details are a bit fuzzy.

A third problem was the shots just not being reported, in Virginia they say that some clinics do not have internet access and have to fill out physical paperwork which has to get mailed in or can get lost etc.

Virginia claims to have improved these problems and Biden said that they made some adjustments at the federal level too. Virginia is now up to 80% which is better if you can believe the numbers.

500M doses for approx 75% of the US population. Currently it takes 2 doses per person. If we get a single dose vacc at some point, bump that up to 85 or 90%.

&gt; You mention 50 mil (or 100 mil doses) but that's ignoring the significant doses already administered.

50M doses, not people, and that's the number of doses administered, so that's precisely what I'm accounting with that number.

&gt; Then you extrapolate rate 50mil/500mil per 100 days to ""over a year"" which while vague isn't quite in the ball park

No, I'm using the current number of doses administered divided by the number of days administered to get the rate. Then using that rate to estimate the time to get the rest of the doses administered, which puts us at the end of April. With increased rates were still a year out.

&gt; In other comments you got condescending and defensive e.g. ""you don't know what ____ is do you?"" Right or wrong no one likes that.

Am I taking crazy pills here? I was responding to the comment ""bless his heart he's trying."" Why am I the only one being held accountable here for being condescending??

Yes and I was being liberal with the estimate. Sometimes it's upwards of 80 or 90%. At first the CDC was saying 60 or 70% but now Fauci is saying it will be higher.

LOOKING BACK: 

In the late 70's and early 80's when the home phone rang, I dived...  and actually raced my sibling to see who could answer it first, because it was almost ALWAYS someone awesome calling--someone from my social circle at middle school, or high school, or a cool cousin or fun relative calling. 

And I mean, sure back then there were about 2 scam marketing callers per year, if that, give or take, and probably easily about 10 prank callers per year. 

The snickering prank callers were almost always kids from my class, asking me if my fridge was still running, because if so: I better go run and catch it! 

(FYI: I actually loved receiving the prank calls back then! Some of them were pretty clever and creative! And I was also admittedly, a bit of a prank caller nuisance myself! Not to mention a serious hard core phone-phreaker script kiddie!)

--------------------------------

Anyways... 

Things progressed into the 1990's and bam... that's when a more innocent technology was ruined. 

The scam/robo-calls unleashed their ugly head at that time as a rather serious problem, but still... the problem was still somewhat manageable, and the dynamics were well understand. 

We could have done something to stop it. But we didn't. 

--------------------------------

And now, at this late-late-late stage... of the technology's evolution... 

It's pretty much all over for traditional incoming phone calls, sadly, due to scam marketing callers.

Facts:

(a) Quarantining the healthy / locking down and masking the entire population is NOT common-sense or ""what you do"": it's the first time in History we do this. It's an experiment. And it's been a year of that experiment

(b) Coronaviruses (e.g. the flu) have been known for a century to be highly mutable and evolve relatively quickly

(c) It's known that such viruses tend to grow milder the more widespread they become, because that's what its evolution leads it to under normal human behavior circumstances

(c) By doing (a), we put an evolutionary pressure on the virus to bypass our lockdowns, masks and restrictions. And, of course, this means becoming more infectious

Conclusions:

(1) ""Slow down the spread"" produced the variants. The more infectious and lethal ones we are worrying about right now, that is, since there are over 3.6k known variants.

(2) The harder we lockdown and mask, the more infectious it will become",,,1613185732,{},gn4tr1r,False,t3_li6lga,False,True,t3_li6lga,/r/Coronavirus/comments/li6lga/daily_discussion_thread_february_12_2021/gn4tr1r/,1613186302,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

And surely if there was a group of experts like that who had analyzed the data and made a recommendation, you would accept that? Because that has happened. I'm not a PhD specializing in infectious disease transmission. I strongly suspect you aren't either. But the whole point of a society is that not everyone has to be an expert on everything. I  am, however, a biologist so I do know a thing or two about reading scientific papers and the majority of everything that I have read points to masks being effective. In fact, the only studies I've seenn claiming noneffect were studies specifically looking at exposure in close quarters i.e. spreading it to people you are living with. That's why there isn't a huge push to mask in your own home, it isn't supported by data. And that is why you can't just look at meta data. Outside of all this, you really shouldn't depend on meta data because it is super easy to manipulate. The whole point of a scientific study is that the parameters are published with the results. Meta data skips all of that and allows whoever is compiling the data to force a conclusion. I don't know when people started thinking meta data was the be all and end all. Maybe it is for advertising but not for science.

And the heart attack thing is still a terrible example. People should be free to fuck up their own lives in whatever way they see fit. Their own lives. Not wearing a mask fucks up other peoples lives. Masks are best at preventing you from infecting other people. That is why it is the definition of selfishness to refuse to wear them.

I was inpatient for over ten days with COVID last month, nearly died due to the double pneumonia and threatened with being intubated and going on a vent if the last resort treatment didn’t work— so really, without the vaccine my only hope is that my broken ass body managed to make some antibodies that’ll last me until they start doing group 1B1/1C in AZ, which will likely be in a couple of months. 

I could technically volunteer at one of the vaccine drives bc I think you get vaccinated for that, but that would also mean higher exposure to the virus and that doesn’t sound smart.

That is the straw man that has been dangled in front of people but almost nobody is demanding that (Rebekah Jones is not). The truth is almost all teachers just want to make sure they're concerns are being listened to.

The vaccines appear to be extremely effective and will soon be approaching universal availability for teachers. If a school is not willing to wait a couple weeks to make sure teachers can get it, then you have to ask yourself: what other safety corners are they willing to cut? (not just for teachers but for students and their families as well)

From a school administrators perspective, ensuring proper ventilation in schools will require far more effort and money than ensuring vaccinations for all their staff.

As far as Rebekah Jones goes, she just seems to be trying to bring attention to the fact that a huge number of these studies of spread among children in schools have the same inherent flaw; which is that children rarely have symptoms and so they are almost never tested. It is very difficult to track actual spread in schools with a population that is (for whatever reason) not being pro-actively tested. This was true for the [17 rural schools in Wisconsin study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7004e3.htm) as well as a bunch of other studies that the media is using to say schools will be safe when they are open.

As the CDC says [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/pediatric-hcp.html#infections):

&gt;The true incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is not known due to lack of widespread testing and the prioritization of testing for adults and those with severe illness.

Researchers  found  that both lower temperatures and lower humidity helped viruses  survive  longer. In particular, at 4 degrees C, or 40 degrees F, and 20%  relative  humidity, more than two thirds of the viruses survived for 28  days. On  the other end of the spectrum, at 40 degrees C, or 104  degrees F, and  80% humidity, the viruses survived for less than 6  hours.  This suggests that coronaviruses survive better on surfaces at  colder temperatures. It is also [expected](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10676-can-flu-viruses-survive-winter-in-frozen-lakes/)  that the virus would survive being frozen.

it's not just ""spread in school"" - it's **community** spread where the kids live.

&amp;#x200B;

**one** sick kid in class causes a 100 contacts to trace.. all classmates + their families.... and by extension, the families of *siblings'* classmates. 

if the community positivity rate is 10%.. that one kid might cause 10 infections.. and each one of them another 10.

In particular, there are two items that will act as barriers: **the use of community-spread metrics** to determine whether schools should open, and the **requirement of routine screening testing.**

This the manufacturer provided actual delivery schedule.  You'll notice it doesn't go beyond the end of February.  

&gt;Both vaccine manufacturers updated their vaccine schedule deliveries for Q2 and there are still big blank empty weeks for Q1?  

That is a rhetorical question. The article suggests a schedule already exists for Q2 - but we don't in fact even have a complete schedule for Q1. 

&gt;6.2 million more doses than planned will be deployed between July and August. ""We  will soon share the schedule with provinces and territories so they can  prepare to get all those doses into people's arms,"" Trudeau said. 

You are right about the cold storage capacity.  We have more than that number because we had some before this all started. 

Unfortunately, the provinces have created so many distribution sites.  For example, Ontario is well beyond 20 already and trying to expand to another 20.  The provinces were supposed to centralize the distribution and they have not done that. So distribution sites have two cold storage at most. The thing about these ""fridges"" is they can't be open and closed like regular cold storage.  And we aren't talking about fitting 1.2 doses, it's supposedly 2.6 million doses - plus whatever doses we haven't distributed yet or are supposed to be held in reserve for the second dose.

*Of the 92 patients who were tested for antibodies, a third are now deceased or* **“did not grant permission”** *to participate, and the remaining individuals tested negative for serology tests*"".

Have you ever heard of the average Chinese citizen being allowed to deny permission to the government?

I would deduce from both reports that the Chinese government are terrified of the world finding out that they were covering up this pandemic long before we thought.

it is not me who needs help so don't bother offering
I really don't care about opinions that are corrupt and therefore of no value

there is only one point in speaking and that is to state the terms and let the chips fall...that is how the game is played as you well know and it's why they have their panties in a bunch which I admit, I find very funny

the more they rant the more I know I hit the bullseye, as usual
it gets me in a LOT of trouble and it's totally worth it
doesn't matter if you delete anything
I was a global IT security remediator
nothing typed and erased is ever lost 
and liars already read it anyway so boom, message delivered
if you feel agitated, you can take a pill these scientists insist is safe and isn't, and wash it down with a cocktail since it's going to cook your liver and they DGAF anyway about your liver lol or anything but sucking up to liars..for perks, which I assure you, are running out, fast, and THAT is why they are so upset and they DESERVE to be

that's the real bottom line
it's very sad how corrupt the tinternet is
I remember it in DOS when I was already in IT for a few yrs, head hunted for my FUCKING GENIUS ha ha....I was appreciated then. They gave me ONE job at the most well known company in the world...(I've led global programs for the top 5 actually - fixed other people's screw ups) and within months I'd taken on 3 other roles combined and STILL had time on my hands

I'm used to people being angry at being left behind eating my dust
rather than be grateful they throw stones and you indulge their tantrums
its why the world was so much better in the 80's and 90's before every pleb thought their opinion was of value lol and that's rude but it's a fact
They just muddy the water. IDGAF what their education is. Colleges, esp US ones, are outrageous bullshitters. We had a TV show in Canada called Talking to Americans...which went to US campuses, stopped professors and asked them BASIC questions they got wrong. We used to gasp and laugh. I cringed. My parents left the US in the 50's bc they knew this was happening and didn't want us miseducated and turned into whores for liars

IT was pioneer days then..coding was invented by a single career woman
they don't even know her name...she was the longest serving military person bc NOBODY could get anything done without her genius
the boys haaaaaaaaaaaaated it
I spent my entire career experiencing that
BUT my clients knew I was indispensible

you ruined our creation
now it's full of filthy aggressive corrupt liars I like shining a light on

&gt;Dr. Dwyer said Chinese authorities had provided influenza surveillance data from before December 2019 but only from one children’s hospital and one general hospital. The authorities told the WHO team that its hospitals generally didn’t store physical samples from patients with respiratory diseases. 

That is true. In China most cases flu like symptoms are not lab tested unless there is problem found on lungs. X-Ray is usually done before any swab. Lab testing of flu was insufficient in China. On contrast, pneumonia of unknown cause will be thoroughly tested, due to the lessons learnt from SARS and MERS.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Marion Koopmans, a Dutch virologist who was also part of the team, said that the team’s Chinese counterparts had done extensive work involving hundreds of investigators from several institutes. The team, she said, had limited time and could attempt to obtain such information later. 

So it is just no time to prepare the raw data? What is ""raw data""? Medical records in China are written in Chinese, usually hand written by doctors which is unrecognizable to even another doctor. It takes time. Very few hospitals started to electrify medical records in 2019 (maybe the children's hospital mentioned earlier). PII must be removed from any medical record providing to 3rd party. Also PCR testing simply didn't exist by the time of early cases identified. Full genome sequencing was done on some cases thus the novel coronavirus was discovered.

But it's missing key context. 

Only about 1,000 of these jobs are currently filled. Also most of these jobs were temporary positions slated to last 4 to 8 months while a pipeline would have been constructed. Those jobs would have been primarily in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas. 

Finally, a State Department report on the Keystone Pipeline found the project would only create 50 permanent long lasting jobs some of which would be in Canada, not the United States.

Looking at all countries and saying there are some that have lockdown and still have high cases tells us little about lockdowns, because those countries are different from Sweden in many other ways beyond lockdown policy. For example, it is very likely multi-generational households are a driver, and while Sweden has no lockdown they also have few 3+ generation households, compared to South of Europe. So we can't tell if Sweden has fewer deaths than Italy because the lockdown is different or because they live differently. 

In the absence of actual modeling, we can compare what is most similar to Sweden over these population and geography characteristics. Denmark is a decent pick for that.

Of course, a full answer will require careful regression models and good data. There are some attempts, like this https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7268966/, but I'd say we need to wait for the final word from this science.

Once get to that point I believe the start to going back to that time pre-March where you get your flu and now Covid shot and hope for the best will be common place. It’s really easy to imagine that scenario a year from now but rather difficult to guess when the switch will happen. The rate we’re going with Covid vaccinations seems slow, but the date between spring and summer still seems reasonable when everyone gets a shot.

There’s already debates sparking up about ripping the mask off when you get all of your required doses. Or specifically, [there is talk from the CDC of not having to quarantine if you got all of your doses](https://twitter.com/usatoday/status/1359959139590365184?s=21) which pretty much sounds like code to do whatever after getting your shot(s). There may be suggestions to keep on a mask and such, but I’m sure most will take it as “it’s over!” and use this as an excuse to not wear masks.

Once more people get vaccinated the sentiment of moving past certain mitigation efforts will grow more and more to the point where local governments will finally call it quits on those efforts. My guess would be fall or so when some places call it quits. Other places will probably do it earlier (probably Florida), maybe others later (probably New York). I feel the turning point will be when an article comes out saying that scientists or even the CDC have determined that it is ok to not wear a mask in public as the vaccines will last longer than expected AND that vaccinated people can’t spread it to unvaccinated people. If there are no issues and only agreements from people like Fauci, watch how quick those masks will fly off faces.

It’s going to feel weird going out in the world knowing that Covid still exists and would be worse to catch than the flu, but I think besides the vaccine, News of some stellar treatment your doctor can prescribe to you if you somehow do get sick with Covid even with a vaccine would quell all my fears, provided I get diagnosed early enough.",,,1613226755,{},gn7wne6,False,t3_lis4rf,False,True,t1_gn7h1ks,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lis4rf/virologist_says_reopening_indoor_dining_is/gn7wne6/,1613227195,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It’s pretty difficult to do a double blind study on mask wearing but the most extensive real life studies (people wearing masks in public, not mannequins in vacuum chambers with masks taped on their face) show no change in transmission.

[This article from *New York* magazine](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/coronavirus-lab-escape-theory.html) argues that we should consider a lab origin a plausible hypothesis alongside the hypothesis of a natural origin, and notes that there has been plenty of experimentation with taking natural viruses and engineering them to be more infectious for the purposes of preparedness. For example, this section:

&gt;Baric, a gravelly voiced former swim champion, described in this early paper how his lab was able to train a coronavirus, MHV, which causes hepatitis in mice, to jump species, so that it could reliably infect BHK (baby-hamster kidney) cell cultures. They did it using serial passaging: repeatedly dosing a mixed solution of mouse cells and hamster cells with mouse-hepatitis virus, while each time decreasing the number of mouse cells and upping the concentration of hamster cells. ... A few years later, in a further round of “interspecies transfer” experimentation, Baric’s scientists introduced their mouse coronavirus into flasks that held a suspension of African-green-monkey cells, **human cells,** and pig-testicle cells.

&gt;...

&gt;In 2006, for instance, Baric and his colleagues, hoping to come up with a “vaccine strategy” for SARS, produced noninfectious virus replicon particles (or VRPs) using the Venezuelan-equine-encephalitis virus (another American germ-warfare agent), which they fitted with various SARS spike proteins. Then, wearing Tyvek suits and two pairs of gloves each, and working in a biological safety cabinet in a BSL-3-certified laboratory, they cloned and grew recombinant versions of the original SARS virus in an incubator in a medium that held African-green-monkey cells. When they had grown enough virus, the scientists swapped out one kind of spike protein for a carefully chosen mutant, and they challenged their prototype vaccine with it in mice.

&gt;The scientists also tried their infectious SARS clones in something called an air-liquid interface, using a relatively new type of cell culture developed by Raymond Pickles of the University of North Carolina’s Cystic Fibrosis Center. **Pickles had perfected a method of emulating the traits of human airway tissue by cultivating cells taken from lung-disease patients** — nurturing the culture over four to six weeks in such a way that the cells differentiated and developed a crop of tiny moving hairs, or cilia, on top and goblet cells within that produced real human mucus. In fact, before infecting these HAE (human airway epithelial) cells with a virus, the lab worker must sometimes rinse off some of the accumulated mucus, as if helping the lab-grown tissue to clear its throat. So **Baric was exposing and adapting his engineered viruses to an extraordinarily true-to-life environment** — the juicy, sticky, hairy inner surface of our breathing apparatus.

But, you may still need to put on a mask before going into a grocery store for a while. Huge businesses owned by conglomerates like Disney World will be especially cautious about dropping the restrictions, because the downside of dropping the mask requirement too soon (i.e. massive liability, poor publicity due to park outbreaks) outweighs any decrease in park attendance due to customers not wanting to wear masks. Disney makes money in lots of other ways; they can carry the theme parks at a loss for an extra year.

The fact that children will be vaccinated so much later than adults is going to create some confusing dilemmas.

Should it be limited to protect access to medical services and grant effective communications and information to the population, or should it fully intervene to reduce the spread as much as possible? While the sensible answer appears to be the latter because life should be valued above all else, that’s only in hindsight; the reality is that all of the previous pandemic plans by the WHO, CDC, British Government and many others was that the former was the way to go - as Neil Ferguson put it, “China changed what it was possible”. Even in the rest of the west, at the start the former was the strategy, let’s not forget that graph people everywhere were sharing about the pandemic trajectory if restrictions were imposed and if they were not - a similar number of people would die, but over time and without overwhelming hospital systems.

Ultimately, I think that Sweden at worst was guilty of being to dogmatic and “by the book” rather than being more aggressive and experimenting with lockdowns and restrictions as a way to control epidemics; at best they followed the established protocols and didn’t succumb to the panic.

In a public health emergency, absolutism is a very tempting response: People should cease all behavior that creates additional risk.

That instinct led to calls for gay men to stop having sex during the AIDS crisis. It has also spurred campaigns for teen abstinence, to reduce sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancies. And to fight obesity, people have been drawn to fads like the elimination of trans fats or carbohydrates.

These days, there is a new absolutist health fad: the discouragement — or even prohibition — of any behavior that seems to increase the risk of coronavirus infection, even minutely.

People continue to scream at joggers, walkers and cyclists who are not wearing masks. The University of California, Berkeley, this week banned outdoor exercise, masked or not, saying, “The risk is real.” The University of Massachusetts Amherst has banned outdoor walks. It encouraged students to get exercise by “accessing food and participating in twice-weekly Covid testing.”

A related trend is “hygiene theater,” as Derek Thompson of The Atlantic described it: The New York City subway system closes every night, for example, so that workers can perform a deep cleaning.

There are two big questions to ask about these actions: How much are they doing to reduce the spread of the virus? And do they have any downside?

No documented cases
The answer to the first question, according to many experts, is: They seem to do little good. Prohibiting outdoor activity is unlikely to reduce the spread of the virus, nor is urging people always to wear a mask outdoors.

Worldwide, scientists have not documented any instances of outdoor transmission unless people were in close conversation, Dr. Muge Cevik, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, told me. “The small number of cases where outdoor transmission might have occurred,” she wrote on Twitter, “were associated with close interactions, particularly extended duration, or settings where people mixed indoors alongside an outdoor setting.” The new variants of the virus are more contagious, but there is no evidence to suggest they will change this pattern.

As my colleague Tara Parker-Pope puts it, “Avoid breathing the air that other people exhale.”

A student walking across campus — let alone a masked student — presents little risk to another student who remains at least six feet away. The same goes for joggers in your neighborhood.

The story is similar for deep cleaning. “Scientists increasingly say that there is little to no evidence that contaminated surfaces can spread the virus,” my colleagues Mike Ives and Apoorva Mandavilli have written. The one surface that is important to wash, frequently and vigorously, is the human hand.

Which brings us to the second question — whether there is any downside to absolutism. Covid-19 is a horrible disease. And the notion that a jogger somewhere might infect somebody she passes, even from more than six feet away, is scientifically plausible.

So why not take every possible precaution at all times?
The short answer is: because we are human.

Taking every possible precaution is unrealistic, just as telling all gay men and teenagers to abstain from sex was unrealistic. Human beings are social creatures who crave connection and pleasure and who cannot minimize danger at all times.

Despite the risks, we eat carbs, drink wine, go sledding and even ride in automobiles. We enjoy taking outdoor walks and drinking a cup of coffee on a public bench. Many people who exercise find it difficult to do so in a mask. “It feels a bit like suffocating,” Shannon Palus wrote in Slate.

I’ve noticed that some of the clearest voices against Covid absolutism are researchers who have spent much of their careers studying HIV, including Cevik, Julia Marcus, Sarit Golub and Aaron Richterman. They know the history. The demonization of sex during the AIDS crisis contributed to more unsafe sex. If all sex is bad, why focus on safe sex?

There is a similar dynamic with Covid. “People do not have unlimited energy, so we should ask them to be vigilant where it matters most,” Cevik has written.

Telling Americans to wear masks when they’re unnecessary undermines efforts to persuade more people to wear masks where they are vital. Remember: Americans are not doing a particularly good job of wearing masks when they make a big difference, indoors and when people are close together outdoors.

Banning college students from outdoor walks won’t make them stay inside their dorm rooms for weeks on end. But it probably will increase the chances that they surreptitiously gather indoors.

And spending money on deep cleaning leaves less money for safety measures that will protect people, like faster vaccination.

“Rules that are really more about showing that you’re doing something versus doing something that’s actually effective” are counterproductive, Marcus told my colleague Ian Prasad Philbrick. “Trust is the currency of public health.”",,,1613231230,{},gn8cl9g,False,t3_li6lga,False,True,t1_gn46ujl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/li6lga/daily_discussion_thread_february_12_2021/gn8cl9g/,1613232727,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

While my wife was pregnant in her 6th month she started having a lot of pain. So the obgyn had his private practice and had to work for the state hospital.  We went to the state hospital to see him and he was so mad he didn't get his €120 fee like at his private practice that he told my wife that she was having a miscarriage and gave her medicine that would terminate the baby. Again her uncle advised her not to take the medication and we found another obgyn and she was told to stay in bed for two weeks and she had a baby a few months later.  

I have adhd and when we moved there the doctors told me that adhd is cured at 18. I broke a finger at 3 pm and went to the hospital in her town of 33k people and there was no xray tech there (hand was the size of a fucking melon at that point) and come back the next day. I came back and sure as shit, it was shattered, but I had to go to another town to get a cast.  

I also got shingles while living there. Waited 14 fucking hours to be seen by the doctor who gave me a shot that made it worse (again uncle told me) then gave me ampules of pain meds and was told to break them open and drink it lol. 

The hospitals are beyond dirty, garbage everywhere and no one cares. Doctors smoke in their office and no one bats an eye. When my wife gave birth they kept her in a hallway when she was crowning and the nurse told her that she didn't know what she was talking about until the doctor came by, moved her gown and yelled at the nurse to get her in the room.

Any answer you get that is either ""yes"" or ""no"" is wrong, for now. We have only ""maybe, probably not"", and it's going to be that way for a long time.

In order to answer the question scientifically, it would require a ""challenge study"" where both vaccinated and unvaccinated people are deliberately exposed to the virus to see if transmission occurs.

The ethical concerns of deliberate exposure prevent us from performing these studies in humans.  It's the same reason that the vaccine trials took so long, we can't deliberately infect people to see if they need hospitalization or die.

However, we did these studies in hamsters, and the results looked pretty bad. They were able to spread it. But hamsters greet each other by touching noses like all the time. Humans don't really do that (do you?). So we did similar studies with monkeys and the results look really good.

Also, you'll notice that any reputable person talking about this subject always says ""may be able to spread"", or ""maybe"", or ""we don't know if"". And that's because there is a small chance that vaccinated people will be able to spread the virus. But it's not a big chance. Doctors, scientists, and regulators are being very careful with their language on this subject, some would argue they're being too careful. That said, if they were to say that ""vaccinated people cannot spread the virus"", and then we find out that in some situations that vaccinated people have spread the virus, that would end up worse for them than if they hedge for a while. So at least to me, the way they're framing it seems pretty reasonable, you just have to put yourself in their shoes.

[A few happy reminders](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ldstk0/daily_discussion_thread_february_06_2021/gmaem2l/).


Looks like the amount of virus in people who've gotten one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and then infected is [greatly reduced compared to those not vaccinated](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfiqma/decreased_sarscov2_viral_load_following/).  This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a heavy reduction in ability to spread the virus.

Despite the news, it looks like at least the mRNA vaccines [*still* work](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfp89k/neutralization_of_sarscov2_spike_6970_deletion/) on the three most worrying variants.

[This was encouraging,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmp5doo/) regarding the efficacy of vaccines against variants.

[Yay!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmqfk4q/)

Just because [mRNA vaccines aren't 100% effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/)  against the SA variant, *doesn't* [mean that we'll definitely need boosters](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gmu581s/).

**Spike mutation analogy:**

The spike protein is coded by 3,831 base pairs.  What does that mean?

Well, it's like a lego sculpture where you have 3,831 words in the instructions for how to build it, and the writer had to be super-detailed when explaining each motion and piece.    

In this analogy, your immune system makes lego pieces (antibodies) that can attach to any pair of exposed bumps on the lego sculpture.  We'll say there are 40 pairs exposed in this example.

A variant is when the instructions change by just one or more words.  Sometimes the photocopier for the instructions page gets a tiny smudge.  This could be really bad sometimes, especially if it's a critical word or phrase, like ""left"" or ""repeat six times"" or a description of a particularly detailed lego piece. Color might not always matter, but size would.

Out of those 3,831 words, how many have to change so much that every one of those 40 spots is no longer there?  It's probably a lot.

But wait, how many words have to change to make the whole sculpture really different, so that it doesn't work as a sculpture anymore?  Really not that many if they're in the right spots, right?  This is why most variants suck at being viruses; it's rare that a mistake would make the instructions *better*.

**Which vaccine should I get?**

When someone asks me what my favorite beer is, the answer is always the same.

It's the one in front of me.

So get the first vaccine you can, the differences are pretty minor.

**Booster questions to think about, I don't have answers**

(note: there's a difference between ""boost"" and ""booster"" here that needs to be understood.)

(also, what's the term for a mixture of sequences, heterogenous? Is my doubt about this term just from overthinking?)

(also also, I'm not convinced we're definitely going to need boosters, this is just fun to think about.)

Could a booster shot replace the second dose of a prime/boost regimen?

Should a booster shot use only one sequence of mRNA (or have all identical spike proteins), or should it have both/multiple?

For future vaccines, should the sequence/spike be the same for prime/boost or different?  If you have four spikes/sequences, would it make more sense to do two in each, or all four in each?

How much should we trust mutation modeling here? Should we anticipate future mutations and include them?  Are we good enough at that yet?

Do we need to give any non-booster doses to people who have recovered from infection?

Could we ""stretch"" doses of an mRNA booster by priming with a vaccine that's easier to manufacture, but maybe less effective (like ChAdOx1), and boost with the mRNA booster?  Could it be better or faster to prime with a current mRNA sequence and boost with an updated ChAdOx1?  

[**Conclusions**](https://gfycat.com/cleantalkativedassie)

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms.  This currently seems to also be true with post vaccination infection with any of the known variants. We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well. 

In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections and symptoms in those who do get infected. Therefore, vaccines should reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing an infection, each subsequent variant they are exposed to will just broaden their immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). So they'll have good and broad immunity to a variety of variants, which seems likely to be an indication that they won't catch or spread the virus as well in the future. Same thing happens when someone who is vaccinated is exposed to a new variant. Their immunity is broadened and strengthened by each subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. But remember, so many people will be less likely to spread the virus, so it's pretty unlikely that this reduced level of spread will be sufficient to sustain the virus in the way we have seen over the past year. So if a variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. If they don't become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing to have my mind changed on this with new information though, so don't take this as gospel.

Tips on clarifying my terms/language/understanding appreciated.  Did I miss something that could help people? Please let me know!

Vaccine induced immunity is [comparable to](https://www.verywellhealth.com/antibodies-from-vaccines-and-from-natural-infection-5092564), or [better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l5whhu/increased_resistance_of_sarscov2_variants_b1351/) immunity from a previous infection.

It's too soon to say ""lifelong"" but [that is a possibility.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4nkco/the_immune_system_mounts_a_lasting_defense_after/) Also, it looks like those who have recovered *may* only need [one dose of an mRNA vaccine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/labst4/robust_spike_antibody_responses_and_increased/). There are some people (~7%) who don't develop lasting immunity from infections. 

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l9nfu8/stable_neutralizing_antibody_levels_six_months/) probably a lot,[ lot longer,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/)  probably many years.

It's unlikely that sterilizing immunity would be found in 100% of vaccinated humans, if we even get sterilizing immunity at all. This is still good news.

# Covid in Scotland: Nation out-vaccinates Europe — but supplies are running low

&gt; Mark McLaughlin
&gt; Saturday February 13 2021, 12.01am GMT, The Times
&gt; Scotland had a record day of Covid-19 vaccinations yesterday with 64,881 people getting a first dose
&gt; JEFF J MITCHELL/GETTY IMAGES

Scotland vaccinated a higher proportion of residents in seven days than any other country in Europe.

Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, shared the statistics on Twitter as she thanked everyone involved in the vaccination programme for their “fantastic work”.

Scotland had another day of record Covid-19 vaccinations yesterday with 64,881 people receiving their first dose — representing 1.4 per cent of the population vaccinated in a single day.

The accelerating rollout is closing the gap with England after a slow start, with 24.5 per cent of eligible adults in Scotland now vaccinated compared with 26 per cent in England. Wales has completed almost 27 per cent and Northern Ireland 25 per cent.

All four nations are storming ahead of other European countries with their vaccination programmes after the UK government agreed to buy millions of doses while they were still undergoing clinical trials and fast-tracked the approval process.

The European Commission is facing criticism from member states for its faltering bureaucracy which has slowed the rollout across the continent.

Our World in Data, which compiles figures from official sources, aggregated Scotland’s performance against other European countries.

It found Scotland had vaccinated an average of 8,901 people per million eligible residents in the seven days to February 9, compared with 8,856 in Wales; 6,760 in Northern Ireland and 6,172 in England.

France managed only 1,347 and Germany, the home of BioNTech which co-created the Pfizer vaccine, had vaccinated 1,282. Belgium, a key manufacturing base for both Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca, managed only 1,336 vaccinations that week.

Jeane Freeman, Scotland’s health secretary, praised the country’s recent performance but said the number of appointments would soon have to be reduced due to a number of factors including a lack of supplies. The latest round of vaccinations brings Scotland’s total as of yesterday morning to 1,113,628 people who have received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine.

Freeman said: “The uptake we have seen so far has been both remarkable and very welcome.”

She added: “A combination of circumstances — remarkably high uptake, a temporary reduction in supply from Pfizer and the need to ensure people can receive second doses on time — means we need to reduce the number of appointments we schedule over the next few weeks.

“As soon as supply improves our programme will scale up again.”

She said the vaccination programme in Scotland remained on course to hit its targets.

The health secretary said the Scottish government had received reports of people breaching coronavirus restrictions at funerals, which limits the number attending to 20.

“I want to remind people that that limit of 20 is still in place and that unfortunately it is there for a really good reason,” she said.

She urged organisers of funerals to think about the restrictions when sending invitations, adding that people who wanted to attend but were unable to do so due to the limit should “please respect that fact”.

She said: “Maybe find out if it is possible to see the service by other means such as live streaming, and check with the person organising about the other ways in which you can pay your respects.

“But please, don’t simply turn up. This places the organisers in a terrible position and it also of course increases the risk that virus will spread as a result of the event.”",,,1613252762,{},gnaqlpz,True,t3_lja2i6,False,True,t3_lja2i6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lja2i6/covid_in_scotland_nation_outvaccinates_europe_but/gnaqlpz/,1613263802,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In Spain, the official message repeated all the time by politicians and the media is that there is practically no transmission at schools. Schoolchildren only get infected elsewhere (mostly with their families).

But the fact is that we see no transmission because we don't look. School children are typically asymptomatic, so infections are typically detected by contact tracing from symptomatic family members. The family member then gets the ""blame"" of having infected the kid, because they were detected first (even though this doesn't necessarily mean they got the virus first). Classmates of the kid aren't checked, because they have no symptoms, and they are not considered ""close contacts"" due to masking and schools officially being considered very safe (yeah, catch-22). So if the kid passes the virus to another kid, again that kid is likely to be asymptomatic, they will infect a family member, who will become symptomatic, then that family member is contact traced, the kid tests positive, and... voilà! Another child infected by their family, no school transmission!

This is a case of ""It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it"".

See, this is an *opinion* that I can respectfully disagree with you about. Most of the other comments on here are simply belligerent.

&gt; It presumes that every American is willing to get te vaccine which is a hugely wrong assumption and children are not yet approved. 

Actually I'm building this into my pessimism. 500M vaccines, at two doses a person, will only cover about three quarters of the population. I'm factoring in the people who will refuse or procrastinate on getting the vaccine when I calculate the rate, which I don't see getting above the current rate of 25M people every couple months, even with improved logistics and even a single dose vaccine eventually coming out.

&gt; So itll take probably another 200 or so days, whether or not America is even capable of achieving herd immunity remains to be seen

&gt;  
&gt;Posted January 29, 2021 1:26 pm   Updated January 29, 2021 9:31 pm      

We are a solid two weeks beyond that update.  

You will notice your article discusses the process of PHAC review of a manufacturers drug:

&gt;Health Canada has been reviewing [AstraZeneca](https://globalnews.ca/tag/astrazeneca/)  and Oxford University’s vaccine since it was submitted for approval on  Oct. 1 as more and more data has arrived from the manufacturer.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The agency said it is in the midst of reviewing final data, but suggested it could be greenlit sooner than later.**

ANd what is being inferred and is unsupported is that J&amp;J has continued to provide the final data to PHAC.

&gt; The delivery news has somewhat overshadowed the [positive vaccine development with Johnson &amp; Johnson (Janssen)](https://globalnews.ca/news/7607245/johnson-johnson-vaccine-trial-data/),  which reported its vaccine is good at preventing people from being  hospitalized or dying from COVID-19.

The CDC is **not** saying schools *can* and *should* re-open at all. They are saying they *should* re-open **if your county meets their criteria**, and I guarantee almost none do.

If you don't believe me, then actually read the CDC's website and look it up yourself. 

Here are the guidelines:
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/indicators.html

1. ""Total new cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days**"" has to be less than 50.
2. ""Percentage of NAATs that are positive in the past 7 days***"" has to be less than 8%.

I say ""has to"" because it says you should pick the highest level and if it's orange or red, that you should not be opening schools beyond at least hybrid: ""*If the two indicators suggest different levels, the actions corresponding to the higher threshold should be chosen. County-level data on total new cases in the past 7 days and test percent positivity are available on the County View tab in CDC’s COVID Data Tracker.""

From here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/operation-strategy.html

""Success in preventing COVID-19 in schools begins with and is connected to preventing transmission in communities. Schools and communities must implement a layered approach that adheres to multiple mitigation strategies and adjust them as needed to reduce COVID-19 risk for students, teachers, school staff, families, and the community. **In areas of low or moderate community transmission, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools is low when consistent use of layered mitigation strategies is in place.**"" (emphasis mine... low or moderate = not orange or red) 

Further down on this [page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/operation-strategy.html) (halfway point, roughly) has information about returning to school based on the levels (blue/yellow/orange/red). That additionally points to hybrid / 100% virtual learning for areas with orange/red levels of spread. They also think you should **cancel sports and make them virtual** if your county is in the red.

The CDC also has a county-level data lookup that you can use to find your county and see if it meets the criteria:
https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view

Our county is over 4x the red level for new cases and over the red positivity threshold, too. **I believe most counties would fail this test in the new cases over 7 days per 100k people.**

Finally, I want to say, please stop saying ""the other side"". I'm not on any side other than I'm trying to make an informed decision based on the data and science; not based on what reporters, politicians, or anyone else says.

I want schools to open but opening them too soon is going to prolong this nightmare.

There is beginning to be a problem with moving goalposts related to the above, as well. Teachers in my local area are now pushing back against going into classrooms until they are vaccinated... AND schools have massive overhauls to HVAC systems, comprehensive on-site testing, and other expensive measures.

And if you look at the data coming out of Israel regarding efficacy of the vaccine it seems entirely unnecessary to implement these additional measures for teacher safety.

It's not a ""gotcha."" I'm using it to point out a major philosophical difference that separates us. You seem to think that the question is simply one of ""follow the science"" -- i.e. it's purely a technical question of whether social distancing works, whether masks work, etc., and all those Dutch protesters are simply stupid luddites who don't believe in science.  I'm saying that the merits of the science are secondary because the core issue is our ethical values in how we view life and death, risk and liberty. Every day we choose to risk premature death in the name of freedom.  According to the WHO, every year 3 million people die of sexually transmitted disease -- why don't we ban sex unless people show proof of an STD test? Alcohol kills 1.9 million per year -- why don't we ban alcohol? Physical inactivity kills 2 million per year -- why don't we ban elevators and escalators?  Tobacco kills 5.4 million per year -- why don't we ban cigarettes?  By comparison, COVID19 killed 2 million in 2020 and mostly very old people who were about to die anyway, yet we're happy to do radical things like ban travel, employment, education, social contact, etc.   Who gets to impose that value judgement?",,,1613187305,{},gn4wglo,False,t3_lil34a,False,True,t1_gn4t0m8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lil34a/new_allegations_of_coverup_by_cuomo_over_nursing/gn4wglo/,1613187539,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This vaccine is against the original covid 19 and only softens the symptoms. Does not prevent or make you safe from catching it. (2) if you want to bring in the survival rate into the conversation, covid 19 survival rate is quite high among those in general healthy shape already. The small percentage points these vaccines help with hardly make a difference. (3) blaming people for an almost natural biological virus seems very counter productive. If you look at the world in general I would have to say people have been trying hard enough to be better and more careful how they operate day to day.

All in all I would say if you feel the need to receive the vaccine for your safety because you feel it would benefit you then do it.

[],,chilladipa,,,[],,,,text,t2_6z8harzu,False,False,[],"LONDON (Reuters) - The coronavirus variant first found in the British region of Kent is a concern because it could undermine the protection given by vaccines against developing COVID-19, the head of the UK's genetic surveillance programme said.

She also said the variant was dominant in the country and was likely ""to sweep the world, in all probability"".

The coronavirus has killed 2.35 million people and turned normal life upside down for billions, but a few new worrying variants out of thousands have raised fears that vaccines will need to be tweaked and people may require booster shots.

Sharon Peacock, director of the COVID-19 Genomics UK consortium, said vaccines were so far effective against the variants in the United Kingdom, but that mutations could potentially undermine the shots.

""What's concerning about this is that the 1.1.7. variant that we have had circulating for some weeks and months is beginning to mutate again and get new mutations which could affect the way that we handle the virus in terms of immunity and effectiveness of vaccines,"" Peacock told the BBC.

""It's concerning that the 1.1.7., which is more transmissible, which has swept the country, is now mutating to have this new mutation that could threaten vaccination.""

That new mutation, first identified in Bristol in southwest England, has been designated a ""Variant of Concern"", by the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group.

There are so far 21 cases of that variant which has E484K mutation, which occurs on the spike protein of the virus, the same change as has been seen in South African and Brazilian variants.

""One has to be a realist that this particular mutation has arisen in our kind of communal garden lineage now, at least five times - five separate times. And so this is going to keep popping up,"" Peacock said.

There are three major known variants that are worrying scientists: The South African variant, known by scientists as 20I/501Y.V2 or B.1.351; the so-called UK or Kent variant, known as 20I/501Y.V1 or B.1.1.7; and and a Brazilian variant known as B.1.1.28(K417N/E484K/N501Y)or P.1.

The British variant, which is more infectious but not necessarily more deadly than others, was likely ""to sweep the world"", Peacock said.

""Once we get on top of (the virus) or it mutates itself out of being virulent - causing disease - then we can stop worrying about it. But I think, looking in the future, we're going to be doing this for years. We're still going to be doing this 10 years down the line, in my view.""

""were going to""? So they didn't?
Literally the majority of the world's countries are exempt from the EU's ""export controls"" to begin with (e.g. Israel). ""Export controls"" meaning vaccine manufacturers have to declare to the EU when they export and the EU has to give approval. So far the EU has approved all shipments, including shipments to the US and the UK while both of those aren't exporting back.
If you think ""global camaraderie"" broke down it's not the EU you should be pointing fingers at.

I know if I start to feel ill, I will mask up out of respect, to not spread a flu, or even a common cold to others.

Canada is just getting out of the supply disruption from Pfizer where it had 1 week of receiving 0 doses followed by 2 weeks of receiving only 20% of what it was originally scheduled to.  Pfizer is making these doses up to Canada in the coming weeks, but it is why Canada's vaccination rates absolutely fell off a cliff in late January and early February.

Now, when Pfizer originally announced the supply disruption due to the Belgium Plant upgrade, they announced it that every country that was relying on that plant was going to be affected equally, with roughly a 50% drop in shipments.  That's what Canada was told, that's what EU was told, and that's what individual EU countries were told and reported that their shipments were due to drop 50% for the next 3-4 weeks.   EU quickly took up the phone to Pfizer and immediately, Pfizer sent out a release saying that EU would only be afffected for just over a week.  In fact, EU saw a disruption for about 2 weeks, of about 10-12%, while Canada saw a much worse supply disruption than originally forecast by Pfizer.   Now, what do you think that phone call consisted of to Pfizer that got them to change their tune so quickly that basically made the disruption so much worse for countries like Canada and Mexico, but so much better for the EU?   I don't think it's hard to come to the conclusion that threats of export controls were brought up, especially when they went public with such threats when AstraZeneca did not (likely because they couldn't) alter course to make up for it's Q1 shortfall.  I understand the EU's position, and don't blame them too harshly for it, but I think it's naive to not think that the size of Canada's Pfizer disruption wasn't very much caused by EU's threat to enact export controls.

Also, Moderna is having trouble getting components from the EU to it's/Lonza's Swiss plants due to the export controls as it is trying to ramp up production, and is the reason for it's supply shortfalls in February (to everyone except the US).

[],,sweetcletus,,,[],,,,text,t2_4cvkt4pl,False,False,[],"Alright, I'm not fond of anti maskers but you seem honestly wrong as opposed to just being an asshole.  First, I never said masks only protect others, I said they primarily protect others. They absolutely offer some protection to the wearer, they're just better at protecting other people. And the reason they work is because of droplet transmission. Even in a virus capable of being transmitted via aerosol, you still have far more viruses in a droplet. If, as the suspicion is with covid (not yet confirmed because it takes a ton of time to confirm something like this), there is a threshold initial viral load that has to be crossed to give someone the disease then any reduction in the virus that is getting out will decrease the risk to others. And if you don't want to see studies then just consider the relative masking rates of various countries around the world. Higher rates of masking tends to inversely correlate to number of cases. Correlation isn't necessarily causation, but it can be a strong indicator. As to removing masks, the virus isn't just floating in the space behind the mask. Its in the fabric. So don't lick it, but touch transmission has never been shown to be a strong vector covid so just touching your mask is highly unlikely to give you covid. And that isn't magic, it's just how things work. Small particles tend to get stuck in fabric, especially in moist environments, like your breath.

And as to your first point, which is the most worrying. Just because I trust the scientist doesn't mean I'm not thinking for myself. If I go to a mechanic and they tell me that I need new spark plugs then there is a decent chance I'll need new spark plugs. I wont take it as gospel right away. But that expert opinion is a factor. A big one. After a google search about spark plugs and checking some reviews of the busines I would probably follow their advice, assuming that the google search and reviews aligned with what they are saying. In this case, the scientific community has provided evidence. It has been peer reviewed (equivalent to checking online reviews), and it jives with the information I have found regarding masking as well as my own knowledge of microbiology. I did not jump straight to a goddamned thing. There is this worrying supposition among anti maskers that thinking for yourself only means disagreeing with the scientific consensus. But a knee jerk reaction to be arbitrarily contrary to the common knowledge is just as reactionary as you claim accepting the common knowledge to be. Just spouting ""think for yourself"" every time someone with a PhD details carefully constructed research does not make you a free thinker. Or brave. It usually just makes you wrong. So I have critically thought of the situation around masks. I'm a grad student and I was taking pathogenic microbiology last semester. We literally had assignments on stopping viral transmission, I read the papers, I even did experiments. And there was no masking involved. I also work in biotech with human cell culture. One of the worst outcomes for one of our processes is if a virus made it into one of our cultures. So guess what we do to stop that. We wear masks. And why do we do that? Because it works. 

And finally, I know you're not saying heart disease is transmissible. But comparing a chronic (often) lifestyle based disease to an infectious disease simply does not work. Yeah, heart disease is concerning. Yes, we should do something to combat it. But I can't do anything to fight the heart disease pandemic except try and educate people.

### Summary

**What is already known about this topic?**

Universal masking is recommended to slow the spread of COVID-19. Cloth masks and medical procedure masks substantially reduce exposure from infected wearers (source control) and reduce exposure of uninfected wearers (wearer exposure).

**What is added by this report?**

CDC conducted experiments to assess two ways of improving the fit of medical procedure masks: fitting a cloth mask over a medical procedure mask, and knotting the ear loops of a medical procedure mask and then tucking in and flattening the extra material close to the face. Each modification substantially improved source control and reduced wearer exposure.

**What are the implications for public health?**

These experiments highlight the importance of good fit to maximize mask performance. There are multiple simple ways to achieve better fit of masks to more effectively slow the spread of COVID-19.",,,1613236039,{},gn8u5f2,True,t3_lj4g34,False,True,t3_lj4g34,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lj4g34/maximizing_fit_for_cloth_and_medical_procedure/gn8u5f2/,1613239289,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
