The association is so strong even Trump and all his family getting the vaccine early can't break their belief.

I also see a lot of the ""gym tribe"" folks refusing. They've so bought into this identity of strong mind and body through diet and exercise to the exclusion of anything else medicine or science might say. As a gym goer myself we joke about it being a cult, but it really is when you think bigger muscles or better cut is the only solution you need to any problem in your life.

There's also the general ""contrarian tribe"", which I see a lot among professors and intellectuals.

Only fear of the Delta variant appears to be pushing some off the fence.

When the pandemic hit, Baxter Regional became a vaccine distribution center and inoculated 5,500 people. But only half of its 1,800 staff members accepted shots, according to Jonny Harvey, its occupational health coordinator. By early June, demand had tapered off so much that the hospital was administering an average of one a day.
Now, Mr. Harvey said, he is ordering enough vaccine to deliver 30 shots a day because people are increasingly anxious of the Delta variant. “I hate that we are having the surge,” he said. “But I do like that we are vaccinating people.”

At the state’s only academic medical center in Little Rock, run by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, vaccines are also suddenly more popular. Over a recent two-week period, the share of the hospital’s staff who are vaccinated jumped to 86 percent from 75 percent.

But those encouraging signs are outweighed by the soaring number of Covid-19 patients. On Saturday, the Little Rock hospital held 51 patients, more than at any point since Feb. 2. In April, there was one coronavirus death. In June, there were six.

Dr. Williams, who has been charting the coronavirus’s trajectory, said the rise in infections and hospitalizations mirrored what he saw in October. And there are other troubling signs.

A larger share of those who are now becoming infected, he said, need hospitalization. And once there, Dr. Steppe Mette, the chief executive of the Little Rock hospital, said, they appeared to need a higher level of care than those who were sickened by the original variant. That is despite the fact that they are younger.

The average age of a coronavirus patient in Arkansas has dropped by nearly a decade since December — from 63 to 54 — a reflection of the fact that three-fourths of older Arkansans are at least partly vaccinated. But some patients at the Little Rock hospital are in their 20s or 30s.
“It’s really discouraging to see younger, sicker patients,” Dr. Mette said. “We didn’t see this degree of illness earlier in the epidemic.”
Young, pregnant coronavirus patients were once rare at the hospital. But recently, four or five of them ended up in intensive care. Three were treated with a machine called ECMO — short for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation — a step some consider a last resort after ventilators fail. The machine routes blood from the body and into equipment that adds oxygen, then pumps it back into the patient.

Ashton Reed, 25, a coordinator in a county prosecutor’s office, was about 30 weeks pregnant when she arrived at the hospital on May 26, critically ill. To save her life, doctors delivered her baby girl by emergency cesarean section, then hooked her up to the ECMO machine.


In a public service announcement later urging vaccination, her husband said she went from sinus trouble to life support in 10 days.
“I almost died,” she said. “My thoughts have definitely changed on the vaccine.”
Last month, the hospital had to reopen a coronavirus ward it had closed in late spring. On Monday, it reopened a second.
Many of the nurses there wore colorful stickers announcing they were vaccinated. Ashley Ayers, 26, a traveling nurse from Dallas, did not. Noting that vaccine development typically took years, she said she worried that the shot might impair her fertility — even though there is no evidence of that.
“I just think it was rushed,” she said.
David Deutscher, 49, one of her patients for nearly a week, is no longer a holdout. A heating and air conditioning specialist and Air Force veteran, he said he fought Covid for 10 days at home before he went to the hospital with a 105-degree fever.

The experience has shaken him to his core. He dissolved into tears describing it, apologizing for being an emotional wreck.

When he failed to improve with monoclonal antibody treatment, he said, “that was probably the most scared I have ever been.” He called a friend, the daughter of a medical researcher, from his hospital bed. “Please don’t let me die,” he said.

He said he never got vaccinated because he figured a mask would suffice. In the past 21 years, he has had the flu once.

“Once I started feeling better,” Mr. Deutscher said, “I got on the phone and I just starting calling everybody to tell them to go get that vaccine.” He did not even wait to be discharged.

The coronavirus “is no joke,” he told his friends. Three of them got a shot.

MOUNTAIN HOME, Ark. — When the boat factory in this leafy Ozark Mountains city offered free coronavirus vaccinations this spring, Susan Johnson, 62, a receptionist there, declined the offer, figuring she was protected as long as she never left her house without a mask.

Linda Marion, 68, a widow with chronic pulmonary disease, worried that a vaccination might actually trigger Covid-19 and kill her. Barbara Billigmeier, 74, an avid golfer who retired here from California, believed she did not need it because “I never get sick.”

Last week, all three were patients on 2 West, an overflow ward that is now largely devoted to treating Covid-19 at Baxter Regional Medical Center, the largest hospital in north-central Arkansas. Mrs. Billigmeier said the scariest part was that “you can’t breathe.” For 10 days, Ms. Johnson had relied on supplemental oxygen being fed to her lungs through nasal tubes.

Ms. Marion said that at one point, she felt so sick and frightened that she wanted to give up. “It was just terrible,” she said. “I felt like I couldn’t take it.”

Yet despite their ordeals, none of them changed their minds about getting vaccinated. “It’s just too new,” Mrs. Billigmeier said. “It is like an experiment.”

While much of the nation tiptoes toward normalcy, the coronavirus is again swamping hospitals in places like Mountain Home, a city of fewer than 13,000 people not far from the Missouri border. A principal reason, health officials say, is the emergence of the new, far more contagious variant called Delta, which now accounts for more than half of new infections in the United States.

The variant has highlighted a new divide in America, between communities with high vaccination rates, where it causes hardly a ripple, and those like Mountain Home that are undervaccinated, where it threatens to upend life all over again. Part of the country is breathing a sigh of relief; part is holding its breath.

While infections rose in more than half the nation’s counties last week, those with low vaccination rates were far more likely to see bigger jumps. Among the 25 counties with the sharpest increases in cases, all but one had vaccinated under 40 percent of residents, and 16 had vaccinated under 30 percent, a New York Times analysis found.

Rising Cases in Low Vaccinated Counties
Low vaccinated counties are increasingly likely to have spikes in coronavirus cases, four times as likely as counties where at least half the population is fully vaccinated. Chart shows percent of counties each week that had an increase of at least 10 cases per 100,000.

Least vaccinated counties had less than 30 percent of residents vaccinated, most vaccinated had vaccination rate of at least 50 percent. Case numbers are based on rolling 7-day averages to smooth anomalies.
By The New York Times

In Baxter County, where the hospital is, fewer than a third of residents are fully vaccinated — below both the state and the national averages. Even fewer people are protected in surrounding counties that the hospital serves.

“It’s absolutely flooded,” said Dr. Rebecca Martin, a pulmonologist, as she made the rounds of 2 West one morning last week.

In the first half of June, the hospital averaged only one or two Covid-19 patients a day. On Thursday, 22 of the unit’s 32 beds were filled with coronavirus patients. Five more were in intensive care. In a single week, the number of Covid patients had jumped by one-third.
Overall, Arkansas ranks near the bottom of states in the share of population that is vaccinated. Only 44 percent of residents have received at least one shot.

“Boy, we’ve tried just about everything we can think of,” a retired National Guard colonel, Robert Ator, who runs the state’s vaccination effort, said in an interview. For about one in three residents, he said, “I don’t think there’s a thing in the world we could do to get them to get vaccinated.”

For that, the state is paying a price. Hospitalizations have quadrupled since mid-May. More than a third of patients are in intensive care. Deaths, a lagging indicator, are also expected to rise, health officials said.

Dr. José R. Romero, the state health director, said he still believed enough Arkansans were vaccinated, or immune from having contracted Covid-19, that the “darkest days” of December and January were behind them. “What I’m concerned about now is we’ll have a rise or surge,” he said, “then winter is going to add another surge, so we’re going to have a surge on top of a surge.”

Dr. Mark Williams, the dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, said the Delta variant was upending his projections for the pandemic. It is spreading through the state’s unvaccinated population “at a very fast rate,” he said, and threatens to strain the ability of hospitals to cope. “I would say we have definitely hit the alarming stage,” he said.

At Baxter Regional, many doctors and nurses are girding for another wave while still exhausted from battling the pandemic they thought had abated.

“I started having flashbacks, like PTSD,” said Dr. Martin, the pulmonologist, who obsesses over her patients’ care. “This is going to sound very selfish but unfortunately it’s true: The fact that people won’t get vaccinated means I can’t go home and see my kids for dinner.”

The Biden administration has pledged to help stem outbreaks by supplying Covid-19 tests and treatments, promoting vaccines with advertising campaigns and sending community health workers door to door to try to persuade the hesitant.

But not all those tactics are welcome. Dr. Romero said Arkansas would happily accept more monoclonal antibody therapies, a Covid-19 treatment often used in outpatient settings. But Mr. Ator, the vaccine coordinator, said door-knocking “would probably do more harm than good,” given residents’ suspicions of federal intentions.

Both said the Arkansas public had been saturated with vaccine promotions and incentives, including free lottery tickets, hunting and fishing licenses and stands offering shots at state parks and high school graduation ceremonies.

The last mass vaccination event was May 4, when the Arkansas Travelers, a minor-league baseball team, had its first game since the pandemic hit. Thousands gathered at the stadium in Little Rock to watch. Fourteen accepted shots.
Even health care workers have balked. Statewide, only about 40 percent are vaccinated, Dr. Romero said.
In April, the state legislature added yet another roadblock, making it essentially illegal for any state or local entity, including public hospitals, to require coronavirus vaccination as a condition of education or employment until two years after the Food and Drug Administration fully licenses a shot. That almost certainly means no such requirements can be issued until late in 2023.",,,,1626557137,{},h5k3c1c,False,t3_omcpwz,False,False,t3_omcpwz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/omcpwz/how_covid19_has_upended_life_in_undervaccinated/h5k3c1c/,1626716273,71,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_aq0qaj78,False,True,,

This means that they have extremely high vaccination levels at the &gt;50 age brackets, but essentially no immunity at the lower age brackets. So when things reopened, there were plenty of naive hosts still waiting to be infected in the lower age groups. Compare this to the US, for example, where there were age-based restrictions when supplies were constrained, but then embarked on a more heterogenous 'come and get it' approach. The differences are reflected in how peoples' social networks tend to interact - if you're 60, you're probably not out raging with 25 year olds at the pub, you're probably mostly spending significant amounts of time around other 60 year old people, excluding any younger individuals that you live with/care for - in the UK, this means 60 year olds are hanging around with other immune 60 year olds and that immunity isn't providing much protection for the 25 year olds that are all raging at the pub. In the US, people in the lower age brackets were able to get vaccinated earlier, meaning that you had heterogenous immunity and so it's harder for chains of transmission to start.""

&gt;Can governments require vaccinations?

&gt;People are often surprised to learn that states would likely have the legal right to enforce such a rule.

&gt;In the 1905 landmark case Jacobson v. Massachusetts, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a state criminal law that required all adult inhabitants of Cambridge to get a smallpox vaccine or be fined. The Supreme Court explained that an individual’s liberty rights under the U.S. Constitution are not absolute and the mandatory vaccination law was necessary to promote public health and safety.

She said she wouldn't get vaccinated at all but is conflicted because during the school year she occasionally works with immunocompromised children. She said she will not work at all if she decides to not get vaccinated. So, she believes they work and that COVID is real, which is a start, I guess.

The idea is that while there will certainly be some loosening of border restrictions after we get a high level of vaccinations, there will still be a lot of limits at the border.  

We know the expect to keep some form of MIQ (managed border quarantine) in place for 4-5 years.  I expect that it will be for the unvaccinated and/or vaccinated people from high risk countries and people who test positive on arrival in NZ.  

For vaccinated people from low-risk countries they'll likely be allowed into NZ with a negative test to get on the plane and probably an instant test on arrival in NZ.  But they'll be required to use our tracer app and the govt will still use contact tracing and managed quarantine to prevent any big outbreaks.  That's basically how we manage the Australian bubble right now (with the exception of requiring vaccination), so it makes sense that's the model going forward.  

I do think the comparison to 9/11 was unhelpful because that additional security is over the top for a relatively minor threat, at least for NZ.

Knowing it was normal and ok though helped me a lot. I just slept it off and wasn't concerned about reactions or bad things happening.

I think UK is operating on the assumption covid is going to be endemic and seasonal like the flu (we've seen evidence of the latter) and therefore with deltas HIT being so much higher, and needing far more of the population vaccinated to achieve herd immunity than can be achieved with current demographics the vaccine is approved in and voluntary uptake levels seen (around 90% of the population is required) it makes more sense to try and have the peak in the summer to build up some further level of immunity across the country (mostly in the unvaccinated cohorts) as quickly as possible. 

The other option would be to stem the tide with mandated lockdowns or NPIs like _increased masking_ which of course are sensible precautions to limiting spread.  however relaxation of these NPIS would have to occur at _some_ point and if this is done closer to winter (inevitably that will occur anyway especially closer to Christmas independently of the rules) where  transmissibility increases,  coupled with some level of waning immunity and the potential but likely burden of other respiratory illnesses like influenza ;  together these may be a factor that aids in overwhelming hospitals. 

Therefore the more immunity (from vaccinates and natural infection)  is built up prior to then, the better. UK just ripping the band-aid off faster than Singapore, so to speak.

There’s a lot of antivax speakers who know enough science to sound convincing but not enough to stand up to scrutiny. People who will misrepresent the results of scientific studies to make it seem like their claims are supported.

I’ve gotten video forwards from anti-vax acquaintances. Having taken a college biology class it’s immediately obvious to me that none of the arguments really make sense, but if you haven’t I could totally see how people become convinced. Arguments about mRNA changing your DNA and modifying your protein production (not really, it’s a recipe for creating proteins) or about how adjuvants make your body attack what it sees and how the vaccine has proteins similar to reproductive organs (again, sort of sounds right if you don’t realize that many proteins are similar and that small differences vastly change the function, also ignoring the fact that COVID has these same proteins)

I’ve tried going through these with people and debunking one by one but it usually ends up with something along the lines of “You’re probably right, but I’d rather be safe and not risk it” which I can understand but that basically boils down to not properly assigning the risk of contracting the virus.",,,,1626504615,{},h5hpcq7,False,t3_oljjeu,False,True,t1_h5fkk7h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oljjeu/us_facing_pandemic_of_the_unvaccinated_cdc_warns/h5hpcq7/,1626668841,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_3z4kr,False,False,,

What? Do you have a source on that?  I have literally never heard about that because

1. local companies can't just buy vaccines.  Vaccine makers only deal with government because there are liabilities.  Taiwan also cannot legally import vaccines from China, which is why it is so important to get certification that it will be shipped directly from Germany.
2. It was the other way around, where Biontech was about to complete a deal with Taiwan, but China/Fosun stepped in last minute to strike it down.

In that Pubmed link I gave before literally dozens of peer-reviewed published papers showing positive effects of IVM are listed. The claim was also made that removing this study from the meta-analysis studies removes any positive effects for IVM. This is incorrect since just looking at the peer-reviewed published papers they overwhelmingly show a positive effect.

 You don’t have to believe me on this. Take a look at a random selection of, say, 10 of the peer-reviewed published papers listed here:

*Linda Marion, 68, a widow with chronic pulmonary disease, worried that a vaccination might actually trigger Covid-19 and kill her. Barbara Billigmeier, 74, an avid golfer who retired here from California, believed she did not need it because “I never get sick.”*

*Last week, all three were patients on 2 West, an overflow ward that is now largely devoted to treating Covid-19 at Baxter Regional Medical Center, the largest hospital in north-central Arkansas. Mrs. Billigmeier said the scariest part was that “you can’t breathe.” For 10 days, Ms. Johnson had relied on supplemental oxygen being fed to her lungs through nasal tubes.*

*Ms. Marion said that at one point, she felt so sick and frightened that she wanted to give up. “It was just terrible,” she said. “I felt like I couldn’t take it.”*

*Yet despite their ordeals, none of them changed their minds about getting vaccinated. “It’s just too new,” Mrs. Billigmeier said. “It is like an experiment.”*

The Portuguese Prime Minister, António Costa, announced Saturday that Portugal will triple the supply of vaccines to Portuguese-speaking African countries (PALOP) and East Timor, from one to three million doses.

At the final press conference after the closing of the 13th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries (CPLP), António Costa recalled that Portugal had committed to offer 5% of the total vaccines, but the latest accounts allow to make available four times more.

In the case of PALOP countries and East Timor, ""we will triple and increase from one million to three million the number of vaccines to be distributed. According to what is the calculation that we have of vaccines that we will be able to make available"" it will be possible to donate ""a total of four million vaccines.

&gt; Los Angeles County recorded more than 1,900 new coronavirus cases Friday, another major jump, as a mandatory mask restriction for inside public places takes effect Saturday night.

&gt; Over the last week, L.A. County has reported an average of more than 1,000 new coronavirus cases a day — a tally that, though merely a fraction of the sky-high counts seen during previous surges, is still six times as high as what the county was seeing in mid-June.

&gt; Daily case numbers have jumped: 1,537 new cases were reported Thursday, and 1,902 more were added Friday.

&gt; COVID-19 hospitalizations also doubled over that same time period, from 223 on June 15 to 462 on Thursday. More than 8,000 coronavirus-positive patients were hospitalized countywide during the darkest days of the winter wave.

&gt; Requiring masks for all, officials said, provides even more protection to those who are vaccinated while simultaneously ensuring that unvaccinated people can no longer skirt indoor face covering requirements.

&gt; Each infection prevented, experts say, is one less chance for the coronavirus to mutate in potentially dangerous ways — as happened with the Delta variant.

&gt; Under the county’s order, effective 11:59 p.m. Saturday, masks will be required to be worn in all indoor public settings, such as theaters, stores, gyms, offices and workplaces, and in restaurants when not eating and drinking. Those exempted include children younger than 2.

&gt; Public indoor spaces will be affected, such as theaters, stores, public venues and shopping malls. The mask rules will essentially revert to what they were before the county lifted them for the June 15 reopening.

Vaccinations were rising. Health-care workers who had been fighting the coronavirus for months felt relieved—perhaps even hopeful. 

&gt; Then, in late May, cases started ticking up again. By July, the surge was so pronounced that “it took the wind out of everyone,” Erik Frederick, the chief administrative officer of Mercy Hospital Springfield, told me. “How did we end up back here again?”

&gt; The hospital is now busier than at any previous point during the pandemic. In just five weeks, it took in as many COVID-19 patients as it did over five months last year.

For example a fully vaccinated navy crew (mRNA) has more than 100 cases onboard 

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-57830617

Also evaluation of a super spreader event in Texas 

Findings Viral sequencing revealed 6 vaccinated patients were infected with the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant. With no histories of vaccine breakthrough, this suggests Delta variant may possess immune evasion in patients that received the Pfizer BNT162b2, Moderna mRNA-1273, and Covaxin BBV152.

Meaning Delta variant may pose the highest risk out of any currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, with increased transmissibility over Alpha variant and possible vaccine breakthrough.

Then any theories of a lab leak were supressed by Peter Daszak and his little virology crew who were directly involved in the WIV and its research. 

Then investigations were further hampered by the US government itself, because of its funding of the WIV through eco health alliance  (Peter Daszak again) 

Then when an investigative team was finally sent to WIV, it was self sabotaged with the goal of the investigation ""to find the cause of the natural leak of covid"" (Paraphrasing, not exact wording) 

There was plenty of time to cover up or destroy any evidence to a lab-leak, and even then we still have evidence.

Heart inflammation is incredibly rare as a side effect. It’s hard to overstate just how rare it is. Even so, it’s mostly mild cases and self resolving. Fun fact, viral infections cause peri/myocarditis, and they do so at much much higher rates than the shots, and guess what covid is… (I believe one study showed that over half of all hospitalized covid patients had myocarditis, and one university saw that over 10% of their students infected with covid had signs of it). The shot currently has something like 0.0006% incidence of it (correct me if I’m wrong, napkin math and googling). 

——

There are extremely few “legitimate fears” at this point. 

What it boils down to is a cognitive bias and fundamental failings in understanding statistics. 

When you get a covid vaccine, that’s an intentional choice. So should you (and you almost definitely won’t) develop a rare side effect, then it was “your fault” you made the “wrong” choice (you didn’t). You shouldn’t have gotten it, it’s your fault!! 

And there’s the bias. 

If you catch covid, then… well… c’est la vie. No control, it just happened. It’s natural. Not *your* fault. Besides, you probably won’t catch covid anyway and if you do, you’ll be fine, it has something like a 99.8% survival rate for your group, right? That’s basically 100%, and long term effects and issues? More like shomg-perm bebbects. 

It’s this fundamental disconnect between the [comparatively] insanely high odds of having a bad covid case or long term health effects but it being involuntary, and the incredibly remote -but possible- chance that the vaccine might harm you, but you made that choice and you could’ve avoided it if you didn’t get the shot. 

That’s what “rational” “legitimate” fears boil down to these days. 

And I get that it’s very hard to get past that for some people. It’s hard to take something like that in your own hands, especially if you’re terrified of rolling a 1 on your 15,000,000 sided dice. 

There’s also the “oh I won’t catch it” mentality, which aids in the above bias. But I mostly roll that into “oh I’ll be fine if I do get it, I’d never get a bad case” category. 

I understand there’s some political impetus (my body my choice, government/businesses shouldn’t mandate it etc etc), but that’s not a fear. That’s a political belief. And I don’t wanna touch on that as I’ve already written too much.

That rule isn’t really for vaccinated people. It’s safer and easier to tell everyone to wear a mask when you can’t distinguish between one person and another. 

Bottom line : The CDC doesn’t care if vaccinated people get covid. They’ve already said they aren’t tracking breakthroughs unless the breakthrough is hospitalized. 

As far as immunocompromised people go, “talk to your doctor” is far weaker than “wear a self-protective mask AND talk to your doctor” or something.

Now why people on public transport are worth protecting while the rest of us swing in the wind, I’ll never know.

Furthermore, Im not my father, I can tell you what he told me but in the end of the day its just what I remember. Im a completely different person in every aspect.

I have already tried to talk about this several times and it always ends in endless discussions.

My dad on the other hand is ultimately stronger when it comes to arguments on this topic. I wasnt joking when I said that he studies a lot in our national library. There you can find reports on anything, even the originals if you want. 

I mean my dad dont get rude about it, he never tried to convince me not to get vaccinated (well okay he said I should wait another 2-3 weeks in order to get the Pfizer vaccine) but thats it. He also mocks the covid conspiracy theorists, but thats it.

In terms of the financial toll, having a fully open nation covid free nation domestically has helped us continue largely as normal, and NZ has been doing well in that respect (I'd throw stats around if I had them on hand but I'm just winging this message, I know there are a number of articles to this effect out there in the digital wild). Also, currently New Zealand has very low unemployment. I actually quit my job and moved towns this year because I knew it would be OK (and I just got a new job this week).

In terms of the mental impact, while it would not be a positive experience working as a manager or owner in the international tourism sector right now, or to be far away from loved ones for a bit, that's offset by the wider positive mental situation throughout the nation where anxiety with regards to covid is low, it's not forefront of mind for most kiwis as (touch wood) we're living a covid free life. We're not giving ourselves anxiety disorders from this, by and large. I wouldn't be so sure that's not that case in many other corners of the world.

And then there's the medical elements, not just the death toll from covid but the long covid effects, which the longer this plays out, the worse the news gets. Which will have significant mental and financial impacts for those affected for years to come.

Most states that are publicly reporting data groups children ranging from 0 to 18(ish) years old (the upper range that states report varies from 14 to 20). In a report by the American Academy of Pediatrics  roughly 1 out of every 1000 covid death is a child. Of the regions (43 states. PR, G and NYC) that reported child mortality, there have been 344 deaths so far. However, there have also been over 16,600 child hospitalization in the 23 states that report the number. It's unclear how many of these children will surfer from long term chronic conditions as a result of their infection.

It is true that kids, so far, are far less likely to get a severe infection than adults. But it still was one of the top 10 causes of child mortality in 2020. Also newborns (&lt;1) are particularly vulnerable to the disease. Finally, keep in mind that in most states a minor needs parental consent to get the vaccine. There are likely children aged 12-18 who may want a vaccine but legally cannot get one.

Also, one of the concerns with the delta variant is that its more likely to result is hospitalization of younger patients than previous variants. So looking at historical data might underrepresent the current risk to children.

At this point, I could care less about the privileged adults who choose not to vaccinate. But their selfish actions endanger others and perpetuate the spread of this disease. The fact is that we have the ability to essentially eliminate the disease in the US.

[],,The-Smelliest-Cat,,,,,,[],"The Scotland wave hit earlier than the England wave, so here are some figures from that. 

- [Vaccination Status of new Cases / Hospital Admissions](https://imgur.com/a/DGHqFVk)
- [Case, Death, Hospital Admissions, and ICU Admission trends from wave to wave](https://i.imgur.com/XVc7qQA.jpg)
- [Vaccination uptake by age range](https://i.imgur.com/b4xgXJX.jpg) (the 100% figures will likely be in the high 90%s and not actually 100%, as the population figures used are a little out of date)
- [Case rates by age range](https://i.imgur.com/XlsJiBW.jpg)

Also no area is particularly near 90%. Those figures would just be for the adult (18+) population. The UK as a whole is at 69% coverage with the first dose and 53% coverage with both doses right now. 

And you can see from the chart above how high cases in under 18s have been. Its also worth noting that vaccinations for under 30s only opened a month or so ago, so most of the spikes for that range came in completely unvaccinated people. 

Anyways, the case peak was quite a bit higher this time around, yes. But its worth noting that we have almost no restrictions in place right now, and we are testing a bit more than in January, so its not really too bad considering that.

I think hospitalizations rose more than people were expecting them to. Obviously the vaccines have weakened the link between them and cases, but there was still a hefty increase. Thankfully they look to be peaking now.

A few hospitals did go into code black status, basically meaning they had no capacity left. But that was also in large part due to the fact that anyone who has come in close contact with a positive case needs to self isolate themselves for 10 days. With our number of cases, and the number of close contacts attached, it was a huge issue for staff in all professions.

The NHS here was operating near breaking point even before the pandemic. Now we're asking them to get back to that, deal with a moderate amount of covid cases, deal with a massive backlog, and also deal with low staff numbers due to the isolation requirements. All after an awful year and a half. Best of luck to them...

Then the link between cases and deaths looks even more weakened than the hospitalization link, but deaths do lag behind a bit more. We've seen some substantial increases in the past few days and that could probably go on for another week before starting to fall.

I think what we're seeing is that cases do still matter, but we've not lost all hope. The low transmission in the older age groups is a good sign, which will hopefully follow across to the younger age groups as we get higher second dose coverage there. 

The situation in Scotland is calming down now thankfully, but in England and the rest of the UK it is [still on the rise](https://i.imgur.com/etIPKaV.jpg). Scotland has traditionally had much smaller case rates than the rest of the UK at their peaks, so its hard to tell how bad things will get in England and elsewhere. They are benefitting from having higher natural immunity and also having their increase later into the pandemic (as more people are vaccinated).. but they are also essentially removing the last of their restrictions (including mask requirements) on Monday, so that won't help!",,,,1626476697,{},h5ge56p,False,t3_olbl51,False,False,t1_h5fwgrb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/olbl51/daily_discussion_thread_july_16_2021/h5ge56p/,1626642874,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_zqoqr,False,False,,

&gt; Not true. How many covid deaths would have otherwise been cancer or heart disease deaths?

It is true. You can look up the statistics yourself, but clearly you don't care to actually do that. Heart disease deaths increased YoY from 2019 and were in line with previous increases given a growing population and a continued obesity epidemic. Cancer deaths were also normal, they stayed about the same which is what one would expect - cancer deaths have been trending downward bc of better treatment, but COVID tied up so many medical resources it likely led to a small rise in cancer deaths too which evened it out.

…

&gt; Before this uptick, the last time Provincetown saw a positive COVID case was June 4.

&gt; “Provincetown has the highest vaccination rate in the state,” Cyr said, noting 114% of the eligible population is fully vaccinated.

…

&gt; Once you’ve reached a high vaccination number like Provincetown, Cyr said almost every new case will be seen as a “breakthrough.”

&gt; The majority of these new cases are from fully vaccinated individuals, “all of whom followed CDC guidelines.”

&gt; Vaccinated Provincetown visitors and community members who contracted COVID last week only reported mild symptoms, or have been outright asymptomatic.

&gt; With over half of Massachusetts population now fully vaccinated, Cyr said we’re reaching the point of “living with the virus.”

&gt; “This isn’t our first pandemic,” Cyr said referring to the AIDS epidemic that impacted the community. **He said residents have been paying close attention to CDC guidelines since the start of the pandemic.**

&gt;Among people 16 and older, only 41% of Black residents and 48% of Latino residents in L.A. County have received at least one shot; by contrast, 63% of white, 59% of Native American and 71% of Asian American residents are at least partially vaccinated. Countywide, 64% of residents in this age group have received at least one dose of vaccine.

&gt;The disparities are contributing to the increased chance of infection, hospitalization and death among Black and Latino residents from COVID-19. Black residents are now about twice as likely, and Latinos about 60% more likely, to be hospitalized with COVID-19 than white residents in L.A. County. Black and Latino residents also have roughly twice the risk of dying of COVID-19 than white residents in the county.

&gt;...

&gt;The disparities in vaccinations are particularly stark in the youngest age groups. Among adults in their 20s or younger, just 24% of Black and 37% of Latino residents have received at least one dose of vaccine; by comparison, 54% of white, 53% of Native American and 70% of Asian American residents in this age group have gotten at least one shot.

&gt;Among people 16 and older, only 41% of Black residents and 48% of Latino residents in L.A.

For vulnerable populations in CA, especially younger people, it's almost like living in one of the redder states for them. I wonder why considering the politics of the state. 

&gt;The disparities in vaccinations are particularly stark in the youngest age groups. Among adults in their 20s or younger, just 24% of Black and 37% of Latino residents have received at least one dose of vaccine; by comparison, 54% of white, 53% of Native American and 70% of Asian American residents in this age group have gotten at least one shot.

*Personal responsibility is the willingness to both accept the importance of standards that society establishes for individual behavior and to make strenuous personal efforts to live by those standards. But personal responsibility also means that when individuals fail to meet expected standards, they do not look around for some factor outside themselves to blame. The demise of personal responsibility occurs when individuals blame their family, their peers, their economic circumstances, or their society for their own failure to meet standards. The three areas of personal decision making in which the nation’s youth and young adults most need to learn and practice personal responsibility are education, sexual behavior and marriage, and work.*

The key point here being: ""**But personal responsibility also means that when individuals fail to meet expected standards, they do not look around for some factor outside themselves to blame.**""

Plus his argument doesn't make complete sense. I understand what he means, but natural immunity is not a static thing. It doesn't permanently inoculate the entire human race. Even if humanity naturally evolved immunity to COVID, there is no guarantee it will still be there a couple hundred years later. Ancient humans were probably immune to things that would reek havoc on us today if it were to reappear.

I also don't get why people think science is somehow unnatural. It's a technique developed over time by communication between millions of human brains.  As far as evolving ""strength"", intelligence and the scientific method have been the strongest traits ever developed in the history of life as we know it.

Humans aren't even the only animals to fight diseases by means other than just natural selection. Chimps groom each other, some fish form symbiotic bonds where they ""hire"" smaller species to clean them, and ants quickly remove the bodies of their dead from their colony to avoid infecting the entire thing. 

None of that will probably matter to your dad, but maybe framing the ability to create vaccines as an evolved human strength will help. Plus since he is into fighting climate change you could also argue that vaccines can help with that. Vaccinating a population uses a lot less energy than hospitalizing millions of people for days/weeks. Plus fighting climate change is a lot easier if we don't have to worry about catching a potentially fatal disease every time we interact with each other.

This a wrong assumption. The vaccine doesn't stop you getting covid, nor is that what it's supposed to do. The vaccine is only there to minimise the chance of serious illness if you do catch it. 

Of the 51k cases yesterday, there is no information yet on if those people were vaccinated or not. However, look at this report from a few days ago..

&gt; The report shows that 163 of the 257 people (63.4%) who died of the delta variant within 28 days of a positive COVID test between February 1 and June 21, had received at least one dose of the vaccine.

They’re still important findings, nonetheless. 

From the article:

&gt; A new U.K. study has found that children who are hospitalized with COVID-19 are significantly more likely than adults to develop rare neurological disorders.

&gt; The study, “Neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalised children and adolescents in the UK: a prospective national cohort study,” looked at 1,334 children and adolescents in England under the age of 18 who were hospitalized with COVID-19 between April 2020 and February 2021. It was led by researchers at the University of Liverpool, and published in The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health on Wednesday.

I may get downvoted for this. But I think there needs to be a conversation about it.

They say crazy, unture, or in worse cases, offensive shit all the time, and genuinely have very little empathy. With the two people I know, it's so bad that I kinda had to stop interacting with them because it was so toxic to be around. Then this is like the third or fourth person that I have seen since the pandemic started claiming to be a nurse and pulling this shit.

What's going on? Is the pressure of the job finally making people crack? Is thuer empathy in overdrive at their job that they either have none left to give/can't turn it off to see reason?

A mask mandate is equivalent to a shutdown for all indoor entertainment venues. Theaters, concert halls, gyms, dance clubs are all fucked.

Really the only businesses that will be okay are restaurants and bars, and only because they can effectively skirt the mandate since people are eating and drinking.

LA has essentially just announced the end of social recreation and culture. These venues that barely survived the first shutdown will not survive this one, which is indefinite and has no conceivable endpoint.

As said he loves to study in our national library, he loves data an statistics but also normative theories. 

In his opinion during a pandemic like this we should simply let the virus free so that humanity can fight it by itself. After the spanish flu he said humanity ultimately got stronger and wasnt hit as hard by the following influenca pandemics anymore. There are also a lot of.orher reasons why is convinced about this, but the most important point for him is this:

He is absolutely pissed by humanity that we dont fight climate change. Im not joking, he is. The fact that my country just got hit by the worst climate disaster since maybe ever (yeah the floodings in western europe) just made him more pissed.

He once told me about a theory which said that climate change is the worst doomsday scenario that could happen and that it is probably that nature will defend itself at one point because of the ""pressure"" we put on it. I dont remember the details, but its possible that one point deadly viruses will appear because nature will try to find its balance again.

So fighting the virus is useless and wrong in his eyes, because even more will appear in the future. (In his opinion)

Furthermore its useless to call him selfish etc because if you turn up in your suv (or fuel based car in general) and you call him this, he will probably laugh at you and call you selfish because you are the bigger threat.

And as said he also reads a lot normative theories and it makes him furious that the 1st world is fighting over vaccines meanwhile most of them dont care about hunger crisises etc. He often mentiobs the congo war in the 90s, 20 million people died (depends on the data) and nobody cared about it.

[They work really darn well](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lsuhzw/singledose_bnt162b2_vaccine_protects_against/), and are really darn [safe](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kcdn0b/natural_immunity_from_covid_is_not_safer_than_a/).

Check out this 
[great article about how unlikely it is for ""long term"" side effects from the vaccines to show up a few months or years later.](https://www.chop.edu/news/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine)

The J&amp;J vaccine manufacturing mixup that you heard about [isn't a problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/mhhf8x/johnson_johnson_statement_on_us_covid19_vaccine/) There are no tainted or flawed doses from J&amp;J being distributed, all our doses of J&amp;J came from a different manufacturer in the Netherlands and are both safe and effective.

Vaccines given EUA are safe even if you hear about [clotting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mh39g4/blood_clots_and_the_az_vaccine_revisited/) or [growing a third arm.](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/04/get-ready-for-false-side-effects)

That the vaccine manufacturers are not liable (you can't sue them, etc.) if you die from their Covid vaccine is a [logical error], that's [true of all vaccines, and really, most medical practices/drugs/etc.]  They just have to warn you about potential risks, [which they actually do a good job of, even though those risks are miniscule.]  Note that this would also be the case (you can't sue them if it hurts you) for any future ""cures"", therapeutics, or other treatments for the disease. 

The vaccine isn't killing anyone. You heard wrong.  Great discussion [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/oc45h0/scientists_quit_journal_board_protesting_grossly/) 

Clotting is so rare from the vaccine and so common from the virus, it's basically not worth talking about.

Should we be excited about a vaccine [that's not 90%+ effective?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lv3h8e/daily_discussion_thread_march_01_2021/gpbwgkf/) Excellent question!

There’s no such thing as vaccine side effects that take [months or years before they start to show up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k96ng0/how_is_it_possible_to_create_a_safe_and_effective/gfldup9/) If there [is](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lxfna2/daily_discussion_thread_march_04_2021/gpoqzl6/) a side effect, [it usually shows up right away.](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2017/0615/p786.html)  Thousands of phase 2 trial participants have had the vaccine for over 12 months, and there are [no worrying, lingering, or delayed side effects.](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/covid-19-vaccine-myths-debunked)

Immunity from infection lasts [*at least 8 months*](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/koxkm1/sarscov2_infection_induces_longlived_bone_marrow/), though [probably a lot longer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/klpvp7/sarscov2specific_t_cell_memory_is_longlasting_in/)  Again, [*at least* 8 months,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ldj06f/immunological_memory_to_sarscov2_assessed_for_up/) though non-antibody immunity may be most important.  It's too soon to say ""lifelong"" but [that is a possibility.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4nkco/the_immune_system_mounts_a_lasting_defense_after/) 

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l9nfu8/stable_neutralizing_antibody_levels_six_months/) probably a lot,[ lot longer,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/)  probably many years. It's looking like it'll be permanent or [semi-permanent in a good portion](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m1xbz4/sarscov2_mrna_vaccines_induce_a_robust_germinal/) of the population.

Vaccine induced immunity may be [comparable to](https://www.verywellhealth.com/antibodies-from-vaccines-and-from-natural-infection-5092564), or [better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l5whhu/increased_resistance_of_sarscov2_variants_b1351/), or a [LOT better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m8m23c/neutralizing_antibodies_against_sarscov2_variants/), immunity from a previous infection. Especially to [Alpha/Beta.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgxpre/vaccineinduced_immunity_provides_more_robust/) Natual immunity from clearing an infection is highly protective of future infections, but you have to risk the disease in order to get it. 

The OG SARS virus (SARS-CoV-1) from 2003 gave detectable immunity [both 6](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/12/7264) and [12 years later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kvbz9y/weekly_question_thread/gizs32j/)   

Vaccination and previous infection [reduce viral load, which reduces spread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s). Updated info [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ocygyp/vast_majority_of_breakthrough_infections_in/)

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) article does a good job of explaining the likelihood of vaccines *at least* reducing spread.  [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lf744r/daily_discussion_thread_february_08_2021/gml0gyi/) may help too. Data from [Scotland](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m3tx1n/covid19_vaccine_linked_to_a_reduction_in/). 

[""Moderna vaccine blocks &gt;90% (87-93%) of infections &amp; 91% (89-94%) of transmission.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmqfk4q/)

 This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a great reduction in ability to spread the virus. [Maybe even with just one dose!](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242) You should [get both doses though.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m2mtnv/immune_response_to_sarscov2_variants_of_concern/)

Reinfections are rare, some studies show [less than 1 in 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kyj0bx/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/) (maybe in the 1 in 10,000 range, you'll have to read the study, it's awesome).  Reinfections tend to be much milder than previous infections, even those new variants. Check the [comments here](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lm0mc2/prior_covid19_significantly_reduces_the_risk_of/) for some really interesting discussion regarding reinfection.

[Delayed second doses are fine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/layx6g/single_dose_administration_and_the_influence_of/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) At least with [ChAdOx1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), though there is evidence from the mRNA vaccine trials that suggest that up to 6 weeks is better if not at least acceptable. The problem is that you have to wait longer for the second dose, and therefore, full protection. [CDC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbiqne/daily_discussion_thread_february_03_2021/glvp1nl?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) used to say that there is no maximum interval between doses, but has recently changed. [Pfizer says not more than 6 weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/liakcb/covid19_vaccine_doses_shouldnt_be_more_than_six/). 

[Dose intervals might increase efficacy if extended past 3 or 4 weeks,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/mudvjd/questin_about_vaccine_intervals/gv58byt/) CDC says you have up to 42 days between doses (but that may be extended at some point).

Did you accidentally get mixed doses? [All good.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html)

Even if your antibodies fade over time, [you still have immunity.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/npeymo/sarscov2specific_memory_b_cells_can_persist_in/)

&gt;There once was a man who lived in a two story house.  The house was near a river and unfortunately the river began to flood. 

&gt;As the river rose, warnings were given via radio, TV and shortwave. Large jeeps drove through the area to evacuate people.  As a jeep drove by the man's house, he was told:

&gt;""You are in danger.  Your life is at stake.  You must evacuate.  Get in the Jeep.  Let us help you evacuate.""
&gt;""No,"" the man replied from his doorstep.  ""I have faith.  I will be ok.  The flood won't get me.  God will take care of me.""

&gt;The water continued to rise.

&gt;Soon the man was on the second floor.  A boat was going through the area and arrived at the man's house. Rescuers made every effort to convince the man to take action so that his life would be saved.

&gt;""You are in danger.  Your life is at stake.  You will drown in the flood.""

&gt;""No worries,"" says the man.  ""I have faith.  Everything is ok.  Even though the flood is rising, I will be fine.  God will take care of me.""

&gt;The flood continued to rise.

&gt;The man went to the roof to avoid the rising water.  A helicopter pilot sees him on top of the roof and hovers above the man.  Using a megaphone, the pilot tries to convince the man to grab the rope ladder which was dangling above his head.

&gt;""You are in danger.  The flood is still rising.  You will drown if you do not grab the rope ladder.  Let us help you.""

&gt;""No worries.""  says the man.  ""I will be fine.  Yes, the flood is higher but I have faith.  God will take care of me.""

&gt;The flood rises.  The man drowns.

&gt;At the pearly gates, the man says to God:  ""I had faith.  You let me die.""

But it is also true that by and large, vaccination tends to elicit a larger immune response. Now there are some advantages of convalescent immunity, because the body has had to deal with the whole virus vs just the spike protein. What studies are starting to suggest is that THE BEST immunity is conveyed from a recovered person receiving a vaccination. That seems to boost the natural immunity by a whole heck of a lot and is a best of both worlds type of scenario.

To answer what I think you’re getting at (aren’t there a lot more people with immunity than just those with vaccine-elicited immunity?), yes there certainly are. But, we also have to remember that a good portion of those people likely also have gotten vaccinated so they wouldn’t “count,” and also that convalescent immunity is on average a bit weaker, at least in terms of full-on infection prevention, and more variable than vaccine-elicited.

Absolutely.  For someone who is firmly on one side of this it's difficult to comprehend.  But ultimately it comes down to a mathematical risk assessment of the **knowns** vs. the **unknowns**.  Most people can't even get to that point because they don't have the skills and/or cognitive abilities to do such assessment.

I would venture to say that the majority of every day people simply go on very basic information presented to them by their **trusted sources**.  Very few people will go through the data (knowns) published by trials, governments, etc. Then assess it against the risk of the unkown which is a completely new vaccine.  The latter is even harder to do because you can never be 100% sure.  You just have to build enough context of the technology used, past vaccination efforts, etc.  To be able to assign some sort of ""risk profile"" to an otherwise unknown quantity.

The provinces and cities are Cần Thơ City, Bình Phước, Tây Ninh, Bà Rịa - Vũng Tàu, Tiền Giang, Long An, Vĩnh Long, Đồng Tháp, Bến Tre, Hậu Giang, An Giang, Bạc Liêu, Sóc Trăng, Trà Vinh, Cà Mau and Kiên Giang.  
  
The move came after Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính signed document No 969/TTg-KGVX on Saturday to strengthen the protection of public health amid the continuing developments of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
  
At present, three localities of HCM City, Bình Dương and Đồng Nai have been applying Directive 16. HCM City has been under Directive 16 since July 8 while Đồng Nai and Bình Dương have had the measures in place since July 9.  
  
Directive 16 orders the closure of non-essential services and businesses, people are told to stay at home unless necessary, gatherings of two or more people in public is forbidden and public transport is halted.  
  
Chính said the exact time to start applying social distancing to 16 provinces and cities was decided by the Chairman of the provincial People's Committee, but must be no later than midnight on July 19.  
  
He also said for localities that had been under social distancing before July 17, based on the results of anti-pandemic activities in the area, the head of the Provincial People's Committee had to promptly report to the authorised agencies for consideration before deciding to continue applying the measures.  
  
Chính ordered all relevant agencies to seriously implement Directive 16, ensuring both medical staff and supply to implement the directive.  
  
Chính assigned relevant agencies to take care of people during the social distancing period.  
  
“People must not lack food or essentials,” he said.  
  
Relevant agencies had to improve treatment and prioritise resources to treat severe cases of COVID-19, he said.  
  
He also called on people and businesses to promote the spirit of national solidarity, sharing, support and strict implementation of social distancing.  
  
He tasked Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam to direct ministries, sectors and localities to apply the directive as well as solving urgent and newly-arising issues on behalf of the Prime Minister. — VNS",,,,1626528143,{},h5ihljm,True,t3_om45qk,False,False,t3_om45qk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/om45qk/vietnam_additional_16_southern_provinces_and/h5ihljm/,1626683541,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,,

*By Gloria Oladipo*

**New coronavirus cases were up at least 10% in 46 states, with each infection increasing the chance of a dangerous virus mutation**

In anticipation of an end to the Covid-19 pandemic, states and cities across the United States have enjoyed reopening once-shuttered communities for business, leisure, summer festivities and travel as life has returned to near-normal.

However, health officials remain on high alert given one ongoing obstacle to being finished with Covid-19: wide swaths of unvaccinated people in America that could allow the virus to further mutate and potentially spawn more transmissible and increasingly deadly variants.

That means that unvaccinated people are not only at greater risk of Covid-19 themselves, but could also potentially undermine America’s whole vaccine rollout if any future variant emerging in the US was significantly resistant to the shots.

“Unvaccinated people are basically the cannon fodder of the virus. The virus needs people to infect in order to replicate and the more people it has that are vulnerable or susceptible to infection, the more likely it will mutate,” said Dr Michael Saag, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

Forty-six US states recorded at least a 10% increase in new coronavirus cases as of Wednesday, reported by CNN. Travel advisories have been declared for several states including Nevada and Florida because of increased Covid-19 cases, warning wannabe vacationers to stay away.

Against the backdrop of an almost nationwide increase in Covid-19 cases, there is a renewed focus on the vaccine rollout. After just missing a 4 July deadline of getting at least 70% of American adults their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, the Biden administration – together with federal, state and local health officials – is encouraging people, especially younger adults, to get vaccinated as quickly as possible.

But, even amid the more aggressive attempts to boost vaccination rates, several states, many concentrated in the south, continue to lag behind. As of 5 July, Arkansas, which has fully vaccinated less than 35% of its adult population, has acquired new Covid-19 cases at five times the national average rate. Similarly, Oklahoma, where only 39% of adults are fully vaccinated, has had a similar increase in Covid-19 cases. Those who remain unvaccinated risk infection as well as an increased chance of hospitalization or death from Covid.

“The challenge that we’re facing in the public health response … is that we’ve gotten the ‘easy’ people in terms of vaccination. The ones that were eager for it, that couldn’t wait to get it,” said Dr Susan Hassig, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.

But, in addition to experiencing the worst form of Covid-19, unvaccinated people present additional opportunities for the Covid-19 virus to mutate. The Delta variant of Covid-19, a more contagious and aggressive mutation of the virus that is now the dominant strain, is a direct result of the coronavirus mutating in people who have been infected. Viruses mutate once they are in the body of a person who has been infected. Some virus mutations can weaken a virus, while others, as observed with the Delta variant, make the virus more harmful.

Hence, clusters of unvaccinated people not only risk transmitting the virus to others, but risk spreading a stronger, more contagious version of Covid.

“Unvaccinated populations, of whatever size, are the breeding ground where the virus will eventually generate some form of mutation that will probably be a problem for us,” said Hassig.

Though epidemiologists remain uncertain about the likelihood of the need for boosters or revaccinations in the face of new strains, mutations of Covid-19 could challenge the immunity provided by existing vaccines.

“That’s been the concern all along. We’ve been talking about this since the beginning and, as anticipated, several variants have emerged … these viruses are just going to continue to emerge and it’s just a question of chance and a question of time, whether one of the variants will be resistant, to some degree, to the existing immunity provided by the vaccination,” said Saag.

With the prevalence of the Delta variant, increasing number of cases, and gaps in vaccination rates amid ongoing travel, public health officials are encouraging the retention of preventive measures such as social distancing and mask-wearing to limit the chance of infection.

But, as Hassig and Saag agreed, the most effective protection against future virus mutation and current strains is getting fully vaccinated.

“What we can do about it is get everyone vaccinated. That protects us from getting infected in the first place and if the virus isn’t able to infect, it’s not going to replicate … and a new variant won’t emerge,” said Saag.",,,,1626549768,{},h5jotod,False,t3_om2wte,False,True,t3_om2wte,/r/Coronavirus/comments/om2wte/unvaccinated_could_be_breeding_ground_for_covid/h5jotod/,1626707481,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_2wwmo35k,False,False,,

I'm not trying to judge or hate on your Dad ,.. but a lot of those arguments just seem like narrow-minded cynicism. 

The argument of:

&gt; ""Just let random-chance or fate sort things out.. whoever is gonna die is gonna die, we'll move on afterwards""

.. is dumb for a lot of reasons ,.. not the least of which ""leaving things to indiscriminate chance"" is completely unfair (no, I don't expect ""reality to be fair""). But the objective truth is,.. some people are naturally better prepared and some are not (or will never be). It's kind of like seeing a Tornado coming and saying:. .""Nah. .don't alert anyone,. just let random chance decide who lives or dies!"".. Some of the people who die may be the Police or Fire/Rescue (that you'll need afterwards).. some of the people who die may be the architects or Power/Electrical/Water engineers you need afterwards. etc..etc.. 

The other argument of:

&gt; ""Humans have done shitty things in the past.. so they get what they deserve"".. 

.. is dumb because a lot of people weren't involved in those shitty things. 

It's kind of like that argument people often make about ""inventing new things"" (IE = ""Well.. it'll probably only be used to do bad things. .so we should never invent it!"").. 

It's just not a logical or reasonable position. Pretty much any tool or development humanity invents is multi-sided. Take guns or firearms for example,. sure, they can do horrible things,.. but a woman walking alone at night can also use one to defend herself,.. so if we took guns away, she'd have to find a different tool to defend herself (something which probably wouldn't' be as effective as a gun).",,,,1626549639,{},h5jokb2,False,t3_om17nh,False,False,t1_h5jhs4c,/r/Coronavirus/comments/om17nh/not_having_the_vaccine_is_the_biggest_mistake_of/h5jokb2/,1626707326,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_3bcvj,False,False,,

1. Most places in the US have relaxed restrictions.  This means people are free to mingle.

2. The people who wanted to be vaccinated have done so.  Vaccinated people tend to mingle with their friends who are also likely to be vaccinated.  That section of the population is therefore going to be safe for the most part.

3. Unvaccinated people tend to mingle with their friends who are also unvaccinated, and not with vaccinated people.  Those people have actually been pretty safe so far, due to the restrictions and their free-loading on the backs of the people who have been conscientious about precautions.  That's all over now, and they will pass the virus around among themselves much more freely that has been the case so far.

I believe that it will take a couple of months for these events to play out, based on what I have seen in the data from other countries.  After that, the virus will have largely burned itself out feasting on the easy targets, and other than outbreaks due to variants, seasonal effects, etc., the pandemic in the US should recede.

Taipei, July 17 (CNA) Taiwan on Saturday reported eight new domestic cases of COVID-19, the lowest case number recorded in a single day since a nationwide Level 3 alert was declared in mid-May, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).

If the coronavirus curve continues to flatten, there is a high possibility that the Level 3 alert will be lowered after it expires on July 26, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who also heads the CECC, said at a press briefing.

With that in mind, the CECC will begin preparations next week for further relaxations of the restrictions, Chen said.

The current Level 3 alert out of a four-tier system, which has amounted to a soft lockdown, was imposed after a surge in COVID-19 cases in Taiwan.

If the COVID-19 alert is lowered to a Level 2, a ban on indoor gatherings of more than four people and outdoor gatherings of more than nine people will likely be lifted, according to the CECC's guidelines first issued in May.

Under such circumstances, however, large-scale indoor and outdoor events -- those with more than 100 and 500 people, respectively -- may still be prohibited.

In addition, wearing face masks in public may no longer be mandatory, except at crowded places where social distancing cannot be observed, according to the guidelines.

One key issue will be on-site dining. Local governments, which have so far been hesitant to follow the CECC's decision to allow dining in restaurants starting on July 13, may agree to allow the practice.

Among the new domestic cases registered Saturday, five were reported in New Taipei, while Taipei, Taoyuan and Taichung cities each recorded one case, the CECC said.

The source of infection in four of the cases could not be determined and one case was still being investigated, Chen said.

The new cases bring the total in the country to 15,390, of which 13,947 are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 COVID-19 cases in a single day.

Also on Saturday, Taiwan confirmed four new imported COVID-19 cases and one death, involving a man in his 60s, who passed away on July 15, the CECC said.

To date, 764 people in Taiwan have died of COVID-19, including 752 since May 15, with an overall case fatality rate of about 5.4 percent for the domestic cases over the past two months.

Most of the cases prior to the recent outbreak were infections contracted by people overseas before entering Taiwan.

The anti-vaxxers will keep on passing it to each other. 

New strains will keep popping up, until we get one that's resistant to the vaccine. 

That's only way to get anti-vaxxers to wear masks is to make everyone wear masks. 

I know what youre thinking -- Politically, that would be a shitstorm, people will protest, pitch fits at stores, school board meetings. 

So it likely won't happen right away. 

The politicians will take the easy route and go back to making us all wear masks.

But just maybe, if this gets to the point where action is needed, our political leaders will step up and do what's right. 

Upon request, at places like this, anyone not wearing a mask, must should present his or her vaccination card: 
- The servers at restaurants will ask to see everyone's card as soon as they are seated. 
- Theater ticket takers
- Every employer is obligated to make sure all unvaccinated wear a mask. Every job. 
- Every student has to show vaccine card if they aren't vaccinated (unless the kid is too young to be vaccinated). 
- When you walk into a grocery store, or any store, an employee will greet everyone at the door to check the vaccine cards of everyone not wearing a mask. 

The side benefit is that if we make it unpleasant to be unvaccinated, those SOBs will get vaccinated.

[],,DeaddyRuxpin,,,,,,[],"Shedding is another case of not understanding anything they are hearing. It is true that some vaccines “shed” in the sense that a vaccinated person can infect a non vaccinated. But these are deliberately designed this way (or at least used this way deliberately). The old polio vaccine was one of these. It infected a person with a specific weakened version of polio that allowed the person to build up the antibodies while not actually getting the form of polio that caused death or paralysis. While the person was infected they could spread that same vaccine strain to others thereby “vaccinating” others at the same time. This was a desired side effect as it allowed significantly higher vaccination rates in areas that were very difficult to do wide spread vaccination (remote underdeveloped parts of the world). 

The current polio vaccine is no longer like this nor are virtually all other vaccines. So 99.999% of the time someone is concerned with vaccine “shedding” they have no idea what they are talking about. 

Also it should be noted that these same people that won’t get vaccines and complain about shedding also say they want to just get the ailment and develop immunity naturally. Which is actually exactly what “shedding” is. An infected person transmitting the specific safe strain used in the vaccine on to others. What they should want is to have others vaccinated and then get it thru shedding. That way you get the safe strain of the virus and build up their immunity naturally without getting injected with the preservatives they think cause autism (it doesn’t but again, morons). Bottom line they are all idiots and have no idea what they are talking about.

Yep. With populations growing, density increases. Outside of cities, we push further into nature and interact with animals. We'll eat more exotic foods as traditional options grow scarce. Even sticking with livestock is dangerous, as antibiotics used in factory farming spawn resistant disease. All of this is a recipe for dangerous plagues traveling through a globally connected population faster than we may have time to react. Covid isn't even as dangerous as some illnesses already in existence, and I dread imagining something new and extremely deadly introduced to the human population. However, if we observe a whole city drop dead in a week, we might react sooner and more aggressively than we did to this pandemic, which arguably spread easier due to asymptomatic cases and confusion with common diseases like cold or flu. Besides all of this, we also have genetic engineering tools now for someone to accidentally or purposefully create some unnaturally strong virus/bacteria.

Since you mentioned ""go\[ing\] by the scientific route"" in another post in this thread as a way to claim that there are ""NO DATA yet for the long term effect of mRNA vaccine\[s\]"", I can reasonably assume that, like me, you have formal education and training in a STEM field, have been published in a scientific journal before, and that you are therefore capable of adequately performing scientific research. As such, I'll proceed under the assumption that we share the same knowledge and expertise.

Would it comfort you to know that there have been previous human trials conducted on [on](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31079849/) [multiple](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28754494/) mRNA vaccines (each of those words is for a different disease that was studied, so they each go to a unique link to a published article in a peer-reviewed journal) before 2020? What about if you knew that the technology [has been around since 1992](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243) and that we've also been working for several years on a coronavirus vaccine in response to the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS outbreaks?

Accordingly, given your intimate knowledge of immunology, you also are surely well aware that all components of the mRNA vaccine are naturally broken down and removed from your body within 4 weeks of receiving the injection, thereby making it essentially impossible for there to be any long-term effects. Certainly this falls in line with the incredibly detailed and well-studied history of vaccines that shows that [virtually all side effects of any vaccine occur within eight weeks of administration](https://www.chop.edu/news/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine).

Lastly, being so well-versed in these topics you would also inherently grasp the concept of statistical significance and apply it to any side effects that would arise from taking any of the available vaccines, correct? The data is all there for you to calculate your p-score and alpha levels. Would love to compare notes once you've accomplished this!",,,,1626537904,{},h5j0a6f,False,t3_om17nh,False,True,t1_h5iiv00,/r/Coronavirus/comments/om17nh/not_having_the_vaccine_is_the_biggest_mistake_of/h5j0a6f/,1626693431,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_kwg64,False,False,,

[],,RagingNerdaholic,,,,,,[],"Yeah sorry, I should clarify.  Age and CEV is a good strategy, I'm not denying that.  We did the same in here in Canada.

It's a difference mostly in timing and uptake:

The US has entered the exponential growth phase of Delta because of said batshit crazies deflating their overall uptake.  They're only 56.5% with at least one dose, 49% with two (proportions of total population).  They opened up eligibility to everyone 12 and up three months ago and supply began outpacing demand shortly after.

Despite the UK having much better overall vaccination rates (69.3%/53.3% respectively), you've only just started with young adults and youth 12-17 aren't even eligible yet, so there's a huge chunk of the population with zero protection.  But at the same time, your Delta growth curve is a solid month ahead of the US.

Here in Canada, everyone 12 and up has been eligible for about two months already.  We have similar vaccination rates to you (70.3%/48.6%), but we haven't left huge gaps in the population unvaccinated.

&gt;AZ provides very good protection against hospitlization and serious illness according to all real world data, I think. Pfizer is amazing, AZ still a good vaccine.

Yes, I wouldn't argue with that.  They're both good and effective, particularly against severe disease... until they won't be:

&gt;What most experts can agree on is that the United Kingdom is about to embark on a country-wide experiment in gain-of-function research. By abolishing all public health restrictions with just half of the population fully vaccinated, **the UK could produce new variants that evade vaccine-induced immunity.**

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/non-us-settings/overview/index.html

&gt; COVID-19 is **primarily transmitted from person-to-person through respiratory droplets**. These droplets are released when someone with COVID-19 sneezes, coughs, or talks. Infectious droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.

Short-range inhalation of aerosols is a possibility for COVID-19, as with many respiratory pathogens. **However, this cannot easily be distinguished from “droplet” transmission based on epidemiologic patterns.**

[],,Synonyms26,,,,,,[],"HCM CITY — HCM City authorities have demanded that supermarkets and convenience stores take preventive measures to handle essential goods reselling at much higher prices, causing a supply shortage at supermarkets.  
  
Dương Anh Đức, vice chairman of the People’s Committee, said: “City authorities have asked distribution systems to ensure daily capacity of more than 5,000 tonnes of fresh food and 6,000 tonnes of vegetables and fruits to meet demand for people’s daily life.”  
  
The move came as local media have reported that speculators took advantage of the pandemic to buy goods in bulk and then resell them at sky-high prices.  
  
Customers said they had been queuing for a long time to buy food such as vegetables, meat and fish and other essential supplies at supermarkets and convenience stores. Much of the food was being sold at higher prices.  
  
Meanwhile, customers who buy goods in bulk explained they wanted to buy enough for a whole week to limit their travels for fear of catching the virus.    
  
According to Saigon Co.op (Union of Commercial Cooperatives of HCM City), violators are taking advantage of the price-stabilisation policies at Saigon Co.op to buy goods in bulk, causing essential goods to sell out quickly.  
  
For example, under price-stabilisation policies at Saigon Co.op, the price remains low, at VNĐ26,000 per package of 10 chicken eggs and VNĐ31,000 per package of 10 duck eggs, about VNĐ10,000-15,000 lower than market price.   
  
To prevent speculation, supermarkets and stores of Saigon Co.op have applied the rule that each customer can only buy one or two packages of eggs to ensure enough supply for “customers who come later”.    
  
According to a representative of MM Mega Market, there is “really no shortage of goods”, but there are customers buying in large quantities.  
  
“With a huge stockpile, the supermarket has no shortage of food, especially poultry eggs. Customers should not stock up at the moment since the supermarket remains open to serve,” said a representative of MM Mega Market.  
  
Satra supermarkets and Satrafoods store systems said they do not have any priority policy, so it is easy to notice speculation buyers.  
  
Lawyer Phan Thị Viết Thu, chairman of the HCM City Consumer Protection Association, said: “Speculation of essential goods for reselling at high prices is a speculative act of profiteering, which will be sanctioned under Article 31 of Decree 98/2020 with a fine of VNĐ5-100 million.”   
  
“It can be criminally prosecuted for the crime of speculation under Article 196 of the Penal Code 2015. Depending on the value of the orders, violators will be subject to a maximum of 15 years in prison in case of illegal profits of over VNĐ1 billion.”  
  
City ensures shipment of goods   
  
The city government has established shipment points to ensure circulation of goods to retail systems because all three wholesale markets have been temporarily closed.   
  
The Thủ Đức wholesale market has set up a 16,500sq.m area to receive goods to ship to retailers in the city.  
  
Each night, 1,000-1,500 tonnes of vegetables and fruits are expected to be supplied to supermarkets and selling places in the city.   
  
Hóc Môn wholesale market said it had submitted a plan to the Department of Industry and Trade and the People’s Committee to partially reopen the market.   
  
The market will arrange an area of ​​more than 2,000sq.m to ship more than 100 tonnes of vegetables and fruits from the market to retailers in the city every day.  
  
Nguyễn Nguyên Phương, deputy director of the Department of Industry and Trade, said the amount of food delivered to HCM City in a day reached about 1,900 tonnes in a day, an increase of 100 tonnes compared to July 12.  
  
According to the Department of Industry and Trade, 166 traditional markets had stopped operating, which greatly affected the supply of goods to people, mainly fresh food.   
  
The department has set up a force to monitor the situation of market prices and coordinate and supply goods in a timely manner.  
  
Trần Quang Lâm, director of the Department of Transport, said the city has coordinated with 19 southern provinces to facilitate nearly 22,000 vehicles to pass the checkpoints at city gateways.   
  
Dương Anh Đức, vice chairman of the People’s Committee, has announced that there are 2,833 points of sale distributed widely in 22 districts and Thủ Đức City, including 106 supermarkets, 2,616 mini-marts and convenience stores, 111 safe traditional markets, and 28,700 department stores.   
  
City considers reopening traditional markets  
  
The Department of Industry and Trade has asked districts and Thủ Đức City authorities to consider reopening traditional markets to reopen those that are safe to meet demand.  
  
Only 63 out of 234 traditional markets are still operating in HCM City due to the outbreak.  
  
The city will pilot a plan in which only two to 10 small traders of fruit and vegetables (depending on the size of the market’s operation) will sell at traditional markets or take turns if many small businesses want to reopen at the same time.  
  
The city will also work to control the number of people going to the market.  
  
Recently, there were rumours on social media that there would be a complete citywide lockdown, along with calls for city residents to start stockpiling food and supplies.   
  
Food scarcity and shortages were also rumoured to be imminent as well as a ban on shopping starting July 15. Several posts also rumoured that city leaders had contracted the deadly virus.  
  
Such groundless rumours have urged many people to rush to supermarkets and convenience stores to buy supplies.  
  
HCM City authorities have officially refuted the rumours.  
  
The city has recorded nearly 20,000 locally transmitted cases since the outbreak began in late April. — VNS",,,,1626524241,{},h5ibptn,True,t3_om352t,False,True,t3_om352t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/om352t/vietnam_city_to_handle_violations_of_sales_of/h5ibptn/,1626680521,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,,

Masks DO work, but they only really make a difference when people see a threat, comply, and use them correctly. Even in the most educated populations, people wear loose cloth masks, neck gaiters, bandanas, or just don’t wear them correctly. They pull them down to speak, or take it off when interacting with friends. Employees take off their masks when alone in a store, exhale the virus inside and put it on when someone comes in. Good luck getting people to wear masks when they’re alone indoors.

I don’t think many experts realize that the average person does not wear masks like they think they do, which is why we keep having wave over wave, with masks or no masks. It’s become so political in the US that, half the country thinks masks are like bulletproof vests, while the other think they’re a hoax. But most don’t know what they’re really for.

People on here says masks are not a big deal, and while they might seem that way, many people won’t be comfortable going to a nightclub with masks on, or a bar, or a concert. The reason why this pandemic has killed so much is because public health doesn’t understand how the average person thinks, and sees white lies as a way to persuade the average person to comply. People are not that bright, but when they’re given clear and true guidelines that are based in science AND other social aspects of society, people will comply.

&gt; British medical officials announced Friday that fully vaccinated travelers returning to England from France must continue to quarantine because of the threat posed by the Beta variant.

&gt; Travelers arriving from France must quarantine for five to 10 days, at home or elsewhere, the British health ministry said.

&gt; Beginning on Monday, vaccinated travelers from other European nations that Britain had placed on its medium-risk amber list no longer have to quarantine. Most virus-related restrictions in England will be lifted, allowing pubs and restaurants to operate at full capacity and nightclubs to open their doors. Curbs on the number of people who can meet indoors, generally limited to six, will also be removed.

&gt; “With restrictions lifting on Monday across the country, we will do everything we can to ensure international travel is conducted as safely as possible, and protect our borders from the threat of variants,” Health Minister Sajid Javid said in a statement.

&gt; While attention has been focused on the threat from the Delta variant, which is now dominant in Britain and France as well as the United States, scientists are also concerned about the Beta variant because clinical trials of vaccines are showing that they offer less protection against it. The Beta variant was first identified in South Africa in December.

&gt; The presence of Beta in France remains relatively low, according to GISAID, an international open source database; it accounts for 3.4 percent of new cases over the past four weeks.

&gt; Some research has shown that the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, the backbone of Britain’s inoculation campaign, has been less effective in preventing mild and moderate Beta cases. In February, South Africa halted use of the vaccine over those concerns.

&gt; In France, concerns that the Delta variant, which accounts for about half of the country’s new cases, could unleash a fourth wave of the virus prompted President Emmanuel Macron this week to announce new vaccination requirements. They include mandatory inoculations for health care workers and proof of immunization or a recent negative test to enter restaurants and cultural venues.

&gt; Mr. Macron’s announcement came just three days after nightclubs reopened for the first time in 16 months, which many believed had signaled the completion of France’s protracted efforts to emerge from the pandemic. But the new measures dashed hopes of a return to a prepandemic normal and of a smooth summer vacation season.

&gt; British travelers, after enduring a miserable winter and a four-month national lockdown, are finding it difficult to visit some of their favorite summer destinations. In June, British tourists had to scramble to leave Portugal ahead of a quarantine deadline, after London changed travel rules over concerns about the Delta variant.

&gt; “The U.K. is entrenching itself as an outlier in its confused approach to travel. This, in turn, is destroying its own travel sector and the thousands of jobs that rely on it,” Willie Walsh, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, said in an interview with Reuters.

&gt; Graham McLeod, from Bolton in northwest England, said that the government’s messaging was “inconsistent, irregular, unclear and frankly unworkable.” In an interview with the Associated Press, Mr. McLeod, who is staying at his vacation home on France’s Atlantic coast, added:  “We struggle to understand the sudden desire to introduce quarantine for returnees from France and cannot help feel this has far more to do with politics and much less to do with science.”",,,,1626542887,{},h5jat0v,True,t3_om8mlj,False,False,t3_om8mlj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/om8mlj/britain_will_continue_to_require_vaccinated/h5jat0v/,1626699359,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_bz91eiwq,False,False,,

What part of deaths are a lagging indicator do you not understand? The UK has experienced a 12,000% increase in cases in 30 DAYS.

And since deaths lag by about 6 weeks, we haven't even seen the start of these deaths.

You're comparing apples to orangutans. The deaths you are seeing now are from infection levels on \~May 20th. So we're talking \~2,250 infections per day. The last time the UK had 2,500 infections per day, guess what the deaths per day were 6 weeks later? 100, which just so happens to be the exact difference cause by vaccination rate of about 60%.

The UK will see 500 deaths per day in !RemindMe 2 months. And that's basing the numbers off mask mandates and lockdowns that were in place this winter.

How many times does exponential growth and lagging deaths have to prove you people wrong?",,,,1626536885,{},h5iy4wr,False,t3_oluja0,False,True,t1_h5iuv3r,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oluja0/delta_is_driving_a_wedge_through_missouri/h5iy4wr/,1626692229,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_2kn65g,False,False,,

This seems optimistic to me.

&gt;Plans to relax self-isolation rules for people traveling from a wide range of countries will no longer apply to France because of the persistent presence of the Beta variant, which was first discovered in South Africa and is believed to be more dangerous than other variants, the government said. The announcement came just days after authorities confirmed plans to lift the quarantine requirement for fully vaccinated people arriving from “amber list” countries, including most destinations in the European Union.

&gt;The about-face comes at a critical moment in Britain’s battle against coronavirus, with remaining restrictions set to end on Monday and summer holidays for most school children scheduled to begin Friday.
