&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday backed a booster shot of the Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for Americans aged 65 and older, some adults with underlying medical conditions and some adults in high-risk working and institutional settings.
&gt;
&gt;The move comes after an advisory panel to the agency on Thursday did not recommend that people in high-risk jobs, such as teachers, and risky living conditions should get boosters. The panel had recommended boosters for elderly and some people with underlying medical conditions.
&gt;
&gt;CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said her agency had to make recommendations based on complex, often imperfect data.
&gt;
&gt;""In a pandemic, even with uncertainty, we must take actions that we anticipate will do the greatest good,"" she said in a statement.
&gt;
&gt;""I believe we can best serve the nation’s public health needs by providing booster doses for the elderly, those in long-term care facilities, people with underlying medical conditions, and for adults at high risk of disease from occupational and institutional exposures to COVID-19. This aligns with the FDA’s booster authorization and makes these groups eligible for a booster shot,"" she said.
&gt;
&gt;The CDC recommendation follows U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorization and clears the way for a booster rollout to begin as soon as this week for millions of people who had their second dose of the Pfizer shot at least six months ago.
&gt;
&gt;The CDC said that people 65 years and older should get a booster. Beyond older Americans, the CDC also recommended the shots for all adults over 50 with underlying conditions.
&gt;
&gt;It said that, based on individual benefits and risks, 18- to 49-year-olds with underlying medical conditions may get a booster, and people 18-64 at increased risk of exposure and transmission due to occupational or institutional setting may get a shot.
&gt;
&gt;The recommendations only cover people who received their second Pfizer/BioNTech shot at least six months earlier. The CDC said that group is currently about 26 million people, including 13 million age 65 or older.
&gt;
&gt;The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Thursday gave the thumbs down to additional doses for groups including healthcare workers, teachers and residents of homeless shelters and prisons.
&gt;
&gt;Panel member Lynn Bahta, who works with the Minnesota Department of Health, voted against that measure. She said the data does not support boosters in that group yet. ""The science shows that we have a really effective vaccine,"" she said.
&gt;
&gt;The committee had said it could revisit the guidance later.
&gt;
&gt;Last month, U.S. President Joe Biden and eight top health officials said they hoped to start a broad booster shot program this week, saying that emerging data showed immunity wanes over time.
&gt;
&gt;Vaccine expert Dr. Paul Offit said he believed the CDC advisers were worried that recommending boosters based on employment would allow overly broad use, especially in younger people for whom the health benefits of a booster shot are still unclear.
&gt;
&gt;""That was a hole that you could drive a truck through, that essentially what we were doing was basically what the (Biden) administration initially asked - to just have a vaccine for the general population, because obviously the pharmacists aren't going to figure out whether you're working in a grocery store or hospital,"" he said.
&gt;
&gt;More than 180 million people in the United States are fully vaccinated, or about 64% of the eligible population.
&gt;
&gt;Pfizer - and some top U.S. health officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci - have argued that the extra round of shots are needed to address waning immunity. Fauci and others have also said they could help contain surging hospitalizations and deaths caused by the highly transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus by cutting breakthrough infections of fully vaccinated people.
&gt;
&gt;Some countries, including Israel and the United Kingdom, have already begun COVID-19 booster campaigns. The United States authorized extra shots for people with compromised immune systems last month and around 2.3 million people have already received a third shot, according to the CDC.",,,,1632466773,{},he2b0lk,True,t3_pudykd,False,True,t3_pudykd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pudykd/us_cdc_director_breaks_with_panel_backs_covid19/he2b0lk/,1632599338.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;  
&gt;That our data should suggest a tenfold higher incidence seems surprising. However, it is important to understand that the report of Diaz et al was essentially based upon the collection of administrative health data and not upon the direct investigation of patients with a protocolized approach, as we used in our study. For example, their case definition of myocarditis is not reported and whether a reference standard such as CMR was used to confirm a clinical suspicion is not discussed. Lack of direct myocardial assessment risks under-recognition of cases. The authors themselves raise this as a limitation of their study.

First, very few people *cant* get the vaccine. That is more or less a myth. mRNA vaccines aren't like the traditional vaccines where a not-insignificant percentage of the population may be allergic or unable to receive it.

Second, if you're thinking immunocompromised people who the vaccine may not work on, most everywhere that has a vaccine mandate also has showing negative testing as an alternative option. In the cases of people who are really immunocompromised and not just pretending, you would think they'd... you know... care about that. Catching COVID for them likely means a hospital stint and maybe death. So yeah I think they probably take this seriously.

Finally, if someone thinks they are getting ""banned from society"", odds are good they're the kind of person who is engaging in the kind of behavior that got us to this place to begin with. Remember when we couldn't even have a two week lockdown without some ""banned from society"" people storming capitol buildings? Yeah, I don't have any empathy for them now- a literal year and a half later.

You have to think about the virus and the disease as two separate entities. The vaccine does nothing to prevent the virus itself from getting into the body. What it does is train the immune system so it can respond to the threat much faster and hopefully kill the virus before it has a chance to replicate itself.

You only get the disease if the virus is in your body at high enough numbers for a long enough time. By training your immune system to respond faster, it becomes more likely that you can either completely eliminate the virus before you even experience any symptoms, or even if you do develop symptoms, they will be less severe and won't last as long as if you were unvaccinated.

After this long how has it still escaped your attention that while yes statistically speaking your demographic are likely to have a mild (technically a mild case is any that doesn't require hospitalisation but ranges from the sniffles to the sickest you've ever felt for 1-2 weeks but short of needing to go to hospital) or asymptomatic case, you still have a magnitudes greater risk of a bad or fatal case of Covid19 than any risk from the vaccination itself. The problem is you don't know until you catch the Virus which kind of statistic for your demographic you will be. 

Yeah, maybe you are someone who in your youth got exposed to several/all of the endemic Cold causing Coronaviruses that meant you had T and B Memory cells that recognised some surface expressed proteins from SarsCov2 infection and replication and thus rendered you asymptomatic to the original or Alpha/beta variants because your immune system had a headstart against the virus before major replication started. (Much higher viral loads of Delta can outpace even that immunity though meaning a greater chance of symptoms before your immune system could get ahead of the virus). Then the infection itself taught the body to recognise the actual SarsCov2 Spike Protein creating specific anti-body protection against it and even more targetted T and B Memory cells.

For example, this is why I reckon that I as a 47 year old working retail behind a register in my convenience store serving hundreds a day every day for the entire pandemic never had so much as a sniffle. I've been constantly exposed to every respiratory infection known to man repeatedly all my working life and so likely encountered all the endemic coronaviruses and had the relevant T and B cells. Guess what though..... **I still got my 2 shots of Pfizer as soon as my cohort was allowed because...why not?? It took 1 hour out of my day and was a pin-prick I didn't even feel and my only sides were a mildly achy arm at the injection site for about 36 hours**

Guess what though! Maybe you are actually someone who got plenty of colds as a kid but they all happened to be several of the 100 or so Rino/Adeno/RSV Cold causing viruses and you happen to be someone who never encountered any of the 4 or 5 cold causing coronaviruses. So your immune system has no headstart against any of the variants. Add to that, maybe you are one of those people who is so 'Young and Healthy' and your immune system so 'powerful' that you are more prone to an immune system over reaction called a Cytokine Storm. This is why the second wave of Spanish/Kentucky Flu in 2018 primarily killed millions of Young healthy people. They hadn't been exposed to a previous related flu decades earlier like the older folks which offered them some protection/immune headstart, and most of them died from Cytokine Storms where their own immune system over-reacted and attacked their own body.

I actually know a local bar owner who is lucky to be alive...twice.... after being put in a coma on a ventilator from both Swine Flu over a decade ago and Covid19 in the Summer of 2020 all because he is prone to Cytokine Storms!! His lungs are likely %^&amp;$ed despite surviving and he'll be lucky to reach or get out of his 60's cause the next bad case of the Flu or other respiratory infection or lung issue will likely kill him.

**So I'll ask again, Why TF won't you take the vaccine thats incredible effective, incredibly safe, takes an hour out of 2 days several weeks apart, is a pin prick that you don't even feel (trust me, I am needle apprehensive and dislike even the tiny pinch of the much thicker gauge blood draw needles. The vaccine needle is so thin you don't even feel it, you just feel the vaccinators hand on your shoulder), is unlikely to cause any side effects other than a mildly achey upper arm for 36 hours for the vast majority of people.**

Like WTF Dude!!

You know what the absolute best protection is? Vaccination that virtually guarantee's an asymptomatic or a truly mild (not just a medical definition of mild) case, that teaches your body to recognise the Virus Spike Protein without risking triggering a Cytokine Storm in order to achieve that recognition. Then that protection is enhanced by actually encountering the real Virus where the few cells the virus manages to replicate in before your vaccine trained immune system blows it away, is enough to create some of those specific surfaced expressed proteins that your T and B Memory cells learn to recognise. **Congratulations**, you know have an immune system that both recognises the actual Virus Spike Protein and has created anti-bodies for **as well as** the T and B memory cells that recognise the expressed proteins from an infection. Every encounter with the virus thereafter enhances and boosts your anti-body protection.",,,,1632484592,{},he2x613,False,t3_publua,False,True,t1_he2hcyh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/publua/no_vaccinated_people_are_not_just_as_likely_to/he2x613/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,96379c5f7cda7f70467e09dbbb5b9e762412323e,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1632484609.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

However, it breaks these deaths down into two groups: unvaccinated deaths, and vaccinated deaths.

As I'm sure you know, the world is seeing incredibly low rates of covid deaths among vaccinated people.  However, according to the health department's daily updates, it is a VERY different story in Puerto Rico.  

Most days, almost HALF of the people that died of covid were vaccinated.  This makes no sense, and a lot of Puerto Ricans, besides being upset that nobody seems to be addressing or even talking about this, suspect that it may be due to improper refrigeration of covid vaccines in PR, resulting in people receiving what would essentially be expired vaccines.  

I've looked at the PR health dept Facebook page.  The ratio of vaccinated to unvaccinated deaths they are seeing is astonishing.  However, this particular breakdown does not appear to be mentioned on their .gov site, which could explain why it isn't all over the news.

Compare and contrast the NIH, which is openly admiring the successful Israeli booster policies. The NIH actually cares about patient outcomes.

It's going to be hard to read the cdc's influenza vaccine recommendations with a straight face after they failed to recommend a covid vaccine booster for health care workers, who now have very little protection against infection, perhaps negligible protection, and for whom a case of covid could well be significantly worse than a case of influenza (which can be treated with an OTC PO med). 

Add to that, that TN and others may now prioritize the increasingly limited supply of monoclonals to people who are unvaccinated. The monoclonals, when administered early, do a pretty good job of preventing disease by providing all those ready antibodies that have long since faded away in the case of Pfizer vaccinations dating back eleven months. So the nightmare scenario by which unvaccinated people may actually do better than the vaccinated ones could conceivably come about as a result of this decision.

You know what happened in 1918? Many doctors and nurses died trying to take care of flu victims in abysmal conditions brought about by a nurse shortage. Those who survived these brutal conditions quit. That set back the numbers of registered nurses even further. Literally, hospitals became so poorly staffed that they practically saved nearly no one from death. Calls went out for anyone who had ever taken care of sick people, regardless of training. Even young women who were interested in such work ended up quitting ward work within 1-2 months, and that was only a fraction of these ""temp"" workers.

It took over a decade for nursing staffing levels to go back up to pre-1918 levels, **and those were still shortage numbers**. It wasn't until the eve of WWII that the numbers started increasing positively.

The strongest risk factors for death were obesity (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.27–1.33), anxiety and fear-related disorders (aRR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.25–1.31), and diabetes with complication (aRR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.24–1.28), as well as the total number of conditions, with aRRs of death ranging from 1.53 (95% CI, 1.41–1.67) for patients with 1 condition to 3.82 (95% CI, 3.45–4.23) for patients with more than 10 conditions (compared with patients with no conditions).

Conclusion

Certain underlying conditions and the number of conditions were associated with severe COVID-19 illness. Hypertension and disorders of lipid metabolism were the most frequent, whereas obesity, diabetes with complication, and anxiety disorders were the strongest risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness. Careful evaluation and management of underlying conditions among patients with COVID-19 can help stratify risk for severe illness.

In the same way that business interests have pushed to sacrifice your life for profit, by lobbying hard for pandemic restrictions to be lifted.

Months into U.S. entry into WWII, the Atlantic coast was ravaged by U-boat attacks on shipping. They found such easy prey that the period was dubbed ""The Second Happy Time"". Why?

""The official history said later, “One of the most reprehensible failures on our part was the neglect of the local communities to dim their waterfront lights, or of military authorities to require them to do so, until three months after the submarine offensive started. When this obvious defense measure was first proposed, squawks went up all the way from Atlantic City to southern Florida that the ‘tourist season would be ruined.’ Miami and its luxurious suburbs threw up six miles of neon-light glow, against which the southbound shipping that hugged the reefs to avoid the Gulf Stream was silhouetted. Ships were sunk and seamen drowned in order that the citizenry might enjoy business and pleasure as usual.”

I first heard about this in a biography of George McGovern. It seemed unbelievable.

We don't currently have a strong argument for boosters being needed against mild covid. Long covid is highly correlated with the severity of symptoms, so there's evidence boosters would do much there either.

If you want my two cents, I wouldn't be surprised if we do get this data later and boosters are recommended in the end - either due to time (recommended 1 year after 2nd dose) or we find a moderate benefit from them (it's unlikely that there would be a big benefit, as the current data would already have been enough to show that, but a small to medium sized benefit definitely could show up).

Humans are a bit unusual as far as mammals go in that newborns get a lot of antibodies into their bloodstream through the placenta but largely lose the ability to move antibodies from breastmilk into the bloodstream after birth.

(Interesting article on the matter here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12850343).

&gt;  We also introduced a furin cleavage site at both the S2′ cleavage site within S2 793-KPTKR-797 (S2′), as well as at the junction of S1 and S2. Introduction of a furin cleavage site at the S2′ position allowed trypsin-independent cell–cell fusion, which was strongly increased by the presence of a second furin cleavage site at the S1–S2 position

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2660061/

&gt; To determine whether proteolytic cleavage of the S glycoprotein might be important for the newly emerged SARS-CoV, we introduced a furin recognition site at single basic residues within the putative S1–S2 junctional region. We show that furin cleavage at the modified R667 position generates discrete S1 and S2 subunits and potentiates membrane fusion activity. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7111780/

&gt; To explore this possibility, we introduced a furin-like cleavage sequence in the S protein at amino acids 798 to 801 and found that the mutated S protein was cleaved and induced cell fusion without trypsin treatment when expressed on the cell surface. Furthermore, a pseudotype virus bearing a cleaved S protein was revealed to infect cells in the presence of a lysosomotropic agent as well as a protease inhibitor, both of which are known to block SARS-CoV infection via an endosome, whereas the infection of pseudotypes with an uncleaved, wild-type S protein was blocked by these agents.

Firstly it's the chances from covid over 4 months, not getting the vaccine means this time keeps running. Secondly majortiy of the cases are minor and easily treated.

Then there is definitive proof the vaccine works extremely well. In the Netherlands they opent bars and clubs early, the numbers got analyzed [here](https://www.rivm.nl/sites/default/files/2021-08/Effectiviteit%20van%20COVID-19%20vaccinatieVV270821.pdf). From 14000 covid hospitalizations 88% was unvaccinated, a mere 4,5% was fully vaccinated. About 12000 could be reduced to 600, probably even further.

Covid will keep killing and disabeling people until we've gotten enought people immunized. Yes the vaccine wil have an adverse effect in some people and if you have a concern then it's okay to wait a bit longer. But completely dismissing it for no (medical) reason and making others doubt and worry is just pure narcacism. Because seriously what's your end game?

That's a false choice. Doing one does not mean not doing the other.

&gt;I think they did a really good job here of threading a very complicated needle.

They overruled the FDA hurting public confidence in that agency, excluded healthcare workers, included 18yos who are a bit chubby but not ones who get covid coughed in their face all day... no, sorry, they did an absolutely terrible job threading the needle.

&gt;Those fully vaxed with Pfizer (whether employed in healthcare or not) who are concerned about their own risk can self attest to what looks like a fairly wide range of health conditions and go get a booster.

Which makes it all the more ridiculous to exclude healthcare and other occupational risks.

&gt;But they’ve avoided making blanket recommendations (outside of 65+) for boosters that aren’t supported by risk/benefit data and that might complicate and take resources away from the much more impactful efforts to vax 12+ and under 12s.

Only under a very narrow conception of the risk/benefit data. For example, all potential health consequences and employment force consequences of mild to moderate covid, all transmission issues particularly when people highly exposed from work take a breakthough that's ""mild"" for them home to someone much worse off... all of that was excluded. The need for particular higher risk subsets to have access, excluded. The level of severe disease protection they define as acceptable, questionable.

&gt;I came into to watching that committee meeting believing that everyone should get a booster now but the data presented and the discussion provided a very clear answer for why that’s a bad idea.

And like the 6 yes votes on this panel and the unanimous opinion of the FDA panel, I reached the opposite conclusion. 

Their only concern about the downsides is a concern about myocarditis in males 18-20. First, it's almost always mild and caused by covid 6x as often. Whatever concerns about that they have are rendered illegitimate by the broad definition of 'high risk' who do qualify. Because of that, they excluded all people under 50. That's not a risk/benefit analysis, that's entirely arbitrary.

And all the non-medical policy items that clearly weighed on their decision really shook my confidence in their claim to be a scientific body. The distinction between unapproved and unapproved is arbitrary, unjustified by the evidence (had they just approved Policy Question 1 &amp; 2, then they could argue they had a lack of faith in the evidence of risk/benefit), and seriously undermines public health goals.

&gt; On Sept. 9, 2021, President Biden issued his Executive Order on Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors (EO), mandating vaccines for all federal employees and covered federal contractor employees. Although the respective agencies are expected to promulgate guidance and rules effectuating the EO, which will become effective Oct. 15, 2021, the Safety Federal Workforce Task Force has given guidance as to protocols federal contractors should follow, building on the prior government safety protocol directive. Until federal contractors are contractually required to be vaccinated, contractors should note the following safety protocols for their employees who are not yet fully vaccinated or decline to provide information about their vaccination status.

Infectious virus was detected in the **sole** specimen tested from an asymptomatic fully vaccinated individual. Although few asymptomatic individuals were sampled, these results indicate that even asymptomatic, fully vaccinated people might shed infectious virus.

One souvenir case led to the first death in a small western pa town right next to mine when community spread was virtually non existent there at the time.  The whole fam came back sick from a vacation and 2 weeks later the mom was gone. 

2- Any state that got caught up in the first wave was dealing with Covid at a time where we literally did not know half of the things that we know now about keeping people alive. That caused a huge swell in the numbers of fatalities (among other stupid things like the nursing homes debacle in the NE).  Once that first wave subsided the rest of the states were without excuse.   We knew it was going to happen and at the same time we had much better treatment protocols which led to less mortality. Any state that comes even close to reaching the numbers and infections of a state that was caught up in the first wave should be ashamed of themselves and their policies.  Or maybe the attitude and actions of the populace would be a better Place to point fingers now that vaccines are available.  Of course that’s a product of their politics as well so it’s a bit of a chicken and the egg.

Remember when the Republican argument was ""only a small percentage of people have real problems, pretty much everyone recovers, what's the big deal?"" Well, now that's become the CDC's argument with this vote against boosters for frontline workers, teachers, etc.

I'm tired of hearing ""well, the data don't support it"". The data are crystal clear: nearly everyone vaccinated with Pfizer will get Covid as it stands with the two-dose regimen. A decent number of those will be subject to long Covid. The CDC is only considering hospitalization and death as poor outcomes, no longer concerned with actually helping people avoid Covid with one of the most brilliant scientific developments ever, the mRNA vaccines. This is what pisses me off. We have the tools, but since the vaccines prevent hospitalization and death pretty well, and that's our definition of success, we're not going to use them to prevent infection. We're going to let everyone get Covid.

In studies that the CDC used themselves, in countries where the initial doses were given about 3 weeks apart (as opposed to months like some countries had to), the Pfizer vaccine was about 40-50% effective at preventing symptomatic infection.

That was a month or two back. In [a recent study of incarcerated individual](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/pswfkg/outbreak_of_sarscov2_b16172_delta_variant/), Delta had an attack rate of 81% for Pfizer vaccinated inmates, or seen another way, *91% for people vaccinated 4-6 months ago who had not had a previous infection*. This translates into only 19% or 9% efficacy, respectively, which tracks very well with the anecdotes in r/covid19positive of people whose entire families get sick, despite full vaccination.

It's very clear, given enough time or dosage, a double dose of Pfizer does basically nothing to prevent you getting sick. AND YES, I KNOW THAT WAS NEVER THE OFFICIAL REASON TO VACCINATE. I get that only hospitalization and death are technically the criteria, and that they still protect very well.

It's not teachers, medical workers, or grocery store clerks' fault that the governments of the world haven't vaccinated poorer countries. I am enormously sympathetic to this. At the same time, I don't skip a meal each day in honor of someone less fortunate. Likewise, the fact they were talking about the unvaccinated in this country, who at this point are only straight lunatics (minus legitimate health reasons in a small number of peeps) and prioritizing vaccines for them ""just in case"" seems ridiculous.

I've been supportive of the government during most of this, but I really feel they've screwed this one up. I very much appreciated the FDA specifically naming teachers as a subset of people to get a vaccine yesterday, but of course today the CDC voted the opposite way. We do have a last-ditch hope that Dr. Walensky decides to allow high-risk professions to get a third, but otherwise, the plan is to let it burn through all Americans and let the luckiest avoid long Covid.",,,,1632448724,{},he1h0rn,False,t3_pu44mw,False,False,t3_pu44mw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pu44mw/advisory_committee_recommends_many_be_offered/he1h0rn/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,c20185971ac58e6a78a52d6fc75457357559a0a5,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1632448738.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,True

&gt; Similarly, the CDC says Covid vaccines are contraindicated in people who have had severe allergic reactions or immediate allergic reactions — occurring within four hours and including symptoms such as hives, swelling and wheezing — after receiving any ingredient of a Covid vaccine or after previous doses of that vaccine.

On the one hand, this is most likely the case.

On the other, the only reason why I'm not rushing out to get a 3rd dose *just yet* (aside from the fact that #modernagang can't technically as of now) is that as of this moment, the best possible protection you can get is 'hybrid immunity' - covid exposure + vaccination.    


**IF** the order doesn't matter - fully vaccinated individuals later exposed to covid / have a mild case - also get that same hybrid immunity - I don't think we know enough to say that 3 doses means you could miss out on that benefit.  What I really, really want to see, is comparisons in the immune response between this 'hybrid' immunity and that of those with 3 doses of mRNA.  Specifically, the 'breadth' of that response - how that immunity might look years from now to future variants.

A booster shot has a small, but measurable risk. Wearing a mask has no measurable risk (at least not measured), so it may be that the risk we have is lower than the vaccine, but higher than the mask.

It is a cost-benefit analysis; we more-or-less know the costs of vaccines, but don't know the costs of masks (much less 'altering our lives', whatever that means).

Do I understand this correctly?

1. The family got a prescription for ivermectin for a ventilated COVID patient. What doctor wrote that prescription? Should that doctor lose their license to practice medicine?

How the fuck can anyone deny/debate that masks work? It's fucking simple: air comes in, air goes out.. if there is something in the way, say.. a filter (like a mask..) then certain things will not pass through, i.e. they will be filtered out. I read something that said that 70% of inhaled air is filtered through a surgical mask and 30% of the exhaled air is filtered out. So not all the air goes through the mask but a lot of the particulate is caught by a decent mask. The particulate (droplets) are what hang in the air and can be breathed in. If everyone wears a decent mask (surgical n95, triple layer cloth, etc..), the chances of any particulate being passed from one person to another is extremely small. I don't do math like this but I'm sure someone has figured out the percentage of filtration provided given a room full of surgically masked people I'm not going to Google it 

Now, there are face coverings that definitely don't work, like bandanas or neck gaiters or any of that half assed bullshit.

So wear a fucking mask. Wear one that isn't stupid. We don't need a study on it. I just explained in simple non scientific terms.

Natural immunity tends to be fairly overblown, both in the numbers of people that have it and how effective it is longterm. In the US for example there's been 183 million people fully vaccinated versus 42.7 million people who tested positive for COVID-19.

[],,HanSingular,#46d160,,[],02cc5c36-ae80-11eb-a76b-0e911ea99c5d,I'm fully vaccinated! 💉💪🩹,light,text,t2_1aga9l38,False,False,[],"The small preprint study by the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Canada’s “largest and foremost” heart centre, was alarming, suggesting that, based on a sample size of just 32 people, Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccinations carry an estimated one in 1,000 risk of heart inflammation.

Except the “incidence calculation” was off. Way off. And it wasn’t corrected or withdrawn before creating considerable traffic on Twitter.

“That our data should suggest a tenfold higher incidence (than recent reports) seems surprising,” the Ottawa researchers wrote in the uncorrected version of the study posted to a preprint site Sept. 16.

The scientists initially estimated the prevalence of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart) based on 32 consecutive people admitted to the Heart Institute from June 1 through to the end of July 2021 with a suspected diagnosis of post-vaccination heart inflammation.

The authors calculated that, during the same study period, a total of 32,379 doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were administered in the Ottawa area. “Therefore, if our cohort captured all cases in the Ottawa area, then the incidence of myocarditis would be 0.1 per cent of all vaccine doses,” or 10 cases of myocarditis for every 10,000 doses of vaccine, they wrote.

The researchers said the data collected on vaccine doses came from an Ottawa Public Health open database.

Except their denominator was wrong.

Ottawa Public Health confirmed to the National Post that, during the study period, more than 833,000 mRNA (Pfizer of Moderna) COVID-19 vaccinations were administered in Ottawa.

The adjusted incidence is about four per 100,000 doses, which is within the range of recent studies, and vastly lower than the initial estimate.

A research letter published in JAMA involving 40 hospitals in Washington, Oregon, Montana and Los Angeles county and more than two million people who received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine estimated an incidence of one case of myocarditis in 100,000 vaccinations. In another large study out of Israel published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers estimated that, for every 100,000 people who get the Pfizer vaccine, one to five would likely develop myocarditis. However, the risk of heart inflammation was 11 events for every 100,000 people infected with COVID.

“Ottawa Public Health was not involved in the study and did not provide the data that was used for the calculation of the incidence or estimation of the denominator,” the department said in an email.

The preprint was tweeted out, including by scientist Dr. Robert Malone, who describes himself as the “inventor of mRNA vaccines” and has been accused of spreading COVID misinformation, prompting thousands of retweets. “I would rather catch a virus. Another reason not to vaccinate with mRNA poison,” one follower responded. Others were more skeptical, saying that if the risk calculations were correct, “hospitals would be run over with heart conditions.”

Late Thursday afternoon, the Heart Institute announced via Twitter that the authors have requested the paper be retracted, and that the incorrect data “vastly inflates the incidence of post-vaccine myocarditis.”

In an interview Wednesday, Dr. Peter Liu, chief scientific officer at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute and one of the study’s authors, said the risk calculation had been corrected and sent to the preprint server, but that the new data hadn’t yet been posted.

Liu said the researchers had incomplete data on the total doses of mRNA vaccines for the entire region of Ottawa. “I think that’s where the difference came in. These numbers were getting updated, so we didn’t get the full numbers.”

Flawed papers and early release of data have ignited controversy and emboldened conspiracy theorists throughout the pandemic. “We keep blaming crackpots and ideological mouthpieces for spreading misinformation about COVID and about vaccines, and it’s a huge problem,” said Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine. “But there have been a not-insignificant number of instances where mainstream science has gotten things wrong,” and which critics pick up on, instantly, Caplan said.",,,,1632462582,{},he25ilv,True,t3_pucb9p,False,False,t3_pucb9p,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pucb9p/study_claiming_1_in_1000_risk_of_heart/he25ilv/,1632596363.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The way it works is that each cycle boosts or ""amplifies"" the viral genetic material that is being tested for, relative to the previous cycle, until either (1) there's enough of said material to cause a positive indication or (2) the max cycle cutoff is reached (if you go beyond this limit, you are essentially amplifying random, low-level ""noise"" into false positives). Typical cutoffs are 35-40 cycles. This is also why PCR testing is not rapid--it takes time to do all those cycles.

So a relatively low viral load will require many more cycles of amplification (higher Ct) before producing a positive. A large load will be detectable much sooner (low Ct).

Breakthrough infections have similar Ct values on PCR but all that does is measure RNA load.  What other studies have found is that there is less replication-capable virus at peak, and that RNA load via Ct declines much faster in breakthrough infections.  That indicates that there is more noninfectious viral RNA debris in breakthrough infections.

As an anology, in a breakthrough infection the body is fighting it off faster, so at peak there are more dead soldiers rather than live ones that you're fighting.  The Ct values only measure soldiers, not live soldiers.  The analogy gets weird fast though because the immune response the body makes and the correlate of how sick you feel is just how many soldiers are around (dead or alive), and with severe hospitalized COVID your body is just pumping out tons of dead soldiers and the immune response to them can kill you, even though you're not infectious.

On the basis of the unfolding evidence, here are what I see as best practices. 
*Assuming your people are fully vaccinated:*
1. **Outdoors** if at all possible for social contact, AND still maintaining distance, OR masking, if that meter apart is too hard to bear in mind. Enjoy life with your people! Just do it outside. 
 (Example in practice: A local group takes kids 8-18 years old out into the wild.  Small groups, up to 10. Even with that immense dilution of air, with some kids unvaccinated, sometimes masking is warranted. Impossible, when one kid finds a frog, to keep ‘em spaced, so they get the kids to mask up, &amp; take turns being close to it, while they joyfully check it out.  Masks off for lunch, where spacing is easy to maintain. Off on the trail, unless you want to walk close to your buddy.  These are 8-18 year olds, &amp; they’re v. cooperative. 
Digression: I’m so grateful for volunteers who insist on carrying on, bravely, in the face of intense pressure to do nothing [“*but, liability!*”] while a mental health disaster befalls our youth. Bravo!) 
2. Minimizing time in indoor public spaces where possible - eg, I don’t dawdle as I would have done in the grocery store.  (Masked, of course. Handwashing, afterward.)

But they are likely contagious for a shorter period of time when compared with the unvaccinated, and they may harbor less infectious virus overall.

This is done ""at the expense of some degradation of normal services"", so some elective procedures will have to be postponed, said Minister of Health Ong Ye Kung at a Multi-Ministry Taskforce on Covid-19 press conference on Friday (Sept 24).

Hospitals have also been barred visitors for four weeks from Friday.

By the end of the week, MOH will increase the beds in community care facilitiesto 4,600, from about 3,500.

The Government has launched a new class of facility - community treatment facilities (CTF), which are better equipped for closer monitoring and management of Covid-19 patients with chronic illnesses. The first such facility, at the site of NTUC Health Nursing Home (Tampines), opened today.

""We have commissioned about 300 CTF beds this week,"" said Mr Ong.

In the coming weeks, MOH will open another 700 such beds at Changi Expo and another 200 at Sengkang Hospital, he added.

MOH is seeking help from private sector hospitals and the Singapore Armed Forces to help operate the CTFs.

There were 21 new cases in the ICU in the past week, up from nine in the preceding week.

As Singapore hospitals can get ready almost 300 ICU beds at short notice, this is sufficient for current needs.

About 40 per cent of infected persons are currently recovering at home, around 15-20 per cent are in hospital, while the rest are in community care facilities.

""We are monitoring the situation closely, working closely with our hospitals on our preparations and our plans to increase our ICU bed capacity as needed,"" said MOH Director of Medical Services Kenneth Mak.

Singapore's data, which is consistent with that of other countries, shows that the risk of unvaccinated persons with Covid-19 needing ICU care or dying is nearly 12 times higher than those who are vaccinated, he added.",,,,1632480574,{},he2qybm,True,t3_puh7s4,False,True,t3_puh7s4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/puh7s4/singapore_1600_icu_beds_to_be_prepared_for/he2qybm/,1632607835.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In truth, you're the one implying a connection between ""Filipinos"" and ""low skill"". My point is that a significant percent of Americans will see *any* foreign nationality as ""low skill"" or ""untrained"". Re-read my comment and you'll see that I made this blatantly clear.

So sad.

You want to explain why you think 'Filipino' is a word for 'low skill'?

NY is willing to replace its own healthcare workers with alien parties because nonachievers refuse to establish public health which BTW is their job.

How can someone misinterpret the headline by a lot.

Should locals be worried that foreigners will take their jobs?

If you demote your role from being a healthcare worker, then you shall be replaced.

The mindset doesn't make any sense. You said that Filipinos is implied as low skill yet they replace 'actual low skill workers' who refuse covid shots.

I think they did a really good job here of threading a very complicated needle.

Those fully vaxed with Pfizer (whether employed in healthcare or not) who are concerned about their own risk can self attest to what looks like a fairly wide range of health conditions and go get a booster.

But they’ve avoided making blanket recommendations (outside of 65+) for boosters that aren’t supported by risk/benefit data and that might complicate and take resources away from the much more impactful efforts to vax 12+ and under 12s.

I don't think these people understand that when you take your love one out of the ICU, you've just bought yourself front row seats to watching your love one die in an incredibly painful manner.  Like people think, ""Oh yeah it'll be bad.""  No, no, you don't understand how bad it will be.  Like twenty-four hours later, shit will get real and the thing is, you're just getting to maybe Act II of the process.

And remember this is going to be someone you ""love"" and have known for quite some time and they are going to die in front of your eyes in pain of no parallel to anything that you have ever seen.  And there's going to be plenty of very visual cues indicating that the person you love is in incredible pain.

That person from that Reddit post, they were all like ""better to die at home than in a hospital"".  He was all cocksure that he knew what he was getting himself into and I'm pretty sure about eight hours later he found himself in something he had no idea he was getting himself into.  And like I said, that's tip of the iceberg there.  All that bravery, all that ""I know better"", all of that melted and the show had just gotten started for him.

You know when a tornado hits, we can see the damage it does.  When a flood comes in, we can see the property it moves around.  When a fire is ablaze, we can see the ashen ruin afterwards.  This disaster, hospital workers have done their best to prevent the general public from seeing the true nature of this.  And maybe that's one of the problems on why there is this group that's still in doubt.  But let me tell you, you take one of these people having trouble breathing out of the hospital.

Pfizer (mRNA, though smaller dose &amp; closer spacing, which slightly reduces efficacy and durability, hence booster discussions) = 76-93% (again, Delta/Mu are 76-80%, and all strains slide from 95% max down to 93% after 6 months from 2nd dose, hence boosters).

J&amp;J/AZ (viral vector vaccine derived from adenovirus filled with COVID’s spike protein) = 60%-75% (Delta sits at ~60% for both).

SinoVac, Sputnik V/Light = &lt;50% (against Delta, questionable efficacy studied for other strains).

Covaxin, Soberana/Abdala, et al = Limited data from peer-reviewed/independent sources.

The difference in efficacy is why should avoid broadly discussing breakthrough cases.  Given the varied risk of breakthrough, if a population is more heavily reliant on a “less reliable” vaccine (still significantly better than remaining unvaxxed!), then the breakthrough rate will be higher, but this is not cause for concern (only cause for higher vaccination rates needed or greater diversity of vaccine type if this is an elevated risk population).",,,,1632500330,{},he3vlff,False,t3_publua,False,False,t1_he3br7t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/publua/no_vaccinated_people_are_not_just_as_likely_to/he3vlff/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,eed5ce133930622620d7f1310a66f0b04e9c5bc1,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1632500341.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

I think Ireland has like 30 deaths per week reported right now and the US reports around 14000 deaths per week at the moment. So if Ireland would have the population of the US then it would equal about 2000 deaths per week, so far less than the 14000 deaths that the US currently has per week.

I don't know differences in testing. I have no idea how the US tests and I'm not even entirely sure how Ireland tests at the moment. I know right now all school children are tested once a week or something. Otherwise people that test voluntarily, are sent to hospital or close contacts of positive cases if they have symptoms. I don't think close contacts are tested if they don't have symptoms but I'm not entirely sure.

For the US I have no idea how they are testing. 

Also yes Trump said to slow down testing to have less cases. The many cases and the pandemic obviously made him look bad so he wanted to do less testing so that it doesn't look as bad. Also in a way he was right though, the more thorough you test the more cases you will find. Like if you only test 100 people you may find 1 case. If you test 100,000 people you may find 1000 cases. If you test your entire population you may find a million cases or whatever depending on the population size. It's basic maths so testing more will reveal more cases, less testing means you will have less confirmed cases.

You left out the last part of that.

""previously infected.... with the DELTA VARIANT ITSELF"".

There is a huge difference.

Yes, catching the delta variant makes you more resistant... to the DELTA variant. It does NOT make you more reisistant to &lt;insert tomorrows variant here&gt;.

The vaccine targets one part of the virus that is VERY hard for the virus to change significantly, because it is the only way the virus can breach cell walls. The SPIKE protein, shared by every single variant with minimal changes and mutations thus far.

The reason delta has had MORE breakthrough infections is NOT because it is ""vaccine resistant"" - it is because it has a higher viral load and higher viral shedding rate than other variants - therefore, it's like the difference between swimming in a swimming pool filtered with salt (not very salty) and swimming in the ocean (much more salty) where salt is the virus itself.

There is MORE virus in the air with delta, which means its much easier to become infected since you have a higher initial ""dose"" of the virus.

Finally, if you have NOT had the DELTA variant specifically, and you have NOT had the vaccine, you are not only at a much higher risk of infection than a vaccinated individual, you are at a much higher risk for complications than a vaccinated individual, especially because your immune system is NOT tuned to attack the spike protein - so your immune system will take much longer to respond to the new DELTA variant that it has not seen before.

Saying being infected with covid makes you more immune than someone with the vaccine is like saying ""I got the flu last year, so I do not need a shot this year"" - it shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how the Covid vaccines work, and how the covid virus and variants themselves infect, spread, mutate, and cause disease.",,,,1632497429,{},he3okq3,False,t3_pudykd,False,True,t1_he3fs1y,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pudykd/us_cdc_director_breaks_with_panel_backs_covid19/he3okq3/,1632625245.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, my indirect risk, due to the ER/ICUs being full (and the healthcare system strained) is huge now, since they are all full.

The world has changed (we now have a new, highly infectious disease), and so our behavior has to change. At schools, work, concerts. This is not rocket science.

Also this is to TREAT covid when you already have it, you don't take it before. You can still catch covid when you're vaccinated.

&gt; It is within the police POWER OF A STATE

This is *super* misleading when it’s wiped of context.

Meaning,

**1.** Federal law trumps local law. State law cannot supersede federal law. In this case, there was no federal law so the state law didn’t contradict federal law. (Of course.)

**2.** Regardless of whether it’s a state or federal mandate, it still must be constitutional and applied fairly. (Of course.) 

**There’s nothing here that says or implies that only states can create/enforce mandates.**

Like, at all. 

[Here’s the legal explainer:](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/197/11/)

&gt; The United States does not derive any of its substantive powers from the Preamble of the Constitution. It cannot exert any power to secure the declared objects of the Constitution unless, apart from the Preamble, such power be found in, or can properly be implied from, some express delegation in the instrument.

&gt; While the spirit of the Constitution is to be respected not less than its letter, the spirit is to be collected chiefly from its words.

&gt; While the exclusion of evidence in the state court in a case involving the constitutionality of a state statute may not strictly present a Federal question, this court may consider the rejection of such evidence upon the ground of incompetency or immateriality under the statute as showing its scope and meaning in the opinion of the state court.

&gt; The police power of a State embraces such reasonable regulations relating to matters completely within its territory, and not affecting the people of other States, established directly by legislative enactment, as will protect the public health and safety.

&gt; While a local regulation, even if based on the acknowledged police power of a State, must always yield in case of conflict with the exercise by the General Government of any power it possesses under the Constitution, the mode or manner of exercising its police power is wholly within the discretion of the State so long as the Constitution of the United States is not contravened, or any right granted or secured thereby is not infringed, or not exercised in such an arbitrary and oppressive manner as to justify the interference of the courts to prevent wrong and oppression.

&gt; The liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States does not import an absolute right in each person to be at all times, and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint, nor is it an element in such liberty that one person, or a minority of persons residing in any community and enjoying the benefits of its local government, should have power to dominate the majority when supported in their action by the authority of the State.

&gt; It is within the police power of a State to enact a compulsory vaccination law, and it is for the legislature, and not for the courts, to determine in the first instance whether vaccination is or is not the best mode for the prevention of smallpox and the protection of the public health.

&gt; There being obvious reasons for such exception, the fact that children, under certain circumstances, are excepted from the operation of the law does not deny the equal protection of the laws to adults if the statute is applicable equally to all adults in like condition.

&gt; The highest court of Massachusetts not having held that the compulsory vaccination law of that State establishes the absolute rule that an adult must be vaccinated even if he is not a fit subject at the time or that vaccination would seriously injure his health or cause his death, this court holds that, as to an adult residing in the community, and a fit subject of vaccination, the statute is not invalid as in derogation of any of the rights of such person under the Fourteenth Amendment.

&gt; This case involves the validity, under the Constitution of the United States, of certain provisions in the statutes of Massachusetts relating to vaccination.

When you consider that:
 - the vaccine does not fully prevent infection and transmission, and it's in question still just how often it breaks through

 - the % of the population that can't have the vaccine is very small

 - the % of them who actually catch the virus is small when the R rate is suppressed and cases are driven down

 - the % of them who get the virus who couldn't have the vaccine, who later are hospitalised or die, is also very small (though immune suppressive comorbidities do bring this up a little)

 - variants are likely to be imported from other countries with higher case rates, as opposed to arising domestically

 - in the case of a vaccine-dodging variant, you're back to square one anyway

You realise that's it's a complex issue with many factors and the balance of probability is not clear or indeed, not yet known. 

And yes, the vaccine does have rare but relevant, and potentially lethal side effects.

It is a tricky situation due to so many unvaccinated people and probably needing to protect the vulnerable more. The data isn't clear for many groups and then there are lot of immunological questions unanswered. What is the best time to boost for maximum effect for the flu season? If you look at influenza, many old people only get a couple of months of high protection. Which schedule is the right one for best longer lasting immunity? Some vaccines work with a 6 month gap, others 12 months or something else. Too short and you might actually be worse off. You also have to consider that the vaccines could be used elsewhere and we know they would have a great effect in reducing suffering and death.

This all has to be considered and I think that the experts are trying to do just that. Everyone would want this to just be over but giving out boosters to everyone might not be the silver bullet it's made out to be.

I don’t read Spanish so I can’t do the math for you. But, if you have 69% of your population fully vaccinated and if truly 50% of all deaths for the past 2 months were vaccinated people, [the Implied Vaccine Effectiveness Calculator](https://sanfordgordon.shinyapps.io/impliedefficacy/) tells us that unvaccinated people are 2.2 times as likely to die as a vaccinated one. But, again, we need to be looking at all the deaths during the delta wave (so how many deaths were vaccinated v. unvaccinated since, say, July 1? I’d be **very** surprised if it was 50% over that time frame) and then run them through the Calculator before we can say what the numbers really show here.",,,,1632488763,{},he34zjl,False,t3_pui0wg,False,True,t1_he2w0dj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pui0wg/can_we_talk_about_the_rates_of_covid_death_among/he34zjl/,1632615103.0,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

1). The Troubles were still a thing 30 years ago.  Of course that was based in Northern Ireland but the negative effects also spilled over into The Republic.  

2). The economy was getting stronger by 1991, but historically the Republic of Ireland had a consistently weak economy from independence through until at least the 1980s.  

3).  The Catholic Church still had way too much influence on Irish society and the Irish government.  Like the shitty economy, the Church was another thing that had been dragging Ireland down since the 1920s.

Then, in the last 30 years, the Irish managed to break the toxic stranglehold the Church had over them, while also ending (though, God knows, N.I. still has its problems) the Troubles with the Good Friday accords, and while somehow establishing the type of strong economy that had eluded them for 60+ years.

IMO, thirty years ago Ireland was languishing, and had been since its independence.  It was a country that couldn't seem to deal with its problems.

If the city runs out of AstraZeneca vaccines, people who have received the first shot with AstraZeneca will be offered the Pfizer vaccine for the second shot.  
  
Nguyễn Hữu Hưng, deputy head of the city Department of Health, said the vaccine efficacy of AstraZeneca with an interval of six weeks between shots is 59.7 per cent against any symptoms, even mild symptoms, according to some studies.   
  
Australia has also reduced the interval for AstraZeneca to six weeks, saying that an interval of between four and eight weeks is preferred in an outbreak situation, according to a report in The Guardian on September 3.   
  
The Ministry of Health, which approved shortening the interval between AstraZeneca vaccine doses to six weeks, said that AstraZeneca vaccine manufacturers had recommended an interval between four and 12 weeks. At 12 weeks, the efficacy rate against any symptoms goes up to 80 per cent, according to some studies.  
  
Ventilator usage drops  
  
Speaking at a press meeting on September 23, the city Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control said the number of severe COVID-19 cases using ventilators at hospitals in the city fell to 2,056 on September 22 from 2,234 on September 20 and 2,350 on September 18.    
  
The committee said the drop in the number of severe cases using ventilators at hospitals was a positive sign for COVID-19 prevention and control.  
  
Nguyễn Hồng Tâm, deputy head of the city Centre for Diseases Control and Prevention, said the rate of  positive COVID-19 cases in the mass testing campaign on September 22-29 fell compared to the previous campaign.  
  
The positive rate in safe, low-risk green zones was 0.1 per cent, 0.5 per cent for high-risk orange zones, and 0.7 per cent for very high-risk red zones.    
  
From August 23 to September 15, the rate of people testing positive for coronavirus in red zones was 3.6 per cent. —VNS",,,,1632492378,{},he3cq7a,True,t3_puki19,False,True,t3_puki19,/r/Coronavirus/comments/puki19/vietnam_hcm_city_shortens_interval_between/he3cq7a/,1632619136.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

That's it. The members strongly opposed kept reminding people the only thing they're supposed to be considering was whether the evidence showed a need in regards to hospitalization. The ones opposed are not saying there's no benefit in preventing infections that knock you on your butt for a week, to spreading it to others, to preventing long covid, to prevent whatever long term effects of the damage we have yet to understand... The *only* thing they're basing their decision on is hospitalization/death. The obvious long list of problems with that is why I believe there's such a wide divide among experts when there's obviously little in the data showing people under 50 are at risk of hospitalizations.

A number of panel members were also obviously convinced widespread boosters would undermine the campaign to get the remaining unvaxxed their first two. This was clearly influencing votes, and the evidence that's true is virtually non-existent, consisting of a poll where 1/3rd said it would increase their hesitance, but there's good reason to distrust their honesty. They also failed to take into account that overruling the FDA would also seriously undermine trust in recommendations.

Finally, it's hard to take any claim of risk seriously when a BMI of 25 or hypertension is enough to change the risk/benefit equation. They don't have data there's elevated risk; what data there is shows it's similar to the 2nd shot. And that risk applies only to 18-20 males.

&gt;**What We Know about Vaccine Breakthrough Infections**

&gt;* Vaccine breakthrough infections are expected. COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing most infections. However, like other vaccines, they are not 100% effective.
* Fully vaccinated people with a vaccine breakthrough infection are less likely to develop serious illness than those who are unvaccinated and get COVID-19.
* Even when fully vaccinated people develop symptoms, they tend to be less severe symptoms than in unvaccinated people. This means they are much less likely to be hospitalized or die than people who are not vaccinated.
* **People who get vaccine breakthrough infections can be contagious.**",,,,1632491817,{},he3bgzb,False,t3_publua,False,False,t1_he32jcc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/publua/no_vaccinated_people_are_not_just_as_likely_to/he3bgzb/,1632618468.0,17,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,GreunLight,,,[],,,,text,t2_bz91eiwq,False,True,,"&gt; Those cases are about powers of states.  Not the Federal government.

That’s untrue. I’m kinda baffled how the reading of [*Jacobson v Massachusetts*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/197us11) got turned on its head.

*Jacobson* essentially says three things: 

1. Federal law trumps local law. State law cannot supersede federal law. In this case, there was no federal law so the state law didn’t contradict federal law. (Of course.)

2. Regardless of whether it’s a state or federal mandate, it still must be constitutional and applied fairly. (Of course.)

3. States enforce local and state mandates. (Of course states would enforce federal mandates, just like they do for OSHA or anything else.)

There’s nothing here that says or implies that only states can create/enforce mandates.

Like, at all.

Here’s the legal explainer:

&gt; The United States does not derive any of its substantive powers from the Preamble of the Constitution. It cannot exert any power to secure the declared objects of the Constitution unless, apart from the Preamble, such power be found in, or can properly be implied from, some express delegation in the instrument.

&gt; While the spirit of the Constitution is to be respected not less than its letter, the spirit is to be collected chiefly from its words.

&gt; While the exclusion of evidence in the state court in a case involving the constitutionality of a state statute may not strictly present a Federal question, this court may consider the rejection of such evidence upon the ground of incompetency or immateriality under the statute as showing its scope and meaning in the opinion of the state court.

&gt; The police power of a State embraces such reasonable regulations relating to matters completely within its territory, and not affecting the people of other States, established directly by legislative enactment, as will protect the public health and safety.

&gt; While a local regulation, even if based on the acknowledged police power of a State, must always yield in case of conflict with the exercise by the General Government of any power it possesses under the Constitution, the mode or manner of exercising its police power is wholly within the discretion of the State so long as the Constitution of the United States is not contravened, or any right granted or secured thereby is not infringed, or not exercised in such an arbitrary and oppressive manner as to justify the interference of the courts to prevent wrong and oppression.

&gt; The liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States does not import an absolute right in each person to be at all times, and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint, nor is it an element in such liberty that one person, or a minority of persons residing in any community and enjoying the benefits of its local government, should have power to dominate the majority when supported in their action by the authority of the State.

&gt; It is within the police power of a State to enact a compulsory vaccination law, and it is for the legislature, and not for the courts, to determine in the first instance whether vaccination is or is not the best mode for the prevention of smallpox and the protection of the public health.

&gt; There being obvious reasons for such exception, the fact that children, under certain circumstances, are excepted from the operation of the law does not deny the equal protection of the laws to adults if the statute is applicable equally to all adults in like condition.

&gt; The highest court of Massachusetts not having held that the compulsory vaccination law of that State establishes the absolute rule that an adult must be vaccinated even if he is not a fit subject at the time or that vaccination would seriously injure his health or cause his death, this court holds that, as to an adult residing in the community, and a fit subject of vaccination, the statute is not invalid as in derogation of any of the rights of such person under the Fourteenth Amendment.

&gt; This case involves the validity, under the Constitution of the United States, of certain provisions in the statutes of Massachusetts relating to vaccination.

First of all, the article says:
""Ivermectin is almost exclusively used to treat parasites in horses and cattle and, in rare instances, humans. ""

Rare instances? It was used as a treatment for humans before livestock, and it is used by about 250 million people worldwide on a yearly basis to treat parasitic infections. (Hardly rare). 

Also according to the article, New Mexico poison control has had 20 reports of exposure, which is double what is normal. And MOST (not all) are related to Covid. So of the 10 more than usual, not all were even related to Covid?

So the story here is that in an entire state, 8 people have contacted poison control about exposure to ivermectin due to covid?

&gt;Here's a peer-reviewed study that shows where intramuscular vaccines (which all three of the COVID-19 vaccines are) travel in macaques (a type of monkey). Vaccines mostly remain near the site of injection (the arm muscle) and local lymph nodes.   
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense: Lymph nodes produce white blood cells and antibodies to protect us from disease. A key part of the lymphatic system, lymph nodes also clean up fluids and remove waste materials. Finding pieces of spike protein in the lymph nodes is completely normal, because lymph nodes act as the trash removal service for the body. That means the vaccine did its job (made spike proteins, which caused the creation of antibodies) and will be cleared from the body.

[https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/where-mrna-vaccines-and-spike-proteins-go](https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/where-mrna-vaccines-and-spike-proteins-go)

&gt;The lymph fluid carries the waste products and destroyed bacteria back into the bloodstream. The liver or kidneys then remove these from the blood. The body passes them out with other body waste, through bowel movements (poo) or urine (pee).

In the vaccinated, it gets lost in a maze of dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs. Every so often, it pieces together an escape route, but in most scenarios, it finds itself cut off, and its journey ends. It can go no further.

For the rare escape route scenario, I often think about the Houston outdoors tent wedding that required vaccination of all attendees and got really unlucky with one bringing the Delta variant over from India--several getting infected, with one death. Circumstances would have been much worse without the precautions and vaccination requirement, but just goes to show that there is the unlucky escape route out there.

Moreover, me as a vaccinated person am more likely to spread it unknowingly, as i'm much less likely to have symptoms than unvaxxed people who could easily then choose to stay at home if they feel unwell.

So, taken this into account, if anything, wouldn't that mean that me as a vaccinated person could be actually be spreading it wider (uknowingly of course) compared to the unvaccinated?

Add to this that unvaxxinated are mostly cut out of life in most parts of the world, while for vaccinated the life continues as normal, so there's way more events and contacts where they would (unknowingly) spread the virus.

&gt;  
&gt;More than a third of COVID-19 infections result in zero protective antibodies

Well that was enlightening. Today I learned that 100% of people who don't have natural immunity, don't have natural immunity, therefore natural immunity is *not* better. /s Saying that you may not have natural immunity following a COVID infection is different from saying natural immunity itself is ineffective.

Additionally, my understanding is that humans have multiple forms of immune memory and antibodies is just one of them, so isn't it actually dishonest and misleading to even have this bullet point? It insinuates antibodies are the sole vanguard of lasting immunity, which is factually untrue? Correct me if I'm wrong.

&gt;Natural immunity fades faster than vaccine immunity

[6-8 months is faster than the vaccine?](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf4063) Is that why we're administering boosters now?

&gt;Natural immunity alone is less than half as effective than natural immunity plus vaccination

Fair point, but which is more effective by itself, vaccination or natural immunity?

&gt;underlying health conditions

Interesting, which underlying conditions cause individuals to be more likely to become *infected* with COVID-19? My understanding is that underlying conditions were a driver of serious illness and death *when* infected, but I've never heard of conditions other than compromised immune systems being a predictor of actual infection.

But the large scale data just isn’t there yet for booster benefits for those younger than 65 even including those with underlying health conditions or in high exposure occupations.

They did decide to allow for boosters for under 65 with underlying health conditions on an individual basis due to concerns about anecdotal reports of hospitalizations in that group.

From listening to the meeting it was clear that all of the committee members were very focused on the primary goal of reducing hospitalizations and were very intent on following the science. Unfortunately the science just isn’t there yet for under 65 that would allow for blanket recommendations.

To quote this article 


Use of highly pure antigens to improve vaccine safety has led to reduced vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. This has led to the need to use adjuvants to improve vaccine immunogenicity. The ideal adjuvant should maximize vaccine immunogenicity without compromising tolerability or safety. Unfortunately, adjuvant research has lagged behind other vaccine areas such as antigen discovery, with the consequence that only a very limited number of adjuvants based on aluminium salts, monophosphoryl lipid A and oil emulsions are currently approved for human use. Recent strategic initiatives to support adjuvant development by the National Institutes of Health should translate into greater adjuvant choices in the future. Mechanistic studies have been valuable for better understanding of adjuvant action, but mechanisms of adjuvant toxicity are less well understood. The inflammatory or danger-signal model of adjuvant action implies that increased vaccine reactogenicity is the inevitable price for improved immunogenicity.

[],,Assume_Utopia,,,[],,,,text,t2_3xfzkkjh,False,False,[],"From everything I've read, it seems to me like a big the reason the Delta variant is so problematic is that it replicates very fast. So you breath some of it in, and it starts to replicate very quickly. I think I also read there's data that it can live in more places in the body, like it can replicate in the sinuses, not just deep in the lungs (although I can't find a source for that now), so it can start replicating sooner and potentially with a smaller exposure?

But if you're vaccinated, your immune system is primed to respond, so it reacts very quickly. With the earlier variants, your immune system would almost always respond faster than the virus could replicate, and you'd snuff it out before developing symptoms and before you had a high enough viral load to spread it. With Delta, it seems like most people's immune systems still react fast enough to either get rid of it right away, or at least to ""catch up"" and start fighting it before symptoms get serious.

But that still means that if Delta gets going there can be a period where it's replicating faster than your body is destroying it, and you'll be infectious. Hopefully, you'll also have symptoms for most of that period. But it seems like it's still possible in vaccinated people for Delta to be replicating and creating a high viral load and be spreadable before symptoms show up. 

Of course an unvaccinated person is in serious trouble. Without the vaccine our bodies struggled to react fast enough to the earlier variants to avoid serious symptoms, and Delta is much easier to catch/transmit, possibly because it seems to replicate very quickly, so even a small exposure can be enough for it to get a ""toe hold"".",,,,1632499699,{},he3u2uj,False,t3_publua,False,False,t1_he3nk25,/r/Coronavirus/comments/publua/no_vaccinated_people_are_not_just_as_likely_to/he3u2uj/,1632628092.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Green box = per 100K rates of red box data
Purple box = Implied effectiveness of vaccine from green box data
Orange box = 7-day average effectiveness from green box data

 Notes:

•	⁠Gov't doesn't release hosp./ICU data on Sunday and Monday’s anymore so I post the following Tuesday.
•	⁠My per 100K rates vary from the government's because they do not offset cases by 14 days. I am of the opinion a 14 day offset is the correct way to adjust for the known incubation period of Covid-19.
•	⁠My per 100K rates vary from enterprisevalue's because he has adjusted them for &gt;12yrs. I want to keep it consistent because around December &lt;12yo's will be approved for a vaccine and then the data won't be as easily comparable.
•	⁠This data is provided without vaccine specifics, so all vaccines are averaged out in these numbers. No way to know the effectiveness of Pfizer vs. Moderna vs. AZ vs. others.
•	⁠Spreadsheet sourcecode for the naysayers: https://i.imgur.com/6BpWoGB.png

""The test batch we produced earlier has met Russia's quality requirements,"" the spokesman Pham Duy Long said by telephone, adding the company aimed to produce more than 1 million doses in the first month, and gradually increase its capacity.

Another article in Vietnamese cites that the Vietnamese manufacturer would be Vabiotech. Expected production capacity in the immediate future would be 5M doses per month (60M per year), and capable of raising it to 100M per year.

I believe surgical masks beneficial to patient outcomes. I also believe masks can help control covid in the right environment. Equating the two settings weakens the story for masks for covid because the two are not close to equivalent. Please do not do it. 

Masking makes sense in low vaccination and high case rate ares, no doubt. Where I have problems with masks and covid is in areas that are highly vaccinated and have low case rates. I believe mandates in these settings (like the bay area in CA) do more to harm mental health and moral than they help reduce cases. They also create mask theater when entering restaurants and bars which also undermines the actual benefit masks can offer in the right setting.

And I will not argue that there are not those who have real, significant, and consistent religious/moral issues with the use of fetal cells in developing medicines.  I accept this as a reality..

However, one cannot legitimately choose to take a moral/religious stance on the Covid 19 vaccine for this reason, and not take the same moral/religious stance on other medicines with the same provenance.    In addition to the medicines listed earlier, that also means abstaining from (at least) vaccines for rubella (and the associated MMRV vaccine for children), chickenpox, rabies, hepatitis A, and shingles.

The National Catholic BioEthics Center offers this advice:  ""One is morally free to use the vaccine regardless of its historical association with abortion. The reason is that the risk to public health, if one chooses not to vaccinate, outweighs the legitimate concern about the origins of the vaccine. This is especially important for parents, who have a moral obligation to protect the life and health of their children and those around them. ""  Of course, because the Catholic Church does endorse &amp; encourage the use of such vaccines does not mean that all religious people will reach the same conclusion.

While moral/religious concerns may dictate abstaining from all of the above (and others), it's firmly established that rejecting vaccines (not just Covid) does not mean being exempt from the consequences of being unvaccinated. For example, if one wishes to not allow their children to be vaccinated against rubella, MMRV, and chickenpox, it may not be possible to send those children to public schools (Or a lot of private schools.)  Valid home-schooling is an option.  It isn't possible to work in many jobs that require vaccination for those other illnesses, either.

CVS takes your word for it if you say you qualify due to a health condition.   For a lot of people this is true.  E.g., the CDC lists being overweight as a health condition that increases COVID risk.

- “Overweight and obesity
Overweight (defined as a body mass index (BMI) &gt; 25 kg/m2 but &lt; 30 kg/m2), obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2 but &lt; 40 kg/m2), or severe obesity (BMI of ≥40 kg/m2), can make you more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19.  The risk of severe COVID-19 illness increases sharply with elevated BMI.“

Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, Bleach, Vitamin D, you name it. Antivax sentiment depends a lot how it's directed, and there's no indication that it would prevent them from taking a new pill that might help covid  


Truth be told this is a very poor article, it's basing its whole argument on two people that we don't even know if they got a placebo or not. It's null in regard to how good this actual medicine might actually be. But if the worry is that antivax people are going to not take the vaccine because of this, it's honestly overblown. Antivax don't care for an actual reason to not take the vaccine, they're always moving the goalpoast, just name an argument ""the vaccines were developed to fast"", ""covid is just a flu"", ""there's a microchip in the vaccine"", or ""Covid is a Chinese ploy to undermine the west"". Any reason those people can come with to not be vaccinated is honestly an excuse.  


Besides that, what's the idea here? That  there should be no investment in developing medicines that can help people that have been vaccinated and got infected? Or people that just cannot take the vaccine for one reason or another?

&gt; While some form of vaccination mandate is presumed likely given Biden’s comments on the topic, the particular contours of what safety guidance contractors must adhere to are governed by the forthcoming task force guidance and resultant contract clause.

&gt; Note, however, that under existing task force guidance agencies are already required to demand proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test from contractor employees that work on-site at government facilities and from visitors to those same facilities. Absent proof of vaccination or a timely negative COVID test (taken within 3 days of the visit), the contractor employee or visitor will be subject to unvaccinated protocols. Such individuals must generally wear masks regardless of community transmission level, physically distance, and comply with travel requirements for not fully vaccinated individuals.

_My_ interpretation was that the study that was conducted relied on people who got tested. In theory, a vaccinated person might go to get tested at the same level of symptoms as an unvaccinated person - resulting in very similar viral loads.

In this interpretation, in vaccinated people the amount of virus doesn't climb as rapidly and declines more quickly than it would in someone who is not vaccinated. So while the initial viral loads are similar at the time of testing, they probably increase faster for longer than in someone who is not vaccinated.

1. No infection
2. Infected but asymptomatic

You can argue more delineation among four different states but that's how I see largely see it.

Before the delta, people who were vaccinated more or less stayed with states 1 and 2 with a small number getting to states 3 and 4. At the time (again, before delta), the view was that asymptomatic individuals were unlikely to have enough viral load to be transmissible.

However, with the delta, it appears that more people are getting to states 3 and 4 - my hypothesis is that (I'm not an academic so treat it as just a POV) COVID was always highly transmissible when you get to states 3 and 4 even with the variants before the delta but the states 3 and 4 were rare with the previous variant.

One of the more recent technological breakthroughs in 2005 was using modified nucleosides to evade the immune system before the payload could be delivered.  Moderna and Biontech were founded a few years after based in part on this technology.  mRNA vaccines for other diseases happened to be nearing clinical trials when the pandemic hit.

The pandemic helped accelerate development in three main ways.  First it removes administrative hurdles.  You're going straight to the front of any line for review.  People are going to be called in on weekends and from their vacation if they need to be.  Second is funding.  There was a massive injection of funds towards the technology both from countries pre-purchasing the vaccine and redirecting internal budgets.  You can move a lot quicker when money isn't an issue.  Instead of getting bottlenecked by an instrument or a manufacturing process you can throw money at it and run things in parallel.  Lastly are the clinical trials.  Lots of people were clamoring to join any vaccine trial they could in the hopes of protecting themselves and helping the cause of science.  Also the nature of a highly infectious and widespread disease means you hit you target number of infections quicker that you need to calculate a vaccine efficacy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The genesis of the polybasic (furin) cleavage site in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been subject to recurrent speculation. Although the furin cleavage site is absent from the closest known relatives of SARS-CoV-2 (Andersen et al., 2020), this is unsurprising because the lineage leading to this virus is poorly sampled and the closest bat viruses have divergent spike proteins due to recombination (Boni et al., 2020; Lytras et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021). **Furin cleavage sites are commonplace in other coronavirus spike proteins, including some feline alphacoronaviruses, MERS-CoV, most but not all strains of mouse hepatitis virus, as well as in endemic human betacoronaviruses such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (Gombold et al., 1993; de Haan et al., 2008; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016). A near identical nucleotide sequence is found in the spike gene of the bat coronavirus HKU9-1 (Gallaher, 2020), and both SARS-CoV-2 and HKU9-1 contain short palindromic sequences immediately upstream of this sequence that are indicative of natural recombination break-points via template switching (Gallaher, 2020). Hence, simple evolutionary mechanisms can readily explain the evolution of an out-of-frame insertion of a furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2 ).**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Here we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of coronavirus spike proteins and mapped furin recognition motif on the tree. **Furin cleavage sites occurred independently for multiple times in the evolution of the coronavirus family, supporting the natural occurring hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2.**

""Comparing SARS-CoV-2 natural immunity to vaccine-induced immunity: reinfections versus breakthrough infections"":

&gt; SARS-CoV-2-naïve vaccinees had a 13.06-fold (95% CI, 8.08 to 21.11) increased risk for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant compared to those previously infected, when the first event (infection or vaccination) occurred during January and February of 2021. The increased risk was significant (P&lt;0.001) for symptomatic disease as well. When allowing the infection to occur at any time before vaccination (from March 2020 to February 2021), evidence of waning natural immunity was demonstrated, though SARS-CoV-2 naïve vaccinees had a 5.96-fold (95% CI, 4.85 to 7.33) increased risk for breakthrough infection and a 7.13-fold (95% CI, 5.51 to 9.21) increased risk for symptomatic disease. SARS-CoV-2-naïve vaccinees were also at a greater risk for COVID-19-related-hospitalizations compared to those that were previously infected.

&gt; This study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity.  Individuals who were both previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and given a single dose of the vaccine gained additional protection against the Delta variant.
