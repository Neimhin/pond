There is nothing unexpected about the fact that the wider the covid vaccination campaign is, the more you hear of rare side effects. AstraZeneca vaccines cause incidental blood clots and Pfizer / BioNTech vaccines cause myocarditis.

&amp;#x200B;

  
**In Israel, between December 2020 and May 2021, 275 cases of myocarditis were reported among more than 5 million vaccinated people. That's 0.0055 percent. In a report submitted on June 1 to the local health ministry, scientists estimated the emergence of such a threat with a frequency of 1 in 3,000 people. up to 1 in 6 thousand young men between the ages of 16 and 24.**

  
**It was initially uncertain whether immunization had a role in causing heart problems at all, but the Israeli health department in its study published on Tuesday clearly states that ""there is a likely link between receivingthe second dose of Pfizer vaccine for the development of myocarditis in men 16 to 30 years of age. ' And this is the main reason why websites started spreading this information to races - after all, mass covid vaccinations began to be carried out among teenagers.**

&amp;#x200B;

**And the mentioned relationship was most often observed in boys between 16 and 19 years of age. Complications. How many parents will be scared? So let's emphasize right away: the side effect of myocarditis is extremely rare and, in most cases, mild. In general, he required four days of hospitalization and the heart disturbance disappeared after a few weeks, which is typical for this disease (most often seen so far in people who had an acute viral infection, such as the flu).** 

&amp;#x200B;

Detecting the current correlation is unlikely to lead to a decision to stop vaccinating children and adolescents, just as the European Medicines Agency or the US FDA have not suspended the use of AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson vector vaccines in women despite reported cases of thrombosis. Yes, some countries have withdrawn from these preparations, so they will probably also carefully analyze Israeli statistics, but it should not be expected that the observed incidents will dissuade anyone from vaccinating for covid among the youngest. 

&amp;#x200B;

But some experts are already suggesting that teens should only be given one dose (since the abovementioned cardiac disturbances occurred after the second). And prof. Dror Mevorach of the Jerusalem Hadassah Medical Center and the lead author of the report on myocarditis after the Pfizer vaccine stated in the Israeli press that, unlike hard recommendations for adults, the decision to vaccinate children will be left to parents who should be aware of the risk of these rare complications . Therefore, he predicts, only half will choose to do so. 

&amp;#x200B;

Risk of side effects Each country in the world has a different epidemic situation and a different level of vaccination of citizens. Therefore, decisions made in, for example, Israel should not be transferred to Poland. Israeli experts may comment on the vaccination of adolescents in a less urgent tone, as more than 70 percent. of citizens of this country over the age of 20 have already been fully immunized with two doses. In Poland, 43 percent have so far been vaccinated with a minimum of one dose. society, and two - only 22 percent. Therefore, the popularization of vaccinations in the youngest age groups (from June 7, the Pfizer vaccine will be able to vaccinate children from the age of 12) is much more important in our country in accelerating the achievement of population herd immunity. 

&amp;#x200B;

Reports of possible side effects that have not been identified during clinical trials of vaccines (and therefore not included in the information leaflets on their safety and risk of side effects) should not be viewed ominously. This is not an argument against giving up such immunization. Each drug or vaccine preparation can cause unforeseen effects in individual patients - the leaflets of all drugs list them in detail, and yet we take the risk every time, applying specificity to pain, fever, acute and chronic ailments. Israeli health officials first reported cases of myocarditis in adolescents who were vaccinated a few days earlier with the second dose of Pfizer in April. At about the same time, Americans began to watch closely 14 people who developed similar disorders. In mid-May, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that it was starting to analyze these reports, and on May 28, European Medicines Agency officials announced that they had received 107 signals of myocarditis after receiving the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine (one in 175,000). administered doses). 

&amp;#x200B;

H**owever, relatively few people under the age of 30 have been vaccinated in Europe so far, and therefore the Israeli and American experiences are now the most complete in the world. And they seem to be the most reliable. Inflammatory response to mRNA Even if the link between myocarditis and vaccine is apparent, the disease is usually mild, while covid infection can cause long-term complications even in adolescents. Thus, the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks,** **even for young people, who were generally less ill than the oldest generation.**

&amp;#x200B;

As in the case of thrombosis after administration of vector vaccines, it is not yet fully clear why mRNA vaccines may increase the risk of myocarditis. in addition, only in male adolescents. It is worth remembering that such disorders are generally more common in them than in women. But researchers hypothesize that the very high levels of antibodies that develop in young people in response to a highly immunogenic vaccine could, in rare cases, lead to an excessive immune response that would trigger the disease. The innate immune system can treat the mRNA introduced into cells as a kind of natural adjuvant (immune response enhancer that is added to traditional vaccines) and hence the body's inflammatory response can get out of control in some cases.

&amp;#x200B;

 In the pages of ""Science"" there are statements of scientists who ask the question, in the face of these unforeseen reactions, a delay in the second dose of the vaccine would reduce the possible risk. There will be an opportunity to see for yourself as several countries have extended the dose interval from the three weeks recommended by Pfizer to 12 or even 16 - so in the coming months the answer will come as to whether the risk of myocarditis has decreased with the delay of the second dose. Another suggestion is to lower the mRNA load contained in the vaccine administered to adolescents. 

&amp;#x200B;

For now, it is identical to the preparations for adults, but Pfizer and Moderna are already testing lower doses in children under 12 years of age and the results of these studies will also be known in the coming months. and even 16 - in the coming months, the answer will therefore emerge whether the risk of myocarditis has decreased with the delay of the second dose.

Ido not question the results of the research published in the reputable journal ""Nature"" or the BioRxiv portal, although the first was conducted on a fairly small sample (77 people), and the second was presented in the form of the so-called preprint, i.e. it has not yet been reviewed or verified.

  
It is worth remembering, however, that the individual immunity in the case of many viral infections - such as influenza, SARS and those caused by common rhinoviruses or coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2 is not the first one that we have learned) - there are many variables that decide, and you should be careful when drawing universal conclusions. It is enough for a new, specific variant of the germ to emerge and you can become infected again. These recurrent infections are due more to the variability of microbes that our immune system cannot respond to quickly, and not to the strength of the immune response itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also read: A tablet for covid and a shout? Pfizer blazes the trail Long-term durability. An unsupported hypothesis? 

&amp;#x200B;

According to a study published by researchers at Washington University in St. Louis in the pages of the journal ""Nature"", immune cells that retain the so-called virus memory, they persist in the bone marrow for a long time and can produce antibodies when needed. It is about plasmocytes, which arise as a result of the stimulation of B lymphocytes, capable of producing antibodies. Americans detected them in people even seven to eight months after the infection ended. In turn, a study conducted at Rockefeller University in New York, presented on the BioRxiv website, showed that cells responsible for immune memory, i.e. T cells, mature and strengthen for at least six months after the first covid infection.

&amp;#x200B;

Although the so-called neutralizing antibodies decline over time, other immune cells provide permanent protection in the event that a germ they already know enters the body. Read also: mRNA vaccines are effective with the Indian variant In both cases, the conclusions are similar - resistance to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is not short-lived and lasts for many months. In addition, vaccinations can extend it, which is very comforting and should be an additional incentive for those who hesitate to immunize. In the New York Times, Dr. Scott Hensley, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania, commented that the natural immunity produced in survivors by infection and vaccination ""seems long-lasting."" But does this mean that people who recovered from covid and took the vaccine will not need the booster doses that are increasingly being talked about in the context of the fall or next season? Many have already come to that conclusion, but perhaps a little prematurely. 

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, such a hypothesis does not necessarily hold true for everyone. There is a group of people - unfortunately it is difficult to estimate how numerous - which, after covid, and does not elicit a strong immune response after vaccination. Perhaps, to protect themselves from the risk of contracting covid with successive waves of growth in the number of infections, such people will need to be vaccinated again. 

&amp;#x200B;

The flu analogy is obvious. I will not be surprised if in some time it will be possible to immunize against both viruses at one time, just as multi-component vaccines can protect children against several infectious diseases today. Read also: Novavax protein vaccine soon in Europe Versatile guardians of immunity According to the authors of both studies, immune memory B cells, produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and then boosted with vaccinations, become exemplary prepared in case of re-infection with this germ. And even its various variants. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only question is are scientists who make such optimistic conclusions today able to predict the behavior of the coronavirus in the near future? And how can they be sure that the set of antibodies they are protecting now will prove effective against variants that may emerge in some time? Both the immune memory acquired after disease and the one acquired through vaccination are organized slightly differently. But fighting a live virus is different from responding to a single virus protein introduced by a vaccine. In addition, it is worth remembering that B lymphocytes produce antibodies against a variety of enemy-antigens, but it is T lymphocytes that receive signals from the body's own tissues, thanks to which they can distinguish infected cells from healthy ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is some of them that are so educated that they become memory cells, stay in the body for many years in case of recurring pathogens. They sit in the lymph nodes and wait for the germs to attack again. And from the aforementioned American research, we also know that some coronavirus-specific immune cells can survive in the bone marrow after the acute infection has subsided, from where it constantly secretes low levels of antibodies. In a healthy organism, i.e. with a full response of the immune system, both memory cells and the defense division responsible for the production of neutralizing antibodies (IgM, IgG, IgA) should be activated. 

&amp;#x200B;

But in practice, some people defend themselves more strongly against infections with antibodies alone, because they have few T lymphocytes, others have few antibodies, but their cellular response is strong enough to eliminate the infection. Also read: Why is it still possible to get infected after vaccination? Much depends on age. And the virus To make things even more confusing: there are differences in the immune response according to age. Older people produce less and less naive T lymphocytes, i.e. cells capable of recognizing and reacting to new antigens previously unknown to the body. Fortunately, there are still immune memory cells that predominate among the T cells of the elderly, so that the acquired immune system will respond reasonably well to those antigens and germs it already knows. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the years, the proportions of individual elements of the immune system also change: the percentage of memory cells against naive T lymphocytes increases, as well as cells that inhibit the immune response, the so-called regulatory T lymphocytes, finally, the number and proportion of B-cells in the blood that produce antibodies are reduced. Depending on so many variables (age, efficiency of the immune system, new variants of germs) it is difficult to predict what the resistance to covid will develop in individual cases. And we are dealing with a germ that has linked the ability to infect the upper respiratory tract, similar to other viruses that cause classic colds, with the deadly traits exhibited by the SARS and MERS coronaviruses. 

&amp;#x200B;

So there is no guarantee that immunity after disease and two-dose or one-time vaccination will be strong enough to protect everyone for years, especially if SARS-CoV-2 returns in the form of various variants that may always, at least partially, bypass the body's defenses. . Then - in the context of the emergence of new mutations - additional vaccinations may be inevitable, although on a voluntary basis, only those who want to use them will probably use them.

I've flown twice in the past 5 weeks, and I've seen most people wearing masks either completely loose around their face, under their nose or under their chin, or some not at all.

And not ONE was stopped by any authorities, arrested or fined, or expelled from the Airport.

One passenger on my flight to Townsville even stood inside the Gate Terminal NOT wearing any face mask at all, and the Airline Crew LET HIM BOARD REGARDLESS and fly to Townsville NOT WEARING ANY facemask whatsoever.

Then, let's look at the Cabin Safety Demonstration: One Airline has their Crew give the demonstration WITHOUT WEARING A FACE MASK ""so they can show passengers how to properly apply an oxygen mask"" (probably when any passengers who boarded the Aircraft already well infected with Covid-19 already suddenly have trouble breathing during the flight and NEED it... Yeah, they don't screen anybody anymore, do they? Covid-19 Dog, Covid-19 Breath Test, etc...? NONE).

Then, after the demonstration it's a message to all passengers that it is a Federal requirement to wear a face mask at all times while travelling onboard... Right before they announce that ""In a few minutes, our Cabin Crew will serve in-flight snacks and drinks"".

SERIOUSLY.

I won't talk about how some people on International flights IN to Australia get ""mistakenly"" waved through to an area that they're NOT supposed to be in, huh?

So, tell me again how exactly it's not likely...

Of course, WHO has been all about the politics rather than public health since the start. Remember ""no evidence of human to human transmission"" on Jan 14?

The bottleneck is rarely the injections. It's the supply. China got a high pace because it initially had problems with distributing it, so they built up a stockpile. Once they reported COVID outbreaks, that unwillingness solved itself. Once their stockpile is spent, their pace will slow.

They are projecting to produce 3 billion doses by the end of 2021, same as the EU. This is barely enough to cover their own population, assuming only two doses each, let alone export enormous amounts.

None the less, Global Vaccine production should be 8 billion or so by year end. More than half the world should be protected.

Those case counts are now so low, the virus is so well contained, that this will be our final weekly map.

&gt;By the numbers: The U.S. averaged roughly 16,500 new cases per day over the past week, a 30% improvement over the week before. New cases declined in 43 states and held steady in the other seven.

&gt;The official case counts haven‚Äôt been this low since Americans went into lockdown in March last year ‚Äî when the pandemic was still new, no one knew how long this would go on, and inadequate testing meant that cases were undercounted.

&gt;Overall, roughly 33 million Americans ‚Äî about 10% of the population ‚Äî have tested positive for COVID-19.

&gt;About 595,000 people have died from the virus in the U.S., making it deadlier for Americans than the past 80 years of wars and other armed military conflicts combined, including World War II.

&gt;The U.S. largely failed to contain the virus until the vaccines arrived.

&gt;Cities and businesses began shutting down last March. From there, the virus rolled into a second wave last summer, when cases climbed to over 65,000 per day, on average, and hospitals in many parts of the country said they were overwhelmed.

&gt;That failure was then eclipsed in the winter, when hundreds of thousands of people per day were contracting the virus and deaths climbed over 3,000 per day for about a month.

&gt;But now, the virus really is under control, nationwide and in every state, thanks almost entirely to the vaccines.

The amount of people I know or have at least tertiary contact with that treat this whole situation like a farce infuriates me. Death is no joke, and a novel virus that is completely unpredictable and unknown to us for the most part up until now is no joke.

I have never said we should not have gotten the vaccine when we needed it, I am simply saying that we demanded far more than we needed or used. We helped exacerbate the situation in which a country like India now finds itself. It also wasn't just the US that was forcing the export of vaccines from India. 

As far as spending is concerned, that does not give us the right to allow others to die or create an environment in which what happened here can now happen elsewhere. Since we are the largest economy, and ""wealthiest country"" I believe we have more of a duty to the rest of the world than anyone else., as we are looked to as one of if not the world leader.

I'll give you that my original point is misguided, but I seriously will die on the hill that no one country's citizens matter more than any others. We should have done our best to even make the attempt to export something during all of this or loosen up restrictions on India's exports to the rest of the world, but we didn't. We spend the money that we do, because we can afford to, being in the position that we are in. Even with that amount of spending, theoretically we could be spending more on this if we were to reallocate our budget spending, but that is another topic entirely.

I found those numbers using the CDC and WHO data that is available, but this was my mistake. We each sit at 52% and 61% of the population with at least one dose of a vaccine, respectively. Almost 90% and 98% of vaccines given (as in relative to the population how many vaccines are available, as you stated). Either way you slice it, the fact of the matter is that being selfish in the face of a tragedy shuts out the other 5 or 6b people who do not have the luxury that we do. 

I also am not saying we are swimming in vaccinated people, when other countries have been criticizing the US for the past few months for hoarding vaccines and letting them go unused while the rest of the world is struggling, it shows a duplicity in how we operate. All I am trying to get across is that we could have easily started exporting vaccines far earlier than the tail-end of May, 2021. Only, we didn't do that, and now because of our policies and forced export of a large number of vaccines from India we are now seeing the repercussions of this. 

I hope you don't take me for some kind of contrarian who doesn't want to see us do well. In fact, it is quite the opposite, I do want to see us recover, and I want this pandemic to be recognized for the national tragedy that it is and for serious and large-scale memorials to be set up for the amount of people we have lost due to the virus. 

I think it is also very obvious that our country would be in a better position if there was not such a large push against the virus and vaccines in general right now, to the point where I believe that a lot of this damage could have been mitigated.

The point is, currently there is a lot of vaccine hesitancy. What exactly is your reason to not just get it, and instead you are ok with the risk of getting it and spreading it to others? My second dose of pfizer really sucked. I had brain fog for three days. Fever chills for two. Was nauseated. Headache. I don‚Äôt understand how anyone would want to risk getting covid for real, and risk having these symptoms for real, for months. Have you been over to r/covid19positive ? Those are all real people, many young, who got long haul covid. There are cases of young people admitted to the ICU and put on ventilators. That is the most horrifying thing to me, being sedated with a machine breathing for me. It is not comfortable, and there are more potential complications being hooked up to one, it is a 50/50 chance coming out of there alive or dying. lets say you are ok with getting covid. Are you also ok with possibly spreading it to my toddler if you are flying? Your other unvaccinated classmates in college? Sure, covid numbers are down, but they are actually *the same* amongst the unvaccinated. Other people getting vaccinated is not enough currently to prevent unvaccinated from infecting each other. I am flying later this month with my toddler and I am really an anxious mess. I just found out straight from an airline stewardess that easily upwards of 50% of airline staff are antivax. Add to that, young people who willingly refuse to get vaccinated, and that puts my unvaccinated toddler even more at risk. There are people with real blood clotting disorders who cannot get the vaccine just yet. There are immune compromised who even with the vaccine it is not nearly as effective because of the medications they take. There are older people like my dad who are vaccinated, but who can still get covid if exposed to a heavy enough viral load. Oregon so far has had 1000 breakthrough cases (where a fully vaccinated person still got covid - most don‚Äôt have a serious infection thanks to the vaccine, but 2% of these people still have died). If you are choosing willingly not to vaccinate, are you also going to stay masked once all the mask mandates are lifted? To protect these people who truly cannot have the luxury to choose to be vaccinated? Or those who can potentially be vulnerable if exposed to a high enough viral load? Is it fair for the people who really depend on herd immunity to just live in hiding forever? Look, I‚Äôm not here to bully or scare tactic you into doing anything. Getting the vaccine or anything medical is truly a personal choice. But do think of the potential effects on everyone else around you. The butterfly effect is real. Taiwan was covid free for over a year and a half. Life was beautiful and perfectly normal, and the whole world applauded them for being such a stunning model of pandemic control, they did an amazing job protecting millions of people in extremely dense urban settings where most people use public transit. And all it took was a few pre-symptomatic airline staff who only quarantined for three days as opposed to at least 10-14 to wreck if for Taiwan. They had zero case numbers and now they are numbering in the hundreds daily (thousands previously) and shutting it all down. My 95 year old grandma is back to sheltering at home alone by herself. The elderly need socializing to maintain a healthy lifestyle, it isn‚Äôt just food and exercise that keeps people ticking. If you are skeptical of the mrna vaccines, consider johnson and johnson which is a more traditional adenovirus vaccine.

Since noroviruses are seasonal with a seasonality like the flu, people who want it could get an annual booster. You could still get the disease, but a milder version of it.

We see it with covid, the virus cannot mutate enough to escape protective immunity, but can mutate to escape some level of sterilising immunity. Once a virus is endemic, it is possible the focus could be put on protecting vulnerable people, especially when complete sterilising immunity seems a major challenge (compared to, say, measles where it has been achieved particularly efficiently).

That means that if they return home to their country (assuming it's one facing restrictions), they cannot fly back to their job or position without staying in somewhere like Mexico for 14 full days first. For most, that's just not possible financially or with the amount of holiday it would require them to book, so it's causing some pretty prolonged separation now.

To add to this, it's also being used by the embassies in the restricted countries as a reason to not issue visas, which has led to massive amounts of stress and issues for would-be visa holders. For example, Fianc√©s hoping to marry and subsequently live together in the states under the K1 visa have faced massive backlogs despite paying copious amounts of money for their visas. Some couples have been separated for over a year, myself included. 

This has also stopped people from going and working in jobs that they would otherwise have started months ago. There are people who have accepted a job to go and work in the USA, but because of the embassies grinding to a halt, they have been unable to take up the position.

&gt;To date, out of more than 74 million children in the United States, there have been about 300 COVID deaths and a few thousand serious illnesses. Hospitalization numbers look worse, but Dr. Roshni Mathew at Stanford's Children's Hospital says those numbers are inflated.

MOKDAD: They're more likely to be transmitted. This is the one we have seen, and it was the U.K. variant. And they're more likely to make the vaccines less effective. And previous infections are not as protective as well**. So that's the problem - you have one that spread much faster, and it's more deadly.

KING: OK. Some of these variants are appearing in countries that were praised for their early handling of the pandemic, especially in Asia. What went wrong?

MOKDAD: This is a false sense of security. Unfortunately, with COVID-19, what we have learned - that no country is immune. And the fact that you have many of your public susceptible because you did a good job controlling COVID-19 in the past and you have an introduction of a new escape variant, you will see immediately a surge of cases.

KING: OK. What should these countries be doing?

MOKDAD: Several things. The first of it - sustaining mask use, implementation of social distancing measures when transmission begins to increase rapidly and, of course, preventing the spread of existing escape variants and new variants through careful control of travel.

Yes!  Completely wrong!  You keep making these absurd conclusions based on these absolutist binary true/false statements.  So your thinking is always ""either vaccinated people can get infected or they can't"" or ""either vaccinated people can transmit the virus or they can't"" but it doesn't work like that at all.

The fact is that the vaccine significantly reduces both infection and transmission.  The way this works is that you take these values, do some mathematical calculations and determine the level of transmission and infection with different vaccination rates, and you can work out a point, with vaccination rates high enough, where the virus simply can't propagate enough to keep infection rates increasing or stable - they will just fall even without social distancing etc.  

For you to constantly talk in terms of ""either they work or they don't"" is just a complete misunderstanding of the principles upon which these things are understood and calculated.  It's like saying ""people in seatbelts can still be killed, so what's the point?"".  And you keep employing this flawed logic no matter how much it's pointed out how specious it is.  Stop trying to come up with these scenarios of mangled logic whereby vaccination rates don't matter.  The fact is that with vaccines inhibiting infection and transmission, it's always going to be beneficial to have higher vaccination rates.  You may as well spend your time trying to levitate by lifting your legs up.  It's a fool's errand.

You claimed to understand what herd immunity was, but you didn't understand it at all.  Herd immunity does not need 100% immunity to work.

&gt;We actually do have systems in place for medical power of attorney when people actually are unable to make medical decisions for themselves.

Right, this is something we do.  Is this somehow horrific to you?

Did you miss what I wrote in a followup:

Without that line of thinking people who lacked mental capacity would just be left to die from any number of reasons. We're not talking about abortions, sterilizations, torturing or abusing people, we're talking about protecting the lives of people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions or take actions necessary for survival.

Otherwise humanity dies off in a generation because making sure babies have what they need to survive = forced abortion/sterilization.

Nowhere did I state that people should be forced to agree with other people's medical decisions simply because it's something I want.

&gt;""Lacking the mental capacity"" seems to mean ""not agreeing with you"".

One of the biggest challenges (and costs) for wealthier nations has been building the capacity to produce vaccines, and that capacity will remain after local citizens are all vaccinated. 

Finally, and this is the part I really don't know anything about, is there a chance that better vaccines will be developed which perhaps don't require the cold chain infrastructure?

Over 10 million [vaccinations](https://coronadashboard.government.nl/landelijk/vaccinaties) now, and over 50% of adults vaccinated. And it is approaching the 165,000 doses per day on average. At this pace it should probably take less than a month to reach 75% of adults, but luckily 85 to 90% of the population want to be vaccinated, so that won't be enough. Luckily the pace should only increase, even though they stopped using Janssen and AstraZeneca due to efficacy and side effects. There were 4 peaks in total in 3 waves. There was a spring 2020 peak, fall 2020 peak, winter 2020/21 peak and spring 2021 peak.

Daily [hospital](https://coronadashboard.government.nl/landelijk/ziekenhuis-opnames) admissions averages (excluding ICU) back to the level of late September. Hospital occupancy (excluding ICU) back to the level of early October. Both trending downwards. Both down from the 4th highest peak.

Daily [ICU](https://coronadashboard.government.nl/landelijk/intensive-care-opnames) admissions averages back to the level of late September. ICU occupancy back to the level of mid October. Both trending downwards. Both down from the 2nd highest peak.

Daily [cases](https://coronadashboard.government.nl/landelijk/positief-geteste-mensen) averages back to the level of late September, down from the 3rd highest peaks Sadly positivity rate is still high, at 8.4%, due to lower testing and less willingness to be tested. Both trending downwards. Down from the 4th highest peak.

Daily [deaths](https://coronadashboard.government.nl/landelijk/sterfte) averages back to the level of late September. No excess mortality anymore. Both trending downwards. I have to point out, there was no increase of deaths, it even declined and stayed on a low level, and no excess mortality during the entire third wave. So no peak can be assigned here.

The [reproduction number](https://coronadashboard.government.nl/landelijk/reproductiegetal) is now below 1 for over a month, currently sitting at 0.86.

The [number of infectious people](https://coronadashboard.government.nl/landelijk/besmettelijke-mensen) is back at the level of mid-September, down from the highest peak.

The [number of virus particles in sewage water](https://coronadashboard.government.nl/landelijk/rioolwater) is back down to the level of mid September and trending downwards. Down from the 3rd highest peak (for the 1st wave there is no data, so I don't count that one).

In the Dashboard there is more data on [Compliance and Support (for measures)](https://coronadashboard.government.nl/landelijk/gedrag), [vaccinations](https://coronadashboard.government.nl/landelijk/vaccinaties),  [nursing homes](https://coronadashboard.government.nl/landelijk/verpleeghuiszorg), [disability care](https://coronadashboard.government.nl/landelijk/gehandicaptenzorg), [people over 70 living at home](https://coronadashboard.government.nl/landelijk/thuiswonende-ouderen), [symptoms at GP's](https://coronadashboard.government.nl/landelijk/verdenkingen-huisartsen) and [Coronamelder app notifications](https://coronadashboard.government.nl/landelijk/coronamelder).

[Original Comment 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnzwri/daily_discussion_thread_april_10_2021/gu200jr/) - Additional stuff, thoughts. Much less worth checking out, but there are a few things in there that are still good.

If you have any food that you bought last year for Covid lockdown/emergencies/etc., now is the time to eat it or donate it to a food pantry. If it's expired, eat it or toss it instead of donating it please.  If you want to be prepared for future emergencies, go ahead and buy more to replace it, I guess.

If you're an American and you've been waiting for your turn to get vaccinated, it's your turn.

If you are vaccinated, it's your turn to help other people get vaccinated. 

If you have a strategy to get older Americans vaccinated, please spread the word. 

I think we need to get to the point where we can get hospitals back to normal operation and get family doctors/GP's doses to give out like they do with the flu vaccine. And like tons of extra doses. Novavax should help here.

The vaccines are FREE in the US.  FREE FREE, not like ""Copay free"", like fuckin FREE.  Go get one. Now.  Is there something stopping you from going to get one today? Talk to me about it, we'll get it worked out.

This does not occur with the vaccines.

Loss of smell [really sucks.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nqkiz5/cdc_touts_smell_training_after_covid19_but_it/) There's a whole subreddit about it ([anosmia](https://www.reddit.com/r/anosmia/comments/nkcta1/3_months_and_minimal_recovery/)), and the people who didn't lose their sense of smell from Covid are tired of everyone asking Covid-loss-of-smell questions.  

[Fewer symptoms = less spread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6sj6g/daily_discussion_thread_may_07_2021/gxbfbt1/)  Vaccines make you have fewer symptoms (*if* you get an infection after vaccination).

From the [NYT:](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/health/cdc-masks-vaccines-variants.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article) 
&gt;Introducing the new recommendations on Thursday, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, cited two recent scientific findings as significant factors: Few vaccinated people become infected with the virus, and transmission seems rarer still; and the vaccines appear to be effective against all known variants of the coronavirus. 

Remember, if you got infected, recovered, and then got at least one dose of Pfizer, you have immunity not only to multiple variants, but also SARS-CoV-1, the virus for which we named SARS in 2003.  Turns out much of [the ""breadth"" of that immunity is from the vaccine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/net65c/sarscov2_mrna_vaccines_induce_a_greater_array_of/)

But was the war ""won"" for Australia in October when they had basically no local cases?  Seems hard to argue that to be the case when Victoria is in lockdown again right now.

Could doing the right things have saved lives?  Sure.  I think it's more relevant on the national level as states are far more porous than we like to believe and so it's hard for, say, Colorado to do much when you've got people coming in from all over all the time.

I'm suggesting that the data we have points to the possibility of longer term as yet unknown impacts that may diminish one's quality of life later on. Especially as prevalent as the long lasting post viral syndrome is (even if ""only six months""). This is much more prevalent than we've seen in other respiratory viruses that we know about.

[],,milvet02,,,,,,[],"We pre-paid for millions of doses from each manufacturer because they needed the funding to set up large scale manufacturing while not knowing if the vaccine would work, be safe, or be approved.

There are many other vaccines that we also paid for that still haven‚Äôt been approved, others that have failed, and we paid for them to be spooled up just like with moderna and to an extent Pfizer.

Without that early and risky investment the vaccines wouldn‚Äôt be where they are now, neither would production capacity.

And again, no one is going to scramble the capital, know how, materials, and construction to duplicate those vaccines in any meaningful amount of time for this pandemic.

It took the US a full year, with basically a blank check and the complete mastery of the tech to make this vaccine production capacity, that simply cannot be replicated, even India with its own homegrown vaccine using much less advanced tech cannot stand up the capacity needed.

India has not authorized the J&amp;J vaccine for internal use, so the export of those to the US has no bearing on internal use, and sure they had private companies in the country export AZ vaccine to poor countries, but we are talking 66m doses over the year, nearly the same amount of vaccines that the US has sent to India as we have yet to approve AZ.

And again, none of this would be where it is now if the US didn‚Äôt fund it all. And that wealth and power can‚Äôt be harnessed for good if it isn‚Äôt sustained, so we absolutely had to put on our oxygen mask before helping others, and now we can give away over a billion doses of vaccine over the next year.

A billion plus doses given away for free, to any country that wants them, including paying India to make a huge portion of those.

Do American citizens matter more than Indian citizens. No, but they are the ones funding everything. And they are the ones who are keeping China and Russia from exerting some really awful influence, and they were the ones getting slaughtered by CoVID and still to this day have a death rate that‚Äôs not too far removed from India‚Äôs, so yes they would get first dibs.

What do you mean loosened up India‚Äôs restrictions to export, they have been exporting, and the vast majority of that wasn‚Äôt to the US.

Reallocate our budget spending? What would you cut, the DoD? You are aware that it was the DoD that shored up failing hospitals for a full year, not just two ships for a few weeks but thousands of doctors and nurses across the country, and that the DoD bought and distributed all the vaccines, and that the DoD developed one of the vaccines, and that the DoD is manning the vaccination sites, and that the DoD makes everything else possible anyways? There are some really bad countries out there that make the admittedly imperfect actions of the US look down right saintly and their power is only checked by a stony military.

Again, the fire was here, so we put it out, and now we are fighting the other fires, no other country on the planet would do it differently.

We were exporting vaccines to civilians in April, we were exporting vaccines to strategic allies in December so that other countries could also maintain their armed forces (China and Russia both vaccinated their military with phase 3 vaccines).

I see you as a person having a meaningful discussion and we both are trying to not point out flaws in each other‚Äôs arguments but instead to point out things that each other might not have been aware of, truth is this whole thing is massive and well beyond the ability of any one person with our lizard brains to understand it all.

Likewise I hope you don‚Äôt see me as bashing you, just pointing out the difference between ideals and realities. That‚Äôs largely due to my ingrained mindset that perfect is and always will be the enemy of good, and I‚Äôll take a now good over a forever delayed perfect later every time.

Absolutely do we have to help out everyone, and no response will be perfect, but I do think you are overly critical of what the US did.

The AZ should have been released months ago, and once production outstripped demand for the approved vaccines they too should have been sent away, but not before that.

I‚Äôm absolutely biased, my wife is the one who has been working 80 hour weeks until recently as an ICU doc, and so many of my friends from her time in medical school are military doctors (as a vet I fell into the schools military interest group even though I wasn‚Äôt in medical school, it was a great social outlet for me though and I made great friends) who have been fighting covid around the world and somehow never get reported on.",,,1622904191,{},h0ov4ho,False,t3_nrfuyw,False,False,t1_h0opnij,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nrfuyw/bidenharris_administration_unveils_strategy_for/h0ov4ho/,1623047597,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5l40nfbq,False,False,,

Also teenagers 12-15 years old are not allowed to get anything other than Biontech right now.

~10 years ago I started having light, brief palpitations but I brushed them off as being due to caffeine / energy drinks. 2 years ago I started having hours-long light-to-medium arrhythmia with non-life-threatening extra beats. This problem really put the screw on me. Despite extensive investigations, I failed to find a doctor capable of performing a broad &amp; in-depth investigation (I found plenty of imbeciles more than eager to jump at the most convenient diagnostic). Beta blockers helped but they only made the flairs more bearable, without suppressing their occurrence.  

In Aug-2020 I quit work and decided to shut myself in for the duration of this pandemic. In Nov-2020 practically all my arrhythmia problems suddenly stopped. I am now 6+ months away from having any flair, living again with a normal heart except for some very very light palpitations that I would've brushed off 100% if I wouldn't have known I have a background problem.  

I spoke with my cardiologist recently and she said she sees a spike of patients with a variety of heart issues after they recover from COVID. She also sees many who did not have COVID, got their vaccine and then got palpitations for a while. She says the latter usually recover.

Have you heard the term ""respectability politics"" before? It addresses precisely this: if you believe black communities in America (for instance, among many other marginalized communities) merely need to take responsibility for themselves (as it's been over 140 years since the abolition of slavery, and 55 since the last Jim Crow law) you're ignoring the long wake of psychic trauma and lasting economic ramifications from subjugation. 

Do you know what obstacles many African nations face? Destabilized political landscapes, economic dependencies. Entering the global market after nations like Britain and the US have had a severe leg up on the backs of nations plundered. Read Andre Gunder Frank: he argues that forced dependency of nations like Brazil on the United States keeps them in a perpetual state of underdevelopment; that the myth of ""developing nations"" is just that, a myth, because the globalized market and capitalism are designed in such a way to keep nations in that state as that's what's advantageous for other more ""developed"" (read: colonial or exploitative) nations. 

20 years is a laughably short time to expect nations to recover from colonialism. And that's partly because some of those tactics are existent today, just under a free-market guise.

Pfizer seems like the lowest risk (that's the one we prefer giving to fragile subjects, at least in Italy), I have already read about trombosis cases with johnson-johnson.

But I wanted to express my point of view. 
Why are you overprotective parents so scared? I mean no offense

I know 40-50 year olds who took covid and left children alone. Not optimal age+not perfect lifestyle+a virus that now we discover being artificial (mainstream media leaking while i scroll my phone, don't know much about it, but tbh this 21th century black plague always seemed weird to me)+no vaccine=potential death

In other words you should worry more about yourself than your toddler, imo. 

Vaccine+20 year old who does keto, takes supplements and just wants to be left alone=Annoying. 
I am not scared of the vaccine or covid, it's just the thought of being forced to take a drug. 

Where's the problem if all at-risk subjects are covered? 
Then I can decide to risk whatever I want because it doesn't affect other people. And even in my country it seems like we've coming close. I just don't understand all this fuzz about vaccinating 12 year olds now. 

We should combat asymptomatic spread by vaccinating people at risk, because they also risk trasmitting it more. Yes in my youthful recklessness i forgot to think about the immunocompromised, and I guess you're right, but it feels like the possibility of me spreading covid is low. If a presymptomatic gives me covid, that makes asymptomatic therefore unable to give covid. 

I know, there's a possibility for everything, I could die tomorrow driving, but small percentages are not always relevant.

First, I‚Äôm happy to be vaccinated and I will continue to be vaccinated. But I think it‚Äôs important to be open and honest about this because it‚Äôs been a lonely and concerning ride so far. 

I took the first Pfizer shot in the morning, and by the end of the day I had some break through bleeding about two weeks before my period was scheduled to start. That has never happened in my entire life. I had spotting off and on for two weeks, then my ‚Äúreal‚Äù (red and painful) period.

I went to my GYN, and she said it‚Äôs true that I disrupted my immune system, but she didn‚Äôt have much to say about the vaccine itself. She did an exam, said she saw some inflammation, took a swab for a bacteria test (negative). She said it could be caused by a whole host of things (some of them scary), but that I needed to track my period for 3 months to establish a pattern. If I had any period related discharge for more than 7 days for 3 months in a row, then I‚Äôd need an ultrasound. 

This is my third month, and everything appears to be ok so far. Month 1 was after the first Pfizer (total shit show). Month 2 was a little longer than normal. Month 3 appears to be in the normal range.

‚Ä¢	0.00039% of fully vaccinated Americans died after contracting COVID-19.  
  
Making sense of the data:  
The vaccines are doing their job, which is to prevent hospitalization and death. Sure, no vaccine is 100% effective but this is pretty close to it. At this point (if a person is fully vaccinated), the likelihood of said person dying or being hospitalized from a breakthrough case is basically nil.
