[],,Threshing_Press,,,,,,[],"But was the goal to eradicate COVID? The reasoning from the CDC seems to be in line with what I remember most comments and articles in here agreed upon just a few months ago - that the goal with vaccines is to prevent severe cases and drastically curb mortality. If we were lucky, I remember them saying, it'd also do a great job of curbing the spread among those infected. 

Right now, the focus has shifted to case positives with very little focus on the efficacy of reducing severe cases among those who are vaccinated. I think constantly focusing only on case #'s is a terrible idea with horrible optics. It's the worst kind of messaging because it makes things seem hopeless even for those who mask up and got vaccinated. I've been fully vaccinated for months and I'm beginning to feel that this will never end. 

If I look at the messaging logically and rationally, then I believe I'm right - what they're saying is that because of variants that might lead to positive cases in the vaccinated, we have to return to mask mandates, distancing, and even lockdowns. 

And if that's the case those things will always be in place because we will never stop the variants. Even if every human in the U.S. was vaccinated tomorrow, there are literally BILLIONS of hosts elsewhere. 100% of the focus, especially now, should be on whether or not we are reducing severe cases and death among the vaccinated.

If variants are the biggest concern, then literally every person on earth who is willing to get the shot should have no problem getting one asap.

Plug and play. They are so well understood that Pfizer/BionTech and Moderna say they can tackle any new variants within a few weeks and have billions of doses within a couple months and ramp up further from there. This would be, iirc, a vaccine that would cover all known variants at the time of manufacture.

Since this is well understood, it would not require ongoing trials and FDA approval. But that only comes once the initial vaccines gain full FDA approval, which looks to be some months away.

In the end, it would become much like a flu shot, which is adjusted every year for whichever strain is circulating.

If we can truly get to that point we will see mandatory vaccinations globally and it will make it very difficult to avoid being vaccinated.

We may be a year or more out from that, but I sure hope it happens. Anything to put this (mostly) behind us.

Even in this post, you belittle his view points on numerous occasions. Lockdowns are an extremely nuanced topic that have no ""objective answer"". Even an immunologist cannot give you a ""right"" answer when it comes to lockdowns. He can tell you his informed advice on how to minimize spread, but that's it. The question to lock down or not *must* be a holistic one. If minimizing spread is the only goal, then no one should be able to leave their houses ever (and that's also for other respiratory viruses like the flu). Obviously, I think we can both agree that that's a little extreme. So the answer is somewhere in the middle, and must take into account the economy, mental health of the population, etc.

You may cope well with lockdowns, but others may not.

The problem is that politicians are reacting to information and trying to steer the narrative and be right. I hate that it's about appearing a certain way rather than making sense even when people do not wanna hear it. We're not afraid to tell the anti-vaxxers they're 100% wrong, so why are we afraid to tell people focused only on positive cases that this number is not gonna go to zero? We can tell them to continue masking up while we get vaccine numbers higher THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, but focusing only on the U.S. is wrong since there's BILLIONS of unvaxxed hosts elsewhere. 

My issue isn't with masks or distancing and it never has been. My wife and I kept our kids fully remote for the majority of the school year and they always wore masks and still do in public spaces (we do too depending on crowd levels, size of the space, etc.). My issue is that if the government and media don't start steering the public focus towards hospitalizations and mortality, we will be chasing our tail for a looooong time on this. 

Also, re: not enough people fully vaccinated in the U.S. - agree, but there's nothing we can do about those people. They are NOT gonna change their mind anytime soon. And, depending on what state you're in, the talk of bringing back restrictions makes it feel hopeless. Its bad messaging. I'm in NJ and we're nearly 60% fully vaxxed and adults are at 69% fully vaxxed. Once we get shots for kids under 12, NJ will likely be near 90%. 

I love our Governor, but why is *he* talking about bringing back restrictions if necessary? With vaccination rates this high, that would mean the vaccine has failed. I'm not saying that's not possible, but there's not much evidence of that yet. A failure would be large numbers of vaxxed people with severe cases of COVID and high mortality rates. Is that what we are seeing?

So in states where vaxxed numbers are high, when you hear that, it makes no sense IF we're being told the vaccines work (OR if you look at the #'s and see that they DO work) and when a booster is necessary, you'll find more and more people giving up cause why bother if you're just gonna get really sick from the vaccination and then your state with high vaxxed numbers has restrictions in place cause of what's going on elsewhere? What does it matter if Missouri and Arkansas and Florida won't mask up and get vaxxed and stop the spread for 8 weeks? 

So they won't lock down or mandate anything, but your state with high vaccination rates has to??? Does that make *any* sense? 

It also makes zero sense when you look at the picture of the world. If I live in New York or SF, then I'd be a lot more worried about international travel and the fact that large numbers of unvaxxed people are coming through from other countries. I do live outside NYC, and I don't see the point in focusing so much on unvaxxed in the U.S. when we could be getting shots into arms of the willing *everywhere* in the world, reducing the spread among earth's human population rather than focusing so much on the U.S. only.

&gt;Nonetheless, England‚Äôs unlocking on July 19th does not come without risks. As cases rise exponentially‚Äîthe government has warned that they might surpass 100,000 a day in August‚Äîmore people will need treatment in hospital and more will die. At current rates of hospitalisation, official cases would need to rise to about 175,000 a day‚Äîthree times their winter peak‚Äîfor hospital admissions to approach the levels experienced in January. That could occur in about four weeks.

&gt;Rates of hospital admission will be highest among the unvaccinated. As in America, whose vaccine programme has slowed markedly in recent weeks, England‚Äôs government still needs to persuade more people to get jabbed. Covid-19 cases tend to be clustered in places that have the lowest vaccination rates. That suggests two things. First, most infections are taking place among the young people who are still waiting in line to be vaccinated (or among those who are too young to be jabbed). Second, vaccine hesitancy in pockets of England will continue to harbour high rates of infection.

His scientists say that delaying the ending of restrictions would simply defer rather than avert the deaths that will inevitably occur. They say that it is better to end restrictions now, when schools are closed for summer and flu cases are low.

The obvious result is that we end up with many fewer cases reported in vaccinated populations. Because fewer infections ""qualify"".

But it's hard to compare against unvaccinated groups, because every infection *is* called a case there.

So if you have 10 people and they all test positive (lets say 2 hospitalizations and 8 asymptomatic) ..

the American company Pfizer, the Chinese Coronavac or the Anglo-Belgian  
AstraZeneca.   
70% of the Uruguayan population has been inoculated with at least one of  
the two doses of the COVID-19 vaccines, as can be seen in the web monitor  
developed by the Ministry of Public Health (MSP). At 6:24 p.m. (21:24 GMT).  
¬†on Tuesday, 2,481,401 people had  
received at least one of the two doses of the American Pfizer, Chinese  
Coronavac or Anglo-Belgian AstraZeneca vaccines. Of these, 2,084,514 people,  
representing 58.83% of the population, have completed the inoculation regimen,  
with both doses administered.   
Uruguay began to vaccinate its 3.5 million inhabitants since last March 1.  
The Coronavac was initially administered to the teaching staff, police,  
firefighters, military personnel and workers of the Institute for Children and  
Adolescents (INAU).   
Shortly after, these vaccines were transferred to the department of Rivera  
(north), bordering Brazil and the one that was initially most affected by the  
pandemic, and to prisons. Subsequently, the Uruguayan Government was  
establishing age ranges to request the administration of the vaccine and,  
recently, it included those older than 12 years, becoming the first country in  
Latin America to inoculate adolescents.   
For its part, the doses of Pfizer were administered -for their greater  
efficacy- to healthcare personnel and the elderly, including those admitted to  
nursing homes. The American vaccine was also used for the homeless population.  
In recent days, Uruguay returned to the yellow risk zone, according to the  
Harvard index, after 7 months between orange and red. The South American  
country registered its worst figures of the pandemic, both in daily cases and deaths,  
in April, May and June. Currently, the country registers 379,376 positive cases

[],,HW90,,,,,,[],"I didn't say what you're saying I said, in fact I said exactly what you rebutted. Vaccines don't prevent infections, or reduce transmissibility, to that extent.

The Pfizer vaccine reduces infections by approximately 80%, in other words if you have 100% of people vaccinated you drop R number to about 1.2 based on that given that R for delta is about 6. Generously, vaccination will reduce transmission in the remaining infected individuals by half, so that gives R of 0.6.

In practice however 100% won't be vaccinated, even if we completely discount children. 85% being fully vaccinated gives us an R of 1.92, and with the generous halving of transmission we barely get that below 1. When we consider children too, the point of herd immunity would be about 83% fully vaccinated, in practice slightly less because children don't transmit it as much. Currently the UK is en route to have about 70% of its entire population fully vaccinated which is still nowhere near the herd immunity point. It's perhaps at a level where high levels of mask wearing plus contact tracing can effectively result in herd immunity albeit with pocket outbreaks amongst populations which don't have &gt;80% total vaccination rates. But this is still going to be a struggle to get cases to go down at a decent rate, not just stabilise, hence why the government is pushing policies which promote vaccination, alongside ""freedom day"" which will top up natural immunity amongst both vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.

And we have a lot of dynamics to consider within smaller populations in order to prevent outbreaks. The vaccines don't have as high efficacy in older populations so won't prevent as many infections, older populations are amongst care staff who are often younger, younger people tend to have more contacts and thus higher transmissibility, and younger people tend to be amongst other younger people so they are likely to be infected in greater numbers. All of those things result in higher vaccination rates being required for those populations to enable herd immunity within those populations and so prevent outbreaks.",,,,1626819935,{},h5xi4z8,False,t3_oo2ya9,False,False,t1_h5xd6l7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oo2ya9/90_of_all_adults_in_scotland_have_had_the_first/h5xi4z8/,1626982857,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_58rca,False,False,,

I always thought the goal was to lower the rate of severe COVID infection, lessen the rate of hospitalization and, if we're lucky, the rate of infectious spread among the vaccinated. I actually thought we hit all of those including the lucky part... but now the entire narrative is based on case numbers with little to no comparison to the other important numbers when cases were at the same levels in the year prior to vaccinations???

If the goal is eradication, then we need to lock up the entire world right this second for at least a few weeks. There will always be mutations and right now we're basically in the phase of figuring out how often that will happen and whether or not they'll be deadly to vaccinated people at a high enough rate to be of concern. 

I don't see the point of states with high vaccination rates among adults, some near or above 70%, going back to mask mandates and social distancing because of all the cases among people in states who aren't going to get vaccinated or change anything anyway. It's insane and it basically shows the situation to be absolutely hopeless if you just want to get the vaccine and move on with your life. 

Because this time, with vaccines, if the danger turns out to not be there and the mandates continue, you will have a much harder time getting *anyone* to follow *any* advisories or precautions if something truly dangerous comes along down the road.

Great. We're making progress here.

&gt;Covid spreads much faster than the flu or a common cold and just because you don't get severe symptoms from it DOESNT MEAN IT FEELS ANY LESS SHITTY TO HAVE.

Right. Getting sick *always* sucks. Practice good hygiene as much as you can.

&gt;YOU STILL FEEL LIKE SHIT HAVING COVID, VACCINATED OR NOT.

Sometimes. Sometimes you don't. Some people who *had* COVID never knew they had it. That's why you get your vaccine, though. It greatly reduces your chances of feeling like shit. It's the same reason I get a yearly flu shot, too.

&gt;I DONT WANT TO FEEL LIKE SHIT ALL THE TIME AND BE SICK.

You won't. You get your vaccine, so your chances of getting sick from COVID are *greatly* reduced. Even if you *do* catch COVID, you'll likely get a cold. Colds suck. You won't be sick ""all the time,"" though, because you have an immune system.

&gt;There is 0 chance we'll ""go back to normal"" anytime soon

I disagree. You're in the minority on this.

&gt;PLEASE GOD TELL ME WHY PEOPLE WOULD RATHER BE SICK ALL THE TIME THAN WEAR A MASK??

Again, you won't be sick ""all the time."" That being said, if *you* want to wear a mask, do it if it makes you feel better. Wear an N-95 even. That's fine. Don't expect everyone else to, though.

The reality is, people who have gotten vaccines don't need them. The people who are still unvaccinated *won't* wear them. So at that point, what good are they? They're not the panacea so many pretend they are.

&gt;I feel like im in genuine crazy land, this is like common knowledge to protect yourself if there's an contagious bug going around places, but this is a virus and even worse!

To start with, the numbers are, by default, averaged over almost the whole year, including when there weren't a significant number of vaccinated people and when delta wasn't a significant issue.

When the data is available for the missing 12days it will be lower than 83%.   And if you look at the NEXT 15 days or so it will likely be lower still.

Add to that, people who are vaccinated are rarely being tested so they aren't counted as being cases, though they will be tested counted if they get sick enough to be hospitalized and/or die.

Me (27 yo male) never had covid (to my knowledge) and was in rough shape after my *second* but not my first. That said, again, was the better part of a day and then fine the next and fine since :)

This is not to discourage you! Just to give you reassurance if you feel those things an anecdote of another who had it.

&gt;	Wyatt Gibson waved at strangers in the grocery store because he knew it made them happy. The 5-year-old danced around in tiny cowboy boots, strumming a toy guitar and singing, ‚ÄúI love donkeys and I love dogs.‚Äù He enjoyed building things with Legos, visiting the Tennessee Aquarium and helping take care of the horses on his family‚Äôs farm in Calhoun.

&gt;Wyatt died Friday after he was diagnosed with COVID-19, according to his godmother, Amanda Summey, who spoke on behalf of his parents. His death comes amid a surge of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations around the world, much of it driven by the spread of the disease among the unvaccinated and the highly contagious delta variant. No vaccines are authorized for children under 12.

Numbers may be off by a couple billionths. Sue me, lol). See [https://imgur.com/qNciiLb](https://imgur.com/qNciiLb) for the chart that came out. I used a logarithmic axis, because otherwise vac cases per capita looks like a zero flatline pretty much. Keep in mind that, while I used the 7-day average data from VDH, the vaccinated cases are so small, that the numbers are still pretty jumpy (hence the jagged graph). The ratio betwen the two is 0.033 +/- 0.011, which lines up pretty well with the 97ish percent efficacy numbers I've seen thrown around (no idea if this is sound analysis, I'm just a monkey that someone left unsupervised with an excel sheet when it comes to public health science).

I think it‚Äôs also important to remember that things like long covid (often referred to as post-viral syndrome when it happens with diseases like the flu) is not a phenomenon that is unique to covid, or at least doesn‚Äôt seem to be. You can have long term complications from virtually any viral illness (or bacteria, or parasite). The prevalence tends to be a function of immunity, meaning if it‚Äôs spreading like wildfire you‚Äôre going to see it more because of sheer number of cases, and also people who have no immunity to the virus in question are more likely to have these complications. Again, none of this makes it ‚Äúfact‚Äù with long covid, but me personally , I think it‚Äôs pretty reasonable and logical to assume that vaccines that reduce or eliminate all other factors of covid (chance of catching, viral load and shedding, time to clear virus, severity of symptoms) would have a significant mitigating effect on long covid occurrences as well.

I have taken care of a handful of COVID19 patients in and outpatient but I do not deal with the most severely ill and I am fortunate to have never signed a death certificate for someone who passed of COVID19. 

Some of you may wonder how a doctor takes care of someone who could have fairly easily prevented their fate. The answer is simply constant practice. 

With the risk of moralizing some, I want to point out that the grand majority of patient problems I deal with are preventable and/or modifiable with healthy eating, exercise and avoiding other toxic habits like smoking and excess alcohol, sugary foods/drink, sitting too long on the couch. Many people do not realize this. 

Probably most people on this forum come from a viewpoint of being vaccinated and are amazed that there are those out there ignorant of vaccine benefits.

mRNA vaccine production is at the end of a long production chain for ribonucleotides and synthetic lipids (which wind up in the product), as well as enzymes (RNA polymerases, pyrophosphatases, methyltransferase, poly(A) polymerases, proteinases) and purification membranes which are expended in production. All of these require major capital investment and time to produce at scale. 

The demand from mRNA vaccine production was so great that much current biomedical research was halted because of critical reagent shortages. Grad students treading water because every time they call a supply house for some reagent, it's out of stock.

I'm sure there was some foot dragging by political funders. That said, I can see most large developing countries investing in mRNA vaccine production and reagent stockpiles. The health and economic costs of waiting for the US/EU to provide doses was too great for places like India, South Africa, and even some developed countries like Taiwan.

&gt;Deaths involving Covid: 598,000  
Deaths involving Pneumonia: 535,000  
Death involving Pneumonia + Covid: 294,000  
Deaths involving Covid, Pneumonia, Influenza: 847,000  
The fact you said  
there were only 63,000 more deaths involving Covid compared to deaths involving pneumonia. And there's a column for both Covid and pneumonia.  
Shows you can't read the chart you are posting as a source.  
The pneumonia deaths are not seperate, 535k people did not die with JUST pneumonia, they are stating 535k people died while also HAVING pneumonia.  
It gives a second figure ""COVID + PNEUMONIA"" which is deaths that are confirmed to have covid and pneumonia. Not all covid deaths will, but that is included in the 535k figure ya dink.  
Aka 535,000 - 294,000 = 241,000.

Since you subtract the Deaths involving Pneumonia + Covid from the Pneumonia deaths, you also have to do the same from the Covid deaths:

Aka 598,00 - 294,000 = 357,000

So we see that 294k died with Covid+Pneumonia, 241k died with Pneumonia, and 357k died with Covid.

143 people hospitalized, 58% vaccinated, 39% vaccinated, 3% partial.

20 total deaths in July, 15 vaccinated.

64 of the hospitalized are in serious condition, with 12 of those people on ventilators and 3/12 ventilated people vaccinated.

Note that total hospitalizations and deaths are much lower than they were in previous waves. Their early December curve and case counts look similar to July 2021, and they had 600+ hospitalized and about 10 deaths per day.

I think they are seeing breakthrough in high risk groups; also, once almost everyone in a high risk group is vaccinated, you would expect lower nominal death and hospitalization rates but fewer unvaccinated people to present themselves given there just aren‚Äôt many there.

So bottom line, israel seems to be in a different position w/ low nominal hospitalization and death rates being skewed by high risk groups, which is why you are seeing such different figures between them and the US, UK, and EU.

Georgia handled the pandemic in an absolutely abysmal way but mostly managed to evade the greater public spotlight, somehow. Only early on was there a bit of controversy when Kemp directly stated he had no idea on some basic virus facts despite the CDC being a couple minute drive from his office iirc.

I guess he just got lucky that outside of ATL Georgia wasn‚Äôt severely hit (or maybe it was malicious by lack of testing). And the Atlanta mayor had her own standoff with the governor to enact mask mandates which helped the city out. 

One of the last to lock down and first to open up too if I remember right. Kemp got obscenely lucky there wasn‚Äôt more outrage.

Yep. That's what ""endemic"" means, after all.

Fortunately, we have vaccines which will prevent severe disease and death in almost everyone. Treatments will also continue to improve, and the dangers of COVID-19 will continue to be reduce even further as time goes on. 

Unfortunately, there will always be some deaths, but that's how it works with every other virus, too. You will never have *zero* illnesses or deaths. Even cold and flu viruses kill people every year. Those viruses can even cause longer-term symptoms, but we never talked about ""long flu."" Before 2020, though, no one was talking about that‚Äîincluding *you* I'd bet.

Some government officials were also encouraging people to drink it and at least some of the major national media outlets were presenting to the public it without question. I remember seeing one particularly horrible video of a patient on a ventilator being force fed cow's urine by a local politician who was wanting to ""prove"" that it was a safe and effective Aruvedic treatment for coronavirus.

That is one example, but there were several others and broadly the national media there seemed to be generally towing the official government line that things weren't that bad.

While this is from a small population (Isle of Man, pop 85k) the delta variant is spreading. But look at the age ranges it's spreading in: generally, the over 40s are fully vaccinated, 25-40 mostly one of two vaccinations, and under 25 mostly unvaccinated:

http://photo.alioth.net/tmp/shot-2021-07-21_11-36-43.jpg

Nearly all the infections are in the not fully vaccinated. The fully vaccinated part of the population is hardly catching it.

That page by the way is https://covid19.gov.im/general-information/latest-updates/ on the 7th page. You can move the sliders around the date ranges to see how things have changed over the range.

You can also see the vaccination progress here https://covid19.gov.im/general-information/covid-19-vaccination-statistics/ which also has date range sliders.

What the AAP is doing is putting the onus on the schools so that if an exposure takes place, they can just shrug their shoulders and say, ""well we told you to be careful.""  If they honestly cared about limiting exposures and infection rates, they would recommend schools stay virtual, but they can't do that either because an entire year and a half of education has been lost already because of the pandemic.

Except, your poor rural background keeps opportunities out of your reach, and your grasp on reality leaves you with no support or friendship from anyone around you, and you find yourself utterly stuck and your best years wasted.

I've heard of people rising above it all and still managing to make it to a better life of satisfaction and progress, but in every instance they got insanely lucky in finding help along the way, especially from an early age, and most importantly in getting the fuck away from their small minded small towns.

There are many more people like me who make it into middle age and just never had a chance to break free.

I got vaccinated the same day I was allowed to, I returned for the second shot promptly as instructed.

It hasn't done me any fucking good. I'm still wedged in a poverty stricken shit small town of fools and can only watch as the little family I have left dies off or disowns me for being sensible and my compassion amounts to nothing, or is seen negatively.

[],,AnonymousWritings,,,,,,[],"Sure. That first line is true. But every additional infection is one more person spreading covid around. So there are more secondary infections that can result in extra hospitilizations. 

Let's say you had two rooms with 100 people in each. Fully vaccinate one with AZ, and one with Pfizer. Then give them all a big exposure to covid, such that they all would be infected if unvaccinated. For the Pfizer room you'd end up with about 12 people walking out with symptomatic covid, 2 of whom get hospitilized. For the AZ room, you end up with still two directly hospitilized, but 33 with symptomatic covid.

Now say we take all 100 people in each room, and have each of them go to individual new small rooms that have 100 new vaccinated (Pfizer, say) people each in them (20,000 more people total). Now you have each infected person exposing 100 more, causing 12 more infections each, and 2 more hospitilizations each.

Including these secondary infections, the original Pfizer room would account for a total of 26 hospitilizations. 2 originally, + 24 from the secondary infections. The original AZ room would account for 68 total hospitilization. Still just 2 original hospitilizations, but 66 ones from secondary infection. 


Obviously this contrived example is an exaggeration of what would happen,  because not everybody exposed to COVID catches it (vaccinated or not), and most people don't go into a small room to cough on 100 other people.

However, it does demonstrate how a vaccine with lower effectiveness against infection (and/or onward transmission) will result in more hospitilizations in society in general, even if it has high effectiveness against primary hospitilization. 


That being said, spread right now is being dominated by the unvaccinated. With the current fully-vaccinated rate, people who had AZ and statistically would catch symptomatic COVID if exposed (but wouldn't if they all had pfizer) is about 6% of the total population. Compared to 46% unvaccinated. So you'd only expect this group to account for 13% of infections (assuming no behavioural changes after vaccination). 

However, as we hopefully move forward to higher vaccination rates (and especially with vaccine passports allowing vaccinated people to do more risky activities than unvaccinated), this difference would become much more important. If we hit 80% uptake across the whole population (Iceland is approaching that number for instance). Then with the same AZ vs. Pfizer breakdown you'd have about 10% extra of the population vulnerable because of the AZ vaccine use, thereby likely driving 1/3 of the transmission (or more, with vaccine passports for nightclubs and the like). Resulting in a lot of secondary hospitilizations. 

Early on, when supply constraints were so important and this kind of population study didn't exist, governments were completely right to use any available vaccine thwt showed effectiveness against hospitilization. The UK government most likely saved many lives by using their AZ supply when safe, rather than fully relying on Pfizer/Moderna.

My point is just to emphasise that going forward, if choice is available, governments need to care about the efficacy vs symptomatic infections and spread, not just the efficacy against hospitilization. So it isn't sufficient to just say ""AZ is as good as Pfizer because it's efficacy against hospitilization is the same.""",,,,1626883164,{},h60lmk2,False,t3_oo2ya9,False,True,t1_h5zd66w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oo2ya9/90_of_all_adults_in_scotland_have_had_the_first/h60lmk2/,1627042061,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_itwof,False,False,,

In real life, where everyone I know has taken extreme precautions throughout but is now vaccinated, if you say some of the stuff I see prevalent in this thread, this is what you're met with, ""But it's never going away, was that even the goal? I thought the goal was to prevent severe illness and lower mortality."" 

Yet on this sub, something has changed drastically from when vaccines began to roll out. Everyone here seems to not realize what they're saying - if you believe the variants mean vaccinated people should go back to masking, lockdowns, and distancing, then you have to realize that will continue forever.

The mission was never to eradicate the virus, that's not possible without a worldwide push button vaccination followed by two weeks of quarantine OR worldwide lockdown for the months or years it will take to vaccinate every human on the planet. 

And that is STILL not a sure thing!

Why are public officials not clarifying the goals? Why has the media been able to control and steer the narrative so much towards ""breakthrough infections"" rather than the positive results of getting vaccinated?

This only gives the anti-vaxxers more ammo and if we begin to roll back in states with very high vaccination rates, then the messaging to me that's unavoidable is the vaccines don't work.   
Cause forget the states that have low vaccination rates, what about the rest of the world that can't get a shot at all right now but they want one. There are and will be billions of unvaccinated for many years to come, possibly, and so what is the solution there? 

Do the mortality rates justify more ruining of children's education, their ability to socialize, the economy, people's livelihoods, etc.? What the hell are we even doing anymore focusing so much ONLY on case #'s? The variants were a given, but what was not a given was that the narrative from the media and now reactionary politicians who simply want to get re-elected has been we have to avoid high positive case #'s at all costs. That's not even what we were doing BEFORE the vaccines, now suddenly it's what we should be doing? 

If we start down this road, this will never end, and then at that point I believe you will see a lot more people turning against the heavy handed rules and hand wringing.

The first samples taken from this batch will be transported to the Gamaleya Center, the Russian research institute that develops the Sputnik V vaccine, for quality control.  
  
The vaccines manufactured in Vi·ªát Nam will be used in the country's National Expanded Programme for Immunisation, as it is dealing with a severe fourth wave of infections while the vaccine supply is still limited.  
  
‚ÄúRDIF and VABIOTECH are actively cooperating in the technology transfer process to provide easier access to Sputnik V for the population of Vi·ªát Nam,"" Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the RDIF, said in the statement.  
  
""As the pandemic is far from over and new, more dangerous variants of coronavirus are being detected in various regions of the world, RDIF is increasing capacities for production of Sputnik V to speed up the vaccination with one of the best vaccines in the world.‚Äù  
  
President of VABIOTECH ƒê·ªó Tu·∫•n ƒê·∫°t said he hoped the cooperation between RDIF and the firm will ""help provide quality and affordable COVID-19 vaccines to Vi·ªát Nam and other Southeast Asian countries.‚Äù  
  
Earlier, Vietnamese health minister Nguy·ªÖn Thanh Long said that VABIOTECH would be bottling and packaging the Sputnik V vaccine starting this July with output of five million doses a month.  
  
Sputnik V vaccine, which enjoys the title of the world's first COVID-19 vaccine to be approved for use, was given conditional authorisation in Vi·ªát Nam on March 23, following AstraZeneca.  
  
T&amp;T, a private group in Vi·ªát Nam, has been approved by the Government to have negotiations with RDIF for a deal of 40 million Sputnik V vaccine doses, using the budget that the group mobilised without touching the State budget.  
  
Sputnik V is one of the COVID-19 vaccines that have a publicly available price (less than $10 a jab), and also can be stored at standard refrigerator temperatures (2-8 degrees Celsius) without the need for ultra cold chain storage.  
  
""The Sputnik V vaccine is based on a proven and well-studied platform of human adenoviral vectors, which cause the common cold and have been around for thousands of years,"" according to the joint statement.  
  
The vaccine makes use of heterogeneous boosting, meaning that it employs two different vectors for the two shots in a course of vaccination, which the developer claims to provide longer immunity than the ones that use the same delivery mechanism.  
  
To date, 4,336,833 COVID-19 vaccine shots have been administered in Vi·ªát Nam, mostly AstraZeneca, with 317,672 people having the full two doses. ‚Äî VNS",,,,1626884746,{},h60peqn,True,t3_ootdtf,False,False,t3_ootdtf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ootdtf/vi·ªát_nam_produces_first_test_batch_of_sputnik_v/h60peqn/,1627044271,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,,

The vast majority of those claims too are incredibly deceiving. 

For every one of those, you have to look at time periods. Almost every one of those ""99% of deaths due to COVID have been unvaccinated"" I have seen has included the time period BEFORE VACCINES WERE PREVALENT. I mean sure, if you include all deaths from March 2020 until now, than the VAST majority are of course going to be unvaccinated, because almost no-one was vaccinated when most deaths happened.

You need to look for those stats over the last week/month to see what the actual impact is, and compare it to the percent of the population that's been vaccinated. It still shows good efficacy for the vaccine, but not the impossible numbers people keep parroting.

I can't help but think this is yet ANOTHER of those ""well meaning but ultimately backfiring"" public health strategies that have been prevalent throughout this pandemic. Where news organizations are starting with ""what do we want people to do"" and walking backwards from there to give us the messaging, instead of starting with the truth and trying to be as accurate as possible.

I've recently had to spend a lot of time explaining this to parts of my family as they have been sending me articles, videos, and memes that are so woefully inaccurate that I just couldn't stay quiet. 

I've tried to explain that a source's credibility is inherently linked to their reputation and the size of their audience; these factors have an almost self-regulatory effect as they are also intrinsically linked to their revenue. 

When a media org like NPR makes a statement, they have a lot to risk if that statement turns out to be false, misleading, or incorrect as it chips away at the trust their audience has and over time reduces their revenue and reach making it harder to retain their existing reputation and grow it in the future. This incentivizes transparency and accuracy, and motivates NPR to do their due diligence when investigating sources and leads. 

When you have an organization without a strong audience, and without much of a reputation in the market, their revenue is tied directly to increasing both of those factors by any means; which breeds sensationalism and focuses more on being provocative than accurate. Making claims that draw attention will always result in a net positive for these organizations even if reader retention is in the single digits, so the more outlandish and attention grabbing their claims can be at times, the better. 

This isn't to say NPR or similar media orgs don't sometimes make mistakes, or have editors that intend to provoke and thus skate the lines of clear, coherent, and factually accurate reporting, but correcting those mistakes and properly directing those editors is extremely important to these orgs and they spend a lot of time, effort, and money to try and find the right balance between attention grabbing intrigue and truthful reporting. That also doesn't exclude that new orgs cannot report the truth at times. 

News and information should be treated the same way we treat scientific data: the more trusted sources that are reporting on something, the more weight it lends to the accuracy and truthfulness of the information.

A lab leak most certainly implies a conspiracy, because there isn't a scintilla of evidence, only speculation, on top of loose inferences on top of flat out lies.  

&gt;The fact that the virus emerged within spitting distance of China's largest lab investigating coronaviruses seems like an awfully big coincidence.

No, it doesn't. It doesn't seem like an awfully big coincidence at all.

It a mere coincidence made a big deal by those looking for someone to blame .

&gt;A much ""simpler"" (hence Occam's razor) than complex theories of multi-animal transmission in some wet market.

This comment is absolute idiocy worthy of ridicule anywhere it is said.  Animal transmission is on of the most common sources of hes types of pathogen.

We should fully expect for this as the obvious alternative by Occams razor. Saying that animal transmission is somehow unlikely is downright a dirty lie. 

&gt;These labs have all sorts of safety equipment, protocols, and failsafes... because there is a clear and present danger of a leak.

Jesus. You are using the reasons that make a lab leak highly unlikely as the reason a lab leak happened. 

Absolute idiocy.

&gt;I don't think we'll ever know for sure, but to dismiss an accident at the lab possibility as a conspiracy (as many in the media have) is disingenuous.

It is a conspiracy because there is no evidence for it and much better and plausible explanations are available. 


If you told me the Chinese government created it and released it, that would have one less layer of convolution and be more likely to be true by Occam's razor. But that would be a much tougher sell in conspiracy circles.

Things are just really busy in my area. When I had intense vertigo earlier this year, I could get into urgent care same day but I spent literally days unable to find an ENT who could see me in under a month, no matter if I was so debilitated I couldn't work. I never did see one and gave up, I used a combination of overpriced physical therapy (nearly $400 per hour session) and urgent care to fix me over the next six weeks, cost about $1600 out of pocket all told.

Trying to get a dentist appointment for routine care in under a month, also hard. When I went to book my annual physical they were booking four months out. If I want to see my doctor because I'm sick I can't get an appointment in under a week and have to go to the more expensive urgent care. I'm working toward bariatric surgery and the initial consult was booked three months out. When I needed to book the psych consult for medical clearance, that was booked four months out. And when my doctor referred me to a psychiatrist to adjust some medicine, I called five practices to find someone who could see me in two months; the others were so booked they weren't even taking new patients.

Amazingly, I did get in to my orthopedist tomorrow, booked today. And I was able to, after calling around a while, find a dermatologist to see me only three weeks out.

(I have a lot of medical stuff because I'm older and also because, with US insurance, once you've paid and extra $5000 or so on top of your insurance premiums you have maxed out your out of pocket payment requirements so more medical care that year is ""free"" in that it does not cost you more than your premiums. Once I maxed out earlier this year being sick I started booking specialist appointment that aren't critically needed but are good to have addressed before things get worse, like the dermatologist and orthopedist and psychiatrist, that I had been putting off partly due to cost.)",,,,1626896244,{},h61gzyn,False,t3_ooor66,False,True,t1_h619lki,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ooor66/im_sorry_but_its_too_late_alabama_doctor_on/h61gzyn/,1627060271,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_359fb,False,True,,

I think you're too narrowly defining lack of opportunity as ""did the school provide a service""

Research has proved for over 50 years that it's much less about what the school does, and more about the socioeconomic status of the students and/or community. The Coleman Report in the late 60s concluded that and it's been demonstrated over and over again - ""The influential Coleman Report concluded that schools themselves did little to affect a student‚Äôs academic outcomes over and above what the students themselves brought to them to school‚Äî‚Äòthe inequalities imposed on children by their home, neighborhood and peer environment are carried along to become the inequalities with which they confront adult life at the end of school‚Äô

Huge swaths of the country just don't value education as important, which is a cultural issue. 

Then there are huge socioeconomic issues - students that have food scarcity, unstable living situations, stress, single parents, no parents, financial stress, etc. These students don't have the resources provided to them outside of school to meet their basic needs, much less their educational needs, both with support and even emphasis that education is important at all

It's not as simple as saying ""oh these students just don't try hard""

My guess is that unvaccinated people in the US mingle more together than other countries and are less likely to take any precautions. For example, maybe unvaccinated people in the UK (who are middle-aged or older and thus more likely to be hospitalized) are more predominantly people who are allergic or are deathly afraid of side effects so they're more likely to still be masking up and avoiding crowds.

When dispersed from the mouth/nose, individual virus particles will agglomerate into larger clumps so N95s are still highly effective.

There are a lot of factors involved in these tests, but the most important for long term exposure is the flow rate the tests are conducted under in lab conditions, and abstracting that to average human respiration.  So for example, whether you use the 95% or the more optimistic 99% effectiveness number, you have to take into account that these numbers are derived by passing a neutralized aerosol at a flow rate of 85 L/mi, which means that each minute 5% or 1% of particles make it through the filter, extend this over time, and exposure is a certainty. 

Now what does this mean for the average adult whose tidal volume is around 500 ml per breath, and averages  12 breaths per minute?  Do you measure chance exposure by breath or by volume?  Add to that the face seal issue, which is highly dependant on flow rate during aspiration.  

Lastly, there is the physics behind how these electrostatically enhanced filters work, and the fact that they are tested with electrostatically neutralized particles, and we are finding out that [particle charge has a significant impact on performance.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0032591016303825)

For example, children don't just know how to sleep or eat in the way that we want them to do it.  You have to teach them that as a parent.   They are born with the ability to do it and can fumble through it, but parents have to intervene in order to set healthy habits.

I think what you mean by teachable is in a classroom.  


If im understand the disconnect here.


Children learn by watching and doing what their parents do.

That is a teaching, just not the formal teaching in a classroom.


Now, formal classroom teachers can help with nurturing empathy as well, but by the time the kids get to them (usually age 6) it will be more difficult.

I think i remember reading something that kids that go to a certified daycare from a young age (4 months on) will score higher on empathy because the teachers there act as a caregiver and can impact at an age were empathy is in high development.

It's like saying 90% of all vaccines have been distributed in northern hemisphere (p.s. 90% of all people live in northern hemisphere). Or for an even more obvious example: 90% of vaccines have been given to people who are right handed.

Although 75% vs 57% does actually show disparity, and we know it's even more biased by GDP.

OPV (oral poliovirus vaccine) is a cheaper form of polio vaccination that's pretty prevalent, especially in developing countries, that contain small amounts of a live virus variant. This variant replicates in the intestine but is very, very unlikely to enter the central nervous system which is where it could cause problems. It's a way to get the body's immune system to recognize the danger and develop an immune response with an extremely minimal risk of getting noticeably sick.

Now, in areas with poor hygiene and sanitation (like developing countries), viruses can spread due to that. The cool thing, though, is that the OPV can ***also*** spread that way. So someone who gets innoculated with the vaccine can literally shed the vaccine and, through poor sanitation and hygiene that is often prevalent, end up passively innoculating others with the vaccine.

Is that gonna happen soon? IDK and I'm not gonna act like it will. But man its getting hard to actually be excited about things going relatively back to normal as these case numbers keep going up.

Tests were not well stocked then and they said because they doubt I have it, they won't test me but just put me there as a precaution. But when they wheeled me to the room through the covid section I saw a lot of nurses weren't wearing any surgical masks or seemingly any other PPE. Some were, but others had nothing. When I expressed concern about being put in the covid ward and asked for a mask the nurse said ""oh it's fine. See?! We're not even wearing masks in here."" 

On the way out that night I asked how I should get home. If they thought I might have covid it seemed unsafe for me to catch a taxi or get on the bus and possibly infect people. But they said the chances of me having covid are slim and I'm OK to take the bus. Unfortunately they still made me walk through the entire covid ward full of beds of sick people to get to the exit though. It's like I wasn't enough of a covid suspect to take a test or precautions after I got out of the hospital, but too much of a suspect to be allowed out of the covid section. 

I was so scared walking through that ward to get out. I was thinking if I didn't have covid yet I sure as heck might now! At some point they were wheeling people who could barely breathe past me into the ICU as I was trying to keep my distance to get to the exit.

People will continue to die from covid this year, next year, and in ten years. The flu has been killing thousands of people every year and yet I don't see anyone calling for immediate lockdowns when flu season comes around. Why are people still obsessed with case numbers day by day? When will it be alright to just go back to normal without feeling like we're harming others? Is the answer to just permanently socialize online and always wear masks when going out like it's the end of times? If that's the case, then no thank you.

Nope, I understand the point pretty clearly.

&gt;How are there so many people still vulnerable to the virus?  Don't forget about natural infections..

Because immunity post-natural infection varies significantly from individual to individual. 

&gt;I am constantly being told on here ""we all had it already"" or that ""true infections are 40x higher than confirmed infections"" and yet... there's still enough vulnerable hosts left that can drive a ""surge?""  How?

There's no confirmed numbers, or even agreed upon estimates, of actual infections vs reported infections.  40x reported cases is a, frankly, silly number too. There's been 34 million covid cases in the US. 40x times that is 1.36 billion cases...the US only has 328 million people. I mean come on dude, that's ridiculous.

&gt;Each natural infection should count as a vaccination in its own right, correct?  I'm also told that a lot too.  

No. Anyone who's told you that has no idea what they're talking about and no public health officials have stated that. 

&gt;So I'm just confused, among even the unvaccinated, how are there still so many people left who don't have antibodies?

Because natural infections are wildly unpredictable and do not provide the same consistency and expected antibodies as a vaccine. I think you need to take a break from this sub dude.

It's very likely that at this time in 2024 we'll still be seeing headlines like these. But that does not mean most of us will still be wearing masks or encountering closed things in 2024.

With that being said, what wave are we even on? I know in around April-June 2020 there was lots of talk about the ""second wave"", but then there was also discussion about ""the second peak of a first wave"" or ""reminder that we are still in the first wave"", and that a ""true"" second wave would entail the development of a variant a la 1918.

Which I guess could easily describe the current situation given Delta, but... that just opens up a whole new can of worms. What about Alpha-Gamma? Are those their own waves? So this is the 5th wave? Does the 2020 summer peak, which was unaffected by variants, count as its own wave, even though it's obviously more severe than our current wave due because there were no vaccines back then?

To me a lot of this talk about what constitutes a true ""wave"" or just a ""peak"" seems like a no-true-Scotsman fallacy. I don't even think there's been a formal definition of what qualifies as one.

[],,SelfishlyIntrigued,,,,,,[],"No one is focusing on one thing. I think that's you. If you think this is just about COVID you clearly are inserting your own narrative on what people are discussing. 

LE is a figure on general health of a nation, you do not have a high LE and a sick population, and you also do not have a low LE and a health population. 

People are not hyperfocusing, LE is an indicator of underlying issues. You think people are focusing on it because you think the LE number means something, a goal to achieve in life, a goal everyone needs to achieve.

That is not what it is for. You keep doing this strange thing where you self insert that people should not want to live long(Missing the point of LE entirely) and we should, I guess you're trying to frame your narrative as people being selfish for wanting to live long, or life isn't great at that age, or or or or. You are giving excuses that can more or less come down to ""I do not care about old/elderly please stop making me change my life or do things for people I do not care about and I will weave a narrative that they are selfish, life sucks at that age and no one else should care either!"".

I know that might not be what you intend, but that's what you're saying. Ask 90% of old people, and most do not want to die. Yes with a terminal illness things change, but that would be you using an anecdote to bolster your narrative.

People have good lives, people live good lives at that age. We all joke about things going downhill after 50, but again the point of LE isn't some end goal.

A higher LE means you have a better older age statistically speaking. That is it, instead of people going downhill at 50, they start going downhill at 60 etc etc etc.

It has nothing to do with individual people, or people that are 90, or 78, or 80. Those people are consequences of a higher LE, and people will always live to those ages.

LE Specifically tells you how old people are statistically living to, and the way you get a population to statistically get to a higher average life expectancy is by making everyone healthier and improving medical care.

Moreover one thing people seem to skip past, they say ""Oh it only dropped because 50% of people who died were over 70"".

If you die at a younger age, it's more weight against life expectancy then dying at an older age, but you know what's even MORE funny?

You thinking death is all that matters. Old people had a very high chance of dying of COVID, at age 70+ it was 20% or higher.

What do you think the chance of long COVID or ongoing issues with COVID in that population is? Even higher then 20%.

We already know 2-5% of people suffer long covid or ongoing complications, and covids overall death rate is 0.6%. Do you not understand the huge wave of ongoing issues in older people, younger people, middle age people that is coming long term?

Why are you only ""Hyper focusing"" on death, something you claim others are about LE(Which they aren't, as it's an indicater)",,,,1626880517,{},h60fc6m,False,t3_ooinqz,False,False,t1_h60afi2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ooinqz/us_life_expectancy_falls_by_more_than_a_year_due/h60fc6m/,1627038563,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_7rpx4zyq,False,False,,

I'm curious about this, because we're certainly hearing about plenty of vaccinated athletes testing positive, but it makes me wonder if they are asymptomatic, and are merely being found out as COVID-positive because testing is required despite their lack of symptoms.  Every time we hear about another athlete testing positive despite being vaccinated, it casts doubt on the efficacy of the vaccine, and raise questions about whether the vaccinated really are protected as well as claimed from infection or being a transmission risk.

Not everywhere, but it would happen. 

I think here this thing is going to play out little by little. I've been to two events that asked for vaccine proof so far. Every other place I've been, restaurants, stores, etc. have made masks optional and don't ask about vaccinations. Individual employers may require the vaccine for employees. Schools, I don't even know what most of them are doing yet. 

I just think if it were as simple as a blanket mandatory vaccine campaign for the whole country, we'd have done it already.

Uh, yes? Education is badly broken in this country.

Think about that. 1 in 3 adults in the USA cannot understand math much more than counting, simple arithmetic, understanding what a percent is. 


Another 34% are in Level 2, such that they could complete tasks that require the application of two or more steps or processes involving calculation with whole numbers and common decimals, percents and fractions; simple measurement and spatial representation


Great - so 2/3rds of the USA cannot do much more than calculate a percent or fraction using whole numbers



Less than 10% of US adults are in Level 4/5, which is the first point at which folks can complete tasks involving "" statistics and chance; spatial relationships; and change, proportions and formulas. ""

&gt;As observed in prior weeks, Black and Hispanic people have received smaller shares of vaccinations compared to their shares of cases and compared to their shares of the total population in most states. The share of vaccinations received by Black people also continues to be smaller than their share of deaths in most states, although in some states it is similar to the share of deaths. The share of vaccinations received by Hispanic people is similar to or higher than their share of deaths in most reporting states, although in some states it continues to be lower. For example, in California, 29% of vaccinations have gone to Hispanic people, while they account for 63% of cases, 48% of deaths, and 40% of the total population in the state.

Our society tends to default to freedom of choice, which is a good default in my opinion, but we also have to be pragmatic about when it's not working to prevent the freedom of one person from trampling on the freedom of another. My point is that the people upset about these mandates are usually the ones to blame for them being necessary in the first place. People acting responsibly are already convinced it's the right course of action, and so are less likely to oppose mandating it.

[],,SelfishlyIntrigued,,,,,,[],"Because you don't know how to read charts, or are attempting to mislead people. I don't know if you're doing that intentionally but since you asked what was ""Bullshit"" about what you posted i'll try to summarize.

First you say

&gt;Additionally, there were only 63,000 more deaths involving Covid compared to deaths involving pneumonia. And there's a column for both Covid and pneumonia.

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm

False. This shows you can not read a chart.

It states: 

Deaths involving Covid: 598,000

Deaths involving Pneumonia: 535,000

Death involving Pneumonia + Covid: 294,000

Deaths involving Covid, Pneumonia, Influenza: 847,000

The fact you said 

&gt;there were only 63,000 more deaths involving Covid compared to deaths involving pneumonia. And there's a column for both Covid and pneumonia.

Shows you can't read the chart you are posting as a source.

The pneumonia deaths are not seperate, 535k people did not die with JUST pneumonia, they are stating 535k people died while also HAVING pneumonia. 

It gives a second figure ""COVID + PNEUMONIA"" which is deaths that are confirmed to have covid and pneumonia. Not all covid deaths will, but that is included in the 535k figure ya dink.

Aka 535,000 - 294,000 = 241,000.

Which means according to the chart outlined(Don't worry we're getting back to that chart several times, there's just way to much to unpack) 598,000 official COVID deaths and 241,000 pneumonia deaths that are unattributed. This means 340k more people died of covid then just pneumonia like you claim.

Moving on the third term is COVID OR(Not plus, OR) influenze or pneumonia. This is a combination, not that people had all 3.

However the 240k figure is also misleading. That figure does not INDICATE they DIED OF PNEUMONIA, in indicates they had pneumonia when they died. It says ""Deaths INVOLVING(Not caused) pneumonia"" and yes that matters. People can have comorbities.

This is why I wrap around to you spreading misinformation. You are trying to frame a chart you unintentionally (Or intentionally) misread and spread that as ""100% undeniable fact"" and hope others don't look to much into it.

However it get's even more tricky then even all that. Because it assumes the COVID death toll is 598,000(Well it's higher but as per that date with CDC). That is simply not the case. Excess deaths account for more than 600k, and other causes of deaths that did increase(Traffic accidents leading to death, overdose deaths increase, and violence only account for about 50-70k increase), so we are still not accounting... Another 300k people.(As per May 2021, when official numbers were at 578k)

http://www.healthdata.org/special-analysis/estimation-excess-mortality-due-covid-19-and-scalars-reported-covid-19-deaths

The suspected excess deaths were 920k during that period March 2020 to May 2021, all other factors of death account for 60-70k of those excess deaths(Traffic accidents, overdose increases etc), which means in the states at per May 1, 2021 they had 860k deaths unaccounted for. Well technically 578k of them were accounted as COVID. That leaves nearly 300k unaccounted for.
