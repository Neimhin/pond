Are we just going to assume that the multiplier doesn't decrease over time like it did in the paper?  

&gt;Do the math for the 10M LA county and you get almost the same conclusion of ~40% infected.

Look, the highest positivity rate in California overall was 14.2% (unique tests).  The highest 7 day rolling average positivity rate in Los Angeles county was around 22%.  Let's say that was the positivity rate for the entire pandemic.  There are 1,072,412 positive cases since the beginning of the pandemic in LA county.  For there to be 4.6x that amount (4,933,096), at a positivity rate of 22%%, the minimum population size of LA county would have to be 22,423,163, roughly 2.25x the population of LA county.  Of course, it wasn't 22% for the entire pandemic.  That's the maximum rate.  Lower values increase the population size needed to account for the lower positivity rate.  The math just doesn't work out.  

And, by the way, the CDC data has continually been revised downward.  It was 91 million cases through September 2020 for a multiplier factor of 7.2 as reported in December. 
 https://web.archive.org/web/20210102131234/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html  Now it's 83 million cases through December...  

Other recent estimates using serological data to derive a multiplier show around 1/2 of what the CDC shows through mid November. 
 https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774584

And lastly, for this to be remotely relevant, you wouldn't have expected a double peak corresponding to an increase in mobility for the holidays.  The cases peaked on December 15th and were dropping until December 31st.  The increase in mobility for the holiday season lead to an increase in cases and a second peak on January 8th.  If immunity was playing a role here, you wouldn't expect to see that second peak.  

In summary, the math doesn't work out with the positivity rate, the multiplier decreases with time as it did in the paper, the CDC data has been revised down (and almost certainly will continue to be given that the CDC cited the JAMA paper in their weekly science updates), serological data indicates a smaller multiplier factor, and the secondary peak simply wouldn't be there if immunity played a significant role in reduction of cases.  There's so much working against this immunity theory that it's just too much when everything can be explained much better with decreases in mobility without having to resort to bad math and magic.",,,1611968764,{},glbdtl1,False,t3_l7zuqs,False,False,t1_glb79by,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l7zuqs/coronavirus_californias_cases_down_50/glbdtl1/,1612006216,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_15v0g2,False,False,,

But lately my biggest thought about my personal health beyond the random clotting issues is if I were to get Covid I don’t want to lose my taste and smell for a long time or possibly permanently (rare I know, but this guy I went to college with hasn’t been normal in that area since March without any clue as to when or if that will sort itself out).   

Do we know if most vaccines would keep that from happening?  I would think that the ones cranking out 94% protection would be way more likely than those that are clocking 70% to lessen the chances of that.   Yet you could still tout that both would keep you out of the hospital and that you would avoid “serious” illness.

Also, most teachers HATE teaching remotely because it is a lot harder to adapt curriculum, the kids are much less engaged and work completion rates are abysmal, and the bureaucratic paperwork has skyrocketed.

Let's assume all the population was vaccinated with this vaccine by magic at the beginning of pandemic:

- But 28% of people distributed across 72% immune means that the virus has a harder time transmitting. It's R (contagion index) is hardly higher than 1, while with no pre-existing immunity it would have been 2-2.5. The virus will get some people but will not spread like wildfire. 

- So far we assumed that 28% were no immune at all.

A much smaller subset than what would have been on an unvaccinated population, will get (really) sick from it, while for most it will be a really mild disease.

Since September, the hospital says it has seen more than twice as many babies arriving with serious injuries, confirming fears that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is taking a heavy toll on the most vulnerable members of society and the families who care for them.

“I've actually seen a doubling of the number of kids as compared to the year before … Babies under one coming with types of injuries that, really, they can't cause themselves,” said Dr. Michelle Ward, a pediatrician and head of the division for Child and Youth Protection at CHEO.

These include broken bones, bleeding around the brain, bleeding at the back of the eyes, or an injury to the brain itself.

**Question**  What is the association between maternal and neonatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)–specific antibody concentrations?

**Findings**  In this cohort study, SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were transferred across the placenta in 72 of 83 pregnant women who were seropositive, and cord blood IgG concentrations were directly associated with maternal antibody concentrations, whereas IgM antibodies were not detected in any cord blood sera. Transfer ratios were associated with time elapsed from maternal infection to delivery and not associated with severity of maternal infection.

**Meaning**  Efficient transplacental transfer of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies supports the potential for maternally derived antibodies to provide neonatal protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

**Abstract**

**Importance**  Maternally derived antibodies are a key element of neonatal immunity. Understanding the dynamics of maternal antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during pregnancy and subsequent transplacental antibody transfer can inform neonatal management as well as maternal vaccination strategies.

**Objective**  To assess the association between maternal and neonatal SARS-CoV-2–specific antibody concentrations.

**Design, Setting, and Participants**  This cohort study took place at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A total of 1714 women delivered at the study site between April 9 and August 8, 2020. Maternal and cord blood sera were available for antibody measurement for 1471 mother/newborn dyads.

**Exposures**  SARS-CoV-2.

**Main Outcomes and Measures**  IgG and IgM antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody concentrations and transplacental transfer ratios were analyzed in combination with demographic and clinical data.

**Results**  The study cohort consisted of 1714 parturient women, with median (interquartile range) age of 32 (28-35) years, of whom 450 (26.3%) identified as Black/non-Hispanic, 879 (51.3%) as White/non-Hispanic, 203 (11.8%) as Hispanic, 126 (7.3%) as Asian, and 56 (3.3%) as other race/ethnicity. Among 1471 mother/newborn dyads for which matched sera were available, SARS-CoV-2 IgG and/or IgM antibodies were detected in 83 of 1471 women (6%; 95% CI, 5%-7%) at the time of delivery, and IgG was detected in cord blood from 72 of 83 newborns (87%; 95% CI, 78%-93%). IgM was not detected in any cord blood specimen, and antibodies were not detected in any infant born to a seronegative mother. Eleven infants born to seropositive mothers were seronegative: 5 of 11 (45%) were born to mothers with IgM antibody only, and 6 of 11 (55%) were born to mothers with significantly lower IgG concentrations compared with those found among mothers of seropositive infants. Cord blood IgG concentrations were positively correlated with maternal IgG concentrations (*r* = 0.886; *P* &lt; .001). Placental transfer ratios more than 1.0 were observed among women with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as those with mild, moderate, and severe coronavirus disease 2019. Transfer ratios increased with increasing time between onset of maternal infection and delivery.

**Conclusions and Relevance**  In this cohort study, maternal IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were transferred across the placenta after asymptomatic as well as symptomatic infection during pregnancy. Cord blood antibody concentrations correlated with maternal antibody concentrations and with duration between onset of infection and delivery. Our findings demonstrate the potential for maternally derived SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies to provide neonatal protection from coronavirus disease 2019.",,,1612020641,{},gldi1lx,True,t3_l8o02t,False,True,t3_l8o02t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8o02t/assessment_of_maternal_and_neonatal_cord_blood/gldi1lx/,1612048660,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,

**Question**  Are population-level social factors associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence and mortality?

**Findings**  In this cross-sectional study including 4 289 283 COVID-19 cases and 147 074 COVID-19 deaths, county-level sociodemographic risk factors as assessed by the Social Vulnerability Index were associated with greater COVID-19 incidence and mortality.

**Meaning**  These findings suggest that to address inequities in the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, these sociodemographic risk factors and their root causes must be addressed.

**Abstract**

**Importance**  Descriptive data have revealed significant racial/ethnic disparities in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the US, but underlying mechanisms of disparities remain unknown.

**Objective**  To examine the association between county-level sociodemographic risk factors and US COVID-19 incidence and mortality.

**Design, Setting, and Participants**  This cross-sectional study analyzed the association between US county-level sociodemographic risk factors and COVID-19 incidence using mixed-effects negative binomial regression, and COVID-19 mortality using zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Data on COVID-19 incidence and mortality were collected from January 20 to July 29, 2020. The association of social risk factors with weekly cumulative incidence and mortality was also examined by interacting time with the index measures, using a random intercept to account for repeated measures.

**Main Outcomes and Measures**  Sociodemographic data from publicly available data sets, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), which includes subindices of socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, racial/ethnic minority and English language proficiency status, and housing and transportation.

**Results**  As of July 29, 2020, there were a total of 4 289 283 COVID-19 cases and 147 074 COVID-19 deaths in the US. An increase of 0.1 point in SVI score was associated with a 14.3% increase in incidence rate (incidence rate ratio \[IRR\], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.13-1.16; *P* &lt; .001) and 13.7% increase in mortality rate (IRR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.12-1.16; *P* &lt; .001), or an excess of 87 COVID-19 cases and 3 COVID-19 deaths per 100 000 population for a SVI score change from 0.5 to 0.6 in a midsize metropolitan county; subindices were also associated with both outcomes. A 0.1-point increase in the overall SVI was associated with a 0.9% increase in weekly cumulative increase in incidence rate (IRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.01; *P* &lt; .001) and 0.5% increase in mortality rate (IRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.01; *P* &lt; .001).

**Conclusions and Relevance**  In this cross-sectional study, a wide range of sociodemographic risk factors, including socioeconomic status, racial/ethnic minority status, household composition, and environmental factors, were significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality.

**Question**  Was the receipt of unemployment insurance and a $600/wk federal supplement to unemployment insurance associated with reduced food insecurity among people in low- and middle-income households who lost work during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic?

**Findings**  In this cohort study of 1119 adults who lost work during the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment insurance was associated with a 35% relative decline in food insecurity and a 48% relative decline in eating less due to financial constraints. The $600/wk federal supplement was associated with additional reductions in food insecurity.

**Meaning**  These findings suggest that expanding the amount and duration of unemployment insurance may be an effective approach to reducing food insecurity.

**Abstract**

**Importance**  More than 50 million US residents have lost work during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and food insecurity has increased.

**Objective**  To evaluate the association between receipt of unemployment insurance, including a $600/wk federal supplement between April and July, and food insecurity among people who lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Design, Setting, and Participants**  This cohort study used difference-in-differences analysis of longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of US adults residing in low- and middle-income households (ie, &lt;$75 000 annual income) who lost work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were from 15 waves of the Understanding Coronavirus in America study (conducted April 1 to November 11, 2020).

**Exposure**  Receipt of unemployment insurance benefits.

**Main Outcomes and Measures**  Food insecurity and eating less due to financial constraints, assessed every 2 weeks by self-report.

**Results**  Of 2319 adults living in households earning less than $75 000 annually and employed in February 2020, 1119 (48.3%) experienced unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic and made up our main sample (588 \[53.6%\] White individuals; mean \[SD\] age 45 \[15\] years; 732 \[65.4%\] women). Of those who lost employment, 415 (37.1%) reported food insecurity and 437 (39.1%) reported eating less due to financial constraints in 1 or more waves of the study. Among people who lost work, receipt of unemployment insurance was associated with a 4.3 (95% CI, 1.8-6.9) percentage point decrease in food insecurity (a 35.0% relative reduction) and a 5.7 (95% CI, 3.0-8.4) percentage point decrease in eating less due to financial constraints (a 47.8% relative reduction). Decreases in food insecurity were larger with the $600/wk supplement and for individuals who were receiving larger amounts of unemployment insurance.

**Conclusions and Relevance**  In this US national cohort study, receiving unemployment insurance was associated with large reductions in food insecurity among people who lost employment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The $600/wk federal supplement and larger amounts of unemployment insurance were associated with larger reductions in food insecurity.",,,1612020384,{},gldhk9w,True,t3_l8nwnv,False,False,t3_l8nwnv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8nwnv/receipt_of_unemployment_insurance_and_food/gldhk9w/,1612048413,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,

So while this is good as long as the dominant strain is the old/UK. If the SA/BR strain becomes dominant, we will need a different vaccine for those that are affected by it.

Further, in this very thread, I highlighted the best case scenario right now if we continue to let the virus go. Best case for those aged 65+ is 240k+ deaths a year with consistent high efficiency vaccines, 80% vaccinated, preventative measures, etc. Not to mention if we have lower efficacy vaccines, with the other measures above, we now have 400k+ a year dying.

For instance, the neutralizing activity of several samples was reduced by &gt;10-fold by single mutations to site E484, but a few samples were essentially unaffected by E484 mutations. Similarly, mutations at sites in the 443–450 loop (e.g., G446V) caused a large drop in serum antibody binding and neutralization for some samples, but had little effect on-others. This inter-individual heterogeneity is further compounded by the fact that the effects of mutations sometimes changed over time for samples longitudinally collected from the same individual. These temporal changes could be due to a disproportionate decay in one dominant antibody clonotype,or a relative increase in antibodies targeting other epitopes.

For starters, yes this may be a reasonable concern - but what is the honest solution to this other than *global* eradication which is absolutely not possible. Even if every wealthy country did a complete China style lockdown and wore masks every day forever and ever - poor countries would have covid spread and mutate and it would eventually reach these wealthy countries again. Poor Asian, Latin American, African countries don’t have working from home, or three layer masks, or all the comfy protections we have here. **Eradication is not possible and therefore cannot be an honest solution**.  Covid is going to spread forever - we just have to deal with it like we do every other virus that started out as severe and is now extremely tolerable with layers of immunity built naturally and with vaccines. 

In addition, various virologists have said that antibody production isn’t the only driver of immunity. If vaccine produced immunity can’t stop the binding of a mutation but can stop it from killing or hospitalizing me, that’s good enough. 

&gt; no need to vaccinate the young or get herd immunity even

I don’t think anyone is saying that. They’re saying that restrictions can be *slowly* walked back in step with risk to hospital overcrowding. 

We will have to vaccinate the young - but if everyone over 50 is vaccinated risk indications change. 10,000 cases a day in 20 year olds isn’t a risk to the hospital system. 10,000 cases a day among 65 year olds is. They’re saying that we can tolerate more spread among the young, and can therefore allow for things like holiday gatherings but maybe not concerts or clubs. 

&gt; dismiss long covid and lung, organ damage 

Ok, Look. Yes, long covid and ‘long term damage’ can arise from a covid infection.... but just saying ‘they can happen’ isn’t justification to  continue to avoid all levels of socialization and life we hold so dear. 

1) long term damage and long covid *can* occur in mild cases - but from what I get in the article it is rare. *More* rare than the current occurrence frequency of long covid - which is pretty unlikely already (but yes still happens - I know). So if we take the current rate of long covid-er’s and cut that by a factor of almost 7 .... you have an even lower occurrence frequency. 

2) even if the rate of long haulers is the same in mild as severe symptoms ... I don’t know if the cost-benefit analysis of restrictions to avoid a longstanding cough or fatigue in a small % of the population is worth the damage we are incurring in the remaining percentage of the population. In March, we all sat down and said ‘yes, we are ok incurring tons of mental &amp; economic damage, but Covid-19 is killing people and threatening the hospital system, so we’re ok with it’. I don’t know if we come to the same conclusion if the negative outcome is ‘we have *some* people who never really get over covid and they can’t hike without getting tired anymore’.

I agree, I'm pro-vaxx myself, but it's som3thing we need to monitor and prepare for as it continues to mutate

&gt;and doesn’t mean we should continue to use distancing and masks once everyone’s (80% is probably the max) vaccinated just because the vaccines neutralization effectiveness might go down.

If this actually happens, then I agree, but I don't think we'll get 80% of the population vaccinated anytime soon. I hope I'm wrong.

&gt;If a mutation causes the virus to bypass the neutralization of the vaccine built immunity but *does not result in serious illness* then it has transitioned from being a novel virus (a new virus that out bodies don’t have any idea how to fight) to a virus that we have some experience fighting - just like *every other virus out these that humans have overcome*.

The issue comes with what kind of mutations happen. It's true that these new variants haven't been shown to be any more deadly, thank God, but that they're more transmissable. I'm not a betting gal, so I dunno if it'll stay that way for long, but I like to hope so.

&gt;If we want to take precautions until there is no covid out there at all - we may as well just lock ourselves in our homes and wear masks forever.... and no one wants to do that.

There's a ton of middle ground between where we are now and zero cases, though. I'm not sure where to draw the line, we're gonna have to wait and see how it progresses.

Strongly suggesting isn’t forcing schools to do anything. There are doctors offices they wouldn’t let me come because of where I work and I’ve had to move appointments several times. My coworker isn’t allowed to see their oncologist because they’re too high risk and could put other patients in danger since they work at a school. Almost all of my high risk students have been pulled due to doctors suggestions- so it’s not just me questioning this data. Or really the schools ability to follow cdc guidelines.

Even social distancing is only “when feasible” so they just say it’s not feasible and don’t do it. The school bus has 3 kids to every seat like normal. They have us giving kids mask breaks, and some kids are exempt from wearing masks. 

I desperately want school going back to normal. My issue is that I can’t do a good job teaching when on any given day I might get pulled to another classroom due to illness, we close at 11am because 4 teachers tested positive, and I don’t know who I am teaching until I get to work. If I wasn’t asked to teach kids at home and at school at the same time they’d actually be learning. 

If schools being open is critical to the economy then they should invest in it like it is. Our budget was slashed at the start of school and our sanitizing wipes had to be donated. It’s cost prohibitive to have 15-16 subs a day when we normally have 3-4, or drive a whole bus to get one kid.

I should also point out many classrooms right now have 3-4 kids in them and 17-22 remote because the family is sick or refuses to send the kid. I’ve had some students quarantined 4 times this year. Most of their in person learning was missed because they came to school.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Novavax  expects to complete the clinical trial for its experimental COVID-19  vaccine in the next few weeks, but is already working on manufacturing  to be able to reach full production capacity quickly, Chief Executive  Officer Stanley Erck said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We  should be at full capacity starting in May or June, maybe as much as  one hundred and fifty million doses per month globally,” he said.

150M doses per month *globally*.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Erck said he expects it will be several weeks before Novavax files the  trial data with regulators in the United Kingdom, Europe and elsewhere,  meaning that full review for authorization of its vaccine could take “a  couple months.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Novavax will begin scaling vaccine production in February or March, and  expects to have its own production ramped up by the second quarter,  along with production from the Serum Institute and partners in South  Korea and Japan, Erck said.

It'll be a few months before they have local approval and can start shipping appreciable quantities of vaccine to any country. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Erck said 16,000 volunteers have already taken part in its U.S. trial  and that it will likely hit its target of 30,000 participants by  early-to-mid February. The company would then observe them for about six  weeks before reviewing the results, he added.

I mean, for an ideal person with ideal immunity and no post-covid, maybe it's is true. But if you compare IgG to S-protein and associated memory cells, vaccines produce much more antibodies than actual COVID. 3 times more on average. Maaaybe if you arrange a prime-boost method with actual corona you'll get better result, but come on. Imagine that.

mRNA is encoded with S-protein. Just like adenoviral vectors. In the end they produce the same antibodies like adenoviral vector vaccines do. mRNA and adenoviral vectors are messengers. S-protein is the message. It's the same for both.

The only vaccines which are substantially different and close to natural immunity are inactivated ones. These are messengers and messages at the same time, all in one. In layman terms, that's actual living and breathing corona, but castrated: replication gene complex is zapped out, as well as some others, for a good measure, so it won't cause a disease and you can't infect anyone. If someone is jabbed with this one, the immunity will produce antibodies towards S-protein, and on top of that there will be another antibodies to some other proteins, like those which make of viral capsid, and these antibodies may or may not be immunocompetent.

This may be important. S-protein is the most important target for the antibodies to our knowledge, but it's also the fastest to change with mutations. If the virus mutates far enough there, so far IgG won't recognize it anymore, then we'll have to produce new vaccines which are targeting this protein = all mRNA and adenoviral vaccines against COVID that is. Inactivated vaccines might avoid this issue to an extent. That said, some proteins of living virus may cause issues for the immunity, it might produce immunoincompetent antibodies towards some of the proteins. Duds, for lack of a better word. Best case scenario, they are useless. Worst case, there might be ADE, antibody-dependent enhancement of the disease. As long as S-protein antibodies work, that won't be an issue, but when they stop, it might turn out to be dengue disaster 2.0. It's not even that unknown: antibodies towards N-protein of SARS-Cov-1 caused pneumonia in mice after SARS exposure. Are you sure that can't happen with SARS-Cov-2 in humans? 

This is why people who are recovered after COVID are still advised to take a shot and boost their immunity against SARS-Cov-2 after some time. That way we can be sure they have enough memory cells or even IgG to respond to COVID properly in the long run, like unexposed people do after the shot.",,,1611967357,{},glbb004,False,t3_l7s43b,False,True,t1_glazdo1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l7s43b/jj_covid19_vaccine_was_66_effective_in_latestage/glbb004/,1612004938,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_plftg,False,False,,

It has to be lower, because it literally cannot be 4.6x without increasing the population size by millions.  The absolute current maximum multiplier possible for LA county is 2.08.  Pretty much inline with the JAMA paper.  

&gt;Your seroprevalence was link was from early November and the number of confirmed cases has tripled since then.

The original CDC estimate was from September...  And they have dropped their estimate since then despite extending their data through December.  The CDC model is based on 2009 H1N1.  I'd rather go with one based on serology than modeling a different virus.

&gt;In terms of the double peak, at my definition of herd immunity, R drops down to 0.99. Increased travel results in a number above 1.0 and cases rise again. This is a very unstable system where minor behavioral changes have enormous effects on cases, until the population regains herd immunity.

That doesn't fit the definition of herd immunity (and also doesn't fit the model you reference as it doesn't allow for a resurgence of cases when restrictions are removed).

We are still in triage mode, and the vast majority of the scientific information has been focused on the most immediate, known dangers. Those are generally associated with the respiratory system. 

However, we don't seem to know much at all about the neurotropic aspects of this disease. What are the long term impacts people are experiencing, and at what frequency? Neurotropic diseases can be terrifyingly destructive, only showing symptoms once the damage is done. Rabies is one such example: if you're not able to get treatment before you start showing symptoms, your chance of survival is literally 0%, but symptoms may not appear for months or (rarely) even years.

When you’re there strangers are cool with talking and hanging out with people around their same age. When you get into your late 20s and early 30s people have more responsibilities. Vacation days are used to attend weddings. Friends move away for work. But you can normally still find a few that want to go and party and experience the big events. Mid to late 30s is where things can get a little rough. Finding people to go with is really difficult. You’ll probably be bored if you go alone b/c most early 20 somethings don’t want to talk to or hang out with a random person 10-15 years older than them.

LONDON—Every week across the U.K., a fleet of courier trucks ferries chilled waste material from half a million Covid-19 tests to a genome-sequencing facility in Cambridgeshire, eastern England.

The daily operation is part of a Covid-19 surveillance system that has made the U.K. the world’s leading sequencer of the coronavirus genome and helped it to spot a more contagious, and possibly more deadly, [variant of the virus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-variant-in-u-k-probed-for-increased-risk-to-younger-people-11611661304?mod=article_inline) that in most countries would have long gone unnoticed.

Viral sequencing—producing a kind of bar code for the virus—has in recent months emerged as crucial in the global hunt for versions of the pathogen that are better adapted to infect humans, evade vaccines and possibly to kill. Virus variants first identified in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil have provoked concern among experts.

The variant the sequencers uncovered in the U.K., which is now the dominant variety in the country, has a mutation that appears better able to bind onto human cells. Studies suggest it is 50% more transmissible than the previous prevalent variant while other research suggests it could be [at least 30% more deadly](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-u-k-covid-19-variant-could-be-more-deadly-british-officials-say-11611338370?mod=article_inline).

New viral variants are more likely to be spotted in the U.K. than anywhere else. As of Jan. 29, the U.K. had submitted 44%, or around 190,000, of the genomes held in a global library run by the nonprofit Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, or Gisaid. That is around 5.1% of the nearly four million cases detected in the U.K.

The U.S. is fast increasing its sequencing capabilities—but only a handful of other countries have contributed more than 1% to the library, which means scientists’ understanding of where and how the virus is mutating is patchy.

That represents a weakness in the [global response to the pandemic](https://www.wsj.com/news/collection/coronavirus-6dcf2a21?mod=article_inline): Speedy detection of new variants allows governments to adjust restrictions and limit travel from countries where new troublesome variants are prevalent. It also can help vaccine developers update vaccines.

The U.K. says it plans to address that weakness by exporting its expertise to countries with limited sequencing capabilities.

Half of the genome sequences in the U.K. were generated at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, the facility in Cambridgeshire that stores, sorts, samples and sequences genomes from the byproducts of positive Covid-19 tests from five large laboratories around the U.K.

The U.S. has increased its contribution to the global coronavirus genome database since December and has so far added 20% of the total. It has assessed about 0.3% of America’s Covid-19 cases.

Anthony Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser for the Covid-19 pandemic, said on CBS on Sunday that U.S. authorities need to expand genomic surveillance to identify variants of the virus.

Britain’s capabilities are partly built upon history. [British scientists discovered the DNA double helix](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-double-helix-was-just-the-beginning-1437166504?mod=article_inline) and were part of the international team that first sequenced the human genome.

“The U.K. was one of the first countries in the world to recognize the need for an infrastructure for viral genomic sequencing and we’ve backed it with huge investment long before Covid emerged,” Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in a speech on Tuesday.

The country’s data-rich, state-run National Health Service is also closely linked with an extensive network of researchers in its universities and the pharmaceutical industry.

Nonetheless, the U.K.’s large-scale sequencing of the coronavirus almost didn’t get off the ground.

On March 4, when the U.K. had four known cases of Covid-19, microbiologist Sharon Peacock got on the phone with a group of other scientists who agreed with her that sequencing the virus’s genome to monitor mutations would be vital to track its spread through the country and identify the source of outbreaks.

They met opposition. Some scientists thought large-scale genome sequencing of a virus that mutates more slowly than some others, such as influenza, would be futile.

“At the time, there were people saying there wouldn’t be enough mutational difference to make this worthwhile,” said Dr. Peacock, who is now director of Covid-19 Genomics U.K., a network established to trace the coronavirus’s family tree.

On March 11, the same day the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic, Dr. Peacock held a meeting in London at the Wellcome Trust with 19 others, including clinical virologists, technologists, experts in human genome sequencing and vaccinologists, to thrash out a plan for large-scale sequencing of the coronavirus.

“It wasn’t like a standard scientific meeting, it was a huge debate how we could do this,” recalled Dr. Peacock. By the end of the day they had a blueprint and submitted it to England’s chief scientific officer on March 18. It was accepted and 20 million pounds, equivalent to $27 million, of government funding was awarded on April 1 to set up COG-UK.

“This was pace over perfection and that’s been the case ever since, but I’m delighted that our consortium of over 600 people can contribute to our understanding of disease,” she added.

Yet the country’s success in variant discovery appears to be due more to serendipity than strategy.

The scale of the U.K.’s genomic sequencing output—that it has assessed up to 10% of all positive coronavirus tests in the U.K. at some points during the pandemic—was intended to identify superspreader events where identical sequences, closely related to their predecessors, emerge at the same time.

When an RNA virus like the one that causes Covid-19 replicates inside a new host, mistakes can be made in its genetic code. Most don’t matter, some are proofread and corrected and sometimes no mistakes are made at all. But some of the errors, or mutations, are large in number or important in changing the virus to affect its biology, in rare cases giving it an advantage over its predecessors.

Coronaviruses mutate more slowly than some other viruses such as influenza, so initially scientists didn’t think there would be enough mutations to make large-scale genomic sequencing worthwhile.

But because the virus has infected so many people—over 100 million world-wide so far—it has had many opportunities to mutate. Some changes, including one in the U.K. variant now reported present in at least 64 countries, confer evolutionary advantages over their forebears that make that version of the virus more transmissible.

The new variant came to experts’ attention in November, when a version with a large number of significant changes from its predecessor began to accumulate in a corner of southeast England, creating an outcrop of identical genomes that flashed red on genomists’ screens.

Initially, the sequencers didn’t know whether the variant was gaining prominence because of widespread flouting of coronavirus restrictions or whether it was the cause of a flare-up in new cases, Jeffrey Barrett, director of the Covid-19 Genomics Initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said in an online seminar this month.

By the final week of November, it was becoming clear that in exactly the same spot the mutant genomes were congregating, Covid-19 cases were accelerating in the community despite compliance with a national lockdown.

Trawling back through the genome databases, sequencers found the first occurrence of the heavily mutated variant on Sept. 20 in Kent, in southeast England, and another a day later in London. Geographical matching of cases to genomes enabled the virus detectives to say with a high degree of certainty that the correlation wasn’t a coincidence and designated the virus as one of concern.",,,1612019415,{},gldfsru,False,t3_l8n4kp,False,False,t3_l8n4kp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8n4kp/how_the_uk_became_world_leader_in_sequencing_the/gldfsru/,1612047504,19,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_rthmq,False,False,,

https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210114-covid-19-how-effective-is-a-single-vaccine-dose

&gt;&gt; According to Pfizer data published in December 2020, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is roughly 52% effective after the first dose. Out of 36,523 participants in the phase three trial – the final stage of testing where people either received two full doses, 21 days apart, or a placebo – who had no evidence of existing infection, 82 people in the placebo group and 39 in the vaccine group developed Covid-19 symptoms.
&gt;&gt; Preclinical trials would have shown that they didn't think there was enough immunity after one shot. 
&gt;&gt; However, this early protection comes with some important caveats. First, the protection doesn't kick in until at least day 12 – until then, there was no difference between the two groups. Secondly, one dose is still significantly less protective than two. The latter is 95% effective at preventing the disease after a week.

My point is, if you are going to immunize 100% of population, any efficacy number above 67% will do great job alone up to R0 = 3, assuming it prevents transmission. Even if it does not block it completely, it still reduces the chance of severe illness, which is the main problem. We don’t know how much transmission reduction do we get from vaccines yet, but masks and social distancing make R = 1.5, so that’s much easier to manage. Even Britain, despite the new SARS-Cov-2 variant, has R = 1 or below as of now. Sure, they have rather strict lockdown at the moment, but it works. 

mRNA set a high standard, but that does not mean 67% is a bad result. Hecc, the developers of these vaccines estimated to get 60-70% in the first place, they never knew they’ll exceed this number. And you are not going to jab everyone with a single shot of J&amp;J. 
NZ will have Pfizer, which is efficient enough. NZ also will have enough J&amp;J to do homologous prime-boost method with it. Or a single shot as an emergency measure in case you guys face an outbreak. You’ll have Astra as well, so even heterologous is an option. That’s a lot of vaccines to work with. 

Don’t know much about NoraVax, here in Russia we have kinda sorta similar vaccine to it, it’s subunit too, but no publications on it, unfortunately. Probably will be used to boost immunity later on. 

And no, US and Europe do not “hoard” vaccines. Nobody stashes them here, they are all used immediately when available. In case you don’t know, we have outbreaks all over the place. It’s hard to find a family which did not loose a relative to COVID already. I lost two, and the reason I rushed to get my Sputnik, which is the only relatively well-studied vaccine in Russia at the moment, is me living with my 80yo asthmatic and diabetic grannie to help her out. Turns out she can’t get her shot due to her a-fib going wild on isolation, so she has to put that back in order first, and you can imagine how hard is it find a cardiologist now. I had to get my shots and even had to stop volunteering for Red Cross. 
She is the last high risk member of my family which is not already dead to COVID, and guess what, she’s completely terrified because the entirety of her friend list got wiped out by the reaper as the result of it. I bet she alone endured more COVID casualties than a half of your country. Not the newsletter deaths in the middle of nowhere, I am talking actual friends and former colleagues. The situation in Europe is the same, if not worse. And even worse than that in the big American cities. So I guess now you can see why we use as many vaccines as possible, way before phase-III trials conclude, and the companies are not keen on delivering the doses to New Zealand. This is also the reason why ordered doses are not the main concern here, most wise countries ordered licenses for domestic production, and the biggest concern is production capacity and availability. And it makes sense. Build domestic production lines, and you’ll get your vaccines faster now. Not only that, you’ll get vaccines faster if/when COVID mutate. 

I know everyone is frustrated. But honestly, I don’t see a reason for you to panic. Your country does a great job at border controls, even for an island. That’s 38th parallel level of border security, something which is completely impossible for bigger economies.

&gt;No that is not what happened. The UK invested I'm a vaccines research and supply lines to set up manufacturing of it last February then signed a contract **guaranteeing that until 100 million vaccines had been supplied the UK plants could not be used to fulfill other contracts that may or many not be signed with other nations.**

and this is essentially what we would call a vaccine war. You see, when Pfizer set up their plants in the EU the one that started to produce and deliver before AZ, the EU did not demand that in case of a shortfall the EU would get doses first but that cuts were spread equally among Pfizer's customers. So the EU set their contract up so that companies can deliver to other customers from their EU plants even if that means that EU deliveries are cut as long as they are cut equally among the customers. 

&gt;The eu chose to wait and negotiate for longer before signing anything and after it signed at the end of August only then started work on supply chains and manufacturing. 

If the longer negotiations would've been the reason for the delays wouldn't AstraZeneca known this for quite some?

Why did they then communicate like this in November:

&gt;AstraZeneca CEO blames trial delays, not manufacturing, for COVID-19 vaccine delivery shortfall 
&gt;
&gt;[...]
&gt;
&gt;Because of the trial delays, AZ’s projected timeline for a vaccine authorization was also extended. To ensure the final product enjoys maximum shelf life as doses are rolled out in mass vaccination campaigns, **AZ decided to postpone its delivery to *governments*, Soriot said.**
&gt;
&gt;In fact, AZ has already produced a bulk vaccine that’s kept at freezing temperatures. The shelf life clock starts ticking once that frozen drug substance moves into the formulation phase of production, Pam Cheng, the company's head of operations and IT, said.
&gt;
&gt;**The company is ready to provide finished commercial products, Cheng said. “However, we really must be thoughtful on how much we progress to the final product stage,” she said. “We want to have maximum shelf life upon regulatory approval around the world.”**
&gt;
&gt;At this point, it’s better to keep the vaccine in that frozen state because it can be stored for longer. After getting positive data from clinical trials, AZ can start “massively filling vials, and **we’ll be ready to supply hundreds of millions of doses starting January next year,”** Soriot told reporters.
&gt;
&gt;When that day comes, AZ can supply the doses on a rolling basis on a delivery schedule that matches the government’s plan for the pace of vaccination, he added.
&gt;
&gt;The British pharma **has built a global supply chain able to churn out 3 billion doses of the vaccine.** A few weeks ago, the company hit its process validation milestone, which means it has established quality assurance, the final step before commercial manufacturing, Soriot said.
&gt;
&gt;AZ has pledged not to profit off the COVID-19 shot during the pandemic. Besides including the manufacturing costs in that calculation, the company is recording costs of more than $1 billion from clinical trials and other activities. To ensure that it’s offsetting those expenses, AZ’s adding an amount equivalent to a maximum of 20% of the manufacturing cost to the vaccine’s price, Soriot said.
&gt;
&gt;On top of the 100 million doses it has promised the U.K. government, AZ has a contract to provide 300 million doses to the U.S. and another with the EU for 400 million doses. In Japan, the company has agreed to deliver 120 million doses. In China, the vaccine will be offered by local firm BioKangtai, which will reserve enough capacity to make at least 100 million doses by the end of 2020.

&gt;&gt; A significant potential limitation of the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is the failure to sufficiently prevent infection and transmissionin the vaccinated population. While this has not been demonstrated conclusively, it remains a plausible risk that has been observed for other vaccines in the past and that is not being addressed directly in the vast majority of ongoing clinical vaccine studies[6,56]. In this study, we have used mathematical modeling to understand conditions in the United States at steady state, if a vaccine that was unable to prevent infection and exerted limited reduction in transmission was used as the primary or sole public-health intervention. Our results paint a grim picture: at steady state, we could expect 30 million symptomatic COVID-19 cases a year for a vaccine that is 95% effective at reducing symptoms and that is taken by 80% of the population (using best-estimate assumptions of natural immunity that lasts for 18 months, permanent vaccine immunity and an R0 of 5.7). If the reduction in risk of symptoms was concomitant with a reduction in risk of mortality (a best-case assumption), this scenario would lead to 240,000 deaths per year, making COVID-19 the third leading cause of death in the United States [51].

&gt;&gt; Another significant potential limitation of the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is reduced protection for the elderly. This remains a plausible risk as of this writing and would be consistent with the behavior of vaccines for a number of other diseases[30,32]. We used our modeling framework to explore the impact of a vaccine that was less effective in the elderly. Again, the picture is grim. For example, for a vaccine that is 85% effective in the over-65 population, at steady state, we could expect around 400,000 deaths a year (using the assumptions of 95% vaccine efficacy in the under-65 population, 80% compliance, 18 months natural immunity, permanent vaccine immunity and an R0 of 5.7; Fig. 2). The vast majority of these deaths would occur in the over-65 population. Crucially, for the over-65 population, a vaccine that does not prevent transmission and that is only partially effective will result in a never-ending pandemic. Beyond the scope of this paper, there are clear implications for the age structure of the US population and life expectancy in general.

However, there is growing evidence the E484 mutation may affect people differently. Meaning you may be able to neutralize or not, as well as the antibodies levels could be low 18 days after and high 90 days out and vice versa. That’s why the vaccine efficacies all over the place with the vaccines right now. 

&gt;&gt; Another key finding is that there is extensive person-to-person variation in how mutations affect serum antibody binding and neutralization. For instance, the neutralizing activity of several samples was reduced by &gt;10-fold by single mutations to site E484, but a few samples were essentially unaffected by E484 mutations. Similarly, mutations at sites in the 443–450 loop (e.g., G446V) caused a large drop in serum antibody binding and neutralization for some samples, but had little effect on-others. This inter-individual heterogeneity is further compounded by the fact that the effects of mutations sometimes changed over time for samples longitudinally collected from the same individual. These temporal changes could be due to a disproportionate decay in one dominant antibody clonotype, or a relative increase in antibodies targeting other epitopes.

A child who is alone (either physically because parents are out of the house at work, or emotionally because the parents are locked in their home office at work) day after day, week after week. Tweens and teenagers (and god knows kids who are younger than that) who care for younger siblings during the day while also trying to keep their head above water in their own schooling. Kids whose households are living under an unimaginable amount of stress, but they have no opportunity to be in any other environment to just feel like themselves again. Then imagine a child who isn’t even having their basic needs met due to physical or emotional abuse, or hunger, or unstable housing, and what that must feel like day in and day out with no safety net in place. 

There will be many kids who come through this able to bounce back emotionally, socially, academically, etc. Particularly for those who are in higher SES households, or have gone to private schools, or have had a stable and well-connected COVID bubble to socialize in.

&gt; 7.3.  Internal travel restrictions
&gt; This section covers internal travel restrictions only – international travel restrictions are not covered in this document . Summary of evidence One epidemiological study (231) and four simulation studies (114, 162, 232, 233) related to internal travel restrictions were included in this review. A time-series analysis study conducted in the USA showed that frequency of domestic airline travel is temporally associated with the rate of influenza spread, and following the September 11 attacks in 2001, a reduction in such travel delayed the epidemic peak by 13 days compared with the average for other years (231). A simulation study predicted that implementation of a strict travel restriction (95% travel restriction, enforced for 4 weeks) could reduce the epidemic peak by 12%, and a moderate restriction (50% travel restriction, enforced for 2–4 weeks) could delay the pandemic peak by 1–1.5 weeks (162). Another simulation study predicted that an internal travel restriction of more than 80% could be beneficial (232). A strict internal travel restriction (90%) was also consistently found to delay the epidemic peak by 2 weeks in the United Kingdom, and by less than 1 week in the USA (114). However, a 75% restriction had almost no effect (114).

I keep pasting this, but I think it's very relevant now. the WHO's 2019 Non Pharmaceutical Interventions guide which summarized evidence for these kind of measures for pandemic influenza does not mention reducing total deaths at all in this section, only delaying the peak flattening the curve.

Is it a different virus,with slightly different properties? sure. But from my understanding if anything, it's more contagious, and has a lower IFR than the Spanish flu of 1918 had, which in my amateur opinion would just reduce a ""lockdowns"" effectiveness.

Things like stagnant wages, social media, stress, obesity, diets with large amounts of refined sugars and processed fillers, student loans, an opioid epidemic, etc have created a perfect storm. Add in isolation from covid and you get what we have today. 

If you are having thoughts of depression or self harm, you need to seek professional help and get treated. There is no substitute for professional help. 

There are some things you can do to reduce stress, and be happier. Again, these are not a replacement for professional help if that is what is needed. But these can help improve the mood and stress levels of most people. 

1) exercise. There is a lot of data and research that shows that regular moderate exercise can reduce stress and give you a positive outlook. Something as simple as going on a 20 min walk in the morning can have a huge positive impact on your day. 

2) eat cleaner foods. I am not saying to eat only kale and chicken breast. Just reduce how much fast food you and sweets you eat and increase more fruits and veggies. 

3) read a book. Even if it is just 15-30 mins a day. Reading is a great way to reduce stress. There are so many types of books out there, everyone can find something they will enjoy. 

4) try new hobbies. Things like learning a musical instrument are great ways to reduce stress. You can typically find a lot of used instruments online for relatively cheap. Maybe you want to learn how to cook a certain dish or style, maybe you want to start hiking or geocaching. 

5) drink and use recreational drugs in moderation. 

6) reduce your social media presence. People that study addiction have had some surprising studies on how notifications, debates, and info we see on social media negatively impacts our stress levels. Anecdotally, I noticed a huge improvement when I deleted Facebook and instagram. I also turned off push notifications for Reddit. 

7) try to get in a routine. Plan when to exercise, read, cook, go to sleep, etc. if something is important, block out some time. If you fly by the seat of your pants, you will have the stress of not knowing when you will be able to do something and it will weigh on your mind. Allocate time and you won’t have to worry about it. 

8) work on your finances. Read *I will teach you to be rich* because it gives 6 actionable steps to organize and automize most of your finances. This will reduce a lot of stress. 

9) I have this listed last, but it is not less important.

[],,BiologyJ,,,,,,[],"I'm going to climb on my soap box. At some point both sides need to come to terms with what science is and what it isn't.    

  

**For the US Right:** You can't ignore data altogether and if you have no background in the field stop trying to argue the experiments are flawed.  Stop citing opinion pieces that talk about data as verified truths.  They're not.  At some point you have to start making rational decisions based on real world observations.  Spare me the theatrics of *proof of impossibility* and asking people to prove negative statements.  Please no more *Gish Gallops*.  Also, you can't introduce your own out of left field expert and pretend as if their alternative theory is equally robust.  The idea that a counter theory holds equal weight simply because everyone is entitled to their own opinion is just...ridiculous.  Some theories are trash.  So can we please stop pumping up people with bad theories simply because you don't like the legislation being introduced?   

  

**For the US Left:** Science is not fact.  Stop saying ""you don't trust scientific facts?"" Science is made of theories, mostly very good theories that we consider ""robust"".  However, sometimes they're really bad theories...or (*gasp)* even incorrect theories.  And when we collect better data, all theories are adjusted.  Facts never get adjusted; facts are absolute.  By it's nature, science will never be factual.  And there is your flaw.  When you tell Joe Smoe ""this is a science fact!"" and then 2 months later you're forced to revise what you told him because a new set of experiments altered what the theory supports....Joe rightfully is going to throw that in your face and say ""but you said this was a fact and now you're changing your facts?""  And the reason the US left is claiming science is fact is because they want to force their pet piece of legislation based on those *facts*...""and how could you argue against this new law?  It's based on scientific facts!""  As a scientist, that line guts me every single time.  It's based on theories, not facts.     

  

And all of this is getting at the problem in the US.  Instead of arguing the merits of the actual laws being decided, we're bogged down by people (most with no background in the field) arguing over if the science is *actually* correct.  

Let's take mandatory vaccines as an example.  Yes, a mandatory vaccine would by the data save lives.  The science would support that theory (but you'd have to admit it's not definite, pretty robust though).  Instead we introduce the argument of whether the science is accurate and *""will it really save lives?""* or *""is it safe though?!?""*.  And we ignore what we're seeing.  In reality, some people want the law and some people find it unethical to force people to get a vaccine.  That's the real political argument.   It has nothing to do with science, it's purely political.  We find these arguments time and time again, where people think it's easier to muddy the water on the science than it is to talk about the actual governing.  That's all this is and literally every topic in science has gone this way over the past 20-30 years because governing is hard and no one wants to talk about that aspect.

What are you talking about? AstraZenica's was tested in UK and South Africa, so it's unclear how much the new variants impacted the efficacy. It's tested on the elderly lol and it's safe and efficacious. Germany claimed that there's not enough data. Well, we'd all like more data, but phase 3 clinical trials don't enroll a million people, it's hard to make it so that every age group or other subgroup is statistically significant.

Nonsense lol. You simply adjust the DNA inside viral vectors.

&gt;Novavax is even worse

It's literally the single best vaccine so far by EVERY metric.

It does require ULTRA cold storage. That's its biggest downside.

The advice by the panel of medical experts will be taken into account by the government as it officially draws up its decree on usage of the vaccine.

The discussion about the right target age group for the vaccine has compounded controversy surrounding AstraZeneca's vaccine.

The European Commission Friday published a redacted version of its contract with the drugs giant, hoping to prove the company had breached a commitment on vaccine deliveries.

French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine appeared not to be effective for people over 65 years of age.
Speaking to reporters only hours before the European Medecines Agency (EMA) recommended the vaccine for adults of all ages, Macron said there was ""very little information"" available for the vaccine developed by the British-Swedish company and Oxford University.

""Today we think that it is quasi-ineffective for people over 65,"" he told the reporters, his office confirmed to AFP.

""What I can tell you officially today is that the early results we have are not encouraging for 60 to 65-year-old people concerning AstraZeneca,"" he said.

Macron said he was awaiting the EMA's verdict - which came later Friday - and also that of France's own health authority ""because they have the numbers"".

The French expert decision on the vaccine is expected at the start of next week, according to sources close to the health authority.

""I don't have any data, and I don't have a scientific team of my own to look at the numbers,"" Macron acknowledged.

Meanwhile, Germany's vaccine commission on Friday maintained its advice against using AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccines on older people.   

""The reason is because there is currently insufficient data on the effectiveness of the vaccines on people above 65 years old,"" said the commission known as STIKO.",,,1611962494,{},glb0om7,True,t3_l87klb,False,True,t3_l87klb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l87klb/macron_astrazenecas_covid_vaccine_seems_to_be/glb0om7/,1612000326,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_136cc9,False,False,,

Cuomo and others were criticized for ""sending infected patients into nursing homes"" but what other options were there? Maybe try to create covid wards in nursing homes or talk families into taking them for a few weeks until they recovered? In how many cases is that even an option?

I also wonder how they handle things like flu or other outbreaks in nursing homes in previous years. This isn't the first virus outbreak and they must be common in nursing homes.

The statistics on nursing homes are also something to consider. The US has about 1.5 million residents and, on average, pre-Covid, 300-350k of them die every year, nearly 1000 per day. This is from things like infection, sepsis, etc. The average period of time between when someone goes to a nursing home and dies is around 13 months.

I say this just because it simply puts the fatalities in perspective. About 40% of Covid fatalities are in nursing homes or about 178k in the past year.

It's not prime-boost scheme, it's just one jab. If you add the second injection of the same J&amp;J vaccine, you'll basically get homologous prime-boost method, and this method is used in AstraZeneca's AZD1222 as well as all mRNA vaccines. You see? Even mRNA vaccines require two injections in order to develop proper immunity as designed. 

J&amp;J vaccine is AD26 vector which is encoded to produce S-protein.
The first component of Sputnik-V has the same design, there is no reasons to believe it is going to work much differently. Of course, the difference here is Sputnik-V uses heterologous prime-boost method, so the second component is based on AD5 vector. It's a slightly more expensive way of doing it, but some studies suggest it might be better than homologous prime-boost method. The developers of Sputnik-V tell you are going to have some immunity after the first injection too, and I imagine it's not far from this 66% achieved by J&amp;J. Problem is, J&amp;J is not tested in any prime-boost schemes yet. But they will soon enough, and 66% for a single shot is not too shabby. I honestly don't even know the number for mRNA vaccines in one shot. The second shot will provide more IgG and memory cells, so it should be more immunogenic after the second jab. We''ll see it it reach AZD1222's efficacy, but if anything goes as I think it is going to have roughly the same prevention rate and lifetime. I may be wrong ofc, but I don't see that coming.

Oh, and by the way. 66% is more the enough for revaccination. Like, take someone who just got Pfeizer of Astra.. They'll all need another vaccine in some time in the future. Maybe in 9 months, maybe in a year, maybe in two, but that will happen. Hopefully by that time damned corona won't mutate enough to render all our vaccines useless, and in this case this person will be able to do annual boost with J&amp;J

TLDR, we need compare apples to apples

Single shot is one thing, that's what J&amp;J was tested for as of now
Homologous prime-boost is another, that's ADZ1222 and mRNA
Heterogous prime-boost is the third thing, that's Sputnik-V

[],,dohrey,,,,,,[],"So I'm not saying the obligation to deliver only applies to doses manufactured within the EU. I was capitalising AND to try to make that clear but clearly failed. The obligations are (1) to use BRE to manufacture the doses in the EU; and (2) use BRE to deliver the doses. I think we both agree on that.

Also again, I never said 5.4 does not pertain to the Initial Doses as well as other doses. I just think there is nothing in 5.4 that requires them to use the UK facilities to fulfill their BRE obligations under 5.1 as 5.1 is simply a separate set of obligations. Again, I don't think we actually disagree on that.

The crux here is the BRE point which you somewhat dodge. The BRE definition is quite weak. Much weaker than a plain construction of ""best efforts"" and probably closer to ""reasonable endeavours"". So given there is no strict requirement in the contract to use the UK facilities to fulfill the order for the initial doses, the obligation to use BRE to deliver doses under 5.1 does not seem to require AZ to breach their UK contract (which according to all reports requires them to use UK capacity to fulfill the UK order first). That is what the EU is effectively trying to require AZ to do. So what is your response to that point? Do you think there is anything in the contract that would require AZ to use the UK facilities to fulfill the order of that would involve breaching other contractual obligations or commercial relationships?

[],,ThatBroadcasterGuy,,,,,,[],"I've been cautiously optimistic that things (here in the US) will get better by the summer, or fall at the latest. Competency at the very top of government, having over a million people vaccinated a day, and the J&amp;J vaccine getting closer to approval gives me hope for this. However, the type of reporting done by the news media and commenters here on reddit has really tried to poke holes in that cautious optimism.

Here are just a couple of examples I can think of. On New Year's Day evening, my local news station did a story on when one might expect things to improve. The reporter began by saying something along the lines of ""2021 is going to look a whole lot like 2020"" and then went on to say our day to day lives wouldn't change until almost the end of the year. Another example is a comment I saw yesterday on a reddit post about Coachella getting canceled (which of course it would be as it takes place in the spring). The commenter said ""[Coronavirus is] not going away in 2021"" or something along those lines.

When it comes to ""normality"", I only care primarily about three things: 1) Full fan attendance at sporting events, 2) full indoor dining at restaurants, and 3) Stage theater performances. If any of those three things happen this year, the year would be better just for that.

Lastly, I have a vested interest in things getting back to a semblance of ""normal."" I was planning on looking for my very first job last April, but the pandemic put a grinding halt to those plans. I've since put my life on hold until things get under control.

So my question is, do I still have reason to hope that things will be better by summer?

Hypotheticals do not represent real life scenarios. Those effects will be observed in places like Israel soon. And the deaths after vaccines for Covid 19 are minimal and reduce risk significantly. The study also states there is insufficient data to analyse the prospect of sterilising immunity from vaccines which means more data needs to be collected. A never ending pandemic is neither plausible, nor realistic. No pandemic has ever lasted forever and it is not possible for it to do so. Previous coronavirus related pandemics (Russia 1889-1890) ended up expiring. Why should the Covid 19 pandemic be any different? Also, why should modelling state 400,000 deaths from this every single year? There are a lot of people who will take this vaccine, protecting them further than from their immune systems, which will consistently be topped up with further exposure to the virus when the endemic nature of the virus presents.

Also what is the point of current restrictions if 400,000 will die per year anyway? It seems to be a fruitless endeavour to minimise infection because it seems, according to this study, that a vaccines impact on the pandemic will be little to nothing. 

In conclusion, we will see the effects vaccinations will have on large populations - but in the context of historical vaccination programmes such as for measles, smallpox, polio and tetanus, even vaccines with comparatively low efficacy produce substantial impacts in the population. Vaccines of the efficacy of Pfizer and Moderna do not have no impact on a pandemic. Even the seasonal influenza vaccines reduce deaths and illness despite them being not in any way effectively targeted. These vaccines are very targeted, and can be modified in the future to continue to prevent more deaths and illness. 

We should be very hopeful and happy about these vaccines and their efficacy, not relying on implausible scenarios created by a study which suggests of a ‘never-ending pandemic’.",,,1612024129,{},gldoy1b,False,t3_l8gzzn,False,True,t1_gldm1pj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8gzzn/daily_discussion_thread_january_30_2021/gldoy1b/,1612052279,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_6c6gndas,False,False,,

The data shows that in one age range it goes down by X, another Y and another Z. This doesn't tell us anything about the efficacy of the vaccine because throughout the whole pandemic different age ranges have had different Infection rates. Earlier in Autumn younger people had a sudden, large rise, which means that the current lock down is having a relatively larger effect on the drop in infection rates. This also has nothing to do with the vaccine.

Having access to the data on as per the quote in my comment, though, they can see that *within* an age range, the group of people who have been vaccinated have a lower rate of cases than the group that have not. This data will be published in the report in the coming days, so right now all we have is the total rate for the whole age range.

Again, here's the key point:

Dr. Paul Stoffels, the chief scientific officer at Johnson &amp; Johnson, told NPR on Friday that the topline results from the company's coronavirus vaccine study fail to tell the full story about just how effective it actually is.

Johnson &amp; Johnson said that 28 days after vaccination, its vaccine is 66% effective in preventing moderate to severe cases of COVID-19. But Stoffels says that Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine is very effective where it matters most: preventing hospitalizations and deaths.

""We showed that there was an 85% efficacy against severe disease and a complete protection against hospitalization and complete protection against death. And that's across all the regions, including in South Africa,"" he says.

A new coronavirus variant that was first discovered in South Africa has already popped up in the U.S. Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine was 57% effective in preventing moderate to severe cases in that country, where the variant dominates. But it was still 89% effective in stopping severe disease, hospitalization and death in South Africa, Stoffels says.

Johnson &amp; Johnson's study included participants in the U.S., Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and South Africa. Unlike the two-dose vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine is administered as a single dose.

""That's very remarkable results: that we can show with a single dose that we can prevent across the world, at 85%, all severe cases and complete[ly] for death and hospitalization,"" Stoffels says.

Stoffels said it's not entirely right to compare the Johnson &amp; Johnson results with those from Pfizer and Moderna — which on the whole showed stronger protections, but also measure effectiveness differently than Johnson &amp; Johnson. He spoke with NPR's Ailsa Chang about its effectiveness and how fast the vaccine could be available. Stoffels says Johnson &amp; Johnson will apply for emergency use authorization with the Food and Drug Administration next week.

Here are excerpts from the interview:

To people who may not understand all the science, it just sounds like the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is not as effective [as the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines]. How would you answer that?

It's difficult to compare. The study was done at different times in different environments against the background of different strains. And so the circulating virus today is so intense that it is much more attacking the immune system. This is not direct comparison of vaccines. But what's most mattered is getting protect[ion] against dying and getting hospitalization and severe disease. And that worked extremely well. So getting, with a single dose, to protecting for that hospitalization and severe disease is what matters in this pandemic. And you can do it everywhere in the world in a very simple way.

So you feel confident to say that, yes, while some people might still get sick ... this vaccine really will help ease the burden on the health care system because it's proven completely effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths one month out.

Absolutely. But we recruited also high-risk populations, including in the favelas in Brazil, including in the townships of South Africa and that across all ages. And we had very diverse population all over the world. And also what we saw was the vaccine was equally efficacious in all ages, which is also a very strong feature because mostly the elderly people are the highest risk of dying, of hospitalization.

Your shot was 72% effective at preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 in the U.S., but only 57% effective in doing the same in South Africa. So what does that signal to you about the variant that was first identified in South Africa?

It signals that it needs more immune response before you're protected. But in the severe, we had 89% prevention of severe diseases. And it's well-known in vaccination that preventing severe diseases is typically very good. Like in influenza, what you do is you prevent with vaccination, you prevent severe disease. And that is what is happening here in COVID, too. While preventing moderates, which is light symptoms, is more difficult to show, but it was lower in South Africa, most likely due to the strain, but still preventing the very severe cases was possible with the vaccine, which is a big relief that this can be done.

How much of the shot can Johnson &amp; Johnson make and how soon?

We started last year in March when we knew that this was going to be needed. Never in history so many vaccines have been needed. And the production capacity was not available. So we started building plans and we are committed to deliver a billion doses in the course of the year. We will gradually be able to deliver more throughout the year and we'll work with each of the individual governments and communicate to the population when a vaccine can be available in particular countries.

Which vaccine should people get? I mean, would you recommend your vaccine for certain groups of people versus others?

It's up to the health care authorities to do that in each of the countries. But what's very essential is that the most vulnerable people, the elderly, those with co-morbidities, get vaccinated very fast because they are the highest risk of getting sick and dying.

But I'm very happy, actually, as a person, as a father, as a family member, that they're so many vaccines available, because probably multi-billion people have to be vaccinated before this will be over. And it's only with the collection of vaccines and the collaboration of all of the pharmaceutical companies here that it will be able to combat this disease in the world. And that's where our vaccine will have its place. But every of the vaccines will have their place in combating this pandemic.

&gt;The United States is doing so little of the genetic sequencing needed to detect new variants of the coronavirus — like the ones first identified in Great Britain and South Africa — that such mutations are probably proliferating quickly, undetected, experts said.

&gt;The lack of widespread genetic sequencing means the window is closing to find and slow the spread of variants such as the one first spotted in Britain, which appears to be much more transmissible, and those initially detected in Brazil and South Africa. All have been discovered in small numbers in the United States.

&gt;Now is when genetic sequencing — a process that maps out the genetic code of the particular virus that infected someone so it can be compared with others — would do the most good, while such variants are less prevalent in the U.S. population and action can be taken against them.

Then EU was praised for keeping the virus at bay during summer... until it didn't. Sometime around that Australians were fighting with outbreaks on their soil. And on and on it goes.. Now UK is good, US is good and EU is bad socialist bureaucratic incompetent hell hole until something new happens.

I'm not trying to defend or attack anyone, I'm just pointing out the nature of viral diseases. It's not an on/off switch, it lingers, moving from one place to another both locally and globally. The best now can be the worst tomorrow when some new mutation comes along that doesn't respond well or bypasses to the vaccine immunity.

The order of life threatening reactions to the vaccine are about 1-2 in a million, and even then it is hard to call those ""life threatening"" - even acute allergic reactions are well tolerated in a clinical environment where interventions are able to be applied quickly. 

Let me try to put it in alternative terms: as of today, with 91 *million* doses administered, there has been no recorded death that has been attributed to the vaccine from an acute reaction, and there is no evidence of post-vaccination deaths attributable to the vaccine (this is different than saying ""no one has died after getting the vaccine"" - you'd expect many 80M+ primarily elderly people to die within weeks of the vaccine just be sheer statistical chance). 

In other words, right now, the ""fatality rate"" from the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines appears to be roughly 0 in 80 million.

Compare this to the known fatality rate from COVID for ages 25-34: about 50 per million. Still very low, but at least so far, more than 4,000 times higher than the vaccine death rate. And that ignores the exogenous benefits to others who are more vulnerable. 

You are right that the FDA has not provided full approval of the vaccine, but that is not a value adding statement. There are tons of FDA-approved drugs that are incredibly dangerous. As a silly example, Tylenol is statistically far more likely to kill you than this vaccine is due its low therapeutic dose to LD-50 ratio due to liver toxicity. Plenty of FDA-approved cancer treatments have fatality rates that exceed 1%. 

Vaccines are typically very safe. They are low-dose, one time, and have a very high bar for approval because they are given to healthy people. Even the extremely unusual ""horror stories"" of some old vaccines have long-term negative reactions in the single digits of millions doses given - *still* significantly less than the death rate of 24-35 year olds from COVID. And these vaccines are theoretically *safer* than old vaccines because of their mechanism of action and the fact that they have no preservatives in them. 

Not getting the vaccine to be ""safe"" is as intellectually sound or reasonable as saying you don't wear seatbelts because there is some theoretical scenario where a seatbelt could cause greater injury or death. Except the delta here is even greater because it's actually true that in 1-2% of accidents seatbelts can cause more damage than if not worn. In this case, evidence appears to point to 0%. 

Think of it this way: this vaccine is producing one tiny protein for a brief period of time to illicit an immune reaction. The substances in the vaccine themselves are completely harmless outside of an autoimmune response (they are chemicals your body either produces on its own or your cells regularly consume). Compare that to getting COVID (or any virus really): it's an all-out biological war. Even asymptomatic infections result in widespread cellular death and inflammatory response.

There 100's of millions more doses of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna on the way, but we can't even effectively administer the ones we already have. Johnson &amp; Johnson will possibly have an EUA in February. 

In the meantime, well-established and proven public health strategies are being used successfully by other countries, such as education, communication, increased testing, financial support, countering false information, increased mask production, etc. These include countries such as Liberia, Senegal, Uganda, India, Colombia, and South Africa.

https://archive.is/L6NZn

Let's say we want to release more vaccine doses anyway, but what if this ends up significantly delaying the second dose? There is some data on effectiveness for AstraZeneca-Oxford. There is no data for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n18

All vaccines are not the same.  We cannot extrapolate AstraZeneca-Oxford data to Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna (much less for other pathogens). They don't even have similar mechanisms or efficacy.

For some vaccines, it is necessary to restart from dose 1 if the second dose is delayed.

https://www.who.int/immunization/policy/Immunization_routine_table3.pdf

If delaying the second dose results in lower effectiveness, can't we just administer booster doses?  Well, there is some research that suggests vaccines could possibly lose effectiveness with repeat doses.

Still early on J&amp;J but:

&gt; Protection was generally consistent across race, age groups, including adults over 60 years of age (N= 13,610), and across all variants and regions studied, including South Africa where nearly all cases of COVID-19 (95%) were due to infection with a SARS-CoV-2 variant from the B.1.351 lineage

I do agree that the decision making process of those in charge is something to worry about. California has gone back and forth between not doing enough to grabbing onto certain specific statistics and making ridiculous policy out of them.

I think it will actually end up being quite simple. The at-risk population is those 65+ with health conditions which are about 12-15% of the total. Once they are vaccinated, probably by any vaccine, hospitalizations and fatalities will fall by 80-90%.

So the logical way to reconcile the two is that 5.4 is about setting up manufacturing capacity for the totality of potential orders under the contract (e.g. including the optional doses). 5.1 is about delivering the initial doses.

Which summer wave?  The first wave?  The one that was ended by locking down the entire country and greatly reducing mobility?

Because of the holiday increase in cases that was accompanied by an increase in mobility.  California had a decrease in cases before the holiday surge.  The wave peaked on December 21st and started dropping until December 31st.  If immunity was a factor here rather than just mobility, there wouldn't have been a surge in cases caused by the holiday, resulting in a second peak.

Now if you take that concept and scale it up to a state of the art scientific laboratory...

There’s probably very complex expensive machines that only one company makes. You probably have to build manufacturing capabilities to build the tools to build the laboratory. 

And there’s installation, calibration, and all kinds of very specific skill bases that not enough people even know how to do. You’ll have to spend months training the technicians to have enough to do what you’d like to do to make enough in time. 

Not to mention every county in the planet vying for these very limited resources.

And actually, they weren’t even wrong! Even now, no one claims that masks are particularly effective at keeping you from getting sick if you are exposed. That is consistent with their original statement. And it’s still true. They were reincorporated I to the public health recommendation when they realized that they are effective in limiting the range that an infected person will project the virus. Their eventual recommendation was as part of the “flattening the curve” strategy. This strategy used masks paired with social distancing to keep the spread below a rate where it overwhelmed emergency rooms. So masks doesn’t stop you from getting the virus, they only allow for a lower degree of social distancing than would be required without them. That’s why these absurd cloth masks are acceptable. They don’t serve any function in preventing the wearer from getting it. They only limit the distance of their exhales. As we reach emergency room capacity, you increase social distancing.

To be fair, you can't just use the raw numbers. You have to use the number that got it in the vaccinated group, compared to a similar composition group who didn't get vaccinated and how many of them got it. It turns out when compared that way, you actually get right around the 95% efficacy rate shown in the Phase III trials, maybe slightly higher.

It would suck if we did everything ""right' to lower risks for ourselves and our community only to have the kids or us get sick in the 11th hour right before vaccines were available for all.

&gt;Sponsors also worry that organisers have not told them what contingency plans there are in case the pandemic derails the Games again this year.

&gt;That uncertainty over the Olympics marks a fresh blow to domestic sponsors, including many of Japan’s biggest companies, such as Canon Inc and Japan Airlines Co Ltd, who have collectively pitched in more than $3 billion to support the event.

&gt;Assurances by both the Japanese government and the International Olympic Committee this month that the Games would begin as scheduled on July 23 have not quelled concerns.

&gt;In interviews with two dozen sponsors, organisers and officials, sources described deepening uncertainty and frustration as national infection numbers hit record highs in January, turning the public mood against the event.

&gt;Nearly 80% of the public now believes the Games should be cancelled or delayed further, according to a January survey by Kyodo.

&gt;Fears that an extended emergency declaration could further erode public confidence in the Games is also a worry, at least 11 of the sources said.

This was still very, very good news back in March or whenever it was reported, but the number is still very comparable to influenza.  Epidemiologists made a big deal out of it because 1/2 the mutation rate of influenza is massively better than like 10x the mutation rate of influenza.

The way redditors talk about it (""much lower mutation rate"" or ""covid has nothing on Influenza when it comes to mutating"") is very inaccurate in its weighting.  The mutation of rate is still the same close order of magnitude and much more comparable.

At the same time we're unlikely to be getting yearly booster shots ""for decades"".  It is looking not like every year now, and its unlikely to go on for decades.  Even after one vaccine dose this year whatever strain manages to successfully achieve immune escape to become epidemic will still not cause the same level of damage (its somewhat unlikely it'll even be as deadly to unvaccinated people since the mutations necessary to achieve immune escape will probably come at a cost to overall fitness -- aka the virus will evolve to be less severe).

We could probably all just get vaccinated this year and then the virus would to turn into a common cold virus very quickly without even any boosters (I'm still getting my booster shots when they become available though).

[],,sudospectral,,,,,,[],"The D614G evidence is iffy though.  There was probably some improvement to fitness, but its also been argued that it was just simply that D614G colonized Italy and hence the rest of Europe and hit NYC and took over America.  The D614 strain was shut down in Wuhan and when it hopped here to Seattle we got lucky and locked down early and then haven't had the severity of outbreaks that the rest of the USA has had so just [viral] population effects could have caused us to import more D614G than we exported D614 so D614 ""lost"".

Similarly I'm not super convinced by the variant evidence to date.  And what is weird is that I'd accept that the variant increased transmission and was more virulent and that was mediated by increased viral replication.  But first they came out and said there was increased transmission, increased viral load and it wasn't more virulent.  Then they said it increased transmission and didn't increase viral load or virulence.  Now it is increased transmission and increased virulence and no increased viral load.  I'm still waiting for all three to light up at the same time with some convincing evidence all pointing the same direction.  And its highly politically convenient.

But that should be ""short term"" mutations sliding along the original fitness curve trying to boost R0 because of emerging herd immunity.  But since there's something like 20 epitopes on the spike protein alone the sum total of mutations to really achieve immune escape from the vaccines to the point that R0 goes above 1.0 again should come at an overall cost to fitness.

The part of SARS-CoV2 that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines prompt your immune system to hate and destroy don’t appear to be a part that’s commonly selected (and I’d like to stress that the selection here is essentially random and not so much a deliberate choice) by “natural” immunity. I say “natural” because every process occurring to develop your immunity is the same in a vaccine and in full infection, it’s just the manner in which your body is initially introduced to foreign substances that’s different (an injection rather than respiratory droplets, in the case of COVID). The strong reactions being seen in second doses of the vaccine are not a direct product of vaccination, they are an inherent sign that your immune system is responsive and active. Fevers very rarely due to the direct action of a pathogen but rather a defense mechanism mounted by your body. 
In relation to the level of immunity that you’re also asking about, to my knowledge (most recent education on this stuff is immunology in first year of med school), there should be no interference with the strength of his immune response from “natural” infection if he is subsequently immunized. In fact, if he developed antibodies and these things called memory T cells to the same part of the virus that the vaccine targets, he’ll have an effectively stronger immunity. In subsequent infections where you have immunological memory, your response will become more rapid and more efficient. This is typically represented by looking at antibody titers, which is just the easiest snapshot of someone’s immunity you can get. You’ll see higher titers for subsequent infections, meaning more antibodies produced, and if you were to assess the strength of antibody grabbing onto nasties, you’d also see an increase.

Obviously with COVID some people don’t develop significant symptoms short term, but to an extent the illness does seem to have a dose response (ie the more virus you are exposed to the sicker you get). So with the mild disease after J&amp;J vaccination, I am assuming this is due to a partial immune response that limits viral replication in your body. Is it possible that the people with mild initial symptoms who then became long haulers were those who just reacted to high levels of virus over time/took a while for the damage to reach a point that was noticeable?

[],,MartinS82,,,,,,[],"&gt;The issues don't actually come from their own sites the production issues have arisen at a French pharma company that the eu insisted be part of the supply chain. The various other production lines in other countries have faced the same issues.

But what did AZ mean when they said in November that they were halting deliveries to governments to optimize shelf life, that the bulk vaccine was already produced and that they were holding of on bottling for that reason and that they were ready to churn out 100s of million of doses starting January? This couldn't be related to the UK order, right? They are not churning out 100s of millions of doses there.

In November AstraZeneca said, that they are **deciding** to postpone deliveries to governments not that there were production issues, they explicitly said that there were no production issues.

According to the Advanced Purchase Agreement they have to inform the EU if they have production issues and they have to produce in alternative facilities including UK facilities if there are production issues.That is probably why the EC was so surprised and irritated when they said that their UK production was totally separate from their EU production.
 
If they don't actually can produce in the plants they use for their British contract, they would have had to produce in other factories and if it is common to not get high enough yields at the beginning of their productions they would have had to plan with a bigger production according to the APA with the EU and actually according to common sense.

You cannot say that it is a common problem and then say that it would be unreasonable to have greater production capacity in reserve, that is essentially what between all of this smoke screen of AZ is the core issue.

The reality is, that AZ said that they had production problems in one plant and that therefore they could not deliver and if they actually knew as they say now that they were month behind and therefore could not guarantee full yields, they had to plan with a greater capacity to begin with.

They are essentially arguing that they had the unexpected issue(therefore unreasonable to plan for) that was already obvious when the contract was signed (therefore fault of the long negotiations)  

&gt;It's oversight on the eu's part thst they did not demand contracts specify that in the event of disruption their contracts be prioritised 

No, that is not an oversight, that is by design and it is also part of the AZ contract and the CureVac contract. When there was a problem in the Belgian plant, they did not just stop delivering to Canada or Israel, they reduced the supply to all customers. 

That was explicitly what the EU called for when they said they wanted to avoid vaccine nationalism and since AZ included UK plants in their contract and the contract between the UK and AZ is secret the EU couldn't have known that the UK plants were exclusive for the UK.

&gt;Johnson said the COVID-19 pandemic had caused countries to have divided approaches to mitigating the threat, “with cheque book wars on airport tarmacs as nation has vied with nation for a supply of PPE”, but that this can’t continue in the context of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.
&gt;
&gt;“The health of every country depends on the whole world having access to a safe and effective vaccine, wherever a breakthrough might occur; and…we will do everything in our power to bring this about,” he asserted.
&gt;
&gt;although I think if you sign a contract after another that specified others cannot compromise the fulfillment of it then they wouldn't be in a position to ever sign a contract interfering with that. 

https://pharmaphorum.com/news/uk-pledges-571m-to-equitable-covid-19-vaccine-access/

This is how the UK communicated their stance last year, while they in their secret contract ruled out that any UK produced vaccine would go to any non UK citizen until they got 100 million doses.

&gt;although I think if you sign a contract after another that specified others cannot compromise the fulfillment of it then they wouldn't be in a position to ever sign a contract interfering with that.

The order in which contracts are signed is not an issue in continental law. In UK law it is improtant i have gathered from this issue but the EU-AZ contract was signed under Belgian law and EU courts are in charge of enforcing it.

&gt;It's also worth noting that the UK ordered some 40 million pfizer doses- shortly after the eu ordered from them and as such the UK were only guaranteed 5 million doses from pfizer before the end if march 2021 as they had to fulfil their much larger eu order as a priority given the contract was signed first 

Yes, you see this is exactly the thing. Pfizer did not sign into contract to deliver 40 million doses to the UK even though they asked for it, because they had already promised their capacities at that point.

AZ on the other hand **now** claims that they always knew that they wouldn't be able to deliver what they signed with the EU and still signed the contract, naming specific factories they would use if they have production issues and putting out statements in November that they were halting production because of shelf life issues.

&gt;and may well for all we know include a clause that they have to be the priority. 

No, we know that this is not the case since when Pfizer had to reduce production the EU did get fewer doses while doses still were exported.

&gt;That pfizer also encountered supply issues and has cut back on what they can supply and by when is not the fault of AZ or the British government. 

What is your point here? I mentioned the Pfizer deal because they are proof that in fact the EU was not doing vaccine nationalism when the UK was doing it and even know as the EU is introducing controls on the exports of vaccines they have said that this would only been done to guarantee that the contracts are followed, the contracts that include sharing losses among the customers of the companies.

&gt;But to address your point as I say the handling of the distribution of the pfizer vaccine hasn't actually been any different to that of the AZ vaccine 

No it has been different. When the Pfizer plant in Belgium had to reduce their output the burden was shared among Pfizer's customers including the UK. When AZ had production issues the burden was not shared among AZ customers.

&gt;only thst the UK didn't insist on them setting up new manufacturing and supply chains in the UK. Also that AZ is not making any profit on their vaccine but I believe Pfizer is....

The whole point of the AZ vaccine was actually how well it could be produced everywhere and the main downside of the mRNA vaccines was how specialized and uncommon the production facilities are. That is the reason mRNA plants are not set up everywhere but in countries with a strong Pharma industry like Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and the US.

Critizising local production of ChAdOx vaccine is outright absurd and shows how the media blitz of AZ to deflect their responsibility to their customers warped the perception of the public:

&gt;Many experts are rooting for the AstraZeneca vaccine to succeed because it's much cheaper than the mRNA shots from Pfizer and Moderna. Plus, it doesn't come with the stringent cold chain distribution requirements associated with those vaccines. AZ and its development partner, the University of Oxford, have teamed up with drugmakers around the globe to expand supply for a worldwide vaccination push.

https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/astrazeneca-has-a-winning-formula-for-its-covid-19-vaccine-ceo-says

Having production around the world was the plan to begin with. It was not a fanciful idea of the EC. 

&gt;Also that AZ is not making any profit on their vaccine but I believe Pfizer is....

AZ produced at production cost plus 20% on the price for the development cost but the infrastructure they buy to produce the vaccine they will obviously keep afterwards. If I build a house for you at cost but I buy a truck and a crane and hire workers and pay for them and all that are the costs and afterwards I keep the crane and the truck, that is not a charity and every company would take that deal every time. 

the CEO of Astra still gets paid as do all their workers and they will keep the machines they buy from the ad cost production.",,,1612013715,{},gld6hoz,False,t3_l7quju,False,True,t1_glcyjxr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l7quju/astrazeneca_must_deliver_vaccine_doses_from_uk_to/gld6hoz/,1612042776,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_ytxtv,False,True,,

&gt;While there is a risk COVID-19 can inflict permanent, long-term lung damage, particularly among people with preexisting lung conditions, there is hope for reversal. A September report from the European Respiratory Journal found coronavirus-induced lung inflammation and fluid buildup appeared to improve steadily over 12 weeks, hinting at an innate repair mechanism within the lungs. The finding is promising but will require further research given the small size of the study with only 82 patients, mostly male and average age over 50. 

This gives me some hope that this damage, even if common for people with asymptomatic cases, will reverse itself in the short to medium term as the body heals. Regardless, my own personal risk assessment is that I'd rather get on with my life once I get the vaccine, even if it means dealing with some of these lung issues from a mild case of covid.

[],,Evening_Writer,,,,,,[],"There's a HUGE problem in North Louisiana (MONROE AREA) concerning fair, efficient vaccination distributions and I wouldn't be surprised if it's not happening statewide in more places. The issue is disgusting, frustrating, embarassing and idiotic in so many ways. Vaccine providers should be ""one goal-focused"" during this epic pandemic and that's to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible according to CDC guidelines. Hospitals, clinics, doctors' offices, pharmacies, labs and other designated locations have one job: administer the vaccine. Instead, I have personally found some of these facilities are using access to these vaccines as a marketing tool to acquire new patients and they are taking advantage of the elderly patients who are seeking their help!

For me personally, when I was trying to help my older family members get Covid vaccine appointments, we were told they couldn't get appointments at a health clinic unless one of the clinic doctors was their primary care physician. So, the only way I could schedule the Covid appointments was to change their primary care physicians and schedule appointments with the physcians.Then, we were told they were out of the vaccines at the time. We were not looking for new doctors. We were just looking to get them a free, hopefully life-saving vaccine. Free marketing for these unscrupulous health providers thanks to the State of Louisiana? Wow! Shame on them! There will ALWAYS be people and companies trying to take advantage of a bad situation. You know, the bad apples? The State of Louisiana has to be more careful, more diligent, add more checks and balances and figure it all out before President Biden sends more vaccines for more clinics to hoard. Randomly ""check"" on these facilities and their practices.

Also, I'm pretty upset with our healthcare workers not getting their vaccinations in a timely manner. They either want them or they don't. I am the biggest supporter of the industry because my mom is a retired nurse. I know what they do for the profession and patients they love. I also know, she would never have waited another day jeopardizing her life, her family's life, the life of her patients and co-workers or those in the public. I understand everyone can be scared of side effects. But we really don't have the luxury of time right now. Over 400,000 dead people would have gladly taken that vaccine. It's absolutely ridiculous it's been almost a month and so many Louisiana healthcare workers have not gotten vaccinated. If it wont be mandatory (like the kids' vaccines are for school), the healthcare workers should take the shot or move to the end of the line and allow the next group to move up. They cannot indefinitely for weeks and months just ponder getting vaccinated while people are waiting and dying. Is that why some of the vaccines are expiring and being thrown out in some areas? To me, there is NEVER any excuse for that! I would rather the vaccine facility send workers to stop people at the red light, pull people from the hospital cafeteria, go into the parking lot, pull up to the school board office to vaccinate teachers or roll up on a college campus to vaccinate students before throwing out perfectly, much-needed, expensive, life-saving vaccines! We should never have that option to just discard them. This is a team effort. It wont work unless we ALL do our part with common sense folks. COME ON LOUISIANA! USE COMMON SENSE!

[],,sudospectral,,,,,,[],"Right but influenza has taken the hit to fitness already many years ago.  So the 1918 H1N1 pandemic would have been most fit of that variant.  As the whole world got infected to the point where the R0 of the original wild type was pushed well below 1.0 then you had the pressure for immune escape.  The resulting H1N1 virus became endemic and less virulent probably due the cost of immune escape and became seasonal influenza.

And I guess its a semantic argument but I wouldn't call a factor of 2 that much lower.  It is still high enough that there's a good chance this coronavirus does mutate to achieve immune escape and will also become endemic.  Some of the statements in this thread like ""covid has nothing on Influenza when it comes to mutating"" reads MUCH stronger to me like it isn't a worry, the virus won't mutate and it'll just go away -- which is very much not true.  That's the kind of statement that I'm arguing against.  The truth is much more in the middle, or we wouldn't be having variant fever in the daily headlines.

And I felt I was clear that the original reason that epidemiologists were very happy was that mutations level of influenza or slight less were fine because that meant that vaccine development was possible.

I'm somewhat skeptical that the variants are really changing that much, but if they are then the virus is likely just turning up the replication rate in host to create higher viral loads.  This creates more transmission and also more virulence, basically by sliding a lever along the same fitness curve.  The selection pressure producing that is probably due to incomplete immunity (as a chunk of the herd attains immunity the R0 of the previous wild-type drops and the virus has pressure to increase the R0 through enhanced transmission and virulence).  That can also explain the more-lethal second wave of the 1918 virus (see for example [this study](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6379/1030.full?ijkey=pJMpEVIr.mD4c&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci)).",,,1611986929,{},glcbsy3,False,t3_l87d32,False,True,t1_glc59fw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l87d32/covid19_variants_will_soon_outnumber_original/glcbsy3/,1612026677,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_56yv9n5n,False,False,,

The European Commission said it would invoke Article 16 to justify its initial plan to impose vaccine export controls on Northern Ireland, even though the region remains part of the EU’s single market for goods.

It cited the risk of “serious societal difficulties” in the EU if the bloc was unable to deploy enough vaccines to its own citizens.

Julian Smith, former Northern Ireland secretary, said the EU had “pulled the emergency cord” without following the proper processes that had been agreed over years of negotiations.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the move came “without anywhere near the level of understanding of the Good Friday Agreement, of the sensitivities of the situation in Northern Ireland”.

“It was an almost Trumpian act — I’m very pleased that they’ve changed their minds,” he said.

The Commission has since republished its vaccine shipment control measures with the Article 16 proposals stripped out.

The export restrictions have drawn criticism from business groups including the International Chamber of Commerce, which has warned they could lead to retaliation from other countries and have a devastating impact on global vaccine supplies.

It has also emerged that Belgium, a key location for vaccine production in the EU, has notified the Commission of a draft health law that would give it new powers to curb medicines exports.

The proposed legislation would allow Belgian authorities to restrict or ban the shipment of critical medicinal products and active ingredients, in case of shortages or potential shortages.

A spokesperson for Frank Vandenbroucke, Belgium’s health minister, said the notification to the commission was not related to vaccine exports or uncertainties about jab supplies.

The draft law aimed to set up a “future legislative framework for managing pandemics more efficiently,” he added.",,,1612018040,{},glddceu,True,t3_l8n56a,False,True,t1_glddbwl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8n56a/eu_pledges_vaccine_controls_will_not_hit_uk/glddceu/,1612046258,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_136cc9,False,False,,

**Von der Leyen vows BioNTech/Pfizer orders from Belgium will not be disrupted during tense call with Johnson**

Ursula von der Leyen has promised Boris Johnson that future EU controls on vaccines will not disrupt contracted supplies of the Belgian-made BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine to Britain.

The European Commission president, made the commitment to the prime minister in a tense Friday night call, which followed the Commission’s controversial plan — hastily abandoned — to impose emergency border controls on vaccines entering Northern Ireland from the EU.

Ms von der Leyen tweeted that the talks with Mr Johnson had been “constructive”, adding: “We agreed on the principle that there should not be restrictions on the export of vaccines by companies where they are fulfilling contractual responsibilities.”

Mr Johnson’s allies confirmed that this included the 40m doses that Pfizer is contracted to supply Britain from a plant in Belgium. The Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The dropping of the implied threat to Pfizer exports and the abandonment of the proposal to include Northern Ireland in new export controls has calmed tension between London and Brussels.

Mr Johnson has tried this week to avoid stoking tension and inflaming a vaccine war which he believes would harm both sides and hinder the global fight against Covid-19.

“The call was fine, hopefully that’s the end of it,” said one ally of the prime minister. “We don’t plan to dwell on it.”

But Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland’s first minister, on Saturday called on Mr Johnson to follow Brussels’ lead and override part of the Brexit agreement to ease the flow of goods between GB and NI.

Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol has a “safeguard” clause to override the agreement, which is intended to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland. It includes checks on GB/NI trade.",,,1612018031,{},glddbwl,True,t3_l8n56a,False,False,t3_l8n56a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8n56a/eu_pledges_vaccine_controls_will_not_hit_uk/glddbwl/,1612046251,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_136cc9,False,False,,

A vaccinated person, even if gets symptoms from COVID, has an immune system with built-in defenses ahead that will kick in as soon as possible, even if not the strongest.

Even a common cold can cause a viral pneumonia, from the older HCoVs that circulate. You most likely won't get one if you're not an almost extremely immunosuppressed invididual. You can (and often do) still develop symptoms from common colds though.

&gt;  
&gt;It would be a game-changer, many said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then, the efficacy numbers came out. And the average Joes — the  people who don’t fully understand trial data — let out a collective  groan. After all, who wants a vaccine with a success rate of 72% versus  the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which have a rate of 94-95%.  
&gt;  
&gt;Never mind that the J&amp;J vaccine is showing 85% efficacy against  severe disease and 100% protection against hospitalization and death.  The general public just heard 72% compared with 94%. And everybody knows  an “A” student is much better than a “C” student.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Richard Marlink, the director of the [Rutgers Global Health Institute](https://globalhealth.rutgers.edu/), said you can’t think of it that way, for three reasons:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Any vaccine is better than no vaccine;  
&gt;  
&gt;The testing period for both vaccines were different — so it’s not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison;  
&gt;  
&gt;We still don’t know the length of effectiveness of any of the vaccines — is it six months or many years?  
&gt;  
&gt;Then, there’s this: Those who have spent a lifetime in this field will tell you both numbers are outstanding.  
&gt;  
&gt;“These are all home-run vaccines,” Marlink said. “You’re looking at  the difference between a BMW and a Mercedes. They’re both unbelievably  wonderful cars — and both are not just going to get me where I need to  go, they’re going to get me there in style.  
&gt;  
&gt;“This is not the difference between the old Pinto and a Cadillac.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Marlink, the inaugural Henry Rutgers Professor of Global Health,  knows his stuff. If you want Ivy League qualifications, he’s got them,  including an undergraduate degree from Brown University and two decades  of work at Harvard University, where he spent two decades as the  executive director of the Harvard AIDS Institute.  
&gt;  
&gt;This experience, he said, has taught him that people need to let this  pandemic play out before they start making judgments on vaccines based  solely on one number.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We’re just beginning to test these vaccines,” he said. “We don’t  know how long the durability is. We just know the initial effectiveness.  
&gt;  
&gt;“What if one lasts much longer than the other? These are different  mechanisms to activate our immune system against the virus. They  certainly could have different lengths of effectiveness. We don’t know  that yet.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The numbers themselves could be off, too, Marlink said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“They were tested in different times and in different places,” he  said. “The pandemic has changed and there are variants. Johnson &amp;  Johnson tested in South Africa, which is good, because there’s a  different variant there. We’re just at the beginning of trying to  compare vaccines side by side in the real world.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Instead of fixating on the number, people should look at these as  new and very successful vaccines. With variants happening, we’re going  to need to continue to test versions of the same vaccine.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Marlink even has an answer to the ultimate trick question: Which vaccine is the most effective?  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s the one that’s in your arm, he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“When all this balances out, something like a single-shot vaccine  that may have a little bit less efficacy in its percentages may overall  be more effective, because it’s going to get into more people’s arms,”  he said. “Let’s put it that way. We say in drugs, the best drug is the  one people take. It will be the same with vaccines. The one that can get  into the most people’s arms will be the most effective.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Marlink hates to dates himself — see the Pinto reference. But, he  said a story from his own childhood explains the issue best of all.  
&gt;  
&gt;“When I was really small, we just sat in our desks at school and got a  sugar cube in our mouth for the polio vaccine,” he said. “We thought it  was the best vaccine ever. Now, it wasn’t the only version — there was  the Sabin and the Salk vaccines. And they were both effective vaccines.  But, over time, we learned which one was more effective and had less  serious side effects.  
&gt;  
&gt;“But, they essentially changed the course of polio. It got rid of it. That’s where we want to go.”",,,1611974103,{},glbonu8,False,t3_l86vvg,False,False,t1_glb7mmr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l86vvg/when_it_comes_to_vaccine_efficacy_heres_why_94/glbonu8/,1612011232,60,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5z57v,False,False,,

Its a mess, I agree. But I personally see it this way. The UK is way ahead on its vaccination rate compared to the EU countries and it has achieved this through early shipments from the EU.

I thought I made it clear my expectations are mere expectations and the my all come from an assumption they should work similarly to the first component of Sputnik due to exactly the same design... If I did not, I am sorry, doing it now as I speak. 
Sure, that’s not actual trial, that’s a guess, but it should be educated enough to be confident in it unless proven otherwise. 

I only insist on one thing. The vaccine is more efficient than infection, no matter how you put it:

1. A certain percentage of infected patients fail to develop long-term immunity because they actually die as the result of the infection. That’s not 1/10000000 chance of unexpected severe anaphylaxis, we are talking large statistically significant numbers here. 
2. Post-COVID is a thing, there is no way to predict it, at least not yet, and it significantly aggravates all other health issues, to the point people end up dying of ordinary flu shortly thereafter.
3. Typical S-protein specific IgG readings for prime-boosted vaccines tend to be three times higher than those for recovered patients. Their half-life is much longer too, that suggest better immunity for severe case prevention in the long run.
4. There is no consensus on mucosal immunity at the moment. Some say it’s supposed to be there, others don’t, no info about IgA to my knowledge, and no actual data yet. If the first is true, that’s awesome. If the second is true, the upcoming nasal vaccines may turn out to be better - either as a whole solution or as a primer. No data on how long it’s going to last too. Nasal flu vaccines aren’t that great here, unfortunately.
5. I mentioned some other potential advantages and disadvantages which are not clear, at least to me.

1. There's no way to tell if everyone in your risk tier who hasn't had covid got the vaccine before you. With the high number of asymptomatic cases, there are bound to be tons of people getting vaccinated who had the virus and never found out.
2. If you've had the virus before, the antibodies could be gone by the time you get the vaccine (we know the immune response for those who've had the virus is shorter than the vaccine's response, too), so you're as vulnerable as those who never had the virus. This is especially true for people who got the virus last spring-summer.
3. Depending on how severe your case was, you might not have developed antibodies *at all,* at which point you're just being punished for getting covid by being denied the vaccine, which is dumb and frankly unfair if you're eligible otherwise.

If you already had the virus and want to make the personal decision to wait a couple weeks after you become eligible for vaccination to let other people go first, that's your choice. I've had it before and I work in an area where I'm exposed to tons of people daily, and because it's more than likely that my antibodies are gone I'm getting the vaccine as soon as it's available for me.

Because there will be a limited supply of AZ, J&amp;J etc for the foreseeable future and vaccinating with Pfizer is much cheaper than waiting for other vaccines to be approved (even ignoring the health benefits of vaccinating people sooner). 

Maybe you don't understand how much these vaccines actually cost compared to the pandemic. I live in Ireland so I will use it as an example. Firstly, the Pfizer vaccine costs €12 per shot compared to nearly €2 per shot for AZ and €7 for J&amp;J (one shot). So lets say Pfizer jabs cost €20 extra per person (full prices in the Guardian link below).

Ireland's welfare system (between basically furlough and unemployment) had over 550,000 on it in November (rte link below) costing €103.8 million per week. We have 4.9 million people in total, meaning it is around €98 million more expensive to use Pfizer then AZ on the population, less than the cost of one weeks welfare (only 350,000 are temporary unemployed due to businesses closed by the pandemic so not all the 103 will disappear). This is before taking into account the amount we are spending on PCR tests (doing over 100,000 per week and they cost roughly €200 at the start of the pandemic, but probably less now) and PPE, the reduced tax take, the impact on peoples lives. It doesn't make economic sense to wait for cheaper vaccines even if its just one week.

&gt;The lower number of infections occurring with REGEN-COV therapy were all **asymptomatic, with decreased peak virus levels and short duration of viral shedding.**

&gt;Infections occurring in the placebo group had, on average, **more than 100-fold higher peak viral load.**

&gt;Infections in the REGEN-COV group lasted no more than 1 week, while approximately 40% of infections in the placebo group lasted 3-4 weeks.

&gt;**No infected individuals in the REGEN-COV group had high viral loads** (&gt;10^4 copies/mL) compared to 62% of the infected placebo group (13/21 placebo vs. 0/9 REGEN-COV).

&gt;REGEN-COV was associated with lower disease burden:

&gt;**Fewer total viral shedding weeks** (44 weeks placebo vs. 9 weeks REGEN-COV).

&gt;**Fewer total high viral shedding weeks** (&gt;10^4 copies/mL) (22 weeks placebo vs. 0 weeks REGEN-COV).

&gt;Fewer total symptomatic weeks (18 weeks placebo vs. 0 weeks REGEN-COV).

Now, this is using passive vaccination, but the method of protection is fundamentally the same as normal vaccination: use antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 to block entry into host cells. It’s reasonable to expect that the antibodies created by Pfizer and Moderna vaccines would have a similar effect of reducing viral load in the case of asymptomatic infections. And of course, lower viral load would result in reduced risk of transmission.

This is no different than if they had been infected by a virus.

The power of this vaccine isn’t just in that spike is produced, but rather that by the fact that the body’s cells are suddenly making a foreign protein, this simulates a cell actually having a viral infection and making a viral protein.  This is exactly what sets off the immune system’s alarm bells.  The majority of the cells that make spike are immune cells called macrophages and dendritic cells, which have a job of going out and trying to get infected and bringing it back to lymph nodes, but probably some muscle cells also make spike.

This isn’t some novel situation.  Any prior “live attenuated” vaccine uses the same idea.  You’re injected with a horsepox virus (vaccinia isn’t cowpox, surprise!), the first ever vaccine and your cells start making poxvirus proteins.  They’re killed and now an immune response against poxviruses is set up.  The same is true for measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, rotavirus, live attenuated influenza, and oral poliovirus.

But with mRNA vaccines, we are able to just express one protein from the surface that the virus needs to enter cells.  The mRNA can’t copy itself.*  Even better, live attenuated vaccines take a long time to develop and sometimes (like for RSV), it seems as if they either over-attenuate and don’t offer protection or under-attenuate and tend to cause disease.  None of that is a problem with an mRNA vaccine and from the time the SARS-CoV-2 genome was published, the people at Moderna already had their candidate designed in just a few hours.",,,1612044879,{'gid_2': 1},glexbhu,False,t3_l8nafi,False,True,t1_gle7n37,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8nafi/luck_foresight_and_science_how_an_unheralded_team/glexbhu/,1612073898,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],[],text,t2_874fg,False,True,,

But, in reality, it is an indoor air quality problem, and the first line of defense should be engineering controls, eg HVAC HEPA filtration and increasing makeup air. Then the administrative controls like masks, distancing and handwashing need to be brought up to more than wearing nuisance masks - ie wearing actual half face respirators, goggles, etc in high hazard environments, not disposable plastic fiber masks that don't fit well. It is because of this abysmal lack of safety protocols that we have lost enormous numbers of hospital personnel. They have literally re-invented respiratory protection safety - badly, because they didn't say ""Oh, airborne microparticle that causes disease, we need to use asbestos protocols.""

I was a safety person 25 years ago, and this whole thing has frustrated me.

Casual, short duration exposure indoors is fine with masks, distancing and handwashing. But it is not appropriate for workplace exposures for 8+ hours a day.

I'm referring to the new law in Europe which allows them to stop export of the vaccine.  There are a number of developing countries on the exemption list, but Australia and NZ didn't make the cut.  

&gt;Build domestic production lines, and you’ll get your vaccines faster now. Not only that, you’ll get vaccines faster if/when COVID mutate.

Our govt says this is not an option for us. We are too small a country to do that. We have to rely on getting vaccines imported. The govt spent months assuring us the deals they signed would mean we were at the top of the list. Now it's only natural people are upset to discover we are at the bottom of the list, months behind the US and Europe.  

We don't have virus now, but our border system is quite faulty and has had at least 10 failures where cases entered the community.  The South African strain escaped in two separate incidents in different parts of the country just in the last week.  Then we just barely averted a third escape of the same variant when the infected person developed symptoms the day they were to be released from quarantine (but after passing all 3 of the normal tests).  We have been incredibly lucky none of the 3 infected people who spent 2 weeks contagious with that variant and going to malls, supermarkets etc. infected anyone else.  But the next mistake could easily lead to an outbreak. We don't have any restrictions in NZ, no masks, no crowd limits.  

Our elimination strategy means another very strict, economy crushing lockdown would be required if the border fails before we have the vaccine.

The hospitalization rate for COVID-19 is six per 100,000 children for those ages 5 to 17, according to the CDC.""",,,1612022166,{},gldkunf,False,t3_l8n3of,False,False,t1_gldj7bf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8n3of/covid_the_devastating_toll_of_the_pandemic_on/gldkunf/,1612050114,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_we4q4,False,False,,

Our superintendent ignore all of them, lied to parents and the school board, put out a survey to the teachers and parents, but never put it out in Spanish because fuck the migrants (~35-40% of our demographics). Then took the teacher survey and cherry picked stats to present to parents... 

We are iirc, the 7th or 8th largest district in the country, and our options presented to us were either quit or teach and sorry, some of you are going to have to die this year. And teachers have died, due to contract tracing placed on admin shoulders and all of the personnel cuts (our school lost 12 units and the 8 vacancies we were trying to fill) we will never know if it was through school or home.

&gt;&gt; Another significant potential limitation of the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is reduced protection for the elderly. This remains a plausible risk as of this writing and would be consistent with the behavior of vaccines for a number of other diseases[30,32]. We used our modeling framework to explore the impact of a vaccine that was less effective in the elderly. Again, the picture is grim. For example, for a vaccine that is 85% effective in the over-65 population, at steady state, we could expect around 400,000 deaths a year (using the assumptions of 95% vaccine efficacy in the under-65 population, 80% compliance, 18 months natural immunity, permanent vaccine immunity and an R0 of 5.7; Fig. 2). The vast majority of these deaths would occur in the over-65 population. Crucially, for the over-65 population, a vaccine that does not prevent transmission and that is only partially effective will result in a never-ending pandemic. Beyond the scope of this paper, there are clear implications for the age structure of the US population and life expectancy in general. 

&gt;&gt; If the choice is made to pursue SARS-CoV-2 elimination, however, existing vaccines can still play a very positive role. The current crop of vaccines represents one more layer in the “Swiss cheese strategy” [73–75], as long as it is made clear to vaccinated individuals that they (counterintuitively)may face increased risk after being vaccinated and returning to pre-pandemic lifestyles. To use an analogy, wearing a seatbelt reduces risk of death when driving, but should not be taken as license to down three beers before taking the wheel. Public health messaging should emphasize that the benefit from the vaccine can be offset by actions taken by individuals to increase their contact rate, so compliance with public health measures to reduce transmission will remain in the individual’s best interest. Crucially, public health strategy should diversify its approach, broadening focus to passive interventions such as ventilation and complementary biomedical interventions such as intranasal prophylactics. These interventions can be stacked on top of a successful vaccine program to increase the likelihood of eliminating SARS-CoV-2 and to address risks of evolutionary escape, reduced protection in some subpopulations, vaccine noncompliance, and limited efficacy against transmission. Further study of the current vaccines’ performance characteristics (impact on infection/ transmission, efficacy in older vaccinees, durability of protection, impact on mortality and morbidity) will be required to better understand their public health impact. 

&gt;&gt; Although it is possible the current crop of vaccines provide sufficient protection from infection and transmission to achieve elimination, there are insufficient data to support this currently. There is much discussion regarding the “herd immunity threshold” and the corresponding fraction of the population that must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity [76].These discussions often neglect the fact that the extent of population immunity is determined by both the fraction of individuals vaccinated and the effectiveness of the vaccine against transmission and infection. There is a minimum threshold of the population requiring vaccination to achieve herd immunity with a vaccine that provides perfect sterilizing immunity, and correspondingly there is a minimum threshold for vaccine efficacy against infection and transmission to reach herd immunity if the entire population is vaccinated. Perfect protection from infection and transmission is not consistent with the preclinical data for these vaccines [25],the frequency of asymptomatic carriers in the AstraZeneca trial[6],or the theorized “maybe 50%” reduction in transmission described by Moderna and Pfizer [77,

&gt;&gt; Another key finding is that there is extensive person-to-person variation in how mutations affect serum antibody binding and neutralization. For instance, the neutralizing activity of several sampleswas reduced by &gt;10-fold by single mutations to site E484, but a few samples were essentially unaffected by E484 mutations. Similarly, mutations at sites in the 443–450 loop (e.g., G446V) caused a large drop in serum antibody binding and neutralization for some samples, but had little effect on-others. This inter-individual heterogeneity is further compounded by the fact that the effects of mutations sometimes changed over time for samples longitudinally collected from the same individual.These temporal changes could be due to a disproportionate decay in one dominant antibody clonotype,or a relative increase in antibodies targeting other epitopes",,,1612021794,{},gldk5kq,False,t3_l8gzzn,False,True,t1_gldicgy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8gzzn/daily_discussion_thread_january_30_2021/gldk5kq/,1612049755,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_54mafy5h,False,False,,

Rationale: Much is known about the acute infective process of SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the COVID-19 pandemic. The marked inflammatory response and coagulopathic state in acute SARS-CoV-2 may promote pulmonary fibrosis. However, little is known of the incidence and seriousness of post-COVID pulmonary pathology.

Objectives: We describe respiratory recovery and self-reported health following infection at time of outpatient attendance.

Methods: Infection severity was graded into three groups: (i) not requiring admission, (ii) requiring hospital admission, and (iii) requiring ICU care. Participants underwent chest radiography and six-minute-walk test (6MWT). Fatigue and subjective return to health were assessed and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6, soluble CD25 and D-dimer were measured. The association between initial illness and abnormal chest x-ray, 6MWT distance and perception of maximal exertion was investigated.

Results: 487 patients were offered an outpatient appointment, of which 153 (31%) attended for assessment at a median of 75 days after diagnosis. 74 (48%) had required hospital admission during acute infection. Persistently abnormal chest x-rays were seen in 4%. The median 6MWT distance covered was 460m. Reduced distance covered was associated with frailty and length of inpatient stay. 95 (62%) felt that they had not returned to full health, while 47% met the case definition for fatigue. Ongoing ill-health and fatigue were associated with increased perception of exertion. None of the measures of persistent respiratory disease were associated with initial disease severity.

Conclusions: This study highlights the rates of objective respiratory disease and subjective respiratory symptoms following COVID-19 and the complex multifactorial nature of post-COVID ill-health.",,,1612023667,{},gldnyky,True,t3_l8p1t2,False,True,t3_l8p1t2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8p1t2/persistent_poor_health_postcovid19_is_not/gldnyky/,1612051776,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,

Even the Astrazeneca vaccine, that you [heard was only 8% effective](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-eu-astrazeneca-idUSL8N2K061O). (That figure was totally inaccurate.)

But should we be excited about a vaccine that's less effective than the 90%+ of Moderna/Pfizer? Excellent question! [Absolutely we should.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l7mzvn/daily_discussion_thread_january_29_2021/gl8iyj5?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) 

The vaccines given EUA is are safe even if you hear [about someone dying or having some crazy side effect.](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/04/get-ready-for-false-side-effects)


They [work so well](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l7apag/just_004_of_israelis_caught_covid19_after_two/) and are so safe that super smart super rich [people are paying to cut in line](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kzbsfk/some_wealthy_americans_accused_of_getting/) to get them. If they weren't safe and effective, those people wouldn't be paying that much for access to the vaccines.

There’s no such thing as [vaccine side effects that take months or years to show up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k96ng0/how_is_it_possible_to_create_a_safe_and_effective/gfldup9/) If there is a side effect, [it shows up right away.](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2017/0615/p786.html)  Phase 2 trial participants have had the vaccine for over 6 months, and there are [no worrying](https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20201217/covid-19-vaccine-faq-safety-side-effects-efficacy), lingering, or [delayed side effects.](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/covid-19-vaccine-myths-debunked)

Getting the virus is worse than getting the vaccine.  Getting the vaccine is better than getting the virus.

The currently approved vaccines work against [new variants, all of them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kqz7y5/comprehensive_mapping_of_mutations_to_the/)  Even that new one [you just read about](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l15czh/neutralization_of_sarscov2_lineage_b117/).  S[eriously,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4pnde/mrna1273_vaccine_induces_neutralizing_antibodies/) it's [very probably](https://reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l6vs1t/in_vitro_studies_demonstrate_pfizer_and/), [not going to be a problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l0yqe6/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gjwov3s?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) 

 You can feel free to ignore any news story or blog or comment that uses the word “strain” instead of “variant”.  [There are currently no Covid19 “strains”, only variants.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC8ObD2W4Rk)

Many variants aren't that great at being viruses.  [Some have already gone extinct](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/19/danish-covid-mink-variant-very-likely-extinct-but-controversial-cull-continues), and the rate of extinction will probably increase over time. Yes, that mink variant you were worried about last year is probably gone forever.

 Reinfections are exceedingly rare, [like less than 1 in 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kyj0bx/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/) (maybe in the 1 in 10,000 range).  In those rare cases where it does happen, reinfections seem to be milder than previous infections. 

Milder cases, especially asymptomatic cases [are worse at spreading the virus](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kcy2e0/weekly_question_thread_week_of_december_14/gg8tp7n/).  It therefore follows that even a less effective vaccine that still reduces symptoms might reduce transmission. 

Plus, we have [studies using monkeys](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03041-6) that show both strong immunity to being exposed, and sterilizing immunity from multiple vaccine types.  This means that the monkeys were unable to spread the virus once they were vaccinated, the virus couldn't take hold in their bodies.

Looks like [Pfizer's vaccine may also prevent spread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l0a6jf/pfizer_vaccine_may_prevent_transmission_of/) in addition to preventing disease.

Immunity from the vaccine is [comparable to](https://www.verywellhealth.com/antibodies-from-vaccines-and-from-natural-infection-5092564), or better than immunity from an infection.

If the virus were able to evade vaccine induced immunity, it would likely also evade the immunity generated by infection, leading to a lot of reinfections.  We’re not seeing a lot of reinfections.

Immunity from clearing an infection lasts [*at least 8 months*](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/koxkm1/sarscov2_infection_induces_longlived_bone_marrow/), though [probably a lot longer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/klpvp7/sarscov2specific_t_cell_memory_is_longlasting_in/)  It's too soon to say ""lifelong"" but [that is a possibility.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4nkco/the_immune_system_mounts_a_lasting_defense_after/)

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/) probably a lot, lot longer, probably many years. 



The OG SARS virus, the one from 2003, gave detectable immunity [both 6](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/12/7264) and [12 years later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kvbz9y/weekly_question_thread/gizs32j/)   

Covid19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, OG SARS was caused by SARS-CoV. Looks like both of them came from bats.  [They’re 79% the same.](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930251-8) (PDF Warning)

So it follows that immunity from the current vaccines may last just as long, or even longer.
 [Vaccines](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-much-will-it-cost-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine#:~:text=The%20cost%20for%20each%20dose,to%20cost%20%2419.50%20a%20dose.) are likely cheaper than [tests.](https://www.advisory.com/en/daily-briefing/2020/06/17/covid-test-cost#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20New%20York,as%20%24100%20or%20less)

The rollout of testing was slow, and people complained, just like they’re doing now with the rollout of vaccinations. [ News stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kuyacf/daily_discussion_thread_january_11_2021/giwdkki/) about how testing was flawed, delayed, only for rich people, etc., will all be recycled for stories about vaccinations.

I mean, it’s not too bad, at least you don’t have thousands of infected people every day and hundreds of daily casualties, let alone death toll to rival WWII. That’s a good thing.. But can imagine, it gotta be so exhausting to be stuck.. But I digress, In this situation, yeah. A single shot of J&amp;J does not sound like a good plan, considering the culture around it. 

But I honestly don’t think that mRNA is outright superior in any way. If Gamaleya was not bullshitting all of us and themselves with noisy raw data, then adenovector vaccines on heterologous prime-boost scheme should be just as efficient as mRNA. There are more studies on the horizon, so well’ll find out soon enough.
As of now, I think both technologies have roughly the same potential, but different pros and cons. I would not disregard all other vaccines out of pure hype for mRNA. I don’t get that “either 90% immunization with mRNA or total eternal lockdown” attitude, especially considering the difference which is either nonexistent or 5-10% tops. Hecc, even these 66% from a single shot should help healthcare systems with overload dramatically. And it’s unlikely it’s even supposed to be one shot vaccine. It’s just a study which shows this specific use case. I bet the journalists are tempted to turn that into “J&amp;J = 67%, why did we even trust our politicians to buy it”, but such is life. This result is not bad for what it actually measures. 
Also it will take a lot of time for Pfizer/Moderna to deliver enough mRNA vaccines to New Zealand in order to vaccinate 90% of population. Purchasing is one thing, delivering is another, and timing is crucial. Time equals fatigue. In a way, good timing is more important than 90%+ efficacy. 
But Pfizer will be on the slower end, I am afraid, and there is no way for all of us to know how long current vaccines are going to last. I don’t mean the immunity, I mean the design. It should be damn horrible to wait full year in a lockdown to prevent outbreaks, then wait another one waiting for the shot, get it, achieve these 90% or vaccinated people with Pfizer aaaand... Encounter some new “SARS-CoV-3” with mutated S-protein which does not care about our current antibodies, requires new vaccines to prevent it. Off to another lockdown we go, wait another 2 years for new vaccine. Repeat ad infinitum. The only way to prevent this circle of doom from happening is to speed things up, and for that country should diversify its sources. I’d hate this myself, but in your case this will be absolutely outrageous. 
That’s what NZ does, by the looks of it. It makes sense to me.

Again agree with you here. So far the data has favored our current vaccines, but we definitely need to be vigilant and vaccinate quickly.

I would be interested to see some comparisons between that pressure and a reduction in mutation opportunities through increased immunity.

&gt;Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine even if I've already had COVID-19?

Getting COVID-19 might offer some natural protection or immunity from reinfection with the virus that causes COVID-19. But it's not clear how long this protection lasts. Because reinfection is possible and COVID-19 can cause severe medical complications, it's recommended that people who have already had COVID-19 get a COVID-19 vaccine.

A value of R = 1.1 means cases will double in seven weeks if that isn’t brought down due to increased amounts of resistance.

So someone allay my concerns about the cells health after making the spikes and having the body basically attack itself to get the immune system to make the antibodies.

What this means is that for emergent situations (the first lockdowns, the vaccine rollouts), they tend to be very effective and impressive, but extended crises put stress on the weak points of the system - in this case, the hospital system.  We've had several Covid patients die in fires, for example, because the hospital infrastructure and electrical wiring was faulty.  We've had old people left to die sitting on the floor in hospital hallways because we don't have effective triage and patient intake procedures, etc.

So basically the Covid response has been great but the hospital and medical system itself has serious problems.  As an interesting illustration, I expect that it will be much easier for me to get the Covid vaccine than it has been for me to get the flu vaccine in the years I've lived here.  When I asked my family doctor about the flu vaccine a few years ago, she laughed at me lol.

In terms of elder care, I haven't seen statistics but my suspicion based on my experience is that Romania has a MUCH smaller population of elders in care homes to begin with.  You would expect most of them to live either on their own or, if they're unable, with family who care for them.

One of the many big questions scientists are trying to untangle is whether people who get Covid-19 during pregnancy will pass on some natural immunity to their newborns.

[Recent studies](https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Fulltext/2021/01000/Severe_Acute_Respiratory_Syndrome_Coronavirus_2.7.aspx) have hinted that they might. And [new findings](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2775945), published Friday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, provide another piece of the puzzle, offering more evidence that Covid-19 antibodies can cross the placenta.

“What we have found is fairly consistent with what we have learned from studies of other viruses,” said Scott E. Hensley, an associate professor of microbiology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the senior authors of the study.

Additionally, he added, the study suggests that women are not only transferring antibodies to their fetuses, but also transferring more antibodies to their babies if they are infected earlier in their pregnancies. This might have implications for when women should be vaccinated against Covid-19, Dr. Hensley said, adding that vaccinating women earlier in pregnancy might offer more protective benefits, “but studies actually analyzing vaccination among pregnant women need to be completed.”

In the study, researchers from Pennsylvania tested more than 1,500 women who gave birth at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia between April and August of last year. Of those, 83 women were found to have Covid-19 antibodies — and after they gave birth, 72 of those babies tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies via their cord blood, regardless of whether their mothers had symptoms.

According to Dr. Karen Puopolo, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the senior authors of the study, about half of those babies had antibody levels that were as high or higher than those found in their mother’s blood, and in about a quarter of the cases, the antibody levels in the cord blood was 1.5 to 2 times higher than the mother’s concentrations.

“That’s fairly efficient,” Dr. Puopolo said.

The researchers also observed that the longer the time period between the start of a pregnant woman’s Covid-19 infection and her delivery, the more antibodies were transferred, a finding that has been noted elsewhere.

The antibodies that crossed the placenta were immunoglobulin G, or IgG, antibodies, the type that are made days after getting infected and are thought to offer long-term protection against the coronavirus.

None of the babies in this study were found to have immunoglobulin M, or IgM, antibodies, which are typically only detected soon after an infection, suggesting that the babies hadn’t been infected with the coronavirus.

Experts don’t yet know if the amount of antibodies that passed on to the babies were enough to prevent newborns from getting Covid-19. And because only a few of the babies in the study were born prematurely, the researchers can’t say whether babies who are born early might miss out on those protective antibodies. The study authors also noted that because their results were from just one facility, the findings would need to be further replicated.

The placenta is a complex organ, and one that has been understudied, said Dr. Denise Jamieson, an obstetrician at Emory University in Atlanta and a member of the Covid expert group at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, who was not involved with the study.

And more research is needed to better understand whether vaccine-generated antibodies behave comparably to antibodies from Covid-19 infection, said Dr. Andrea G. Edlow, an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School.

In [a study](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31749-9) published in the journal Cell in December, for instance, Dr. Edlow and her colleagues found that Covid-19 antibodies from a natural infection might cross the placenta less efficiently than the antibodies produced after vaccination for flu and whooping cough (pertussis).

“What we really want to know is, do antibodies from the vaccine efficiently cross the placenta and protect the baby, the way we know happens in influenza and pertussis,” Dr. Jamieson said.

Experts do not know whether the Covid vaccine will work in this way, in part because [pregnant women were excluded](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/health/pregnant-women-covid-vaccines.html) from the initial clinical trials.

“It’s plausible that the Covid vaccine will offer protection to both pregnant mothers and their infants,” said Dr. Mark Turrentine, a member of the Covid expert group at A.C.O.G. “To me,” he added, “this study highlights that inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials such as the Covid-19 vaccine is essential, particularly when the benefit of vaccination is greater than the potential risk of a life-threatening disease.”",,,1611981315,{},glc2ui9,True,t3_l8dti1,False,False,t3_l8dti1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8dti1/evidence_builds_that_pregnant_women_pass_covid/glc2ui9/,1612020517,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_a8994,False,False,,

[],,crystalshypss,,,,,,[],"Pregnant women looking for guidance on Covid-19 vaccines are facing the kind of confusion that has dogged the pandemic from the start: The world’s leading public health organizations — the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization — are offering contradictory advice.

Neither organization explicitly forbids or encourages immunizing pregnant women. But weighing the same limited studies, they provide different recommendations.

The C.D.C.’s advisory committee urged pregnant women to consult with their doctors before rolling up their sleeves — a decision applauded by several women’s health organizations because it kept decision making in the hands of the expectant mothers.

The W.H.O. recommended that pregnant women not receive the vaccine, unless they were at high risk for Covid because of work exposures or chronic conditions. It issued guidance on the Moderna vaccine on Tuesday, stirring uncertainty among women and doctors on social media. (Earlier this month, it published similar guidance on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.)

Several experts expressed dismay at the W.H.O.’s stance, saying the risks to pregnant women from Covid were far greater than any theoretical harm from the vaccines.

“There are no documented risks to the fetus, there’s no theoretical risks, there’s no risk in animal studies,” from the vaccines, said Dr. Anne Lyerly, a bioethicist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. “The more that I think about it, the more disappointed and sad I feel about it.”

The difference of opinion between the C.D.C. and the W.H.O. is not rooted in scientific evidence, but the lack of it: Pregnant women have been barred from participating in clinical trials of the vaccines, a decision in line with a long tradition of excluding pregnant women from biomedical research, but one that is now being challenged.",,,1611960398,{},glavyzk,True,t3_l86g96,False,True,t3_l86g96,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l86g96/pregnant_women_get_conflicting_advice_on_covid19/glavyzk/,1611998244,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_44bjj64k,False,False,,

But the negative should also be obvious. Information spread publicly have real, widespread consequences on the society and should not be taken lightly.  Misinformation, conspiracy theories, disinformation can all evolve into huge costs for individuals and societies alike. While one could of course hope that the “bad” information will get debunked by the “good” ones, remember that it cost way more effort and resources to combat fake news than coming up with them, and many times the damage is already done way the truth surfaces. So for me, the answer is definitely not clear cut and I think a healthy compromise is the way to go. 

It’s also incredibly alarming that people somehow think that information is controlled only in China. Take U.S for example, twitter and FB accounts get banned all the time for “spreading misinformation”. Trump, who literally represents the voices of almost half of the Americans, is effectively being shut out of all modern communication platforms. Anyone not blind would realize that censorship is alive and well in the U.S mainstream media. Oh not to mention how whistleblowers like Snowden, Assange, Chelsea Manning, etc gets persecuted for revealing mass surveillance and war crimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; so I'd ask the very straightforward question, do you think open, democratic or closed autocratic governments or political systems tend to produce better results (or are more likely to achieve a better society)

**Internally:** 

The standard of living in China has risen at incredible pace for the past 20-30 years. Infrastructure is well-built, economy is now the 2nd largest in the world, the government has pulled over 600 million people out of extreme poverty. Chinese people are wealthier and healthier than they've ever been. Higher education and medicare are at affordable cost. The Government continue to spend huge amount of resources on poverty elimination and improving the lives of the least fortunate and average people. There's no hatred between different ethnicities in the country, and the country is as united as ever as it continues to steadily develop. 

The standard of living in the U.S hasn't really changed all that much in the meantime for the average person. Infrastructure is shit while higher education and medicare is only affordable to the top 10% of the society. Those areas continue to be underfunded while U.S continue to spend more than the next 10 countries combined on defense, funneling money to the military-industrial complex, insurance companies, and wall street, etc. The middle class is shrinking, wealth gap is wider than ever, poverty rate and homelessness is more problematic than ever while corporations revenue and stock market hits all time highs. Racial tensions are high and there's deep rooted division within the nation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Externally:**

China: no wars other than when its borders/sovereignty are at risk of being violated. No killing, no invasion, no interference in other country's internal affairs. 

U.S: continue to invade countries, commit war crimes, and manufacture dissent in order to topple (democratically elected) government through overt or covert operations. Civilian casualties and displacements in millions. All to protect its own hegemony and the profits of the ruling class corporate elites. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do not see how China's system is performing worse. Do you? This is exactly why the the West has focus the narrative on ""(market)freedom, (sham)democracy, and (individual)rights"", and produce atrocity propagandas. The ruling elites simply cannot afford to let people know how much they're failing them. 

To answer your question, I do not care about ideologies. I simply look at results. CCP, despites its shortcomings, has served the core interest of Chinese people incredibly well: sovereignty, stability, peacefulness, and prosperity, in that order.

&gt;&gt; Another key finding is that there is extensive person-to-person variation in how mutations affect serum antibody binding and neutralization. For instance, the neutralizing activity of several samples was reduced by &gt;10-fold by single mutations to site E484, but a few samples were essentially unaffected by E484 mutations.

\+ There are tons of drugs/vaccines targeting the version isolates / sequenced back in Jan/Feb. Hospitals are using their strongest drugs to keep this at bay.

\+ People are wearing masks and practicing social distancing, making it harder for the virus to spread. Thus anything that makes it more able to latch onto cells (e.g., spike protein variants) will make it better adapt to these new situations.

\+ Since no one has been infected with COVID before, the virus can spread like wildfire. When a virus replicates, it always creates a mutation in its RNA, so if everyone gets it, it increases the pool of potential variants to undergo selection.

The flu in contrast doesn't experience any of this. While there are drugs, the diseases is rarely so bad that they'll go and get drugs to target it. It's usually take some DayQuil/NightQuil to reduce the symptoms while your body fights it off. People also don't really self-quarantine with the flu; I've had colleagues come into the office when they were full on flu, exhausted and feverish. Lastly, the pool of infectible flu people is much smaller (since many have pre-existing immunity), so the number of potential mutations is small.

The REAL problem concerning students here in Chicago is the fact that for a lot of them, their meal at school is the only consistent meal of the day. Some days they might not have lunch, or some days they might not have dinner, and still for others their school lunch might be their only meal for the entire day. To take away that... it's very concerning. Their food security net is just torn to shreds. 

The other problem is that students are now more likely to be recruited (or pressed) into gangs, since they no longer have school to occupy their time.

**Glitches ‘to be expected’**

The chief executive of Astrazeneca has said that delays in production are to be expected because making a new vaccine is “not like doing an orange juice” (Tom Whipple writes).

A problem at a manufacturing plant in Belgium has held up supplies to the European Union of the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, leading indirectly to a diplomatic row with Britain where production is going more smoothly.

Pascal Soriot said that such “teething issues” were to be expected. “We’re talking about biology manufacturing here,” he said, explaining that making and then bottling vaccines was “extremely complicated”.

Doses are made in 1,000-2,000 litre “bioreactors”, using human cells to churn out copies of the benign virus, which is the active ingredient of the vaccine. This process is hard to standardise and yield varies between sites.

The Times understands that part of the reason UK government officials are unwilling to publish the schedule for when doses will arrive is because of uncertainties in the supply lines, and the likelihood that whole batches could go wrong.

Mr Soriot said the speed of the programme has meant that there are still aspects to be understood.

“Everybody’s on a learning curve which usually you develop over a year. We’ve had months.”

Speaking at a press conference to coincide with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approving the vaccine for all adults over 18, Mr Soriot said he was confident. “We believe we have fixed most of the issues and the productivity of the sites should improve rapidly over the next few months,” he said.

The EMA decision came after Germany’s vaccine committee said it would not recommend the Oxford vaccine for over-65s due to a lack of data.",,,1612017557,{},gldcjdo,True,t3_l8n07c,False,False,t1_gldcixj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8n07c/covid_vaccines_are_slowing_spread_of_virus/gldcjdo/,1612045847,37,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_136cc9,False,False,,

Infection rates in the over-80s have fallen by 36 per cent this month. Other age groups have seen similar falls, while the biggest drop is in twenty-somethings whose rates have halved.

However, Public Health England has access to infection data linked to vaccination records, and its researchers can compare the chance of catching the virus between those who have had the jab and those of similar ages who have not. Initial findings from their study are due out next week.

Professor Harnden said: “The data we have is still is very early because it only reflects approximately three or four weeks of the programme and it’s mainly based on the Pfizer vaccine.”

The data does not yet show an effect on hospital admissions or deaths but scientists are optimistic given that case rates in the over-60s have been one of the most reliable predictors of impending hospital admissions.

Ministers are likely to use the results as vindication of the strategy of delaying second doses beyond the three or four-week window specified by manufacturers. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, has said that it is likely to save lives by doubling the number protected.

The delay has raised concerns about whether disruptions to supply will prevent people getting their second doses within the 12-week window.

Professor Harnden said: “Our position is you should receive the same second dose of vaccine as you did the first dose, unless there were exceptional circumstances and those exceptional circumstances may be supply constraints. In which case it’s better to have a second dose of a different vaccine than no second dose at all,” he said.

“There aren’t results from studies on mixing vaccines at the moment, so we haven’t got evidence but there’s no theoretical evidence why you shouldn’t mix vaccines.”

The JCVI is also due to set out guidance for the second stage of the vaccines programme within weeks, amid pressure for teachers and other key workers to be given priority over other younger adults. The list includes everyone over 50 and younger people with chronic conditions. Given that younger people are at much lower risk, ministers are keen to prioritise frontline workers.

Professor Harnden said that untangling the effects of vaccination on transmission was so complicated that “I don’t think we’re going to know a lot about the definitive transmission questions before phase two of the vaccination programme is going to have to be decided”.

With ministers keen to understand how to use vaccines to reopen the economy, he said: “There are going to be a lot of bodies feeding into this phase two in addition to JCVI. We accept that other bits of advice will come from other groups that have more expertise in economic aspects and social aspects . . . because I don’t think JCVI on its own can say for example, ‘We should immunise all teachers’.”",,,1612017550,{},gldcixj,True,t3_l8n07c,False,False,t1_gldcihb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8n07c/covid_vaccines_are_slowing_spread_of_virus/gldcixj/,1612045841,53,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_136cc9,False,False,,

Vaccination is already easing Britain’s Covid epidemic with early data showing it is definitely reducing cases.

Research due to be published within days will provide real-world evidence that Britons are being protected, including suggestions that the effect is still building a month after one dose, said Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).

With fears about an EU export ban on vaccines, Professor Harnden said plans were in place for people to be able to mix and match vaccines if second doses of the Pfizer jab were unavailable.

Decisions on vaccinating teachers and other key workers in the second phase are likely to involve political and economic input because clear evidence that the vaccines block transmission of the virus is unlikely to be available for months, he said.

Yesterday official figures showed that another 414,419 people had been given a first dose, taking that total to 7.9 million, suggesting the NHS is more than halfway towards its target of immunising the four most vulnerable groups by the middle of next month.

Protection is thought to take at least two weeks to build but Professor Harnden said it was clear that mass vaccination was working to bring down cases.

“The preliminary data indicate a vaccine effect from the first dose in both younger adults and in older adults over 80. The effect seems to increase over time,” he said. “It is possible that we may get stronger and better long-term protection by a delayed second dose.”

Initial vaccination focused on the over-80s and NHS and care staff and has since widened out to younger people and the clinically vulnerable.",,,1612017542,{},gldcihb,True,t3_l8n07c,False,False,t3_l8n07c,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8n07c/covid_vaccines_are_slowing_spread_of_virus/gldcihb/,1612045834,165,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_136cc9,False,False,,

If you have, say, 150+ students and you have to email parents about their child every week, that's an extra few hours right there. In some districts, the computerized systems are set up poorly and they have to, say, enter attendance in three different places every day. There's also the need for differentiated assignments and classroom accommodations for kids on IEPs, which again can be MUCH harder to figure out in a remote context.

But pfizer/moderna has unfortunately spoiled some people that we expect 90%+ efficiency from every vaccine. And the fact is i don't consider this a second rate vaccine. The annual flu shot we all happily take is between 40-60% efficient yet we don't complain about that. J&amp;J is more effective than the annual flu shot so that's already a win. Not to mention they also said while it's 66% overall efficient it's 85% efficient against the most severe symptoms and no hospitlisations. And I think that is the most important bit because yes even if i develop symptoms it's more likely to be minor symptoms and the vaccine will most likely still keep me out of hospital and dying. End of the day i don't mind so much just developing some minor symptoms which will be more flu like but i definitely don't want to go into hospital. And that's what our main aim should be keeping us all out of hospital. So as far as I'm concerned the vaccine is a win in my book. 

And logistically thus vaccine is a plus in being single dose. No worries about calling people in for a second shot or worrying if we'll have a second shot in time. Simply infect them and send them on their way done and dusted.

Article From yesterday: 

“Double masking for COVID-19: Fauci now recommends wearing two masks at once 

Dr. Fauci's recommendation comes in light of new strains of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, that are thought to be more transmissible than the primary strain of SARS-CoV-2. 

""With a more transmissible virus, that means every exposure has increased likelihood of leading to spread,"" says Andrea Love, an immunologist and microbiologist. ""We must be more stringent with our behaviors now, including social distancing, minimizing trips to public places, avoiding indoor spaces and always wearing a mask.

If you plan to be near people who aren't in your household, however, even outdoors, ""a simple solution is to double-mask.""

Many who dwelled on this sub over the last year have seen the near gleeful smashing of the upvote button on every gloomy article posted, while watching the early vaccine research be met with tepid reaction and shrugged shoulders.

Many of us who watch the numbers and see the science are tired of the melodrama winning out over reality. That's why we're pushing back. Cases are in freefall, hospitalizations are down, deaths are down, we're getting vaccine after vaccine locked and loaded and deployed, there's good reason to be done with the Eternal Pandemic nonsense. 

We're also sick of the media shying away from this new reality. Even ""straight laced"" outfits like PBS are not immune to sweeping positivity under the rug.

[],,marbanasin,,,,,,[],"I appreciate your post and agree this should be an open debate. I believe though that a bit of the concern regarding vaccines sitting idle was literally because states were really worried they wouldn't have steady supply so they were holding them back to guarantee the second shot on time.

Now, again, we can debate what risk/reward there is in administering only on time. And I also think the states and federal government are now working a bit more smoothly to ensure there will be steady supply so the states can be comfortable giving &gt;50% of their inventory out knowing more will be coming. But I do want to push back on the argument that this is solely an infrastructure/logistics issue. The states and federal governments created this bottle neck to some extent because they were stringently adhering to the guideline. 

I do agree in the US we are also going to drag this out since each phase is more than likely going to have ~30% of staunch opponents to this vaccine just due to the cluster F of our politics and media landscape. For that problem I'm more hoping that states closely monitor weekly averages of what they are giving out and if there's any substantial dip that indicates the current phase is losing viable candidates who want to come in they should move to the next phase. This also seems to have somewhat happened which lead to the spike in vaccinations the past two weeks - most states began authorizing down to age 65 + other essential workers in some cases which helped open up the pool of candidates quite a bit further.

Very specific questions, which A.) exclude all uninsured B.) Is showing a strong difference in how people feel about ""national"" coverage, which as vague as that is might indicate that the only reason why people are satisfied with what they have is because we are settling for absolute junk because it's better than nothing.

Compare with all surveys asking these questions in different words.

Like I said, I have *good* insurance and I have to waste time jumping through hoops for no good reason, and I get fed up and pay out of pocket because I'm sick of wasting time making phone calls.

Yes, depending on where they are needed.

I completely agree that people should not be forced to be vaccinated, but I also think they should be responsible for the potential repercussions of that decision because of the impact on patients and other personnel (e.g., people who can't get vaccinated for medical reasons).

Objectively, people who voluntarily don't get vaccinated pose greater risks to everybody.  If risks of their decision means reassignment to positions where their riskier choice is less likely to have a medical impact, that sounds like ordinary risk management to me.

To be clear, I don't mean this as some kind of punishment, simply that employers should be able to rearrange assignments in light of whether or not people are vaccinated.  If people don't like that potential for reassignment, then the choice is still there if it isn't a medical issue.

## Abstract

The recurrent zoonotic spillover of coronaviruses (CoVs) into the human population underscores the need for broadly active countermeasures. We employed a directed evolution approach to engineer three SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for enhanced neutralization breadth and potency. One of the affinity-matured variants, ADG-2, displays strong binding activity to a large panel of sarbecovirus receptor binding domains (RBDs) and neutralizes representative epidemic sarbecoviruses with high potency. Structural and biochemical studies demonstrate that ADG-2 employs a distinct angle of approach to recognize a highly conserved epitope overlapping the receptor binding site. In immunocompetent mouse models of SARS and COVID-19, prophylactic administration of ADG-2 provided complete protection against respiratory burden, viral replication in the lungs, and lung pathology. Altogether, ADG-2 represents a promising broad-spectrum therapeutic candidate against clade 1 sarbecoviruses.",,,1612020987,{},gldip40,True,t3_l8o46o,False,True,t3_l8o46o,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8o46o/broad_and_potent_activity_against_sarslike/gldip40/,1612048995,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,

&gt;&gt; A significant potential limitation of the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is the failure to sufficiently prevent infection and transmissionin the vaccinated population. While this has not been demonstrated conclusively, it remains a plausible risk that has been observed for other vaccines in the past and that is not being addressed directly in the vast majority of ongoing clinical vaccine studies[6,56]. In this study, we have used mathematical modeling to understand conditions in the United States at steady state, if a vaccine that was unable to prevent infection and exerted limited reduction in transmission was used as the primary or sole public-health intervention. Our results paint a grim picture: at steady state, we could expect 30 million symptomatic COVID-19 cases a year for a vaccine that is 95% effective at reducing symptoms and that is taken by 80% of the population (using best-estimate assumptions of natural immunity that lasts for 18 months, permanent vaccine immunity and an R0 of 5.7). If the reduction in risk of symptoms was concomitant with a reduction in risk of mortality (a best-case assumption), this scenario would lead to 240,000 deaths per year, making COVID-19 the third leading cause of death in the United States.

&gt;&gt; Another significant potential limitation of the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is reduced protection for the elderly. This remains a plausible risk as of this writing and would be consistent with the behavior of vaccines for a number of other diseases[30,32]. We used our modeling framework to explore the impact of a vaccine that was less effective in the elderly. Again, the picture is grim. For example, for a vaccine that is 85% effective in the over-65 population, at steady state, we could expect around 400,000 deaths a year (using the assumptions of 95% vaccine efficacy in the under-65 population, 80% compliance, 18 months natural immunity, permanent vaccine immunity and an R0 of 5.7; Fig. 2). The vast majority of these deaths would occur in the over-65 population. Crucially, for the over-65 population, a vaccine that does not prevent transmission and that is only partially effective will result in a never-ending pandemic.

But you’re right to worry that rapidly immunizing more people via vaccinations is going to greatly increase this selective pressure and lead to the development of more variants like the ones found in Brazil and South Africa. It’s likely not a coincidence that both of these nations had significant outbreaks before the variants emerged. In fact the Brazilian variant was found in Manaus, which was thought to be one of the most infected cities in the world. It is scary to imagine what will happen when the entire developed world has over 50% of its population somehow immune like Manaus was thought to.

The good news is that the trials for Noravax and J&amp;J indicate that their vaccines still seem to prevent severe illness even in regions where the variants are common.

Currently, imported cases are a drop in the water in most places. There is no point in closing borders when there is no strategy for local eradication. Great, you have stopped the influx of a few thousand cases, meanwhile a million people got infected locally. Every measure needs to be measured in its impact vs. its efectivness. A lot of people here want to pretend that the impact of closed borders is nothing, because it doesn't affect them personally. For other people it means the lost of jobs, the lost of access to healthcare, to family, including the elderly and the children that they need to care for and for some it means outright homelessness. Doing all of this to those people for marginal gain is just not alright, it's a human sacrifice.

It took me years to just be functional with A/D/PTSD and be able to work, maintain a medication/excercize/therapy balance, and be able to socialize without having social anxiety so bad I didn't want to at all. When my miscariage knocked me out of my social routine it took me months to recover. I had coffee with one friend after months of crying at home and trying to just make it through the day, then POW, pandemic. 

Not everyone has a rockstar partner/family support. Not everyone recognizes the importance of staying sober when A/D or PTSD is flaring up. Not everyone has the opportunity or motivation to prioritize eating well and excercize.

This isn't something that's just going to magically clear up when we reopen either. People may not be able to jump back into full time work. People may not be able to handle addiction/self medication very well. It's going to take years of kindness, professional help, and support from friends and family - many if which are dealing with the same issues. There's going to be a lot of people feeling guilty for not being able to support themselves/their families the way they used to, or be hard on themselves for feeling very real feelings of burnout from having their kids hanging on them 24/7 and trying to be ""on"" for a year without a break. 

Having A/D/PTSD has been a huge stigma, hopefully the one good thing about 33%+ of people having it is that stigma will be less. And maybe, just maybe, people will quit telling us to ""JuST RelAx"" and ""ChEEr uP, iT's NoT ThAT BaD"".

- doesn’t acknowledge the limitations of Bayesian analysis (at least on of his priors, as someone else here pointed out, is off, so that throws the entire analysis out of balance).
- and this guy paid to have his article deceptively published by AP (money talks, right).

Friday 1 kid came late, 2 were called into quarantine, 1 had a computer issue and had to come get it fixed.

From [this study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.14.20212555v1.full.pdf):

&gt; Between April and September 2020, 201 individuals (mean age 44 (SD 11.0) years, 70% female, 87% white, 31% healthcare workers) completed assessments following SARS-CoV-2 infection (median 140, IQR 105-160 days after initial symptoms). The prevalence of pre-existing conditions (obesity: 20%, hypertension: 6%; diabetes: 2%; heart disease: 4%) was low, and **only 18% of individuals had been hospitalised with COVID-19**.

...

&gt;In a young, low-risk population with ongoing symptoms, **almost 70% of individuals have impairment in one or more organs four months after initial symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection**. There are implications not only for burden of long COVID but also public health approaches which have assumed low risk in young people with no comorbidities.

[Another study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20214494v2) looked at the frequency of long COVID, and found that 2.3% of people with COVID19 infections were still experiencing symptoms after 12 weeks.

If these numbers are even close to accurate, then many hundreds of thousands of people in the US are among those who never got hospitalized but have detectable organ damage several months after their initial infection.

Importantly, these studies weren't even looking at the central nervous system when they developed these numbers. We don't know the mechanisms for the known neurological damage that's occurring, much less the frequency with which it occurs. 

We do know, however, that the virus can directly infect the Central Nervous System. We know that loss of smell is common. We know that this loss of smell often last a very long time, indicating significant damage to the nerves. We know that those nerves form a direct pathway to the brain.

Everyone has been focused on how this impacts the respiratory system and/or circulatory system, but nobody has been looking at the brain. The US was actively avoiding the use of things like MRIs on infected patients due to the risk of spreading the disease.

**TL;DR** Based on the available data, the number of people with moderate cases experiencing organ impairment is surprisingly high without even attempting to look at what the impacts are on the nervous system. Given what we know about this disease, it seems like the lack of information regarding the frequency of nervous system involvement is a major blind spot in our understanding of this disease.",,,1612022348,{},gldl8iq,False,t3_l8ays7,False,False,t1_glcu39f,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l8ays7/covid19_vaccines_could_end_the_pandemic_by/gldl8iq/,1612050337,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_8d3vu,False,False,,
