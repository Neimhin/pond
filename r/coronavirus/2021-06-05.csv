And these are just the things I wanted to do yesterday. How is this not restrictive?

You are also ignoring the emotional aspect of things. I've been sitting at home since March of 2020 because 60+year olds had to have their lives saved. And I was okay with that because peoples lives matter. 

But now they get vaccinated first and get to go out and live their lives again, while I am still subject to restriction? I have had multiple conversations with very frustrated young people who have all said (joking or otherwise) that perhaps they should just have gotten covid and then they could enjoy life now.

&gt; Also, we are not too far off from having everyone vaccinated who wants it. We currently have over 45 percent of the WHOLE population (including those under 18) vaccinated, meaning that over 60 % of adults have received their first shot.

Yeah tell that to the city of Hamburg, where they've said they wont drop priority on June 7 and GPs are telling Group 4 people to come back in August for their first shot. So far, the federal government keeps opening up the vaccine to younger and younger people and that just means that kids in tiny cities (literally the smallest risk group) are getting vaccinated before 40 year olds in Hamburg. Germany's vaccine rollout has been a disgrace. Hamburg's continues to be a disgrace today.

&gt; Finally, restricting rights for those vaccinated or cured is unconstitutional, so there is little choice here.

By the same logic that you restrict the freedoms of those who are not vaccinated for public health reasons you should be able to restrict rights for vaccinated people. Human psychology should be considered when laws are made. Or before soon, you have young people say - 'Well worst case, I will get covid, and that's not so bad is it? Once I recover I can do whatever I want for the next 6 months'.

Please note, I am an environmental scientist, not a virologist or microbiologist, so if I get anything wrong, please feel free to correct me!

Anyways on to the subject at hand.

COVID-19 uses it's Spike Protein to bind to ACE-II and a few other receptors lining your cells. Think of the spike as a key, and the receptor as a lock. The key binds with the lock, allowing the virus to inject it's genetic material into your cells, where your ribosomes (Think of these as little protein factories inside your cells) begin to make copies of the viral particle.

This same Spike Protein is coded for or presented by all of the existing vaccines. Your body learns to recognize the Spike, and thus can deactivate the Key on the virus should you be exposed.

A virus can mutate a few different ways. It can become more transmissible through a few different ways, it can become more or less deadly in a few ways as well, but the important factor here is in it's ability to evade immune resistance.

In order to evade current vaccines, the Spike protein would have to significantly change. This is a delicate process, as your body doesn't just develop one anti-body, but many for different parts of the Spike. If one doesn't work, chances are many of the others do. In order to make a vaccine completely ineffective, so many parts of the Spike would have to change, it would likely be a Key that doesn't fit in the the Lock. Basically, the Spike has changed so much, it physically cannot interact with Human cells.",,,1623015371,{},h0u84fu,False,t3_ntle9g,False,True,t1_h0t3zay,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ntle9g/covid19_delta_variant_is_around_40_more/h0u84fu/,1623171094,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Wrong. Censorship according to the [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/other/what-censorship):

&gt; Censorship, the suppression of words, images, or ideas that are ""offensive,"" happens whenever some people succeed in imposing their personal political or moral values on others. Censorship can be carried out by the government as well as private pressure groups. Censorship by the government is unconstitutional.

Initially, he tried his best to explain to his anti-vaxx family members that the vaccine was safe, beneficial, and worth it for the greater good, but they did not listen and mainly clung onto the idea that there were harmful ingredients in the vaccine. My friend decided to get the two doses of Pfizer in college in late April/early May and went home fully vaccinated. He told his vaccine-skeptical family members that he got the two shots and emerged without any negative impacts and tried encouraging them to get vaccinated given he believed them seeing him fine would somehow work. But still no success. So my friend decided to voluntarily do what I personally would have to assume is not what many people who typically get the two-dose vaccine would ever think of doing: he decided to get a *third* dose of Pfizer. He trusted that this would be safe and that showing him alive and well after doing this would at least help to further convince his anti-vaxx family members to get vaccinated. So under the pretense that he was in for a first shot, he went to a local CVS on his own and got a *third* Pfizer dose a few weeks ago. Turns out, he did emerge alive and well with no damage whatsoever. His anti-vaxxer family members found out about what he did and initially panicked, but after seeing him healthy and doing just fine, a few of them eventually listened to my friend and, as of quite recently, went in for their first shots.  

While I am sure not all anti-vaxxers think the same and that this would be one of those rare anecdotes of success in convincing such people to get vaccinated, what I learned from my friend is that sometimes it may involve you taking it a step further and diving into rare territory.",,,1623006932,{},h0tq3xp,False,t3_ntfv6e,False,False,t3_ntfv6e,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ntfv6e/daily_discussion_thread_june_06_2021/h0tq3xp/,1623159057,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

To begin, we need to learn the word: “*antigen*”.  For our purposes, an antigen is a foreign protein against which we will develop an immune response.  In the current pandemic coronavirus, the main antigen we are targeting is a protein on the surface of the virus that we call “spike.”  This is a dual-function protein that first binds the virus particle to the surface of the cell that it will infect and then fuses the membrane of the particle with the cell membrane, thereby releasing the viral genetic material into the cell to start the process of replication.  If we develop antibodies and other immune responses against spike, then we are protected from future infection by the virus.

The first coronavirus vaccines to be developed and released in the pandemic are what I call “expression-based” approaches.  These supply the genetic code for spike to the patient’s cells.  This means that the patient’s cells start making this foreign protein, which is similar to what a virus does, so it’s really good at stimulating an antiviral immune response.  This response involves producing antibodies, which are the only aspect of the immune system that can actually prevent infection, but also T cells, which look inside cells and can identify and destroy those cells that are infected by a virus.  The mRNA and viral vectored vaccines are expression-based approaches and these newer technologies allow us to develop these vaccines very quickly and very cleanly.  

I’ll point out that expression-based approaches are ancient.  Both variolation against smallpox and then Edward Jenner’s use of vaccina as the first vaccine were expression-based approaches.  They just didn’t know it at the time.

The other approach is a subunit approach.  One way to do this is to grow virus in cell culture and then inactivate it with something like formaldehyde or beta propiolactone and inject it into people with an additive called an adjuvant (usually an aluminum salt) to cause some local tissue irritation and set off an immune response.  The Sinopharm and Sinovac products use this approach, but it doesn’t seem to generate as strong an immune response as the expression-based approaches.

Novavax is using a variation on this.  It’s been known for a while that if you can cluster your antigen of interest together into little bundles or particles, this seems to generate a stronger immune response than just giving them as free-floating molecules.  They also have an adjuvant that seems to be very effective at activating just the right kind of antiviral response.  So Novavax basically expresses a bunch of spike protein using a cell culture system and bunches it into little nanoscopic “bouquets” of spike and then presents it to the immune system as such with their adjuvant.  This generates a ridiculously strong antibody response that has proven in clinical trials to offer robust protection against the virus.  The current GSK “SHINGRIX” shingles vaccine operates on this principle and offers 97% protection against shingles.

So this approach will be helpful for patients who haven’t been able to tolerate mRNA or adenovirus vaccines and also can be used to prepare for future pandemic viruses.",,,1623005070,{},h0tm3lt,False,t3_ntiwlv,False,False,t3_ntiwlv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ntiwlv/new_type_of_covid_vaccine_could_debut_soon/h0tm3lt/,1623156473,16,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

""In the case of SH 130, however, there may also be individualized factors that have contributed to a significant increase in accidents and ‘problematic driver behavior’ on that road. In 2012, the toll road section of the highway opened, and investigation by Austin media shows that a private toll road company provided a $100 million investment payment to post the speed limit on that section of SH 130 at 85 mph. In theory, the higher speed was intended to ‘incentivize’ drivers, particularly truckers, to take SH 130 instead of other roads like I-35, hopefully alleviating some of Austin’s traffic problems. This has not been borne out. Instead, accident rates have only risen.

The private road operator, who originally proffered the incentive payment has since gone bankrupt; traffic metrics for the road have simply not been what was forecasted. Statistics from 2016 showed that actual traffic was 60 percent lower than estimated, and much of this has been postulated to be due to tolls. Most drivers prefer free roads, even if they are busy and congested, so the only people who chose to take SH 130 tend to be those who want to go fast on the relatively open road.

&gt;far less diversity in population.

Compared to what?  NZ is one of the world's most diverse populations.  The country is 28% foreign-born, with 15% of the population Asian, 16% Maori and 9% Pacific Islander.  That's more diverse and more immigrant than the US or UK.  

Or how about Taiwan, which is over 95% Han Chinese. That's not diverse at all!   

&gt;The total population is still less than a city like New York and a little more than Los Angeles.

The argument was about population density.  The Auckland urban area has about the same density as the Los Angeles urban area.  I'm just pointing out your density argument doesn't work.  And now you've shifted the goalposts.  

&gt;Any government with a little competence can manage a pandemic with 5 million people in an isolated part of the world, not to mention a developed country.

Right.

&gt;If everybody wore face mask correctly OUTDOORS, then there wouldn't be a worry about transmission INDOORS.

Except majority of the transmission has been in-doors. Don't you get it?

Case 1 gets it from hotel quarantine. Spreads it to family. Family spreads it to friends. Friends spreads to workplace. Workplace spreads it to family. And so on and on. Barely anyone has spread it to someone at a park or walking on the street.

Majority (all) of transmission so far has been in in-door settings.

So I know exactly how an elimination strategy is meant to work.  From the very beginning in NZ and Australia massive regular surveillance testing has been an absolute key part of the strategy.  

The reason being that in order to contact trace you must catch the outbreak extremely early. Such regular surveillance testing has caught three outbreaks in NZ which were then able to be stopped before they got beyond contact tracers.  The people infected had no links to the border, no links to other infected people and were only caught because everyone with cold or flu symptoms gets tested in NZ.  

Since the beginning Taiwan has had among the lowest test rates in the world and unlike India or Vietnam or other developing countries that can't afford so many tests, Taiwan has no excuse. It's as wealthy as NZ and could easily have been doing regular community testing.  

Sure enough exactly what I feared has happened, they only discovered an outbreak after it had spread silently through the community for weeks and they still haven't managed to ring-fence it.  

Australia, NZ and China have also all shown that the only safe way to react to even a small outbreak is to have an immediate hard lockdown to give contact tracing and mass testing time to find and isolate the clusters.  Taiwan's measures have not been as harsh and have clearly allowed the virus to continue to spread.  It's very disappointing and worrying.

I only started commenting on this subreddit this April, but I’ve followed this pandemic since there were only a handful of confirmed cases in five countries a Pacific Ocean away.  I couldn’t have predicted then-- in the middle of my third year in college-- how much it would upend my life and those of *so many others.*

But I also couldn’t have known, amid California’s winter surge, how quickly we would turn it around.  I’m one of at least 73% of people aged 12+ in San Diego County and 68% statewide who’ve gotten a shot (S.D. H.S.S.A., C.D.C.).  Fewer people here are testing positive now than at any other point during this crisis.

I’m fully aware that COVID’s still around, and I’ll continue to take precautions for the time being.  But I find that this subreddit contributes to a loop of irrational anger and stress.  I appreciate reading different perspectives, but sometimes-- albeit very rarely-- these conversations can get ugly.  A while back, someone had replied to one of my comments and shamed me for getting the vaccine.  Big thanks to the moderators for shutting that down and for fostering a healthy discussion overall.

And... it’s just the time to turn to new chapters.  Two days before California “graduates” from the pandemic, I’ll be graduating from college in an in-person ceremony.  It’s not much, but it’s finally a day to look forward to.  To see some of the friends that I haven’t seen in a while.  To go on my first road trip and host my first party in more than a year.  Of course, I can’t revert the effects of the pandemic on my life, but it’s just time that I looked ahead.

I might continue to lurk the COVID-related subreddits.  But unless things turn south again, I’ll go back to commenting on gaming, music, sports, and other such communities.  

As a parting word, go get your vaccine.  If you’re somewhere that hasn’t been as fortunate as we in the U.S. have been, continue to mask up and distance.  And hang in there.

That wasn't your proposition. You said any competent govt of an isolated country of 5 million could handle it well.  Now you can't name any others so you just completely change your definition.  I'll take that as admission your first statement was wrong.  

&gt;That's idiotic. Have you actually visited a subway in NYC? That's a microcosm of the the world. Nowhere in the world is as diverse as NYC or even other major US coastal cities.

You can't actually back this up with evidence because you have none.  You're simply betraying your ignorance with this insulting statement.  I actually grew up in Boston, lived in Washington DC for years and regularly went to NYC because I had family and friends there.  So I know from personal experience that NZ is just as diverse and more immigrant.  

But here are some stats to back that up. The New York City urban are is 29.7% immigrant according to the census [here](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/31000US35620-new-york-newark-jersey-city-ny-nj-pa-metro-area/).  

The Boston urban area is 19.2% immigrant and 69% White in population according to the [census](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/31000US14460-boston-cambridge-newton-ma-nh-metro-area/).

Meanwhile Auckland, according to [Stats NZ](https://www.stats.govt.nz/tools/2018-census-place-summaries/auckland-region#birthplace) is 41.6% immigrant and 53.5% White. So far more immigrant than any US East Coast urban area and more diverse than Boston, which is a major US coastal city. 

&gt;Population density depends on both population and area. Did you fail basic math? 5 million total population is still insignificant, smaller cities in countries like India and China have more population.

Okay, so why did isolated Iceland with its 350,000 people and competent government have such high Covid numbers?  Or how about Ireland, which is also an island, had a similar population and is not a major world transit hub.

&gt; This study highlights the challenge of generating HIV-neutralizing antibodies. Most gp120 appears as inactive single molecules or in viral debris. Future vaccines will have to generate antibodies to target the site of vulnerability on gp120 in the envelope spike. “We now know the factors guarding the site,” Kwong says. “The next step is learning how to overcome those barriers.”

If a vaccine is able to cause the body to generate proteins that would create antibodies that would successfully latch onto the HIV virus - this vaccine, while not able to completely remove HIV from the cells it already infected, would almost stop it from infecting further cells, and decrease the viral load in blood to near-zero.

Every piece of data says we are not going to get there based on vaccines alone. We may get there through the combination of vaccines and ""natural immunity"" (which is the nice way of saying that people are going to have to get sick to get immune), but even that is uncertain as we don't know how long immunity lasts.

But, at the end of the day, herd immunity is a noble goal but was probably always impractical. Even achieving herd immunity in the US would not mean global herd immunity, so Covid is almost certainly here to stay. The goal then becomes slightly different, to reduce the societal risk from Covid to something acceptable. Have enough immunity that there aren't enough people getting sick that it will disrupt society. We do risky things every day, we simply need Covid to be within our risk tolerance.

I think we are close to that, if not already there, in most of the US. There are still some red spots on the maps, but infections, hospitalizations, and mortality is trending towards zero in most places. And that is the measure that we should be using to open up rather than if we have gotten to herd immunity or not.

The places where infections are still occurring is where mutations emerge. That’s not a theory, it’s based on decades of evidence and study of viruses. Our new vaccines do protect us from variants so far. But the entire point of viral mutation is that _the moment_ a mutation occurs that can evade a vaccinated immune system, it will spread through the population slowed only by lack of exposure.

&gt;	Treating every country/state/city with a one size fits all strategy makes no sense.

Not taking the most basic, simple, and inexpensive steps to slow the possible spread of an infection we can’t see or detect until _after it emerges_ is what makes no sense. It doesn’t matter what the local infection rate is when the vast majority of humans are still susceptible to the virus and can throw off a new mutation at any time.

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

Base on this Canada news, looks like Moderna is having delays even for Canada. EU production sites don't have enough capacity and Moderna vaccine produced in US are still ordered to stay in US by government's order/guidance. I think Moderna's contract with Canada was 20 m + 36 m option. If any Canadian here know how many have been delivered that will be helpful. But when this contract has only been filled a little bit, it's not that surprising that Taiwan's 5 m contract have been filled only by 150K.

Basically Taiwan government signed contract with 2 local developers (Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation and UBI Pharma Inc.) for 10 million doses. But those 2 vaccines are still in Phase II trial. And nobody really wants to get a vaccine without Phase III trial.

Some people are complaining that government didn't buy much foreign vaccines because they betted heavily on local vaccines. It was not an issue even in April, because at that time there was no local virus transmission in Taiwan and local vaccines were going to deliver in August. TV programs were even talking about left-over vaccines and who to blame if vaccines were over purchased. Then everything changed when outbreak happened in May. August feels like forever now. 

In my opinion, government took a gamble and it backfired. When you were 200+ or 300+ straight days no local transmission, you just didn't expect an outbreak to happen.",,,1622996410,{},h0t3rp4,False,t3_ntff74,False,False,t1_h0sxde6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ntff74/taiwan_to_receive_750000_covid19_vaccine_doses/h0t3rp4/,1623142428,25,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Nothing really. While the CCP probably doesn't care too much about the lives of individual Chinese citizens, there's no point in releasing a pathogen in your own country if your purpose is to spread it to your adversaries.

Any major power that wanted to intentionally release an infectious pathogen, would surely be able to smuggle it into the target country and release it there. Such an approach would have so many advantages over letting it loose in your own country first.

We thought it was surface transmission driving the spread.  We didn't know if/what masks were that effective and if user error outweighed the potential benefits.  We thought it was distance that was important instead of ventilation.  When we finally figured out what to do, we not only reduced the spread of COVID-19, but crushed the cold and flu transmission as well. 

That's kind of crazy in retrospect.  Yes, some of our confusion was probably practical (masks were needed in certain places, ventilation fixes are more expensive than floor stickers, DoorDash/Amazon shouldn't make all the money, etc.).  But I remember reading some of the studies (ok, their abstracts -- sue me).  The best scientific literature was pretty scatter shot.  It kind of took looking at the regions that were getting hammered and which were not and then working backwards.

By allowing China to polictically control the WHO which is quite easy considering the WHO has to use appeasement to get what they need from China, we miss out on having members like Taiwan. I understand knowing that info would have been good, but China still withheld information from the WHO controlling the spread of the disease. My point is the information we gain isn't worth the political effort it takes to get that information, we could have just followed Taiwans recommendations if they were allowed to be in the WHO.

Seems to be the story of much of the developed west, sadly.

* Government reacts to pandemic cases rising with effective restrictions and sufficient enforcement thereof.
* Previous measures result in case rates declining.
* Declining case rates result in politicians tripping over themselves to end restrictions.
* Ending restrictions causes cases to rise.
* But, now that the public has tasted restrictions-&gt;no/little restrictions, there's no political will to properly reinstate those restrictions, so they just shrug and let things happen and/or re-implement restrictions but only half-assed with basically no enforcement.

The reason it got bad in Canada in the most recent few months was because of the arrival of the more transmissible variants, the effect of which was blunted in the US because of widespread deployment of vaccines by that point, whereas Canada (back in Feb. and March) was well behind the US on vaccinations due to inadequate availability.  So, the US started pulling ahead of Canada in terms of performance on several metrics in the spring.

These issues are complicated to assess, but bottom line, if the US had done what Canada did it early in the pandemic, it could have saved at least a couple hundred thousand lives.  If Canada had access to vaccines like the US did back at the start of 2021, then the ""third wave"" in Canada could have been better contained.  Different strategies, different outcomes, and it depends when you look at it.

* Negative result means that they did not detect antibodies. This means you have not been recently infected with COVID, but really says nothing about the vaccines. There are *many* different antibodies, and the ones you might have gotten from the vaccine might not be one they are testing for. Or, they might not be at a detectable level, but you still are protected because of other immune mechanisms that the Red Cross is not testing for.
* Positive result means that they did detect antibodies, which may be from either recent infection or the vaccine. You of course cannot tell which, at least not from their testing equipment. That infection may have been even before you got vaccinated.

This is why the Red Cross stresses that their antibody tests **do not** say anything about vaccination: all of the results are muddy. If you do not have a good before and after case, and do not have any idea if you were infected at some point, the results are essentially meaningless. But, if you got the vaccine, in a vast majority of cases, it works. It is not worth checking.

But it is still great to donate blood, so please do that.

That being said, I am a bit of a hypocrite. I donate blood regularly anyways, so I am using their antibody test to see if I can see some sort of antibody pickup. But the thing is, I do have that before and after comparison: I donated blood before getting vaccinated which was negative for antibodies, and have since been fully vaccinated and have donated blood again. As a student, I have been getting regularly tested for COVID (all negative of course), so I know for a fact that I did not have it between the blood donations. So while I am still waiting for the test results, I know for certain that the only way that I would have antibodies would be from the vaccine.

I agree that the situation is unfair for younger people. Also, trust me, I am very frustrated. My year studying in London got cut in half due to Covid and instead, I am now sitting at home the whole day trying to work on my Ph.D. which, admittedly, is not going too well, when University libraries are still largely closed or only bookable in time slots and you have no one to discuss and chat with. 

However, I don't think that taking away rights from older people who have received their vaccines until everyone has had the chance is a solution here. While young people have been hit the hardest by restrictions, this should not mean that other people should also suffer, if there is literally no reason to do so anymore for them. Vaccinated people don't save lives if they stay at home, infection rates will not be noticeably lower if vaccinated are required to stay home - this is an important difference.

I don't know if vaccinating younger people earlier was a solution. At least I think I should have been given better consideration since most infections are in young age groups as well. I also think that the older generation owes the younger for protecting their lives. But instead of having the older generation suffer with them which really doesn't benefit anyone, there should be measures that specifically benefit young people such as payments, travel/restaurant/clubbing vouchers, etc. While this will hardly make up for the past year, it would at least show some goodwill. Also, imo you should be allowed to rely on a negative PCR test for at least 5 days so that testing once a week would be sufficient.

And it isn't clear to me how the WSJ gets from the idea that something is inconsistent with evolutionary theory to something being inconsistent with evolutionary origin. Something that is inconsistent with evolutionary origin is most likely man made. Something inconsistent with evolutionary theory does not aver that something is or is not man made. It may be that Anderson and his colleagues think the theory needs revising. Maybe they think that they theory is solid but there may be some error in the instrumentation or in the process used to uncover the anomaly. So they WSJ is wrong to draw the conclusion it does.

Having said that, I hate it when scientists talk like lawyers.

[And still, California better controlled the virus. If California had Florida’s death rate, roughly 6,000 more Californians would be dead from COVID-19,](https://www.sfchronicle.com/local/article/California-and-Florida-have-similar-COVID-16031518.php) and tens of thousands of additional patients likely would have landed in already overburdened hospitals. And if Florida had California’s death rate, roughly 3,000 fewer Floridians would be dead from COVID-19

...

About 55% of California residents live in counties with a high “social vulnerability” score — a measure of how severely a disease outbreak might affect a region — while only a quarter of Floridians do. California’s rate of overcrowding in homes, a metric linked to coronavirus spread, is also more than double Florida’s.

...

California also has a longer flu and pneumonia season, a pattern that the coronavirus tends to follow, Mokdad said. And in the fall, there may have been an extra-contagious strain of the virus circulating locally that further complicated matters.

Because of the many ways California is more susceptible to coronavirus spread, replicating Florida’s relaxed approach may have had devastating consequences here. Arizona, which has lax restrictions similar to Florida’s, has the nation’s fifth-highest COVID-19 death rate. An additional 38,000 Californians would be dead if the state’s per-capita deaths matched Arizona’s.

...

If L.A. County’s deaths are subtracted out of California’s total, Florida’s death rate would measure 39% higher than the state’s.

This is part of the content of a document from the committee recently sent to leaders of religious organisations, asking for enhanced application of anti-COVID-19 measures.

The move followed a COVID-19 outbreak that started from a religious group named “Hoi thanh truyen giao Phuc Hung” (Revival Ekklesia Mission) in Ho Chi Minh City and then spread to many localities.

Therefore, the Government committee requested leaders of religious organisations to continue communication activities to encourage their dignitaries, followers, and establishments to seriously adhere to the instructions on COVID-19 prevention and control.

They were asked to suspend all religious activities at places of worship and the sites registered for concentrated religious practices and put up warning signs at those areas. Religious establishments and sites of religious practices must coordinate with authorities in contact tracing if any of them records suspected cases.

The Government committee required religious organisations to update COVID-19 information from official sources on their websites and other means of communications, and disseminate the information to their facilities in remote areas and pandemic hotbeds.

It also recommended religious organisations call on their subsidiaries, dignitaries, and followers join hands with authorities in the pandemic fight and contribute to the COVID-19 vaccine fund.

The COVID-19 cluster at the place of worship of the Revival Ekklesia Mission group in Ward 3 of Go Vap district, HCM City, was found on late May 26.

As of 3pm on June 4, there had been 310 infection cases (F0), 5,377 F1s (people directly meeting the confirmed patients), and over 320,000 F2s (those with close contact with F1s) related to this cluster.

Apart from 20 of the 22 district-level localities in HCM City, the outbreak from this hotbed has spread to 15 provinces and cities, with eight reporting infection cases and seven others recording F1s or F2s.

The numbers of F0s, F1s, and F2s related to this cluster are forecast to keep increasing on the coming days./.",,,1622983297,{},h0sf6hh,True,t3_ntkvcf,False,False,t3_ntkvcf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ntkvcf/vietnam_religious_organisations_leaders_to_be/h0sf6hh/,1623128700,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

And guess what, now we have almost 50% of our population with at least one dose and expect huge deliveries in June. This means that 2/3 of those who want to get a vaccine already have one dose, and there are still a few more weeks in Q2 to get close to ""most people"". Remember we will never hit 100% uptake, and kids are not recommended to get a vaccine right now. Even with 100% of adults vaccinated, that would be only 85% of our population. But if uptake is 80%, then we would only be able to vaccinate close to 70% of the population. So 45% done out of 70% is pretty good already, just \~25% to go with most of that happening in the next \~4 weeks.

As for all your questions, I'd say that each state's drivers' licensing system can be expanded to create vaccine ID's too.  You can get them at the DMV as long as you have your vaccine card from the pharmacy or mass vax center that you got your shot at.  Alternatively you can also get a passport if you have a signed doctors' note saying that for health reasons (allergies or other conditions) you cannot take the vaccine.

Some bars let underage people in, and often they are eventually busted by the police.  I'd imagine something similar could be the way it's enforced.  

No one prevents fakes; the point is not to have a foolproof system, but a system that keeps immunocompromised people mostly safe as they go out to restaurants or go to work, and STRONGLY encourages vaccination.

I'm not pretending my answers above are the only solution; it's just one possible suggestion for your list of questions that you seem to be trying to imply are unsolvable.

[],,liulide,,,[],,,,text,t2_4u84c,False,False,[],"In the modern history of catastrophic infectious diseases in Brazil, children often suffer the most in terms of deaths and disability. When dengue epidemics emerged in Brazil in 2007 and 2008, children accounted for more than half of the fatalities. When pregnant women became infected with the [Zika virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/health/zika-virus-brazil-how-it-spread-explained.html) during an epidemic that began in 2015, more than 1,600 newborn Brazilian infants were born with devastating microcephaly birth defects, far more than in any other nation. Respiratory viruses continue to disproportionately affect Brazil’s children, while hookworms and other intestinal parasites stunt childhood growth and development, especially in poor rural areas.

Now Covid-19 is causing severe illness in young Brazilian children at levels not seen in other parts of the world. Research by Dr. Fatima Marinho of Vital Strategies, a nongovernmental organization, [has found that](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/23/children-with-covid-why-are-some-countries-seeing-more-cases-and-deaths) more than 2,200 children under the age of 10 have died from Covid-19. While this number represents less than 0.5 percent of Brazil’s 467,000 Covid-19 deaths, more than 900 of the fatalities occurred in children under the age of 5. The United States has recorded nearly 600,000 deaths from Covid-19, but only 113 of those have been of children under the age of 5.

We studied Covid-19 infection rates for adolescents and children in the state of São Paulo, home to more than 20 percent of Brazil’s population. Our analysis found a surge in the numbers of both reported cases and hospitalizations among adolescents and children since the end of 2020. Approximately half of those hospitalizations, more than 900, were among children younger than 5, including many infants.

When the pandemic began last year, the coronavirus [appeared to affect children](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/health/coronavirus-children-immune.html) far less frequently, and less severely, than adults. So why are so many young children in Brazil being hospitalized with and dying from Covid-19? Identifying the answer is critical not just to the health of children in South America; it’s also vital to understanding what path the coronavirus pandemic may take in the future.

One possible explanation lies in Brazil’s emerging variants of concern. The predominant strain of the coronavirus circulating in Brazil is the P.1 variant — now called [Gamma](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/), according to an [announcement](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/31/health/covid-variant-names-india-delta.html) from the World Health Organization this week. Like Beta (the new name for the B.1.351 variant, which was first identified in South Africa), the Gamma variant is more transmissible compared to earlier virus lineages, and it may be able to partially escape the antibodies produced by a Covid-19 infection or vaccine. It is possible that the same mutations that make Gamma more transmissible also contribute to higher rates of infections, hospitalizations and deaths among children.

Of course, it’s equally likely that the rise in Covid-19 cases among children is part of an uncontrolled spread of Gamma across all age groups. Pregnant women who get Covid-19 are at a higher risk for severe illness and preterm births, and women who are infected may pass the coronavirus to their newborns.

Given the presence of the Gamma variant in the United States — about 7 percent of Covid-19 cases in the United States can be attributed to this variant — it’s possible that pediatric and newborn Covid-19 cases could soon become more prevalent. This is cause for serious concern.

While the B.1.1.7 variant, now called Alpha, is now responsible for more than two-thirds of all coronavirus cases in the United States, Gamma appears to be spreading quickly in some areas. In Illinois Gamma is now [responsible](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions) for 22.4 percent of cases for which the coronavirus strains have been genetically sequenced; in Massachusetts, 13.6 percent of sequenced Covid cases were caused by the Gamma variant.

If the Gamma variant continues to spread and outpaces vaccination efforts in the United States, officials may need to reinstate virus mitigation measures or identify new ones. Booster shots that are tailored to variants may be critical. And the United States needs to continue its efforts to vaccinate adolescents and to approve vaccines for younger children and infants. Public health officials must also continue to educate parents about the very real threat that Covid-19 poses to their children and the importance of vaccination. Otherwise, pediatric and infant Covid-19 may become a tragic new reality.

The Covid-19 crisis in Brazil is the result of the [government’s failure](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/06/world/americas/brazil-covid-bolsonaro-nasal-spray.html) to take adequate public health measures to limit the transmission of the coronavirus, as well as inadequate supplies of vaccines. As more transmissible variants spread, similar crises are unfolding in South America, as well as in India and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

I've linked you to actual studies and all the evidence is that they do stop transmission.  You've linked to one person who essentially said ""be careful"" and from that determined that you know the precise extent to which they reduce transmission and it's negligible...

&gt;My husband said the transmission reduction's current estimation is between 0.002%-0.005% from the most recent studies. Again, he's a doctor of public health and is getting direction from the WHO and CDC and viewing the date so to say he's clueless going of the studies and their guidance is ignoring the science.


Again you're giving me anecdotal evidence based on hearsay based on an appeal to authority - I'm giving you links to the *actual* studies giving a reduction of between 40-50% reduced transmission. 
 
Do you really not see the difference?!

Here are studies from Israel:

They don’t say anything - it’s Covid and they don’t know it. 5 minutes pass by, a few people in that house get exposed. Those people find out they were exposed a week later (if at all), and at that point they’ve already gone to church or visited with a friend. Maybe they got sick and spread it without knowing. Maybe one of them got on a plane.

I think another thing is this - masks might not be well-fitted, or they might be mishandled. Cross-contamination might be happening. Maybe there isn’t adequate ventilation in a public space and people are crowded together.

An extremely contagious respiratory virus with a long latency period, people unknowingly exposing their friends, families and communities for days, the lack of testing, continued local and international travel, the absurd politicization of the virus, the lack of vaccines, the long wait for test results... there’s no way it could have ever been totally under control under those conditions.

My rationale was that while we don’t know the percent needed for herd immunity for Covid specifically, 80-90% is generally the case for other viruses. For example: measles is 95%, while polio is 80%, and mumps is 86%. 

However, with a little more googling I found that the estimates for Covid are actually “70% or higher”, as per Dr. Betty Chung from the Cambridge department of pathology. You can see her tweet on the subject in the webMD source.

I’m not making light of combat and I’m NOT making a direct comparison. I said it “FELT like a fucking war.”

Myself, along with many others fought to help save the lives of our fellow countrymen and women and on multiple occasions we failed, not for lack of trying, but because the enemy we were fighting was simply too much for us to manage.

I’m not just including grannies and grandpas and those highly susceptible to the virus, I’ve seen physically fit and healthy individuals lose legs, have heart attacks, go into heart failure, neurological injuries that are unfixable, etc.

There are thousands of Americans right now who will NEVER get back the lives they once had due to the long term effects they are now suffering. People who will be dependent on oxygen concentrators or portable tanks for the rest of their lives because they simply cannot breathe adequately anymore.

People who will have to go to dialysis every other day until they eventually die because their kidneys are destroyed.

People who will never walk again or be able to form complete sentences because their brain doesn’t function fully anymore. People who will have to be dependent on feeding tubes for the rest of their lives, people who will need constant 24/7 care because they suffered debilitating strokes. People who lost every dime they had trying to save their homes or their loved ones, including healthcare workers.

And last but not least, people I PERSONALLY worked alongside who lost their lives to this virus, either because their bodies simply could not defeat it, or the mental and physical toll it took on them until they took their own life.

I’ve known doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists,medics, and EMT’s who gave EVERYTHING they had at the height of this to help only to be told the virus wasn’t real and it was all a hoax and a government conspiracy to control people. 

I’ve personally had random people challenge me on the validity of the virus, a virus I saw destroy homes and families and communities and local businesses. They invalidated the work of so many healthcare workers across this country, almost as if they were spitting directly in our faces.

So while there may not have been any bullets whizzing past our heads or bombs being dropped on us, WE STILL FOUGHT.

So please, take this into consideration and think about the perspective of those who were there doing their damndest to help stop the spread and save others from the suffering so many people endured.

Like I said, it wasn’t war, but it sure as fuck felt like it.
