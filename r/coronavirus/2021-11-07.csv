https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/10/07/1043910547/los-angeles-mandates-covid-19-vaccines

&gt; Patrons will need to show proof of a COVID-19 vaccination to enter restaurants, bars, coffee shops, stores, gyms, spas or salons as well as large, outdoor events.

&gt; Proof includes a CDC vaccination card, a photo of *both sides* of the card, documentation from a health provider, or a digital record. … A business found in violation could face a warning or notice for a first violation, a $1,000 fine for a second violation, a $2,000 fine for a third, and a $5,000 fine for a fourth violation.

For California residents, the new version of iOS (15.1) allows one to import a certified vaccination status directly into Health and Wallet.  It's super convenient at venues.  One can download a digital COVID-19 vaccination record at the following link:

[],,butts_kapinsky,,,,,,[],"Wavelength: Light has wave properties, much like the ocean. The wavelength is the distance from wave peak to peak. Radio broadcasts have wavelengths on the order of meters. Microwaves have wavelength on the order of, you might be able to guess, micrometers. Visible light exists on the order of hundreds of nanometers

Bandwidth: When we're talking about a range of wavelengths, we refer to the range that they cover the bandwidth. Visible light has wavelengths from 400-700 nanometers roughly. Therefore it has a bandwidth of 300 nm (though, it is more typical to talk about bandwidth in terms of frequency which is simply 1/wavelength)

Brilliance: This is brightness per bandwidth. A source which is dim but concentrated tightly about a single wavelength will be more ""brilliant"" than a source which is equally dim but contains a wider range of frequencies. As the OP stated, any single wavelength would have infinite brilliance. This is because a single wavelength has a bandwidth of zero. The result is dividing by zero.

Synchotron: This is a type of particle accelerator which can generate high energy light. X-rays are simply high energy light but they are generated by other means. The light generated by synchotrons are generally more energetic than X-rays. This means they have a shorter wavelength

Quasi-monochromactic: This is a very fancy way to say that it almost has a single wavelength. Quasi means almost, mono means one, and chromatic means uh, ""property of light""? I'm not sure the root definition of chromatic haha.

Bremsstrahlung spectrum: This is an additional source of radiation introduced when radiation enters a body or a target. Imagine you are running on concrete and then you start to run on a beach. What happens? You slow down. Radiation does this also when it goes from air or a vaccum into a human body, for example. But when certain particles slow down, the reduction in velocity causes them to give off extra radiation. The wavelength of this radiation will be different from the wavelength of the source. The net result is that Bremsstrahlung will ""broaden"" the spectrum. It will increase the bandwidth that we measure. 

Kerma: This is a measurement for calculating how much energy radiation in the air will deposit into a human body. Bodies are very different from air and the result is a transfer of energy.

Dose: This is a measurement which tells us how dangerous the energy deposited in a human body is. It can be very location dependent. For example, our skin exists specifically to protect against radiation. For this reason, all radiative sources will give a human a lower dose when they are held next to the skin compared to if they are ingested.",,,,1636341448,{},hjret27,False,t3_qoilt7,False,True,t1_hjnwr3w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qoilt7/brightest_ever_xray_shows_lung_vessels_altered_by/hjret27/,1636606194.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,[],text,t2_5fw801iq,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Navy has granted only six permanent medical exemptions ahead of its deadline for active sailors on Nov. 28, officials said. The active-duty Army, which faces a Dec. 15 deadline, has approved one for medical reasons.

October, with the vast majority of them for religious reasons, according to the Professional Managers Association, which represents agency managers.

There's cultural factors at play here too and not simply just vaccinations.

NA is seeing a spike in cases. EU is seeing a spike in cases. Asia, even the countries that did very well, are seeing a spike in cases. Even Australia and New Zealand are seeing a spike in cases. And somehow nobody bats an eyelash when japan's numbers are exceptional?

japan is quite infamous for under testing. Just look at their covid graph, the peaks for the positivity rate coincides with their peaks in cases. Their latest wave, which was their worst one yet had a corresponding positivity rate of 20%. Their were literally stories coming out from japan about people being straight up turned away from hospitals so they wouldn't get tested.

Let's use South Korea as an example. Similar culture (though they would hate me saying that), higher vaccination rate, slightly younger population, and slightly lower population density. Very comparable countries and South Korea even has the edge and yet japan has the much better numbers. Anyone else think it strange that the country that is known for testing a lot less has the better numbers? Remember, South Korea is the country that pioneered testing and tracing in the first place so their numbers are far more reliable.

Now before you make a strawman out of my argument, I'm not saying that there's a mountain of dead bodies that they're hiding. All I'm saying is that many countries in the world with much better covid policies are struggling so there's zero reason to think that japan, which has next to no covid policies, should be doing as well as they claim.

&gt;A regional director who was employed at the research organisation Ventavia Research Group has told The BMJ  
that the company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed   
inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse   
events reported in Pfizer’s pivotal phase III trial. Staff who conducted  
 quality control checks were overwhelmed by the volume of problems they   
were finding. After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, the  
 regional director, Brook Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US Food   
and Drug Administration (FDA). Ventavia fired her later the same day. 

1.  The company itself has disregarded the problems and and not only failed to address them, but fired the employee who was raising concerns.   
2. FDA has failed to act. They only inspected 9 out of 153 trial sites. I understand that FDA has limited resources, but this was larger than average trial site and they appear to have failed to follow up on   
3. Pfizer itself was notified of the issues. Not only they have not mentioned any such issues in their documents submitted to FDA, but:  


&gt;Since Jackson reported problems with Ventavia to the FDA in September   
2020, Pfizer has hired Ventavia as a research subcontractor on four   
other vaccine clinical trials (covid-19 vaccine in children and young   
adults, pregnant women, and a booster dose, as well an RSV vaccine trial  


It appears that clinical trials are contracted to private companies that are incentivized to cut corners, as RCTs are cumbersome and expensive, there is clear lack of government oversight for various reasons and the pharma companies who are paying for these trials are not looking to delay/cancel the products they've already spend billions on on R&amp;D or spend even more money running ""proper"" RCTs.

This was noticed by a group of independent investigators (who have been checking up and asking for original data files from authors).  Hit the news when BBC called them out on it in October.  https://www.bbc.com/news/health-58170809.amp

Authors claim they accidentally sent the wrong file (that one had been used to help train a research assistant) for analysis. And that they have re-run the stats with the correct data and it still gives the same conclusion.

This claim seems a bit contradictory.  If they’d just sent the wrong file to the investigators for re-analysis, there’d be no need to retract.  So it seems like they’ve actually used the “wrong data file” for the published paper.

If you’re thinking “surely you’d put a bit more effort into faking, especially before sending it to an independent analyst group?” … a weirdly high number of research fraud cases do get caught this way.   

I don’t understand it either.  I’d randomise my fake numbers a bit.   But this is a thing.

With the same 5% hospitalization rate you can find a number of daily cases where hospital beds will be strained/run out.  By this metric it's somewhere in the 0.01-0.05% of the population that can test positive per day without hitting those thresholds.  Of course, exceeding that only raises the 1% number, so it's really just a higher mortality cost (and likely an even bigger healthcare savings).

By devaluing American lives we can get a different answer.  The value of American life is agreed upon by several standards ($8 million in one, $10 million in another, but the best one for this purpose is the $128,000 per year of life remaining Dialysis Standard).

Everyone (who can) should get vaccinated, but I think (perceived) punitive measures help feed spinners of 'ill intent'-narratives more than you would like and further escalate division of American society. That process is worrying, even for a spectator from 'afar'. Internet makes seeding worries, doubt and anger really easy, as you know.

More, tireless effort needs to be done to reach out. Maybe there is a role here for the newer media's like Netflix and Facebook, etc., too to reach out. As well as on community levels the message needs to be conveyed: The vaccines are safe and help prevent hospitalization and death. I'd even consider positive monetary incentives to get people along, it may prove to be just as cheap and might induce less negative feedback.

Gaining trust is hard. Trust is a fragile 'social asset' that requires both parties at the table at some level, to respect and care for each other.

[],,telo1014,,,,,,[],"Just wanted to share an odd experience, as I couldn't find anything online about this.  My boyfriend and I (we live together) went to a small get-together (7 friends) over Halloween weekend. We are fully vaccinated with Pfizer since May/June.  Most people at the get together were vaccinated, apparently only one person was not. He had Covid. He tested positive that Monday. My boyfriend and I developed symptoms on Tuesday (congestion, sore throat, etc).  My boyfriend also had a low grade fever, I did not. I had BiNax tests at home, we took them (Tuesday). He was positive, I was negative. Two of our other friends  tested positive on Wednesday, both vaccinated as well, so I tested myself again at home on Thursday (negative again). My boyfriend still tested positive.

Tuesday-Saturday my symptoms were an extremely dry cough and sore throat, aches, sinus congestion, a headache that literally never left, and fatigue. My boyfriend had all of the same symptoms as me, though slightly worse, plus a low grade fever that lasted about 24 hours before subsiding. My boyfriend also lost taste and smell on Wednesday, however I did not.

Cut to today, I \*did\* lose all of my taste and smell, but I am feeling much better aside from that. Much less congestion, throat no longer super sore. Energy is back. Boyfriend also feels much improved today.

I never tested positive, though I'm certain I had it.  3-4 people I was in close contact with were  positive including my boyfriend who I sleep beside. I was talking with my mom (they live a few hours away from me so I have not actually spent time with them in person lately) and she said that a few weeks ago my dad's coworker (they spend a lot of time in the car together) tested positive, and a few days later my dad was displaying all of the symptoms but tested negative, the only thing he lacked was a fever.

I just wonder if \*not\* having a fever somehow lowers the chances of getting a positive Covid test result.

Objective: To determine the temporal expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in dominant follicles throughout the periovulatory period in women and the regulatory mechanisms underlying ACE2 expression in human granulosa/lutein cells (hGLC).  
  
Design: Experimental prospective clinical study and laboratory-based investigation.  
  
Setting: University Medical Center and private in vitro fertilization center.  
  
Patient(s): Thirty premenopausal women undergoing surgery for tubal ligation and 16 premenopausal women undergoing in vitro fertilization.  
  
Intervention(s): Administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and harvesting of preovulatory/ovulatory follicles by timed laparoscopy, and collection of granulosa/lutein cells and cumulus cells at the time of oocyte retrieval.  
  
Main outcome measure(s): Expression and localization of ACE2 in granulosa cells and dominant follicles collected throughout the periovulatory period of the menstrual cycle and in hGLC using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry.  
  
Result(s): ACE2 expression (mRNA and protein) is up-regulated in human ovulatory follicles after administration of hCG. ACE2 expression was higher in cumulus cells than in granulosa cells. hCG increased the expression of ACE2 in primary hGLC cultures; the increase was inhibited by RU486 (an antagonist for progesterone receptor and glucocorticoid receptor) and CORT125281 (a selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist), but not by AG1478 (an EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor) or by dexamethasone.  
  
Conclusion(s): The hormone-regulated expression of ACE2 in granulosa cells suggests a potential role of ACE2 in the ovulatory process. These data also imply the possible impact of COVID-19 on a vital cyclic event of ovarian function and thus on women's overall reproductive health. However, SAR-CoV-2 infection in ovarian cells in vivo or in vitro has yet to be determined.

[],,D-R-AZ,,,,,,[],"Abstract  
Difficulty in controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission made the ability to inactivate viruses in aerosols and fomites to be an important and attractive risk reduction measure. Evidence that light frequencies have the ability to inhibit microorganisms has already been reported by many studies which, however, focused on ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, which are known to induce potential injury in humans. In the present study, the effect on suspensions of SARS-CoV-2 of a Light Emitting Diode (LED) device capable of radiating frequencies in the non-hazardous visible light spectrum (VIS) was investigated. In order to evaluate the efficiency of viral inactivation, plaque assay and western blot of viral proteins were performed. The observed results showed a significant reduction in infectious particles that had been exposed to the LED irradiation of visible light. Furthermore, the analysis of the intracellular expression of viral proteins confirmed the inactivating effect of this irradiation technology. This in vitro study revealed for the first time the inactivation of SAR-CoV-2 through LED irradiation with multiple wavelengths of the visible spectrum. However additional and more in-depth studies can aim to demonstrate the data obtained during these experiments in different matrices, in mutable environmental conditions and on other respiratory viruses such as the influenza virus, the type of LED technology can decisively contribute on reducing virus transmission through the continuous sanitation of common environments without risks for humans and animals.

To add to that mess , we also have 16 local state governors who all want different things or outride blame the federal government for inaction so they don't have to do anything on the local level .

Theres a few things going- 

1- Like you said, politicians from one side of the aisle not hammering home the messaging of getting the vaccine. You really cant blame the other side, they've been messaging to get vaccinated the whole time.

2- The internet and most of the media is a misinformation spreader. Many Americans aren't media literate and get confused when they see all this ""conflicting information"" and don't know how to identify shitty ass sources.

What I was trying to say is that its not entirely the peoples fault that they are misinformed. The internet brings misinformation to people at alarmingly high rates and people aren't educated enough to parse out fact from fiction. Some people legitimately believe, apolitically, that the risk profiles between vaccine and no-vaccine are close or debatable and they just aren't even close. Like I said I give monoclonals to these people all the time. Most aren't partisan idiots, some genuinely believe that the benefits of getting the vaccine(improved immune response, milder symptoms, decreased hospitalization, lower morbidity) are outweighed by the risk of getting the vaccine(sore arm, chance of flu like symptoms for a day).

[],,zach7691,,,,,,[],"I mean you’re right that an ETS sidesteps the notice and comment process that comes with administrative agencies… but it would be accurate to say that an ETS is an action that is explicitly  within the Congressionally-delegated authority of an administrative agency, and the authority to determine the necessity of, and enter into, an ETS is lawfully vested in the executive. No one here is taking action that was not Constitutionally delegated to them by Congress itself.

I can certainly understand someone being of the opinion that there shouldn’t be a way to go around that process, no matter the emergency (I don’t agree with that concept, but I can fathom an argument for it), but I don’t really see how the assertion of executive fiat can hold up. No administrative body has a tool at its disposal that wasn’t explicitly granted to them (or, through judicial review, deemed to be necessarily granted to them due to some ambiguity in the law that enables their existence) by the most supreme lawmaking body in the US.

Taking that “executive fiat” logic a step further renders the entire idea of an executive branch of government, headed by one person, completely moot. A requirement of a functioning executive branch is the ability of an executive, when he or she has been granted authority to act, to so act at his discretion, for better or worse. If the concern of someone is essentially “no one person should have all that power,” well, that’s something you’ll have to take up with the Constitution, which explicitly vests a certain degree of power into one person.",,,,1636343354,{},hjrikjj,False,t3_qo743w,False,True,t1_hjrewds,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qo743w/court_temporarily_halts_biden_vaccine_testing/hjrikjj/,1636608222.0,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,[],text,t2_7o92k,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a parent of two little ones (6 and 3), I cannot wait for them to get the vaccine though. And while you’re correct that we don’t know what the vaccine will do long-term, I believe we can reasonably assume that it’s a vastly better alternative than not getting them vaccinated. My 6yo has asthma and Covid could be extremely deadly or could have life-long affects that we aren’t aware of yet. I’d much rather play the odds on a vaccine that has had almost no issues vs. the hundreds of thousands of people that have died from the virus. 

Also, for what it’s worth, I’m in my 40’s and assume I’m a good bit older than you, let me encourage you to learn that you’re going to make tons of decisions that affect them and their future, every day. So even not getting them vaccinated “yet” is a decision that is affecting them- it may not be a negative, but it is an unknown. So, I encourage you to do your best to do right by them. But I also encourage you to give yourself the grace to know that you did your best every step of the way- you made the best decisions you could with the information you had at the time.

The risks of bad outcomes from COVID even for children are not low enough yet to not care (the UK estimates 12-15% of kids 2-16 who are infected have persistent symptoms, and we know COVID damages organs and tissues); maybe that will change once all children can have the opportunity to get vaccinated. 

In the meantime, I believe we’re talking about common-sense precautions like masks in indoor public spaces, vaccinated-only indoor activities like movie theaters etc that make it safer and that most (vaccinated) people appreciate, whereas you’re inexplicably arguing that it’s unnecessary when even highly vaccinated areas have much higher infection rates than some low vaccinated countries.

[Derek Lowe](https://www.science.org/blogs/pipeline) was my go-to guy for important drug news even before the pandemic, and I learned about [Vincent Racaniello](https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/) from Reddit. (Although they've both had prodigious output with regards to COVID, I don't think they make their primary living from their science communication.)

* 24 imported symptomatic cases.
* 65 locally transmitted symptomatic cases.
* 12 imported asymptomatic cases.
* 34 locally transmitted asymptomatic cases.

Of the locally transmitted symptomatic cases, 20 were in Dalian, 16 were in Zhengzhou, 8 were in Xinji, and the rest were in a bunch of cities I won't list here. There are similar details available for the other categories of cases too.

Currently, there are 49,691 people in quarantine due to possible exposure, and a total of 1202 people with confirmed infections, 28 of whom are in serious condition.

That's just an overview of the national figures. If you read Chinese, you can get much more detailed information. For example, Beijing had one new case yesterday. [You can read](https://wap.bjd.com.cn/news/2021/11/08/10003052.shtml) about where the person lives, how he was infected, when he was tested, and when his symptoms developed. One really important thing is that this guy was already in quarantine when he first tested positive, because he was a close contact of people who recently tested positive.

Because China is set on zero CoVID, it does a huge amount of contact tracing, and we actually have a lot more detail on every case than in most countries.

CDC guidance is that people who recover from COVID may test positive on PCR tests for an extended period after recovery but are not likely to infect others:

&gt; For most people with a current laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, isolation and precautions can be discontinued 10 days after symptom onset and after resolution of fever for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing medications, and with improvement of other symptoms.

...

&gt; The likelihood of recovering replication-competent (infectious) virus is very low after 10 days from onset of symptoms, except in severely ill or immunocompromised people.

...

&gt; People who have recovered from COVID-19 may have prolonged detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. However, prolonged detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that such people are a transmission risk. Studies of patients who were hospitalized and recovered indicate that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in upper respiratory tract specimens for up to 3 months (12 weeks) after symptom onset.

&gt; Investigation of 285 “persistently SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive” adults, which included 126 adults who had developed recurrent symptoms, found no secondary infections among 790 contacts. Efforts to isolate replication-competent virus were attempted for 108 of these 285 case patients, and SARS-CoV-2 was not recovered in viral culture from any of the 108 specimens.”

[],,AliceTaniyama,,,,,,[],"&gt; It’s only a disease of the “stupid” if you caught it but didn’t do as much as you can to prevent it like getting vaccinated.

In the most recent local report I read (SoCal), my county had had, IIRC, 34 deaths over such-and-such time period (a week, I think).  27 of those were unvaccinated people, and our vaccination rate is over 80%.

Calling it a disease of the stupid is a bit overgeneralizing, but it's one of those things that's still largely true.  I wouldn't be *ashamed* to catch it, as I'm vaccinated and avoid indoor gatherings as much as possible (and I mask up for the grocery store), but the majority of the people catching it at this point are, indeed, stupid.

The tricky part is conditioning statistics on a demographic.

That 27 vs. 7 stat I mentioned?  MISLEADING, because it's an aggregate for the whole region, and vaccines are not randomly distributed.  I don't know if vaccines distribution is still skewed toward the most vulnerable populations, but it certainly was at one point.  Thus, more vulnerable people were overrepresented in the vaccinated group, while less vulnerable people were overrepresented in the unvaccinated group.

Look *just* at one risk level and look at per capita results and you get that the vaccinated are faring even better than the overall numbers show.

Though, it's also worth noting that hospitalization and death rates are reduced a lot more than case rate.  However, I'm not sure if *that* is also a statistical artifact.",,,,1636397667,{},hju4jqx,False,t3_qob75w,False,False,t1_hjm17r0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qob75w/health_care_company_cuts_ties_with_aaron_rodgers/hju4jqx/,1636659366.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,[],text,t2_bk57f,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,

So when Biden decides to start implementing a mandatory **mmmammandatory mamandatory** vaccine requirement, that just reinforces the distrust even more.

Nobody gave this much of a shit about flu spreading in the workplace, and that is basically all you contract from COVID if you have a vaccine. Also, anyone who has previously contracted COVID is at the same level if not more protected than those who are vaccinated, so it shouldn't matter if they are unvaccinated either.

The pandemic is over, and it is endemic, when year over year R0 is 1.0, without unique measures being put into place to handle different phases of the virus. 

Supposedly, in an immunologically naive and open society, R0 for Delta is 6-8, which puts R0 for AY.4.2 at 7-9.  
So people have to have immunities or behavioral changes that decrease the rate of spread by at least 86%.  

2 doses vaccines simply will not do this after a year of waning. However, the booster is seemingly crazy effective -- the US military study put Pfizer vaccine 2 disease around 55% effective after 6 months. Pfizer booster trial put the booster at 95% more effective than the 2 dose vaccine. This would mean the booster is around 97-98% effective -- depending on the boost schedule and waning dynamics, a booster could make the virus endemic without any other measures.   
There are additional measures.  
People will not all return to pre-COVID behavior. Caution may increase some, effectively lowering R0 of COVID.   
Natural immunity is basically an unknown -- studies have been kinda all over on how much protection previous infection grants, and how quickly it wanes. In the endemic scenario, we need to know how multiple reinfections affect immunities,  and we definitely don't have that info. 

Mutations and variant dynamics can change everything too. Is the sublineage of Mu that's competitive with Delta in Colombia going to get a boost in effectiveness once societies rely on vaccines instead of social measures? Mu is one of the most antibody resistant variants, and it might be suppressed by current social measured more strongly than Delta is.

The fever is an indication that your immune system is working hard on the virus (or bacteria or whatever it is that is making your immune system respond).

A positive rapid test indicates the presence of virus in the sample.

A fever doesn't have an effect on the test. 

If your immune system is not working that hard, possibly because you didn't get as much virus in you as your boyfriend, it's not going to increase your body temperature.

 Found a medical journal article from december 13 2018. The article was about record vaccination rates that year. Under 65 years of age the rate was 2% which was a record (previous season was 1,6%).

 So like I wrote it's virtually non existent. Above 65 years of age however the stats looks very different. People above 65 are recommended to take the vaccine and gets contacted about it and offered it. 41,9% above 65 had vaccinated themselves.

It has to be administered as an IV that takes an hour, so pretty much only at a hospital, but you can’t be hospitalized for covid and receive it, so it requires an outpatient IV set-up. Plus, it requires that the healthcare worker reporting covid test results or responsible for the care of the patient is aware of the option and eligibility requirements (which have been in flux and somewhat ambiguous for most of the time that these have existed) and knows to recommend it to the patient and how to get the patient to the place to receive it. It also requires that the patient has the desire and ability to get to the location and stay for more than an hour, within the timeframe in which receiving it will still be effective. I certainly would make the time and effort, but not everybody understands the benefit or has the circumstances to be able to.

Plus there are a plethora of other potential hurdles and disconnects. I’ll provide an anecdote to highlight one that I’m personally aware of:

Someone I know who is in his 70s and high risk for numerous other reasons tested positive at a local urgent care center recently. The urgent care center is a satellite of a hospital system based in a city about an hour and a half away. They asked if he wanted to receive monoclonal antibodies and he said yes. He was then told he would have to drive the hour and a half to the hospital in the other city to get them. He declined to make the trek.

Suppose you have 3 kids, and a house right.

You want your kids to get a house, and you have big cash savings for them to go to college.

Unfortunately you have cancer, or another serious illness of your choice, it will kill you in 5 years or less with treatment, although you could survive if you're lucky enough.

However, you were recently laid off and are uninsured, and even if you were it's a new treatment that could actually save your life, the version the insurance covers is certain death.


So, do you get the treatments, or die? Please keep in mind, you'll lose the house and all the college savings, and also have to declare bankruptcy. If you had a job still you might be able to cling onto the house through bankruptcy, but there's just no way you can pay anything.

If you die though, your kids are paid through college and have a house to live in, and you're certain they'll be *way* better off financially for the future if you die.

If you take the treatments, you're probably going to die anyway.

There are other ways we could set this scenario up to make you even more screwed.

For example, you might already be elderly, and in desperate need of full time care suddenly. As this was unexpected, you haven't transferred all assets out of your name to avoid them being lost, so you or your children have to pay for your massive medical bills and care. In some cases you might be saved by Medicare, but hey you might fall ill in your early 60s and be doomed to be a vegetable in a few more years, that's got something like a 25% chance of happening to me personally.

Your care is likely to slurp away tens of thousands of dollars *at the very least* from your family, and you're probably going to be suffering in some absolute shithole the whole time. Or you could stay with family and turn them into full time care givers.

[],,tractiontiresadvised,,,,,,[],"&gt; Why push false or inaccurate information? What's the motive?

One possibility: in academia, prestige drives pretty much everything. You get prestige if your work is widely publicized, if you discover something that society thinks is important, or if lots of other scientists reference your work in their later papers. Also, many people in academic positions have to publish a lot to keep their job (let alone get a promotion), so there's motivation to ""publish or perish"". A lot of people don't want to publish a study if the results were basically ""meh, we couldn't tell whether or not this thing worked"".

Another possibility: some of the people running the crappy studies may have been true believers in Ivermectin and didn't want to believe that their new favorite drug didn't actually work. Scientists and doctors aren't immune to wishful thinking any more than the rest of us.

Yet another possibility: they were sloppy and lazy.

And it could be some combination of the above as well.

For a good writeup of why people thought the drug might work in the first place, what the likely problems are, and what was good or bad about earlier trials, check out [this](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/antiviral-therapy/ivermectin/) writeup from the CDC from February. I think the #1 quote from it is this:

Not rubella, which is almost always mild for children, often asymptomatic.

The big reason all 50 states mandate the rubella vaccine for children is to protect pregnant women from getting it, which causes birth defects, miscarriage, and dead newborns.

Why not just vaccinate pregnant women only? Because like all vaccines, the rubella disease is not 100% effective; letting the disease circulate for everyone else would have continued the horrible problems for a subset of pregnant women, forever. Instead, widespread vaccination eventually slashed cases to 10/year (American travelers to other countries, generally when the vaccine fails). This compares to \~12,500,000 cases a year at the last pre-vaccine pandemic in 1964-1965.

If the argument is ""we have never mandated vaccinates for kids to protect others"", it's not really true. If you consider rubella, America has done this universally for a very long time.

If the argument is ""No COVID vaccination scheme can prevent endemic COVID"", yes, that may be true, unfortunately. If the argument is ""No COVID vaccination scheme can greatly reduce spread to protect others and save many lives"", no, that's false. Personally I don't follow what makes perfect the enemy of good.

All that being said, I'm not necessarily taking the position that there needs to be age 5-11 COVID school mandates a few days after the EUA. It wouldn't be crazy to look at data from millions of doses administered in this age group, first, and making policy decisions based on data much stronger than any possible trial.

People have been promised way more than what is feasible with current vacciantion rates. Especially, that there will be no lockdown and no significant restrictions for people which had the vaccine. That would be difficult to make work even with very high vaccination rates, because the delta variant shifts the R0 to much larger numbers. But in the current situation in South and South-Eastern Germany, we already have incidence numbers of several thousand per 100,000 for the group of unvaccinated people. It is well possible that the health system will become severely overron within the next two weeks. Which means that it is too late for extra vaccinations to prevent that. 

Models talk about between 50,000 and 200,000 additional deaths. These are only scenarios, but even the best ones do not look pretty.

And considering there are many parts of the world where people are *far* worse off than I am, I couldn't blame them for not understanding many of these concepts considering how complex modern science has become.

If we made more progress on the front of increasing access to information, I believe there would be more individuals  who would be interested in taking up the mantle of trying to educate their community, even if they are outside of the established institutions themselves (for example, despite how bad it can be in a variety of ways, YouTube still hosts a great wealth of educational videos that I would hope only continues to expand).
