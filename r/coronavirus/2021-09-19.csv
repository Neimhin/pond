I'm saying this: it's not simply being unvaccinated that makes you a murderer. It's being a willing vector. The two are not necessarily the same, but they are conflated because currently they are overwhelmingly overlapping in terms of population.
There's only one solution to our problem which is to vaccinate to prevent further backlog of the hospital systems.

The manslaughter comes in when the unvaccinated wear it as a badge of honor and willingly go out to infect other people. This HAS been recorded as happening. They are symptomatic and then they pretend they aren't because they don't want to admit they're sick.  Then they inevitably get very sick (not all but some), and take up the hospital resources.

That is what I'm trying to address. Being a living vector willingly is the problem, which in this case is highly correlated with the unvaccinated. Sometimes things happen that can't be helped, like if you did everything right (got vaccinated) and still got sick. That's fine. The difference is they are willingly hurting other people with their actions and THEN try to reap the rewards of a working hospital system.

It doesn't mean it's not a problem, but it's nowhere near the league of COVID. Influenza is endemic and occurs yearly but it doesn't kill or spread at the rate that COVID does, especially Delta. The flu's ratios are across the board less lethal and less contagious than COVID...

The situation literally evolved.
For those asymptomatic, you cannot tell if you are sick so no they wouldn't be charged. I'm not sure why you'd ask that because it's fairly obvious that you couldn't charge an asymptomatic person, but for the sake of clarity I'll answer it.
Those who willingly endanger others while knowing they are symptomatic should be charged. There should at minimum be a significant fine that scales to the amount they earn. I would therefore be for charging them with manslaughter, or at the very least punishing them instead of letting them hurt others freely.

Like you say, the willingly unvaccinated are the vast majority of the people who are taking up space in the hospital system. That is what I want to address. It's their hubris that is killing other innocent people.
I am not talking about the vaccinated dying from COVID. That's the point. I'm talking about those who have sicknesses other than COVID who are dying that are otherwise preventable but die because there is no longer any resources. And why is there no more resources? Because the wilful science deniers are clogging the system and taxing it to the max... This is simply unsustainable and it's the fault of the unvaccinated because they run amok, get deathly sick, suddenly have a change of heart, and take up all the energy that we have in our already limited healthcare system. If it simply killed them and them alone without taxing the system I would gladly let them, by all means. But unfortunately that's not how interconnected systems work.

Obviously the vaccination would prevent most cases of death and hospitalization indeed. That's a good thing. It doesn't mean there are no victims here. The true victims are the people I just mentioned: people with other health problems who need access to the hospital for non COVID reasons who no longer have access because of morons.",,,,1632095343,{},hdj1h39,False,t3_pqzlld,False,True,t1_hdisc8i,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pqzlld/covid19_hospitalizations_continue_dropping_in/hdj1h39/,,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_bzdwm,False,False,,False,4acc94491a13e2ff17c15784a8a5afb7e177b8aa,True,False,,0.0,,1632096032.0,0.0,1632150977.0,False,r/Coronavirus,public

Few weeks later went on a camping trip with a friend who became symptomatic while there, so he was for sure contagious the day before on the way up… also drove 4 hours home with him and he tested positive the next day.

Thought with delta variant and that much close space time together no way I didn’t catch it.

So self quarantined for a couple days while I got tested and nada. Got tested a week later to be sure and nothing.

Vaccines work. Out of the 6 of us on that trip only one other person ended up testing positive… they also were J&amp;J but no booster. Had a very mild case. Again anecdotal but I feel the booster saved me, planning on getting the 2nd Moderna shot as another booster in another few months figuring I’d spread out the immunity (this is not medical advice just my own decisions). 

My friend who got sick was the only one not vaccinated. And to people that think they’re young and healthy so no worries well so was he. 29 and shredded. Yeah he didn’t die but he got fucked up, missed burning man which he goes to almost every year, missed work, lost all stamina and mentally took a toll, depression and still just feels “slow”.

The reasons why we think it likely was Covid is that while I was fine, quite a few people lost taste and smell, but more importantly the older/comorbid coworkers ended up in the hospital with dropped O2 levels multiple times and the docs essentially said this is viral but we don’t know what it is, you’ll have to wait it out.

You should honestly research more and respect and understand every death from covid, despite age, underlining circumstances, and basically any factor that is moot if you take away the virus.

THEN the virus will be beaten and hopefully die out.

Measles and polio are present in parts of the world, but anywhere with the ability to vaccinate (and this doesn't take much wealth, just stable infrastructure) doesn't have them.

What will determine whether COVID is endemic or locally eliminated is how effective vaccine/infection immunity is long-term, or alternately what percentage of the population gets their annual respiratory vaccine.  These are both essentially unknowns at this point.  

The waning effectiveness of vaccines in the news doesn't tell us anything here; it's quite common for lifelong vaccinations to require several doses given over one or more years.  We know a booster shot brings immunity levels up far higher than they were after the second dose, but we don't know if they will wane at the same rate or if a larger cellular response is generated then.

&gt; keep persevering

Vaccination drives for measles have been nonstop for decades, and are now joined by flu vaccine drives.  It's a never-ending war to vaccinate people that costs almost nothing to wage.

&gt; it is good at preventing serious illness but much less at preventing infection

This is the narrative, but it's not supported by any facts.  Vaccines are extremely effective at preventing infection - 95% against wildtype for mRNA, 90-95% against alpha, 88% against Delta per UK numbers, maybe a bit lower after months.  The reduction in mortality of breakthrough Delta cases is much harder to measure since it takes a vastly larger sample, and it's still significant but not extremely so.  CFR in over-50s [in the UK](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1009243/Technical_Briefing_20.pdf) is 6% for unvaccinated, 2% for vaccinated - a good reduction, but still far from the &lt;&lt;1% we have for flu in oldest 1/3 of the population.

Of course, those two effects stack, so the protection from hospitalization/death is always going to be higher than protection from infection.

What is likely true is that antibodies (which prevent infection) are declining with time, but humoral T/B cells (which reproduce when an infection is detected) will not do so.",,,,1632111769,{'gid_1': 1},hdjy8xq,False,t3_priret,False,False,t1_hdjvz7i,/r/Coronavirus/comments/priret/georgia_professor_we_are_teaching_in_covid/hdjy8xq/,1632227851.0,29,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],[],text,t2_ii7rl,False,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Picture it, January 2021

One Sunday night, I felt like a sinus infection was brewing. No problem, I'll just take a Benadryl and get ready to ride it out. 

Monday afternoon, while painting my bedroom, I couldn't smell the paint. I said to myself ""hmm, that ain't right"". Told my ol' lady and she said "" that's strange because I can smell it, I hope you're not positive"". Later that evening, some of my taste were gone. I could only taste sweet and salty. Sour, spicy and bitter was gone. 

Tuesday morning, I took a Covid test. Later that night, the results came back positive. That's when it was ""oh sh*t!"". Reality kicked in.

Tuesday- Saturday, fever followed chills then back to fever.  Sweating then teeth chattering. Body aches and headache, sore throat &amp; inflammation from the cough. And just so tired.

By Sunday, I thought I faintly smelled some Vicks rub but wasn't sure. After a few hours, it happened again. I said to myself ""I think my smell is coming back""

Over the next few days, my taste and smell gradually started to return to normal. And the fever and chills stopped  But, I was beat, felt like a mule kicked me. It took about another 2 weeks to recover.

After that, I took another covid test and was negative. 

So far, it seems like no long term damage 🤞🏿. Everything is back to normal. 

I think the hardest part was worrying about my ol' lady. And if she got sick bc of my dumbazz.

It is extremely contagious. R0 is something like 18 (i.e., the average infected person spreads it to 18 others in a population with no prior immunity).

Measles emerged in the 10th or 11th century, likely a zoonotic infection (like COVID) that mutated from a disease called rinderpest that is found in cattle (like COVID is similar to certain other viruses found in bats). It probably went through a rapid period of mutation, producing different variants like COVID-19 has. Eventually, it became optimally adapted to spreading in humans, with certain common mutations occurring.

It hasn't changed much since then because further mutations make it less contagious or otherwise spread less. Basically, it already has all of the most serious mutations.

Israel has large chunks of its population unvaccinated and still uninfected.  That's a pandemic problem, not an endemic one - endemic situation only begins when enough people have been exposed for the first time.

Once we have enough vaccine doses (50-100 days to reach a reasonable level of worldwide vaccination) here's no need for any measures other than vaccination.  But countries that have no prior infection at all will need a much higher level of vaccination to prevent spread.

The endgame is going to vary greatly by country.  China with closed borders and 70% of its population fully vaccinated will simply suppress with test and tracing.  Bhutan (pop 750k) with 95% of the adult population having heterologous vaccination and porous borders, hasn't had a case in nearly a month.  

Denmark with 74% of the full population fully vaccinated (plus some amount of immunity infection) has falling cases after fully reopening.  But if we believe that Delta could remain endemic in Denmark, then at some point the reproductive rate is going to rise again there.  What would cause that?  They haven't even reached the point of boosters yet, which we know makes the vaccine far more effective than it is after the second dose.  The situation is similar in Spain and Portugal - high vaccination rates and quickly falling cases.  It's true in many (not all) states in India, though of course there it's nearly all from infection - but they're vaccinating people who had prior infection, which we know gives a dramatically high level of immunity.

Countries without any prior infection immunity are going to have it much harder.  You need not only a high level of vaccination to end fast positive exponential growth, but you need those vaccinations to be fairly evenly spread (heterogeneous) so that there aren't clumps of population in which the virus can freely spread.  This is what's seen in both Israel (where there are clumps of antivax religious groups) and entirely differently in the UK (where they've vaccinated nearly nobody under 18) - but those countries have at least some prior infection in those groups.

But as long as unmitigated spread would cause hospital collapse in your country, the pandemic/epidemic isn't over there.  Many other countries are still far from that point - though again, we're only a few months from a surplus of vaccines being available.",,,,1632119073,{},hdk8td2,False,t3_priret,False,False,t1_hdk6wzo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/priret/georgia_professor_we_are_teaching_in_covid/hdk8td2/,,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_ii7rl,False,False,,False,75621612a4d56cf1cf79b8e6498f5bc8fc71716a,True,False,,0.0,,1632119417.0,0.0,1632147491.0,False,r/Coronavirus,public

I'd wake up each day feeling the best I'd feel all day. Then hour by hour I'd feel worse. Take a long nap at some point and feel kinda better after. That CPAP helping me breath helped so much.

Once the meds helped with the bronchitis it was a cruel trick. ""Wow I feel better"" then I'd try and do a load of laundry and be exhausted.

I've always known chiropractic to not be based on any proper evidence in its foundation, and also not be a medical science—furthermore, I'm relatively sure chiropractors themselves are not medical doctors. That's more along the lines of what I meant! 

To say people benefit from going there might totally be true, but people will swear by things like homeopathy as well.  Naturally, as there are crazy GPs, there are some sane chiropractors. Some of their treatments likely include medically valid techniques, which yield proper results.

I'm indeed not US-based. I wouldn't bring up health insurance as any sort of proof to its validity, however, as over here (universal health care) insurance pays for a multitude of alternative medicine-based treatments, which doesn't exactly rid those 'treatments' of their pseudoscience-label. Things like ""holistic energy healing"" are covered, to give an example.

Ultimately, it seems like they're (at best) physiotherapists' worse cousin. Definitely not trying to start shit, however, but I believe the dislike from the medical community isn't ungrounded.

In January of this year the government put in place a 100 year confidentiality on our president’s vaccination card. They said it was to guard his “intimacy, privacy, honor and image”.

Coincidentally (or not) January was also when  Brazil started vaccinating its population.

He has been a stark protester against the Covid vaccine. It wouldn’t surprise me if he DID vaccinate and put the confidentiality in place so he could keep his anti-vax image. 

Hell, it wouldn’t surprise me if he skipped ahead in line and got vaccinated in January, when only elderly and medical professional were being vaccinated.

Nowadays he claims that he will be “[the last Brazilian to be vaccinated](https://oglobo.globo.com/politica/bolsonaro-diz-que-so-decidira-se-tomara-vacina-depois-que-ultimo-brasileiro-for-vacinado-24952199)”",,,,1632138458,{},hdkvvyo,False,t3_prptyu,False,False,t3_prptyu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prptyu/jair_bolsonaro_defiantly_unvaccinated_will_test/hdkvvyo/,1632246970.0,60,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_i0aab,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This seems like a weird middle ground to me because one shot is estimated to reduce the chance of contracting covid if you are exposed by just 55%.

Bottom line for me is that kids are at very little risk from getting sick from covid. Vaccinations may help reduce spread but it's far more important that adults get vaccinated.

This comes a day after the city’s teachers’ union, the United Federation of Teachers, called for weekly testing.

&gt; In another significant shift, the city is changing its quarantine policy for unvaccinated students. Previously, the education department had said all unvaccinated and asymptomatic students in a classroom with a positive case would have to quarantine for 10 days, although older students could provide a negative test result to return to school on day 7. Now, unvaccinated students will not have to quarantine when there is a positive case in the class unless they were unmasked and less than three feet apart.

Studies in adults are showing persistent changes to cardiac and pulmonary tissues, even in seemingly mild cases. This could very well negatively impact my kids’ lives forever. So, no I don’t want to go out and potentially expose them (more like definitely expose them given the state of affairs here) when I don’t have to. 

Case numbers in kids are up 240% during this recent surge. Unfortunately that means more kids are going to die. 
  
And your comment about car crashes… yeah driving is a risk. But that’s why we take risk reduction strategies like using child restraints and maxing out rear facing limits on car seats. Unfortunately my children can’t really partake in covid risk reduction strategies because they’re not old enough to mask or get vaccinated. And since adults in this country are largely selfish and also won’t take part in such strategies then I’m doing the responsible thing by shielding my kids.

&gt; When the trials were announced 6 months ago, both Moderna and Pfizer said the trials were designed to use immunobridging or correlates of protection to infer efficacy, and would *not* use a comparison of positive cases between treatment and placebo arms. This has been well understood by the FDA and should not come as a surprise to anyone. 


I'm aware of that, and I'm sure Pfizer/Moderna are very eager to get these approved. The FDA, to my knowledge, has not said anything about whether or not antibody titers alone are sufficient to approve the vaccine, particularly in the wake of Delta. If you have a source for that, please let me know and I'm happy to increase my optimism!

&gt;As for what is defined as an ""emergency"" I suppose you could ask the states seeing the highest number of pediatric covid cases to date and running out of beds in their children's hospitals. If a respiratory pathogen with an R0 upwards of 7,  sweeping through school districts across the nation as we speak, and causes disease severe enough to result in the hospitalization of 1 in 100 kids isn't an ""emergency"" in your view, then I'd like to know what does meet the criteria.


I mean, this is on par with chicken pox or measles, and neither of those vaccines had EUAs. I wish I knew more about what the hospitalization situation was like in hot spot states. I can tell you when my state was at it's peak, the vast majority of ""COVID hospitalizations"" were picked up on asymptomatic screens, and the patients were not there with respiratory failure as the underlying reason for their hospitalization. I did see some really sick kids with MIS-C, but it's still pretty rare.

[],,Tinyfishy,,,,,,[],"Yes! Dr Poland makes this point well in his talks. I highly recommend them. I guess a better question is: Is the rate of vaxxed in the hospital going up beyond what we would expect with the number and demographics vaccinated? (because we know higher risk people sought out the vax more, so they make up a greater percentage, but we still expect them to do a bit worse than the average vaxxed person). Also: if there is excess breakthrough, is that due to waning immunity or due to evasive variants?  And then, of course, the experts have to weigh risk and benefits, even if so far the risks from the vax have been small. So a small uptick in excess vaxxed hospitalization may not justify boosters for everyone.     
‘Team vaccine’ has to follow and accept the science too. Even when it is complicated, subtle, and not as reassuring as we would like. There are going to be breakthrough infections and we need to be scientific about how we handle and understand that. And we want the govt agencies to stick to the science and not hand out vaccines and treatments willy nilly, but to weigh risk/benefit properly.       
I’m betting that most of the ‘extra’ breakthrough cases, if any, are people like me who are immune compromised in some way. That group was not included in the original studies, so when you add us to the mix, bang, you get more ‘unexpected’ breakthroughs.    I expect     
‘Ordinary’ people without severely immune compromising situations are probably well protected and don’t need to clamor for more shots that may not help them improve their chances anyways.           It might be that other methods would achieve  better hospitalization rates with less risk, like getting everyone vaccinated (less spread, though not zero, darnit), or masking whenever feasible for awhile, or…?       
But, this is all speculation from a stranger on the internet, so people should talk to their doctors and check out the info from the experts. But I’d be interested to see the stats I mentioned above and I’d like to see more public education around what is expected and normal to help people be calm and advocate for the right next moves.

While this long-term efficiency stuff wasn't necessarily going to be clear right away, it was obvious from the beginning that JJ was inferior to Moderna and Pfizer. We should have allowed people to get that information and weigh it against one shot vs. two shots, instead of just bullying people into getting JJ when it was their only option *at the time,* when Pfizer/Moderna would have become available in like 3 weeks, and now they are SOL with 0 booster options and far diminished immunity. Oh yeah, and that brief scare that they would get blood clots.

Agreed that Pfizer/Moderna likely isn't that significant, but there is a small portion of the country that does have this third option JJ shot that nobody wants to talk about. I really empathize with the family members that we set up to get a JJ shot, telling them it was the same, and now they have this inferior option when almost everyone else they know was able to get Moderna/Pfizer.

beyond this, it would be worth considering not ""death"" versus ""life"" as the result of covid but anything that keeps you out of the gym for weeks and/or impedes your progress long term. you can find a lot of those percentages online if you're willing to take some time to look. you can do your own research and see how big the risk is of screwing over all your hard work.

The difference is, getting the vaccine is your own choice and getting the virus is a possibility, not a certainty.

[],,buttercupcake23,,,,,,[],"I mean we could have waited, sure. But that was a risk because like you said it takes time to vaccinate and the longer and MORE people remain unvaxxed the bigger the risk. And the thing is, a lot of people waited and that's...bad. And even still some refuse to get in the lifeboats. That's a big part of the problem, it's not a reason to say we should have vaccinated even more slowly. But at the time all we saw was people, ocean, lifeboats. We expected people would get in the lifeboats that were available and from the initial wave, expected that there might even be shortages because when that first wave of boats came out and we prioritized the at risk, elderly, bad swimmers and all that the wait was insane. There actually weren't enough boats at that point.

But then there were more boats for the second stage of general public and it wasn't crazy to think there might also be a limited supply of boats available. We didn't know there'd be a fuck ton of anti life boaters who preferred sharks to boats and that there would in fact be plenty of boats. And while yeah it was always going to take months to get everyone in a boat why would we exacerbate that timeline and cause it to be even longer by suggesting people wait?

Also, nobody was forced to take the JJ - it was encouraged that you take whatever was available but nobody was actually forced. The recommendation at the time based on the science was: these are good at preventing death, all the vaccines are good at it, take any. Before delta that was true. But even still, if people had WANTED to wait or go get a different one, that's a choice they could have made. If you had wanted to wait for a fancier boat and risk the sharks, that was a choice you had. The advice and it was good advice was to get what you could because we didn't know what might be available and you might have waited months for the right one. Just like now we are getting info moderna might be better but the advice for anyone unvaxxed is still, just get vaxxed. If your town only has Pfizer, get Pfizer, don't wait til god knows when for the next moderna shipment when the danger is here now.

The other thing is, it might well be that plenty of people who did get the vaccine instead of waiting are now angry about it but I bet it also saved any number of people's lives who might just never realize it. Just like maybe right now you're in a rickety boat having to row to shore and you're mad that a bunch of other people got nicer boats but you don't realize that had you stayed in the water for another day there was a shark about to eat you. You'd never know. Hindsight in these situations is a questionable thing.

Like I said I think JJ people need to be included and helped right now. It's awful that they're neglecting some 14 million people. I imagine there's some lacking information that is causing the delay but I think there's enough evidence in other countries to show you could probably give everyone with JJ a booster of Pfizer or moderna and it'd be fine but the fact that they aren't even discussing it is very frustrating and I understand why you feel angry about it.",,,,1632156072,{},hdlxwl1,False,t3_prt70z,False,True,t1_hdlswy6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prt70z/big_gap_between_pfizer_moderna_vaccines_seen_for/hdlxwl1/,1632268358.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_hy28t,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vaccine developed in mid 2020 is VERY effective at preventing squares and circles from infecting a host, yet not nearly as effective against novel triangles which emerged late 2020. Triangles will thrive, will spread among the vaccinated as well, and will quickly become the dominant variant.  We call these breakthrough cases.  So no, it's not *random* when taken across millions of individuals and millions of infections who each have a unique circumstance and many mutations across those.   Eventually that selective pressure forces the unsuccessful variants out because the dominant variants have been selected for, which is largely due to vaccination and natural herd immunity. 

  ""Virulence"" only matters if you define it - virulent against the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, AZ etc., natural antibodies, or against the unvaxxed? Or all three?  Or some permutation of each? Variants each have different virulence against each of these, you'd need a table to define it.  We 100% know with certainty that Delta leads to many more breakthrough cases among the vaccinated than other variants, which makes it more virulent against both the vaccinated, the unvaccinated, and those who may have natural immunity due to contracting Sars-CoV2 and building antibodies.  Variants emerge and become dominant *because* they resist herd immunity, not the other way around.  It's like animal populations exploding with a food source and no/few natural predators, after another predator (e.g. natural/vaccine immunity) killed off their food-competition yet has no interest/efficacy against them.

The vaccine developed in mid 2020 is VERY effective at preventing squares and circles from infecting a host, yet not nearly as effective against novel triangles which emerged late 2020. Triangles will thrive, will spread among the vaccinated as well, and will quickly become the dominant variant.  We call these breakthrough cases.  So no, it's not *random* when taken across millions of individuals and millions of infections who each have a unique -- eventually that selective pressure forces the unsuccessful variants out because the dominant variants have been selected for. 

  ""Virulence"" only matters if you define it - virulent against the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, AZ etc., natural antibodies, or against the unvaxxed? Or all three?  Or some permutation of each? Variants each have different virulence against each of these, you'd need a table to define it.  We 100% know with certainty that Delta leads to many more breakthrough cases than other variants, which makes it more virulent against both the vaccinated, the unvaccinated, and those who may have natural immunity due to contracting Sars-CoV2 and building antibodies.  Variants emerge and survive *because* they resist herd immunity, not the other way around.

First, the FDA is not the science. The research is. The FDA can be wrong, they are only people. Now, they should absolutely be respected as a high authority on science. They should absolutely be the default position. However, a group of scientists should not be blindly followed. The reason people try to say it should be is because the average person doesn't understand how to do science without merely listening to the scientists. Most people don't read the research papers, and the ones that do often go in with strong biases searching for the one line that confirms their hypothesis instead of the several that reject it. However, just because the average person doesn't understand science doesn't mean that average people can't have legitimate complaints about what groups of scientists say.

Second, the FDA does not do science about a particular individual, they do science to best suit a population. These two differ and that distinction matters, particularly when discussing an EUA that is about whether individual people should be allowed to take an action. I read an interesting comment that talked about a war situation where 80% of troops were being killed in air attacks and 20% on land. All of the advice you would hear from the government would be about minimizing losses from air attacks, but if you were somewhere that was unreachable by air, then you would be stupid to follow that advice and instead you should be figuring out how to protect yourself from a land attack. This is a similar situation where the FDA's advice is focused on the majority of the population but some people will be in situations not considered by the FDA and to follow the science should actually follow advice more tailored to their situation.

The last time I saw so much ""why aren't people listening to the science"" complaints was when they were telling people to not bother wearing masks when Delta was approaching. While most people will say this was wrong, in a way it wasn't. At the time, Delta hadn't hit yet, so there was a brief window where the risk of not wearing a mask was pretty low. For the community, the benefits of wearing the mask were small, compared to the ""risks"" of them being annoying. I wore a mask at this time. Was I ""as bad as an antivaxxer""? No, I simply recognized that my individual situation, where I don't mind wearing a mask and very much mind an infection with COVID, meant that the communal science they had done didn't fit my individual risk profile. I'd rather have extra protection, but still recognized that the science they had done was valid.

Third, this is a very different situation then the hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin issues because for those there was little evidence that they had any positive effects. Boosters, on the other hand, have a massive amount of evidence of positive effects and this panel does not deny that. In this case, the issue is not the question of positive effects, but rather the question of negative effects potentially causing the benefits to be smaller than the risks. In the case where there are no positive effects, then there is no positive situation, however, in the case where there are positive effects but also risks, then someone already in a risky situation might have a different individual risk profile.

Fourth, this committee has publicly announced that they are ignoring a benefit of the boosters - spread. I don't have a degree in epidemiology, but I do have one in math. In something growing exponentially, cutting that growth factor by a mere 4% can easily cut the result by a quarter. As such, it is quite mathematically possible that if boosters were openly encouraged and 40% of the population took them, and they only decreased the spread by 10%, that we could drastically cut down cases, hospitalizations, and deaths by a quarter. The other issue with spread is vaccinated people spreading it to people in their lives who are unable to get vaccinated. However, the FDA has openly announced that they are only considering hospitalizations and deaths. They are likely doing this for two reasons: spread is hard to quantify, and they are not supposed to be looking at communal effects, but rather whether boosters benefit the individual taking them. As such, someone living with a person who is immunocompromised might have a different individual risk profile beyond what the FDA is considering. My point is that when complaining that people ""aren't following the science,"" you should be aware of potential limitations to the science being discussed.

Fifth, the FDA is a bunch of humans, and humans are all biased. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue, scientists try very hard to be unbiased and they are aware of many of their biases and have found clever ways such as randomized placebo controlled trials. However, in this case, two of these scientists have openly stated that they have very strong biases that boosters are bad due to a world wide communal view. The FDA was supposed to solely investigate whether or not the benefits would outweigh the risks for an individual. Did they do that? I'm honestly not sure. The two scientists writing that for that journal article in the Lancet have done the worst possible things they could have done, they have caused an appearance of bias. If this was a court of law, they would have had to recuse themselves, yet they did not. Honestly, I was fine with them resigning over Biden promising boosters, that wasn't okay either and was politics before science. However, the article made it clear that these two view that the ends justify the means, and that is a position incongruent with science which should seek the truth even if the ends don't suit you. I am glad that these two are resigning from the FDA, yet they had a hand in the vote yesterday and opened up the question of how many more of these scientists in the panel also view that the ends justify the means.",,,,1632090308,{'gid_2': 1},hdiqcy1,False,t3_prbi39,False,False,t1_hdibdj1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prbi39/key_data_on_us_jj_moderna_covid19_boosters_weeks/hdiqcy1/,1632205817.0,49,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,2,[],[],text,t2_llftk,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;While Altmann suspects that boosting with mRNA-based vaccines such as Pfizer and Moderna – which sneak mRNA containing the instructions to make the Covid-19 spike protein into cells, showing them what to look out for – work well, he does have mild concerns about the wisdom of boosting with another kind – the viral vector.  
In contrast, vaccines like the Oxford/AstraZeneca rely on a virus – in this case, a chimpanzee adenovirus – to smuggle the code for the Covid-19 spike protein into our bodies. And there's a theoretical possibility that reinfecting yourself with an (inactivated) virus several times could be a bad idea.  
""We've never been there before… there's quite a big chance that you're going to induce inhibitory antibodies against the vaccine itself, and stop the vaccine working,"" says Altmann, who explains he's curious to know whether the UK's vaccine advisory committee – the JCVI – have taken this into consideration.

Q: Do I need a booster shot if I received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine?

A: It is likely that those who received the J&amp;J vaccine will also be recommended for a booster. We expect more data in the next few weeks and will keep the public informed.

Yes, I would be for doctors turning away a person dying of influenza who has not taken the influenza vaccine if all else was held constant.

If this was the 1918 pandemic but in modern times (COVID kind of is, different illness though) then... yes. Why would it be different? In pandemics resource management is even more crucial.

Maybe in normal times we wouldn't turn away a person but you seem to be forgetting that horribly virulent pandemics with overrun resources are not normal times.

This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions. However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

And if you're the pessimist and think some adverse effects are being hidden from us by our public health people, you can be assured that Pfizer would call out Moderna if they were hiding something and vice-versa.

One problem is that us laypeople have incredible access to the data which is out there, but don't have the experience to put it into context.  Take a look at Open Vaers.  They post raw data from after-vaccination reports of various adverse effects, without adding the kind of context that needs to go along with it.  Researchers use Vaers to determine if any particular adverse effect could be linked to vaccinations, but they do it by comparing the normal rate to the post vax rate after vetting the data carefully.  This website doesn't explain that and worse it draws a direct link to things like miscarriages or death to being vaccinated.

Tell the school that they have symptoms, keep them home for two days. Tell them you've gotten the kids tested at the end of the first day. On the afternoon of the second day, take them to get tested.

There is significant spread in the school and you can make adjustments so your kid is not there. 

Or 

The one kid is quarantined and nobody else gets sick. 

If your kids are positive, hey, you caught it early and maybe prevented some spread to others. If it's negative, you maybe prevented your kid from getting it.

I doubt the vast majority of vaccinated have none of those issues by the experience I had with this unless my group has extremely bad luck, which is statistically unlikely. Of the 6 people in my circle that got the virus (all breakthrough cases), all young, healthy and vaccinated, only 1 got it to a degree I would say is very mild (just some tiredness, sneezing and that's it), the others endured a miserable week. Of all the people I know that got infected last year (pretty big sample of 30-40 people) only a handful had it with almost no symptoms, the rest (who were office workers in their 20s-30s) got absolutely wrecked and some even got to ICU, luckily none died (but this was before the vaccine).

As for your question, if things stayed like this I'd cut ny hangouts significantly to not getting others sick. I admit until recently I thought differently, I hanged out much more because I thought at last, if I or anyone else vaccinated got it, it would be no big deal just some sneezes, so the pandemic for us was pretty much over, but it's still super nasty, and the people at the house all had a complete flip flop on their perspective (I'm not anti vax, but really, the vaccine should provide more protection than this, we were all shocked as such a breakthrough massive infection shouldn't happen and if it did it should be much milder). I care that random strangers don't get it, as a collective I care about them more than myself. 

The only reason this won't happen in practice is that I'm getting immunization just after this and it should last roughly a year. So I will hang out normally as I can't carry the virus and get anyone sick. In a year there should be better vaccines and treatment methods, so when the immunity runs down it may be that the average experience is now indeed mild. If that was the case I would keep hanging out knowing the risk is low, even if I got it again. But if the virus keeps mutitating and eluding our treatments, and symptoms were still as bad, I'd have to go back to cut my hangouts until that happens.

Regarding local elimination, does your point hold true for something like a respiratory illness? And if so, how come no countries in the world have successfully been able to sustainably achieve it. Australia is an island and we have all but completely halted international travel and put in place incredibly strict/draconian laws to try to prevent the spread and it has still found a way.  Countries like Israel are well and truly onto their third shot and case numbers are as high as ever. Unless there is some break through discovery of a much better vaccine I don't see how this doesn't become endemic worldwide like the flu.

I support a continued drive to improve the situation through vaccinations (provided there is no coercion involved) but I'm not sure there will be much appetite in the community for the other measures that have thus far been used (moving universities online, lockdowns, etc) and perhaps that brings us back to the OP's original question - what's the end game?

1)  Brother dead from heart attack.  Was unable to get checkup when he started feeling off.

2) Sister in law dead from COVID after catching COVID at my brothers funeral.

3)  Daughter had a medical emergency.  Was having convulsions and was in agony with a gut blockage.  Sat outside the ER for hours before she was seen.  Needed to be checked in but no rooms.  Finally got a room about 18 hours after we went to the hospital.

Those hours of being with her in agony were torture.  

4)  Laid off right before pandemic started.  Have decided to retire as over 60 and daughter is immunocompromised.  Its not really the plan, but you make do.

5)  I feel like a lock in patient.  No vacations, trips to bars, Christmas celebrations with family, birthday parties, flights etc etc.  I hate this shit, but with my daughter I need to be responsible.

[],,bubbuty,,,,,,[],"American Samoa reported its first coronavirus case, 18 months into the pandemic, after a traveler tested positive after flying to the U.S. territory from Hawaii.
The positive case was discovered during a quarantine period required upon arrival in American Samoa. The traveler was fully vaccinated, according to a news release published Friday by American Samoa’s Department of Homeland Security, and the positive result was confirmed by the Health Department Thursday. Officials say the individual tested negative before traveling. The traveler was asymptomatic when tested, according to the news release, and will continue to be monitored.
“The discovery of this positive case during quarantine highlights the importance of why our process is critical to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” Gov. Lemanu Mauga (D) said in a statement. “It further highlights the importance of maintaining our current quarantine protocols.” Mauga was among the passengers on the Monday flight from Hawaii and is in quarantine, according to the Associated Press.
What you need to know about the highly contagious delta variant
Gabor Kelen, director of Johns Hopkins University’s Department of Emergency Medicine, told The Washington Post it was surprising that American Samoa was able to evade the coronavirus as long as it did. The “covid zero” approach, in which countries such as Australia mandated lockdowns, hotel quarantines and other measures to stamp out transmission, probably is not possible in the long term, he said.
“Can any nation, entity, territory, forever and ever evade coronavirus? I think that answer is almost for sure no,” Kelen said. Noting that Australia has had outbreaks despite its early success, he added, “Think of it almost like a pressure cooker. As soon as you release the valve just a little, it’s over.”
The infected traveler was an America Samoa resident who had traveled to Hawaii and to the U.S. mainland, according to the Associated Press. The passenger returned Monday, the first day that commercial flights from Honolulu to Pago Pago had resumed since last year.
According to the World Health Organization coronavirus tracker last updated Friday, American Samoa had reported no confirmed coronavirus cases, but it was not clear why that was so.
Story continues below advertisement

In a news conference on Friday, American Samoa Health Department epidemiologist Aifili John Tufa said the traveler had tested negative before flying back home. He said it’s possible the traveler was “exposed at any time traveling from the mainland, and the time that they were in Hawaii.”
“It’s very hard for us to pinpoint exactly where the exposure happened at this point,” he said. “But we know for sure that the processes we have in place are working. This passenger, their positive result was caught in quarantine.” Officials said the person was moved to isolation.
The coronavirus pandemic in the voices of those who lived it
Lin Chen, director of the Travel Medicine Center at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass., and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, said the positive report in American Samoa shows that protocols like testing and quarantine upon arrival can pick up positive cases, even if tests before departure were negative.
Story continues below advertisement

“It does show we cannot let our guard down,” Chen said, adding, “Testing is still important, even with full vaccination.” She said even the fully vaccinated should think about getting themselves tested before and after travel even if it’s not required by the destination.
In a post in late August, the American Samoa Health Department posted an infographic on social media, outlining its travel guidelines and noting that it was monitoring travelers. It notes that three negative PCR test results are required before departure, at 10 days and five days before departure as well as 48 hours before.
Hawaiian Airlines announced this month that it would resume nonstop flights between Honolulu and the U.S. territory on Monday, service that had been suspended since March 2020.
Story continues below advertisement
The airline, which said in a statement that it “provides the only regularly scheduled air link between the two island chains,” had paused the service for 17 months at the request of the American Samoa government. Repatriation flights had resumed this year to bring thousands of residents to American Samoa who had been stranded elsewhere during the pandemic, the airline said.
Tracking the worldwide spread of coronavirus cases and deaths
The report of American Samoa’s first positive case leaves a dozen countries, regions and territories that had reported no coronavirus cases, according to the World Health Organization. Several “zero covid” claims are viewed with skepticism. Many experts doubt North Korea would acknowledge an outbreak, and reports suggest that Turkmenistan, another country that denies having coronavirus cases, is experiencing a wave of infections, according to BBC News.
Chen said the new infection in American Samoa may suggest the coronavirus is present in other places that have yet to report cases. “It may be circulating, it may be there already, and we just don’t know it yet,” she said.

Kelen said immunity — either through a huge number of people being vaccinated or the virus moving “through a lot of people” — is the only way out of the pandemic. He said that it is too difficult to contain, and that borders cannot stay closed forever. “No country can lock this thing down,” he said.
In American Samoa, just over 48 percent of the population is fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, compared to nearly 55 percent of the total U.S. population, according to tracking by The Washington Post.",,,,1632136256,{},hdkso10,False,t3_prpwnb,False,False,t1_hdkpwb4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prpwnb/american_samoa_one_of_the_last_places_without/hdkso10/,1632245165.0,25,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_hoc8j1u,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,ParadiseLosingIt,,,,,,[],"“Jamie Azar left a rehab hospital in Tennessee this week with the help of a walker after spending the entire month of August in the ICU and on a ventilator. She had received a shot of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine in mid-July but tested positive for the coronavirus within 11 days and nearly died.

Now Azar, who earns about $36,000 a year as the director of a preschool at a Baptist church in Georgia, is facing thousands of dollars in medical expenses that she can’t afford.
“I’m very thankful to be home. I am still weak. And I’m just waiting for the bills to come in to know what to do with them,” she said Wednesday, after returning home.

In 2020, as the pandemic took hold, U.S. health insurance companies declared they would cover 100 percent of the costs for covid treatment, waiving co-pays and expensive deductibles for hospital stays that frequently range into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

But this year, most insurers have reinstated co-pays and deductibles for covid patients, in many cases even before vaccines became widely available. The companies imposed the costs as industry profits remained strong or grew in 2020, with insurers paying out less to cover elective procedures that hospitals suspended during the crisis.
Now the financial burden of covid is falling unevenly on patients across the country, varying widely by health-care plan and geography, according to a survey of the two largest health plans in every state by the nonprofit and nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.
If you’re fortunate enough to live in Vermont or New Mexico, for instance, state mandates require insurance companies to cover 100 percent of treatment. But most Americans with covid are now exposed to the uncertainty, confusion and expense of business-as-usual medical billing and insurance practices — joining those with cancer, diabetes and other serious, costly illnesses.
(Insurers continue to waive costs associated with vaccinations and testing, a pandemic benefit the federal government requires.)

A widow with no children, Azar, 57, is part of the unlucky majority. Her experience is a sign of what to expect if covid, as most scientists fear, becomes endemic: a permanent, regular health threat.

The carrier for her employee health insurance, UnitedHealthcare, reinstated patient cost-sharing Jan. 31. That means, because she got sick months later, she could be on the hook for $5,500 in deductibles, co-pays and out-of-network charges this year for her care in a Georgia hospital near her home, including her ICU stay, according to estimates by her family. They anticipate she could face another $5,500 in uncovered expenses next year as her recovery continues.
Bills related to her stay at the out-of-network rehab hospital in Tennessee could climb as high as $10,000 more, her relatives have estimated, but they acknowledged they were uncertain this month what exactly to expect, even after asking UnitedHealthcare and the providers.

“We still don’t know where the numbers will land because the system makes the family wait for the bills,” said Azar’s sister, Rebecca Straub.
UnitedHealthcare declined to comment specifically about Azar’s situation unless she signed a blanket waiver allowing release of all her health records — which she declined.
In general, a person with Azar’s type of plan would have an in-network deductible of $1,500 and an in-network out-of-pocket maximum of $4,000, said UnitedHealthcare spokeswoman Tracey Lempner in an email. Lempner declined to say what a patient’s out-of-network, out-of-state share would be at the Tennessee rehab hospital.
She did not respond directly to a question about why UnitedHealthcare chose Jan. 31 to stop waiving deductibles and co-pays for covid treatment.”",,,,1632135440,{},hdkrjht,True,t3_prsd6m,False,True,t3_prsd6m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prsd6m/no_more_free_hospital_care_for_the_unvaccinated/hdkrjht/,1632244502.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_4d5f321k,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s not very controversial though?  It’s just what you’d expect when vaccines work extremely well (but not quite perfectly) and you manage to get incredibly high vaccination in the high risk groups.   

Imagine a population that is 95% vaccinated (rest are anti-vaxxers).  So 20 times more vaccinated people than unvaccinated ones.   If your vaccine is perfectly effective none of them end up in hospital.   If your vaccine is 95% effective, they are 20 times less likely than an unvaccinated person to end up in hospital.  Still amazing.   But remember there were 20 times more vaccinated people, so for every anti-vaxxer in hospital there’s also one unlucky fully vaccinated person.

That’s basically the case in Israel.   They don’t have anywhere near 95% of their entire population vaccinated but they do have very high rates in the most at risk groups.

Productivity growth is exponential, but it's a slow exponential-- during that time, food supply growth was in fact slower than population growth. The British avoided a Malthusian crisis at home by outsourcing the misery to Ireland; European powers followed suit, and imperialism was born.

Birth control is the main reason we're not experiencing a Malthusian crisis now. As women become more educated and have more autonomy over their bodies and reproductive destinies, population growth slows, and this is a good thing for a number of reasons... for the first time in our history, world economic growth outpaces population growth... but that's not a law of physics, and there are a number of conditions that could make it not the case... which we should be very afraid of.

Malthus was pretty gross. He considered birth control and abortion (""moral vice"") to be as bad as famine and war, and with that I staunchly disagree... but he was not incorrect on the observation that, from the dawn of civilization to about 1850 AD, human populations have grown faster than economic resources could accommodate then.",,,,1632143149,{},hdl43xf,False,t3_prcmti,False,False,t1_hdkig6m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prcmti/covid19s_official_worldwide_death_toll_is_45m/hdl43xf/,1632251660.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_4ocdf,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Two doses of either vaccine still provided at least the same level of protection as having had COVID-19 before through natural infection; people who had been vaccinated after already being infected with COVID-19 had even more protection than vaccinated individuals who had not had COVID-19 before.

However, Delta infections after two vaccine doses had similar peak levels of virus to those in unvaccinated people; with the Alpha variant, peak virus levels in those infected post-vaccination were much lower.

Professor Sarah Walker, Professor of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology at the University of Oxford and Chief Investigator and Academic Lead for the COVID-19 Infection Survey, said: ‘We don’t yet know how much transmission can happen from people who get COVID-19 after being vaccinated – for example, they may have high levels of virus for shorter periods of time.

‘But the fact that they can have high levels of virus suggests that people who aren’t yet vaccinated may not be as protected from the Delta variant as we hoped. This means it is essential for as many people as possible to get vaccinated – both in the UK and worldwide.’""

The FDA may have a hard time issuing the EUA in the coming weeks with the data we have now, and I wouldn't at all be surprised if they ask for more.

[],,DiabolicallyRandom,,,,,,,"&gt;So you’re smarter than the two leaders of the fda vaccine research who resigned over this very thing. Their concern over boosting. Who to boost. And the problem of boosting against alpha and not new and future strains?


I thought we were talking about pediatric vaccines here?

And they didn't resign *because* of that. They were already resigning - and ADDITIONALLY - the entire FDA panel voted in unison with those two people this past week - so if they actually resigned ""in protest"" it makes them look pretty fucking idiotic, hmm?

I like how you link to a bunch of politically charged news sites with grandstanding articles, and not a single scientific article, and conveniently ignore the ACTUAL outcome of the recent FDA advisory panel meeting - where astutely, the FDA advisory panel approved boosters for 65+ and those who are high risk - but didn't approve them for younger populations *yet* - and even mentioned that once the EUA is approved for this group, it will be easier to come back around and approve boosters for all ages once more data is available.

&gt;Prof Helen Colhoun, of the University of Edinburgh, said: ""The fact that we see an increase in protection from the first to the second dose gives hope that a third dose might increase protection further.""

The vaccines (ALL of them, but most effectively the mRNA vaccines that generate spike proteins) incontrovertibly reduces negative outcomes from infection of *any* strain or variant of SARS-CoV-2. Period. Additionally, they also reduce the ability of sustained infections. This is 100% supported by the data from across the world and across populations. 

It is precisely the decision-making of anti-vaccine and anti-mask individuals that has directly lead to increased spread and variant viability, by providing a more rapid and easy infection vector.

This is the basic science of RNA virus' and how they operate.

RNA virus' will ALWAYS rapidly develop variants (see influenza).

You are showing a fundamental misunderstanding of how vaccines operate. No vaccine, ever, for any virus or pathogen prefects the virus from attempting to infect. In fact, in every case, the action of learned anti-bodies via vaccines *requires* infection to take place in order to actively fight said infection. 

The effect of vaccines is that they prime the immune system to fight the targeted pathogen. In the best cases, the immune system is in fact SO ready to fight, that the pathogen is attacked extremely rapidly - within hours of infection.

But NO vaccine can wholly prevent the inital infection onset for ANY pathogen - there is no ""biological force field"" that prevents a pathogen from infecting a cell - the presence of the pathogen is first required in order to trigger the immune response that will then destroy it.

Not vaccinating will only lead to increase in loss of life and long term complications for unvaccinated individuals, and continue to result in strained healthcare systems and additional vectors for variants to mutate as the virus will be able to stay active in unvaccinated individuals much longer than those who are vaccinated.

Reducing the length of active infection (and thus opportunity for RNA mutation) is the key to reducing the active generation of new variants. That is what the last century of research into RNA virus's has shown.

Not only are they trying to state that their opinion is the consensus (which it factually isn't), what they said it clearly wrong. We have huge amounts of data about the vaccines. The chance for side effects is absolutely miniscule and that's a fact too. There isn't room for debates here. Furthermore they are implying that the vaccines are more dangerous than they actually are. It is incredibly unlikely that negative side effects are going to appear years down the line.

Having said all that: Yes, there are healthcare workers who aren't vaccinated. It is also true that they are a tiny minority. What I said in the beginning is factually correct: the vast majority of doctors, experts, immunologists and virologists are vaccinated and are advocating for the vaccines. This is happening world wide. To pretend that the few people who go against the consensus have more valid opinions than basically 95% of the experts is foolish and unnecessary.

One, people who have both vaccine and natural immunity, we'll say ""hybrid immunity"" are less likely to get it again and much less likely to spread it.

[],,jdorje,,,,,,[],"I apologize.  I wanted to make a point by finding the first study I could and showing it was in agreement, and then went to bed.

Many studies, like this one, do look at only one of the variables involved: efficacy against infection, and efficacy against hospitalization/death OR HFR/CFR.  They are all generally in agreement that efficacy against infection is 80-90% (5-10x RR) and efficacy against hospitalization is 90-95% (10-20x) RR, for a combined 5-10x RR (80-90% VE) pre-infection and 2-4x (50-75% VE) post-infection.  Looking at risk reduction or risk ratio, RR, here is more intuitive because you can multiply reductions in sequence together.  It's also important only to look at Delta numbers, since vaccines were far better against Alpha and every previously prevalent lineage, to the point where efficacy against hospitalization was too high to measure.

[Here](https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n2282) is a scientific summary of all US data from the CDC: 5x RR against infection, 10x (2x post-infection) against hospitalization, 11x (2.2x post-infection) against death.  [Here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1009243/Technical_Briefing_20.pdf) is raw UK data, showing a 70% reduction in CFR (3.3x RR) after vaccination for over-50s.  [Here's](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2108891) the original UK study on efficacy against delta: 88% (8x RR) against infection (testing positive) for delta.  Pick any other study or set of studies you want and it's almost certainly going to be in the same range: 5-10x RR against infection, 10-20x RR against hospitalization/death.  [Here's](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2110345?query=featured_home) an analysis of the original Pfizer trial at 6 months; 86% was their lower bound for efficacy against infection (though they don't separate by Delta).  [These](https://www.covid-datascience.com/post/israeli-data-how-can-efficacy-vs-severe-disease-be-strong-when-60-of-hospitalized-are-vaccinated) numbers from Israel show 90-95% efficacy against severe disease.

There are several caveats.  If antibodies continue to wane and people can't get boosters, efficacy pre-infection (driven by antibodies) is likely to continue to decline, while post-infection efficacy should remain unchanged.   We really would want higher post-infection efficacy, and if we see unchanged hospitalization risk as the infection risk climbs, it implies that post-infection efficacy is actually rising over that time (which would be *overwhelmingly* good news).

Of course, none of these numbers approach the 95% efficacy seen pre-infection and too-high-to-measure efficacy seen post-infection against Alpha and wildtype after the second doses, which is likely to be achieved again (based on phase 1 trials) after a third shot.",,,,1632164244,{},hdmhvyj,False,t3_prc7le,False,False,t1_hdkkd0m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prc7le/chris_rock_says_he_has_covid19_urges_vaccination/hdmhvyj/,1632279084.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_ii7rl,False,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She did return for her trial or hearing.

The New York City ""no bail"" policy was a much needed reform because before that poor or working class people would be held in jail because they couldn't manage to scrape together even relatively low bail.

What would the alternative be - have these women be held in jail for months pending trial? I mean on a schadenfreude level, of course I would like that but in terms of penal reform, I do support not having to post bail for relatively minor infractions because of the disproportionate impact on poorer people and POC.

The US has been overpopulated for decades. see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_ecological_footprint) for a fast overview of nations which exceed biocapacity and by how much and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_footprint), [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocapacity), and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overshoot_(population\)) for a simple introduction to the concepts. Overpopulation is absolutely a critical issue that threatens our environment and our future.   

It isn't just a question of food production. The impacts of a population on an area will include things like the excrement they produce, the water they need for survival, the plants and animals that are displaced, the erosion of soil and the depletion of its nutrients, the loss of trees and forests, the power needed to provide electricity heating and cooling, the increase in the spread of disease, the vehicles those people depend on and the roads/fuel those require, etc.   

It wouldn't matter if we all lived in grass huts, ate nothing but fruits and vegetables, and only rode bikes. At a certain point, too many people in one space is going to take a greater environmental toll than the land can sustain just as too many deer (who don't drive cars, clear cut forests, or farm cattle) can and do become overpopulated in areas.",,,,1632171766,{},hdn07od,False,t3_pqw6ex,False,True,t1_hdmvkbf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pqw6ex/covidstricken_alabama_had_more_deaths_than_births/hdn07od/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_4nbrl,False,False,,False,415f36b7fe0d615f638f9095dcc78fc0d14843a2,True,False,,0.0,,,0.0,1632171782.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public

I mean, I suppose that's technically correct (the best kind of correct.) It's been 4 weeks since that statement so it's still in the coming weeks. But when the fuck can we expect it?

It really feels like they're waiting for the *perfect set of data*. Life is messy, and sometimes you're just not going to have perfect information. Part of being a leader is realizing that sometimes you have to make the best call you can based on the information you have at the time. And it really feels like no one is willing to step up and make the hard decision.

So yeah, I am about the same as you. I think I am just going to lie and go get a Moderna shot.

Virtually no effective solutions are provided to us and we’re told to essentially “suck it up.” A phobia is a form of a mental illness, and it’s more than just a fear. The lack of empathy in this matter is unacceptable. I get why it’s difficult for some to understand — believe me. If I didn’t have this condition, I don’t think I would take it seriously either. But if herd immunity is something that you want to see, I urge you to develop some compassion for people that suffer with trypanophobia.

But something in our brains is wired differently to have irrational reactions to events that others experience with little to no reaction.

Are we not all affected to an intense degree with both influenza and COVID-19? Both are able to spread in close contact, indoor settings with poor ventilation, and in some cases on surfaces ([CDC Source](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm)). Again, why was there no concern for decades about this?

&gt;not getting vaccinated is equivalent to attempted murder when you directly cause others to get sick, yes. For example, being infectious and not telling others about it who may be vulnerable because of your own shitty pride. It's only the nonvaccinated you see doing this in large quantities.

And this would include the [82-87%](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/9/e2019716118) of individuals who are asymptomatic and do not know if they are infectious? 

&gt;We are now at the point where vaccinated people are dying of treatable illnesses because of the sheer amount of science deniers

And what is the rate of dying from COVID-19 if you are fully vaccinated? From my research, the risk of dying from COVID-19 if you are fully vaccinated is 0.00001% ([Source](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/what-is-your-actual-risk-of-getting-covid-19-if-youre-vaccinated#The-risk-of-hospitalization-and-death-after-vaccination-is-still-minuscule)). And things only improve in regards to cases and hospitalizations.

The case rate for unvaccinated individuals stands at 0.01%, compared to 0.001% if fully vaccinated. And the hospitalization rate for unvaccinated stands at 0.002% compared to 0.0001% if fully vaccinated ([CDC Source](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7037a7.htm?s_cid=mm7037a7_w)).

Yes, people can still die from COVID-19 if fully vaccinated, however, I think it disingenuous to say that without the proper context. 

&gt;it's equivalent to indirect murder at a certain point. Manslaughter.

Then I will ask you a direct question:

You say it is considered manslaughter, the maximum penalty in federal cases for manslaughter according to U.S. Code is 8 years ([Source](https://www.lawinfo.com/resources/criminal-defense/involuntary-manslaughter/involuntary-manslaughter-penalties-sentencing.html#:~:text=The%20maximum%20penalty%20under%20federal%20law%20for%20involuntary,or%20Class%20D%20felony%20offense%20in%20most%20states)).

The antivaxxer made the decision for themselves when they chose not to take the vaccine. They chose they did not want to take precautions. Therefore, we should prioritize the person who did take proper precautions but happened to have shit luck.

This is called triage and is necessary when there are not enough resources for everybody. This is completely moral to me. Doctors wouldn't have to make this decision to such a degree if the antivaxxer didn't literally do it to themselves.

Meaning that while a vaccinated person with covid may have a better chance of survival that an unvaxxed person with covid (let's say both patients are 25) the vaccinated person in this case received the car. In another scenario it may be an unvaccinated 30 y/o with covid against a 65 y/o vaccinated person having a heart attack. If the 30 y/o has a better chance of survival, they get the bed.

Yes, because it isn't being taken into consideration at all, period. If two fundamentally identical patients both need the sole bed and ventilator of an ICU, they don't look at vaccination status -- they go by lottery once all other criteria is exhausted.

That's just not a good way of managing a crisis. The kicking covid patients off vents after a week or so is a step in the right direction though, so that's a welcoming sight.

That's an unknown unknown. If a life terminates, it is difficult, with any certainty, to say that they would have died anyway or would still be alive.

The truth will eventually be calculated, once this is all over, because the trend lines (from before COVID) will be sufficiently disrupted, that the difference can be seen.

You can't achieve that with a vaccine that simply reduces severity, so we need to stop proliferating that idea.

[],,danysdragons,,,,,,,"While I agree with your argument that they were being overly pessimistic about protection from infection, the numbers you’ve cited as effectiveness preventing infection look more like the numbers for effectiveness preventing symptomatic illness.

The three primary vaccine effectiveness statistics we see cited are effectiveness against:

1. Infection
2. Symptomatic Illness
3. Severe Illness

For convenience I'll refer to to these by number ;)

In the early stages of vaccination campaigns, 2. was by far the most cited figure. With the arrival of Delta, public health authorities have switched to focusing on 3.

[This article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.09.010) discusses vaccine effectiveness against Delta, with stats for  2 and 3, along with a more detailed discussion of 1. This little table below Is based off stats in the article for Pfizer’s protection Delta:

|**Effectiveness Type**|**% (95% CI)**||
|:-|:-|:-|
|Symptomatic Illness|85 (80–90)||
|Severe Illness|95 (90–99)||


Excerpt regarding effectiveness against infection:

&gt; Although the preliminary data published by the Ministry of Health in Israel caused much concern suggesting a significant decline of effectiveness against symptomatic Delta infection, further preprint published did not report effectiveness figures against symptomatic infection as symptoms reporting was not reliable in the national database. Vaccine effectiveness against infection is much harder to measure as these estimates are affected by various biases such as testing criteria, behavior, exposure risk, immunity status of the population, and community prevalence. Studies showed an estimated 55%–80% effectiveness against infection before Delta was dominant, and there is a modest decline seen in prevention against infection with Delta.

&gt; American Samoa reported its first coronavirus case, 18 months into the pandemic, after a traveler tested positive after flying to the U.S. territory from Hawaii.
&gt; 
&gt; The positive case was discovered during a quarantine period required upon arrival in American Samoa. The traveler was fully vaccinated, according to a news release published Friday by American Samoa’s Department of Homeland Security, and the positive result was confirmed by the Health Department Thursday. Officials say the individual tested negative before traveling. The traveler was asymptomatic when tested, according to the news release, and will continue to be monitored.
&gt; 
&gt; “The discovery of this positive case during quarantine highlights the importance of why our process is critical to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” Gov. Lemanu Mauga (D) said in a statement. “It further highlights the importance of maintaining our current quarantine protocols.” Mauga was among the passengers on the Monday flight from Hawaii and is in quarantine, according to the [Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/article/health-coronavirus-pandemic-hawaii-honolulu-american-samoa-6433b498bfaf61a7846ad0718c91680b).
&gt; 
&gt; Gabor Kelen, director of Johns Hopkins University’s Department of Emergency Medicine, told The Washington Post it was surprising that American Samoa was able to evade the coronavirus as long as it did. The “[covid zero](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/australia-delta-covid-lockdown/2021/08/24/6bb6131c-03b8-11ec-b3c4-c462b1edcfc8_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_7)” approach, in which countries such as Australia mandated lockdowns, hotel quarantines and other measures to stamp out transmission, probably is not possible in the long term, he said.
&gt; 
&gt; “Can any nation, entity, territory, forever and ever evade coronavirus? I think that answer is almost for sure no,” Kelen said. Noting that Australia has had outbreaks despite its early success, he added, “Think of it almost like a pressure cooker. As soon as you release the valve just a little, it’s over.”
&gt; 
&gt; The infected traveler was an America Samoa resident who had traveled to Hawaii and to the U.S. mainland, according to the [Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/article/health-coronavirus-pandemic-hawaii-honolulu-american-samoa-6433b498bfaf61a7846ad0718c91680b). The passenger returned Monday, the first day that commercial flights from Honolulu to Pago Pago had resumed since last year.
&gt; 
&gt; According to the World Health Organization [coronavirus tracker](https://covid19.who.int/region/wpro/country/as) last updated Friday, American Samoa had reported no confirmed coronavirus cases, but it was not clear why that was so.
&gt; 
&gt; In a news conference on Friday, American Samoa Health Department epidemiologist Aifili John Tufa said the traveler had tested negative before flying back home. He said it’s possible the traveler was “exposed at any time traveling from the mainland, and the time that they were in Hawaii.”
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s very hard for us to pinpoint exactly where the exposure happened at this point,” he said. “But we know for sure that the processes we have in place are working. This passenger, their positive result was caught in quarantine.” Officials said the person was moved to isolation.
&gt; 
&gt; Lin Chen, director of the Travel Medicine Center at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass., and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, said the positive report in American Samoa shows that protocols like testing and quarantine upon arrival can pick up positive cases, even if tests before departure were negative.
&gt; 
&gt; “It does show we cannot let our guard down,” Chen said, adding, “Testing is still important, even with full vaccination.” She said even the fully vaccinated should think about getting themselves tested before and after travel even if it’s not required by the destination.
&gt; 
&gt; In a post in late August, the American Samoa Health Department [posted an infographic](https://www.facebook.com/americansamoadoh/photos/a.141690487296874/405694197563167) on social media, outlining its travel guidelines and noting that it was monitoring travelers. It notes that three negative PCR test results are required before departure, at 10 days and five days before departure as well as 48 hours before.
&gt; 
&gt; Hawaiian Airlines announced this month that it would resume nonstop flights between Honolulu and the U.S. territory on Monday, service that had been suspended since March 2020.
&gt; 
&gt; The airline, which said [in a statement](https://newsroom.hawaiianairlines.com/releases/hawaiian-airlines-to-resume-american-samoa-service-6850212) that it “provides the only regularly scheduled air link between the two island chains,” had paused the service for 17 months at the request of the American Samoa government. Repatriation flights had resumed this year to bring thousands of residents to American Samoa who had been stranded elsewhere during the pandemic, the airline said.
&gt; 
&gt; The report of American Samoa’s first positive case leaves a dozen countries, regions and territories that had reported no coronavirus cases, according to the World Health Organization. Several “zero covid” claims are viewed with skepticism. Many experts doubt North Korea would acknowledge an outbreak, and reports suggest that Turkmenistan, another country that denies having coronavirus cases, is experiencing a [wave of infections](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58583212), according to BBC News.
&gt; 
&gt; Chen said the new infection in American Samoa may suggest the coronavirus is present in other places that have yet to report cases. “It may be circulating, it may be there already, and we just don’t know it yet,” she said.
&gt; 
&gt; Kelen said immunity — either through a huge number of people being vaccinated or the virus moving “through a lot of people” — is the only way out of the pandemic. He said that it is too difficult to contain, and that borders cannot stay closed forever. “No country can lock this thing down,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; In American Samoa, just over 48 percent of the population is fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, compared to nearly 55 percent of the total U.S. population, according to tracking by [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=lk_inline_manual_32).",,,,1632141297,{},hdl0mc9,False,t3_prpwnb,False,False,t3_prpwnb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prpwnb/american_samoa_one_of_the_last_places_without/hdl0mc9/,1632249729.0,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_dvgbv,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you poll bedside nurses at any given time, without reference to covid, a high percentage want to leave the field.   Some of us just moved to outpatient care, but many nurses think bedside = nursing and, fed up, leave the field entirely.

Lockdown will still be applied but on a reduced scale. The city’s authorities will apply technology to supervise mobility of residents and trace positive cases, he said.  
  
The capital will loosen social distancing restrictions but continue to ensure strict COVID-19 protocols because the city still has some clusters in narrow alleys and densely-populated areas.  
  
The priority target is to protect public health and strive to vaccinate all residents with a second dose, Dũng said.  
  
Dũng asked the people, local organisations and businesses to uphold their responsibilities in observing COVID protocols.  
  
Trần Ngọc Dương, deputy director of the city’s Police Department, said after September 21, the police would continue to maintain 55 COVID checkpoints including 22 expressway checkpoints at the city’s gateways and 33 other checkpoints at the entrances to other localities to control people leaving and entering the city, especially from high-risk areas.  
  
QR codes will be checked at these points. The authorities will focus on testing people entering the city, tracing epidemiological history and asking for health declarations.  
  
Vũ Văn Viện, director of the city Department of Transport, said they would consult with city authorities to continue to suspend operation of public passenger transport inside the city and from other provinces and cities.  
  
Inner-city goods transport will continue to follow the direction of the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Transport.  
  
The transport department is considering allowing ride-hailing app shippers to resume operation to meet public demand.  
  
Nguyễn Văn Phong, deputy secretary of the city's Party Committee, said regular health declarations were key to tracing positive cases.  
  
Hà Nội should not lower its guard against the pandemic because, he said, “the infection risk is still present” and the city cannot completely return to a normal life.  
  
According to Trần Nhị Hà, director of the city's Department of Health, Hà Nội now has 10 new and complicated new clusters.  
  
The number of daily cases in the fourth social distancing period (from September 7) has declined significantly compared to the first period.

Part of this is: It’s your turn to float to another unit. So because my unit included a step down for the MICU, I was never oriented to the MICU itself but expected to float there for the day and take one of the more stable patients. In my case, a patient on ECMO.  “What’s ECMO?” I literally asked. There was pressure on me to take the patient because otherwise someone else from my unit would have to float in my place. I was pretty meek but I refused the assignment because it was unsafe-I thought- for me to take a patient on ECMO, which the only thing they said to me about it was “Make sure it doesn’t stop!”

Also there was pressure to not need my full orientation but to take a staff nurse load before the 8 weeks was up.

There was not a good sense of team work on that unit. Not always thr case, but a frequent complaint. Nurses tend to be care-taking by personality in some form or other.

You do realize that all the data I wrote suggests that the vaccine works, right?

The data shows that people under 60 years old and unvaxed are 3 times more likely to get severe case than vaxed (in the same age group). For over 60 is 5 times more likely.

I mean 70 % of ICU beds in Israel in the begging of august was taken by the 6.3 % of 90+ year olds who were unvaxed.

HOWEVER, since a lot of people are vaxed, there are bound to be SOME who need ICU (you can see the graphs yourself), so my question still stands:

HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE ARE 0 VAXED PEOPLE IN ICU?

To me statments like : ""I also work in a Covid unit. I’ve yet to see one single vaxxed person admitted."" smell like BULLSHIT. Its like saying: "" Do your own research"", just because it fits your narrative.

Since NOT seeing one single vaxed person admitted in ICU is statistically very unlikely, but still possible I asked OP where does she work, because it interests me, it baffles my mind why I got all the downvotes.

Also i would love to get any (real) source that confirms there are no vaxed patients in ICU if possible?

&amp;#x200B;

BTW the data is over one month old, but still reliable IMO, you can also get it from Israeli Ministry of Health, however some Hebrew is needed for that.

My sickness landed in my sinuses, head and throat.  My wife's landed in her sinuses, throat and chest.

Once we had our onset of symptoms we received regeneron treatment.  Still had a couple days of misery but when the symptoms went away, they went away.  There was no ""decline"" in symptoms.  I went to bed feeling like shit one night and woke up feeling normal the next morning.

My daughter brought Covid home from school.  She's 7.  She infected my son, 11 and both of us.  Her symptoms?  Headache, low grade fever for one day.  She was up and normal on day 2.  My son had a headache, slight cough, low grade fever and lost his smell and taste.  All symptoms were gone on day 3 (except for the taste and smell, that's still kind of a thing).

We are all back to normal except for my wife who is still fighting off remnants of pneumonia in her left lung.  She still has a cough.

The thing that fucking bothers me the most with all of this is that we were BY FAR the safest when it came to this.  We were vaccinated as soon as we could be, we wear masks religiously, I wear gloves to the grocery store, etc.  

Against our better judgement, we sent the kids to in-person school and within 3 days at school, we all had Covid.

Not to disagree with your stance, but if we are unable to find and document any bad cases that result from the vaccine and rule out comorbidities, it'll be difficult to answer this question. The only way to really test for this is to scale the vaccine trials to the 100,000 range or higher to capture outlier cases. The fact we've tested 25,000 toddlers so far and found no reports of bad cases is a good sign, but we'll need to be transparent and diligent to document sides effects or cases that turned for the worst.

My issue with the VACCINE is this ...if I can still get covid and spread it while vaccinated , what's the reason for someone in my shoes to get the shot.

Simply put, I was always told that masks don't really protect the wearer, but protect those around the wearer from getting infected by the wearer. So it's an altruistic thing to wear a mask.  
  
But who are the people that still need protecting? Here in the UK every adult has by now had every chance in the world to get vaccinated and protect themselves that way. They don't need me to wear a mask.  
  
The only people who do benefit from me wearing my mask are the ones who refused to get their vaccines. Why should I do extra effort (cause let's be honest, wearing a mask in hot tube or bus is annoying) to protect the antivaxxers?  
  
I realize there are few other groups who could not get vaccinated, e.g. those who have had allergic reactions to components of the vaccine in the past. But in all honesty at this point you're talking about such a small group of the population that I don't think it's fair to to enforce everyone to wear a mask for the rest of their lives on transport. You might as well start enforcing mask wearing during flu season for the ones who can't get a flu jab then.

&gt;This isn't true, it's just one part of a larger purpose and I didn't provide a source because you literally already did. Your own CDC link references disease prevention. 

You just said my words aren't true but the source I provided is true, and from the source is what I said. I didn't include every single little detail about the vaccine because it wasn't needed for the comment.

&gt;Why are you so adamant that vaccines are not designed to prevent infection? That's the misinformation I'm trying to push back on.

I never said that. You are assuming things. You are so diehard for saying that vaccines number 1 priority is reducing transmission. When clearly there are multiple priorities for the vaccine.

From your source: 

&gt;Some people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will still get sick because no vaccine is 100% effective. Experts continue to monitor and evaluate how often this occurs, how severe their illness is, and how likely a vaccinated person is to spread COVID-19 to others.

And here is your bullet point: 

&gt;All COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States are effective at preventing COVID-19 as seen in clinical trial settings.

Preventing covid is not getting sick. Getting sick usually implies hospitalization or having a test to be done to confirm/deny the illness you may are experiencing. Not getting sick implies not having covid in your system or not enough to get you sick, and that implies reduces transmission. Alot of things works hand in hand in a vaccine. 

&gt;I'm sick of people pushing that vaccines aren't intended to prevent infection and also reduce disease severity when breakthroughs occur. That's why I chose to respond.

I am not advocating for that nor I ever said that. AND YET, you choose to say I was misinforming others.

As for your comment that the varicella and measles vaccines were never given EUAs, you think that might have anything to do with the fact that the EUA process was codified a decade or more after those vaccines were already given full approval by the FDA? Just throwing that out there as a theory.

&gt;The EUA program was established in 2004, when the Project BioShield Act, among other measures, amended Section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include this provision (HHS, 2010a). EUA permits the FDA Commissioner to authorize the use of an unapproved medical product or an unapproved use of an approved medical product during a declared emergency involving a heightened risk of attack on the public or U.S. military forces, or a significant potential to affect national security (FDA, 2007).

&gt; Idar-Oberstein (dpa) - In the dispute over wearing a corona mask, a 49-year-old is said to have shot a gas station cashier in Idar-Oberstein (Rhineland-Palatinate).

&gt; The man was annoyed because the employee did not want to sell him beer because he did not wear mouth and nose protection, said chief prosecutor Kai Fuhrmann on Monday in Idar-Oberstein.

&gt; Warrant for murder

&gt; An arrest warrant for murder was issued against the German suspect from the Birkenfeld district at the Bad Kreuznach district court. The alleged perpetrator confessed to having killed the 20-year-old student with a targeted shot in the head, said Fuhrmann.

&gt; As for the motive, he stated that the situation of the corona pandemic was a heavy burden on him. He felt pushed into a corner and ""saw no other way out"" than to set an example. The victim seemed to him ""responsible for the overall situation, since it had enforced the rules,"" said Fuhrmann.

&gt; Cruel act

&gt; According to the previous investigations, the 49-year-old had entered the sales room of the gas station without a mask on Saturday evening and placed two six-packs of beer on the counter at the cash register. The cashier pointed out the mask requirement to the man - whereupon the man left the room and threateningly raised his hand.

&gt; A good hour later he appeared again at the gas station - this time he wore a mouth and nose cover, took another six-pack of beer, and went to the cash register. ""There he put the mouth and nose cover down,"" said Fuhrmann. The cashier had again advised the man to comply with the mask requirement: The perpetrator then pulled a revolver and shot the 20-year-old.

&gt; The suspect was arrested on Sunday morning on the premises of the police in Idar-Oberstein. ""We assume that he wanted to surrender,"" said Trier's police chief Friedel Durben. ""This is definitely a special case: We have not had such an act in either the Trier police headquarters or in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate that suggests a connection to Corona.""",,,,1632157487,{},hdm1f4z,True,t3_prz1wv,False,True,t3_prz1wv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prz1wv/gas_station_cashier_shot_because_of_corona_mask/hdm1f4z/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_15ua46,False,False,,False,8c6cfe6e47281fb34eb66aa2bc7db4851b7dd583,True,False,,0.0,,,0.0,1632157505.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public

As a hypothetical, FDA could approve a vaccine for a tropical disease because you're better off protected against it; CDC ACIP could then say ""only people living in/travelling to places where it's common should get it"" or ""everyone should get it"" based on weighing costs, side effects, etc.,

The virus would spread from outside the country back in and within a month or two we'd be exactly where we were before.  That's only an effective strategy when a virus is geographically constrained.. if you can lock it down hard enough you can kill the spread.

The R-value is what matters - the rate of spread within the population.  You can reduce the R-value all sorts of ways - social distancing, masks, vaccines, outdoor activities vs indoor activities.  That's why the flu comes back every winter - our behavior changes which increases the R-value beyond 1.0 and outbreaks begin to occur.

[],,we_gotta_believe,,,,,,[],"Because a child's risk of long-term effects is almost certainly higher if they get infected with covid than if they have an adverse reaction to the vaccine. More thorough long-covid studies are underway but from the little we know so far, approx 2-4% of kids with symptomatic covid still deal with symptoms 12 weeks after infection. And while the risk of hospitalization is low, it's still about 1 in 100 for a kid who gets infected, which isn't exactly anything to brush off. When it comes to my kids, I'm not crazy about gambling with their health at those odds if it can be reasonably avoided with masks and vaccines. 

Critics of covid restrictions often say how much emotional trauma in kids is being caused by all this, but you know what's *really traumatic*? A trip to the hospital to save your kid's life. Try explaining that to a 5 year old while they're struggling to breathe, I bet it won't go over that well.

So if you're confident that the odds of a trip to the ER is lower with covid than with the vaccine, then you might want to wait to see how things play out a bit longer. But for those of us who have kept up to date on how fast delta is spreading, and how low the prevalence of side effects are with the vaccine, we are more confident that the vaccine is the safer route, because choosing not to get vaccinated in the era of delta, is basically a choice to get infected with covid sooner or later.",,,,1632149599,{},hdli6y4,False,t3_prsbj3,False,False,t1_hdlaidt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prsbj3/covid19_vaccine_for_5_to_11yearolds_is_safe_and/hdli6y4/,1632259711.0,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_681t761n,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; Remember, the vaccines are about you having a much much better chance of not being hospitalized than someone who is unvaccinated.

This isn't true, it's just one part of a larger purpose and I didn't provide a source because you literally already did. Your own CDC link references disease prevention. I don't think you need me to waste my time finding source after source taking about herd immunity being the goal initially. Why are you so adamant that vaccines are not designed to prevent infection? That's the misinformation I'm trying to push back on.

But since you're being obstinate, here's another source. Note the first bullet points emphasize disease prevention. Notably there are no bullet points claiming vaccines sent indented to prevent infection or disease (yes I know they are different). I'm sick of people pushing that vaccines aren't intended to prevent infection and also reduce disease severity when breakthroughs occur. That's why I chose to respond.

This has been well understood by the FDA and should not come as a surprise to anyone. As for what is defined as an ""emergency"" I suppose you could ask the states seeing the highest number of pediatric covid cases to date and running out of beds in their children's hospitals. If a respiratory pathogen with an R0 upwards of 7,  sweeping through school districts across the nation as we speak, and causes disease severe enough to result in the hospitalization of 1 in 100 kids isn't an ""emergency"" in your view, then I'd like to know does meet the criteria.

 https://www.nfid.org/2020/07/16/measles-covid-19-a-dangerous-combination/

From the article ""Measles is highly contagious—much more so than COVID-19. It is so contagious that if one person has measles, up to 90 percent of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected.""

So with respect to herd immunity, that seems to imply you have to consider transmissibility first and foremost. Now with the measles vaccine, you get lifelong immunity and 97% protection for life. With reasonably high vaccination rates, measles is very rare. However, in communities where anti-vax movements have taken place a resurgence of measles has been seen. In places like the Pacific Northwest where there are a lot of antivax crazies, measles still make the news:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Pacific_Northwest_measles_outbreak

They refuse to get their kids to measles vaccine. So measles outbreaks actually make the news there and kids are left with brain damage and deafness.

[],,jwbinghamus42,,,,,,[],"I think there are a few different ways you could counter that argument. 1% seems small, and I know that it is pretty unlikely that I personally will die of covid, but there is a lot more bad that can happen than just me personally dying. When you take a small number like 1% and multiply it by a very large number, like the population of the United States or of the world, and you end up with a big number, or 3.3 million dead in the US, and 70 million dead around the world. Even though I am likely to survive personally, I don't really like the idea of a single thing killing that many people within a few years.

To make it more personal though, you can also think on the smaller scale of people you personally know. If I add up the number of close family members in my family on both my side and my wife's, including all parents, siblings, nieces, nephews, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, you easily get over 100 people. Add to that friends, neighbors, coworkers, former classmates, former coworkers, acquaintances through hobbies and church, and even familiar faces at businesses you frequent, and I bet most people, if you really took the time to count up how many people they know in one way or another, know well over a thousand people. If 1% of 1000 people that I know die, that means that 10 people I know will die, and I don't like that idea either.

To look at it another way, 1% is actually a pretty high number when it comes to risk aversion. Each day, an average of 30,000 commercial flights take place in the United States. If 1% of these flights (300) crashed each day, would you feel safe flying? Or if you were going to a sporting event at a stadium that seats 20,000 people and knew that 200 of them were going to die, would you still fell safe going?

Lastly, while death is the worst outcome one can get from covid, it is hardly the only negative outcome. It isn't simply you get a mild cold, or you die. Many people end up with long-term effects that can range from mild inconveniences like a cough, all the way to permanent damage to vital organs that severely impact quality of life. Even most people who get admitted to the ICU make it out alive, and are part of the 99% that survived. But many are walking away with severely damaged hearts, lungs, and kidneys. And even if you make it out of the hospital relatively ok, I doubt most people would appreciate losing potentially weeks of their lives and thousands of dollars to a prolonged hospital visit.",,,,1632166565,{},hdmnjvx,False,t3_prulak,False,False,t1_hdmeskn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prulak/covids_us_death_toll_on_verge_of_surpassing_that/hdmnjvx/,1632282153.0,31,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_49mrpchf,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So much wrong with this, starting with your [""superficial differences""](https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/8xt55v/the_fcc_wants_to_charge_you_225_to_review_your/e25uz0g/) 

&gt; There's no such thing as overpopulation, but overconsumption. There's room for many more people to live with less.

overpopulation isn't about how many people you can possibly cram into a physical space. It's about biocapcity which is how many people a particular area can sustainably support. Over-consumption can play a role in that, but it's still only a small example of many factors. At a national scale the US is already over biocapacity. We are greatly over populated. On a local scale there are some areas which do not exceed biocapacity.

[],,glibsonoran,,,,,,[],"A lot of recent studies state that peak viral loads with the Delta variant are similar between vaccinated and unvaccinated by relying on PCR testing to be a proxy for viral load.  PCR works by first breaking up all the viral and cellular material into a soup of free floating pieces. Then they add a molecule that binds to a certain sequence of RNA that's unique to the virus, the molecule also contains a marker that fluoresces when exposed to a certain type of light.  The number of test cycles required to detect a positive fluorescent signal tells us the concentration of viral RNA in the test (fewer cycles \[Ct-values\] means higher viral RNA concentration).    
  
The problem with this is that the test doesn't know the state of the viral RNA before it was rendered into a soup.  By using this a proxy for viral load they're assuming the RNA came from whole virus capable of infecting another person.   But vaccinated people (and those who had a previous infection) mount a defense against the virus much earlier and much more vigorously than unvaccinated people with naive immune systems.  So it wouldn't be out of line to expect that a higher percentage of PCR-detected viral RNA might come from virons that are coated with antibodies and rendered inactive, or debris from virus that have been deactivated or destroyed by the active immune response.  
So what would give us a more clear answer to this is following up the PCR testing with Culturing; taking part of the sample and culturing it to see how much virus it will grow in a certain amount of time since only truly infectious whole virus can replicate.  A recent study that's in pre-print right now did exactly that: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.20.21262158v1.full-text  
  
They found that: ""As the probability of culture positivity depends on viral load, this was corrected for using a probit regression model with both viral load and vaccination status as predictors. Figure 1C shows the probability of a positive culture for a given viral load in vaccinated and unvaccinated HCWs. A positive vaccination status significantly decreased the probability of culture positivity (p = 0.002, Wald test).""    
  
So on looking deeper the narrative that vaccinated produce the same maximum infectious viral load as unvaccinated may not stand up to scrutiny.",,,,1632169376,{},hdmuekf,False,t3_prviti,False,False,t3_prviti,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prviti/vaccines_still_effective_against_delta_variant_of/hdmuekf/,1632285758.0,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_6xahd,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,iieer,,,,,,,"The numbers are still very low, meaning that it can be difficult to get good statistics from it, but we actually have a fairly good idea about the cause. If you followed Danish media in early Sept., there was quite a bit of talk about increasing rates in people in nursing homes, as also clearly visible from SSI's data. For example, in week 32 (mid-Aug), there were 12 covid cases among nursing home residents, all breakthroughs. Vaccines are good but not perfect and one can expect some breakthroughs, but if there's an increase it's likely because of reduced protection. In week 36 (early Sept), there were almost four times as many as week 32, all breakthroughs. The increase among old people, especially those that are particularly vulnerable, can be seen in hospitalization rates, too. The oldest age category where data is provided is 90+ years. In entire August, there were 10 new hospitalizations in that group. We're now slightly less than three weeks into September and there have been almost 20 new hospitalizations in that age group. A similar trend can be seen in 80-89 years. Nursing home residents was the first group to be vaccinated (almost all finished February; ~8 months ago), so they've been keeping an eye on reduced effect of the vaccine. It appears this began happening about a month ago. That's why they began giving boosters to nursing home residents (along with other particularly vulnerable people) earlier this month. However, just like the ""main"" vaccine shots, it likely takes a couple of weeks from booster shot until it has full effect. The data is still too limited to say for certain, but there are indications that we're starting to see an effect. In the last full week (14-20 Sept), there were 16 deaths. In the week before that (7-13 Sept), there were 22 deaths. This means that the last week was the first week in about two months with a clear decrease in deaths, compared to the week directly before it.

The authorities have already said that they're expecting boosters for other people too and I suspect we'll see it for old people in general (not just nursing home residents and particularly vulnerable people) in 2021. For younger people I doubt it'll happen in 2021 because they're less vulnerable to this disease and were the last to be vaccinated.",,,,1632171234,{},hdmyxbu,False,t3_prdze6,False,True,t1_hdmfcdn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prdze6/professor_about_the_low_positivepercentages_in/hdmyxbu/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_15384w,False,False,,False,a870cd70591c1fe4b46fd3d0872b29d164ffac19,True,False,,0.0,,,0.0,1632171249.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public

Here’s another question that I’ve had that I can’t seem to get a good answer to

In many areas, we are hearing that hospitals are more overloaded now than they were at any other time during the pandemic. This seems counter-intuitive to me, as we have a higher vaccination rate now than ever, and therefore the pool of unvaccinated is smaller, and therefore the pool of potential hospitalizations is smaller. It seems to me there must be some other phenomenon at play that would explain why hospitals are more overloaded than ever despite a plurality of the population being vaccinated. 

In your experience do you see a reason for this? The most sensible explanation to me seems to be that the surge is coinciding with major worker shortages at hospitals, but you would think this would be part of the narrative were it the case.",,,,1632170774,{},hdmxsxx,False,t3_prsbj3,False,True,t1_hdm0umn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prsbj3/covid19_vaccine_for_5_to_11yearolds_is_safe_and/hdmxsxx/,1632287513.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_52f7h1r7,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier in the pandemic, on April 9, 2020, Dr. Joseph Mercola posted a video about whether hydrogen peroxide could treat the coronavirus; it was shared more than 4,600 times.

OP’s questions are the flipped versions of your explanations why Israel saw so many vaccinated people hospitalised (more than the number of unvaccinated people!).   But OP was trying to figure out how the other person saw so few (zero!) fully vaccinated people.

Most places (at the moment) would be somewhere in the middle of those two extremes.

Geographic location could explain it via a low local take-up of vaccines, or a low number of cases in general, or comparative recency of vaccine access.   Working on vents might explain it.  They don’t see the milder breakthrough cases and serious breakthrough cases are often going to have some underlying factor (age or comorbidity) that both explains the severity and means they’d be directed towards hospice-style care rather than extreme interventions.

In case you're sincere, here's a sincere answer:

The vaccine reduced viral load in vaccinated folks until Delta. It looks like Delta can transmit as freely in either group, though studies on this are still new, as we're all learning as we go.

There's no actual debate though over whether the vaccine drastically reduces your changes of serious outcomes from infection. That's settled science at this point, even with Delta. 

So, stay unvac'd – transmit and have a realistic possibility at a bad outcome with Covid infection — or vaccinate and probably still transmit some, while making the infection very mild in almost all cases. Breakthru cases and vaccine injuries are both incredibly small numbers compared to unvaccinated deaths. 

I hope you get vaccinated, as most of us should. My 5 year old will be as soon as it's available.

According to this site, the confirmed dose purchases of SK are:

- 96m Pfizer

- 20m AZ

- 40m Moderna

- 6m Janssen

- 40m Novavax

SK purchased enough doses but fell behind in priority compared to other countries such as US, who bought ahead vaccine-hopefuls-then.

Pfizer vaccines have been delivered to SK punctually but other vaccines have not. First, AZ didn't meet their schedule because EU countries and India began to controll vaccine exports so all AZ vaccines manufactured in SK had to go abroad instead. Then, Moderna brorke the agreement with SK to supply vaccines in 2Q, because US exercised their purchase option to stock more vaccines up in warehouse. Until quite recently, Moderna has kept delaying their vaccine deliveries frequently, which has kept holding SK's vaccination campaign back.

In that scenario do you tell people to hang out and wait for the fancy lifeboats or the super special rescue boats? Or do you just try to get as many people into the lifeboats as you can regardless of if they're a bit rickety? Because at the time all we knew was that 3 or 4 weeks meant people were still floating the ocean ready to be eaten by a shark at any moment. And with covid, the danger wasn't just to those people but to others too - like if one person got ate, it was gonna attract more sharks and result in more sharks eating more people.

[],,reader3488,,,,,,,"Wow, the original study behind this really damns the vaccines' effectiveness with faint praise, if closely read. Maybe somebody can check my work here, but here's what I drew from the cited study.

First, let's clarify terminology. The declared standard threshold, enunciated by the WHO, for a vaccine to be called ""effective,"" meant it achieved prevention of 50% of the ""outcome of interest,"" usually ""disease."" That would be symptomatic infections, by the standard of the initial vaccine trials. 

This study looked at Delta cases ""from 17 May 2021 to 1 August 2021 when Alpha was replaced by Delta"" and found ""There was no evidence of reduced effectiveness in the Delta-dominant period for BNT162b2 against all newPCR-positives, with VE 57% (50-63%) post first dose and 80% (77-83%) post second dose (heterogeneityp=0.60, p=0.23, respectively) (Table 1, Figure 1).""

So, 80% for fresh Pfizer against delta.

Also: 

""In those 18 to 64 years, VE of BNT162b2 against new PCR-positives reduced by 22% (95% CI 6% to 41%) for every 30 days from second vaccination (p=0.007; Figure 2)."" So just ball-parking the numbers, three months after the fully-vaccinated status (14 days post dose 2), protection has dropped from 80% to 65% (about). They didn't follow up longer than that, but those numbers aren't inconsistent with the Israeli study findings: it was widely reported there in July, and again cited in this study from Britain, that two doses of Pfizer provided about 41% prevention against self-reported symptomatic delta infections.

Note that the British study only does the efficacy diminution analysis for those under 65. Why?

Based on this, I find it utterly misleading to say that the Pfizer vaccine is ""still effective against the Delta variant"" without qualifying that as for a diminishing value of effectiveness that reaches ""technically ineffective"" after the first six months after vaccination (and that's in the under 65 group).",,,,1632162561,{},hdmds29,False,t3_prviti,False,True,t3_prviti,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prviti/vaccines_still_effective_against_delta_variant_of/hdmds29/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_drv5whb0,False,False,,False,6a6867deef021b689d3f0360f963a41ca6c90f12,True,False,,0.0,,,0.0,1632162615.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public

Non-high risk kids have been hospitalized as well - not as often, but risk is only statistics and a healthy kid can end up in the hospital or with long-COVID as well.

And - without having kids vaccinated, we will not get COVID in check. Look at the hospital situation in many states here. Full. We need the full population vaccinated. Adults even more, but without vaccinating kids, we will not get out.

I see it also from the standpoint of a decision. Yes, it is difficult to decide to inject a vaccine into your kid - because it is your decision and if something happens, you may think it is your fault. But - by not vaccinating your kids, you decide that your kid can get sick, and if your kid gets COIVD - this is also your fault.

I do risk assessments A LOT as a part of my job and we have three parameters we use to evaluate the risk (Severity, Likelihood, Detectability). The latter doesn't really make sense in this scenario but Severity and Likelihood are critical to making an informed decision. 

To give you an example: 

I will presume you drive a car every day. There is a risk that you get killed/paralyzed/etc. in a T-bone collision every time you go through an intersection. Yet you still drive through multiple intersections every time you get in a car. When evaluating this risk, the Severity for this risk is extremely high but the likelihood is very low. As a result, the risk is considered acceptable. 

When it comes to the vaccine, the media has heavily played up the severe side effects but the likelihood of these severe side effects is extremely low (myocarditis . The not severe side effects are far more common but those just aren't fun. It's kinda like pushing yourself in the gym. It sucks like hell in the moment but it is worth it when it is done. 

All of this has assumed there is zero cost to null decision. In reality, not getting vaccinated increases your risk of contracting an infection. Infection by the virus causes many of the same issues but with a dramatically increased likelihood. For example, teenage males are 6.7 times more likely to contract myocarditis from the virus (450 cases per million) than they are from the vaccine (66.7 cases per million). For other potentially severe side effects, the differential is even worse! 

* Clotting issues occur at rate around NINE TIMES higher rate after contracting the virus than post-vaccination
* Strokes occur at almost an ELEVEN TIMES higher rate after contracting the virus than post-vaccination
* Deaths, the differential is so much that it is absurd. Only THREE deaths have been linked to the vaccine, meanwhile we have over half a million deaths from the virus.",,,,1632158516,{},hdm3xgk,False,t3_prpirk,False,True,t1_hdlyjnc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prpirk/daily_discussion_thread_september_20_2021/hdm3xgk/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_a3anf,False,False,,False,577bd1973a6741dec570edd341c1f439b7b46f46,True,False,,0.0,,,0.0,1632158533.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public

We have seen some reports of myocarditis after getting vaccinated. And yes while these reports are very very rare so is the risk of getting seriously ill/dying of covid as a kid. Kids generally are very low risk as opposed to say an adult who faces a a greater risk of ending up in hospital for covid. 

Obviously those who won't vaccinate their kids because they believe vaccines are poison or they're putting microchips in kids are just plain stupid. 

Those vaccinated parents who are hesitant to get their kids vaccinated probably won't be dead set on not getting their kids vaccinated. I reckon most of them will probably wait it out to watch for any reports of rare side effects and then once its shown in the real world it's safe they'll probably go out and get their kids vaccinated after a few months.
