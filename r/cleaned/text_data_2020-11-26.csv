0,2020-11-26," 4 deaths yesterday Remind reason again? Depends FDA approves Pfizer vaccine EUA. meeting 10th male determination approve 11th people start getting specifically cited another job comparable (hand-to-hand, low paid, labor precariat) also commented elsewhere I'd equally mad operating illegally violation state health standards. title post sex workers, ""targeting"" them??? care sex workers women, men, gay, straight, whatever. thick. Saving comment. order online? Yeah, could trust people make right decision kill other. works COVID! try ordering one Pixel at-home tests. able get test person arrives, save later. Hope feeling better soon. That‚Äôs failed vaccine never rolled public, I‚Äôm still looking examples released vaccines issues caused issues 3-5 years (again curious 3-5 years) later. 

And nearly decade mRNA vaccine trials far. You‚Äôre acting dark that‚Äôs pretty gross mischaracterization tbh. 

We go back forth, make decisions guess, think you‚Äôre somewhat inconsistent standards tbh.  People downvoting herd immunity means exposing enough healthy people pathogen pathogen mode transportation die pathogen.

Rolling dice everybody, healthy vulnerable, gets sick weak die hard immunity. thinning herd. Yes like whole world problems cares much details everything happening America. Gimme break. üçæüç∑üç∏üçπüç∫üçªü•Çü•É Saying something like ""vaccines cause autism"" purposes truth. say finding truth point rather ""proving hypothesis scientific method gives well-supported information"" context discussion, point semantics. People say want, seems China actually dealt Covid quite successfully. want things. Then, adult citizens, correct decisions personal health, well health community. It‚Äôs really hard understand. Paid credit card debt stimulus/unemployment getting. fair large limit, outrageous amount. since April 7-8 months later I've rely get they're maxed again. Sigh. fianc√© pay bills that's *all* pay lost fulltime job. sad relying parents groceries necessities, they're struggling themselves. Meanwhile Congress (cough McConnell goons) power fix suffering, instead vacation. downplay virus caused suffering, knowing they're infected status tax payer funded healthcare assures top line care. Sickening. 10% state? That's 7 people people drop outs slackers resent anyone hint ambition tell people store employees right taser don‚Äôt wear mask THEN.. flood internet videos people getting tasered wearing masks (fake course, made look real).. bet people wear mask. Hi, Sanford hospital worker (I'm food service, want suggest I'm doctor someone front lines, interact regularly) Fargo here. companies upping hours staff, main covid hospital (broadway) entirely filled COVID patients. They've clear floors Cancer patients make room. 

Our community state leaders care. thing that's swayed state area becoming laughingstock nation. doofus city council Fargo suggested masks work absurd, video went viral, city mandated masks. course, one follows/enforces really. state level. came 1 1000 NDans died it, got national news, state mandate came. Again, enforcement followings. 

We need help getting it. want cynical seeing universally ignored situation incredibly horrifying me, mental health shattered throughout this. parents it, they're gonna okay, know many people never luxury. Fuck. wrong, problem people fall Alex Jones like read begin with. That's they're watching video rants. It‚Äôs like liberal state report ‚Äúpositive‚Äù tests That‚Äôs works. medical system overrun, we‚Äôre screwed. Even one stays home, still medical emergency, COVID-related. isn‚Äôt magical team reserve doctors treat them‚Äîthey‚Äôre busy dealing people love freedom, football, catching COVID. 

That leads deaths. fucks people right thing regardless. fact illegal reason murdered someone? See! Works like charm! RNGesus would generous Right I‚Äôm ignorant don‚Äôt agree I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôd say intolerant different views own. challenge get comfortable bubble realize world isn‚Äôt sunshine rainbows don‚Äôt see covid response succeeding federal level. It‚Äôs going take vaccination eradicate states. yet people still refuse fly commercially US despite far safest form travel deaths per mile traveled. last fatal commercial plane crash US happening decade ago. everyone talked noticed told wear masks. Facebook/Twitter Feeds ‚â† ""facts"" That's bad, let visitors ICUs much all, people get families sick, die terrible lonely deaths. 

I'm family. I'd rather spread love death. industrialists right problem profiting China's cheap labor. guess China lost allure labor costs Chinese competition increased. Fargo least it‚Äôs mostly staffing issue. They‚Äôre paying travel nurses 8k week still don‚Äôt enough keep ICU patients. state 60 Air Force nurses sent help. 

Also there‚Äôs lot staff scared go governor gave nurses okay continue working covid units test positive long they‚Äôre symptomatic. So, question. saw December 11th date one vaccines distributed front like workers (I forgot which, sorry) headline ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù attached it. So, it? would put concrete date it‚Äôs still maybe?  know numbers rise? Thanks people like guy thinking low numbers means behave like pandemic. Well technically aren‚Äôt safety others, wouldn‚Äôt give COVID again. Well, given scientist Singapore COVID practically endemic pandemic, country must least 70% compliance comes wearing masks consistently. Mind you, Singapore mask mandates 5-6 months, certainly one accuse consistent. reverse. packing people smaller time frame?

if go beer public i'd rather one seven pm fewer people out. would 10 That‚Äôs don‚Äôt work well. people proximity wear them, filters 50-65% way one person breathing, 50 - 65% remains person inhaling. It‚Äôs effective enough done everyone, would stop pandemic tracks. But, you‚Äôre right, myself, don‚Äôt go anywhere without N95 greater. Careful, outdoor, limited, pod-based (some combination) gatherings especially summer case rates low one thing.

Now time ""power through"". course people feel lonely, throw caution wind sake family. thought funny guy. I‚Äôm equal opportunity casual racist. Probably sheriffs want give chair god forbid pot. Sounds like resent Renaissance want return living huts hiding dark. Best greatest country world! 

Food, sport, culture, security, government actually gives shit people. grateful born bred country. 

Can‚Äôt say US countries Europe! 10% North Dakota tested verified positive, certain total cases significantly higher that. Herd immunity threshold magical. R reduces continuously (and \~linearly!) R\_0 1 function % population infected. Careful researchers put estimate total infected ND close 30%. would \~cut exponential growth rate half.  


Re: reinfection. Yeah mean always thought myself: rate false positives would expect (even due purely clerical errors). would expect (at minimum) thousands false positives \~13M diagnosed cases, perhaps tens thousands. people get real false positives. amount 'people getting twice' seeing seem rise significantly threshold, IMO. hard numbers here, many doctors talked agree. think someone immune conditions getting reinfected changes assessment. Fletcher, professor immunology London School Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said another trial would necessarily delay getting green light efficacy higher dose regime still met World Health Organization‚Äôs target, unusual run new studies approved entirely possible AZ Oxford could license high dose quickly seek amendment use low dose sufficient data,‚Äù said. Born raised North Dakota, lived 30+ years. Moved Minnesota years ago. horrified least bit surprised. Seems come handy trying identify level Covid area scale one ten though! Gosh, almost like professional athletes think they're rules! always hierarchy needs. Socializing, also, chilling friends. also belong society, norms promote harmony protect public commons. Thank concern. Trump definitely one worst contributors this. covid politicizing supporters. God damn everyone country fucking stupid? least know half voters shred decency. found least 49 state local public health leaders either resigned, retired fired April August across 23 states

Holy shit. Pardon French. That's insanity. quite clear distinction CFR IFR. indeed, University Pennsylvania. Lots anti-education GOP politicans also Ivy League alma mater. Class divide exceptionalism that. r/conservative half people convinced election fraud based solely fact Biden's rallies people. Totally oblivious discouraging large crowds pandemic. gonna listen bullshit next 4 yrs. already tired it. okay, I'll make deal you, take message people living households making 100k year, leave rest us fuck alone. Crazy reading Baader-Meinhoff phenomenon 8-10 times many people infected reported

Back pandemic started revving February, became aware mindset. Back testing still scant, crazy envision ""there 50k known cases nationwide, due low testing 'real number"" probably like 500k cases.""

But assumption scale well, all. Per Infection2020 roughly ~12.66MM cases COVID confirmed across U.S. Applying idea ""really 10x many"" would mean 126MM Americans contracted COVID -- third population.

I'm well aware likely gap official case count, ""actual"" number cases. assume still factor 10, nearly year improving testing effectiveness capacity, strikes faulty premise.  ultimately bite ass. build structure foundation fools... two Dakotas anyway? Neither one particularly large area population. It‚Äôs ridiculous. totally commensurate given situation. Fear mongering warranted need people afraid. They‚Äôre afraid enough currently. Trump definitely psychopath there. traditional from, get Pfizer Moderna vaccine next year, promise start celebrating Thanksgiving well, form carries today, especially thinking US celebrate it, absolutely wonderful. Heck, I'll even learn cook stuff turkey make amazing sides. correct formula...

 difference percentage got sick divided percentage get sick unvaccinated group. 50% efficiency would mean reduces chances infection half, definition 50% efficiency would mean vaccine nothing. believe first place question. people want see family afraid. It‚Äôs alarming you‚Äôre not. Ah, bad reading

Still, 6ft actually scientific, arbitrary, really need lot aerosolized disease Denver's mayor Hancock twitting ""Don't travel Thanksgiving"" 30 minutes boarding flight Texas see daughter. Even better! Oh you‚Äôre post irony say nEw nOrMaL

What loser part Dan's plan resurrect gyms. Record tictok. want beleive emotions badly resent authority kind. like nation people grew spoiled brats. even metric system?? Stupid meters! /s actually stopped dating girl didn‚Äôt know metric system. Holy crow, right. terrifying thought? also occurs cronies admirers politics still running loose damage. fear find another one run four years. Maybe one acts civilized surface deadly. I'm gonna surprised That's exactly household needs it, exception mentioned earlier people living minimum wage.

I watched multiple field hand living paycheck paycheck pulling 200k$ year. made realize little value saving taught. Youre confused ignorant. case, id start something words pictures. Democracy two wolves lamb voting lunch. anyone discovered tipping point outbreak becomes impossible control contact tracing quarantine alone? many cases start considering significant restrictions? I'd say ""consistently"" also key term here. Definitely learn loans work taxes. may may accurate I‚Äôd reckon closer serology estimates. I‚Äôve thought starting deaths working back useful way get # infected. Yes, lot positives Stupidity free age, class, race, sex. truly equal opportunity mentality. Dude know he's talking about. vaccine scenario would 38.9% effective. 62% effective means every 100 people get sick placebo group, 38 get sick vaccinated group assuming groups equal size (and adjusting not)

You find correct formula here: Well complacent industry bleeds people dry change apart problem. Right isn‚Äôt way things go now? said less 36 ft beat lmao  post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* [A review Kaiser Health News service Associated found least 49 state local public health leaders either resigned, retired fired April August across 23 states.

If wondering sounds like *deja vu* constantly happening. bet there‚Äôs tens thousands cohort. sentencing community service supporting hospitals? couple hours working morgue aught fix problem. numbers CDC. Sadly they've become terrible nothing political pawn. country uneducated. Stupidity killing us. Pay attention school, kids. Science real. Statistics real. Epidemiology real. argument would better suited listed places actually free. Talking parts Europe similar US. least Japan Korea Hopefully mathematicians help us figure one out. People hate America weve power country long time. GDP 1.5√ó higher next highest country. basically Yankees Patriots. [The White House science office listed ""ending the¬†COVID-19 pandemic"" top accomplishment President Trump's first hospital right covid related issues paramedic exhausted, said spent day watching people die alone. There's beds hospital left kept saying ""I wish people would take seriously"" Achieving ‚Äúglobal group immunity‚Äù end goal, according Lipkin, explained 60 80 percent world‚Äôs population needs immune normalcy restored.

I think valid point continue pockets harbour virus vaccine distributed across globe. sounds pessimistic impact vaccines themselves. mind, pockets really gain foothold country vaccinated majority population.

I guess see justification thinks 'normalcy' difficult achieve. reason Democratic Party ever looks good they're Republican Party. American ""left"" populated people obsessed personal ambition careers, whose concern welfare constituents takes back seat, takes seat all. say someone consistently voted Democrat general elections. Maybe I'm part problem. Saw article estimating 100,000,000 Americans might already. dunno makes feel better worse. mask become new article clothing. FYI summoned bot. Also go website; happen sub blocks bot. COVID disease stop you. 

Government officials wanted play God decide lives prioritize pandemic ones stopped you. 

Sadly, many stories like one people might survived treatment dying Government officials cared COVID disease.  know, like others, expert, healthy immune system respond accordingly. unhealthy one respond disproportionately- less isolate infected cells early and/or responding excess point. I'm case spanish flu, cytokene storm leading mechanism fatality, relies immune system responding heavy handed manner causes body fail. remember exactly, want spread misinformation. head think immune system unable stop reciprocating response, literally continues generate stronger response causes damage, damage becomes fatal.

A healthy immune system responds quickly appropriately, mean reacts strongest possible response. 

Its like responding bomb threat near white house using entire US nuclear arsenal DC evacuations issued. literally, concept.

But again, expert . No, don't.

Herd immunity happen natural infection alone. this, fellow Fargo resident, con confirm this. Even business ‚Äúrequire‚Äù masks don‚Äôt give shit.

I‚Äôm looking Walmart 13th... this? Every single thread matter topic, country, etc someone like snarky comment shitting Americans. US start vaccinating literal day vaccine approved...and already firm date: December 11th. 

Please decent. Recommendations mix households, meanwhile mixed three different households. better cousins bashing. Plus test results snap shot 4-5 days prior test date plus whatever reporting time was. Negative tests place clear indefinitely really used rule potential exposures symptomatic, way rationalize breaking guildlines well. Florida Australia US. /u/amputatorbot even wanna guess bad crowd control Wal-Mart, best buy etc be...superspreader events sure. title makes sound like rising grave  I‚Äôm 85% certain we‚Äôll still crisis come next winter  I‚Äôve saying ages post articles Facebook, feels like screaming void. underlying health issues, concerned availability care disappears. We‚Äôre overpopulated anyway. Meanwhile right wing science denial universe, REAL story Washington post defamed Amuricans suggesting anything order here. think I‚Äôm joking, joking Ah yes ‚Äúgrease wheels economy blood people‚Äù approach. know doesn‚Äôt work? businesses need employees. likely contract Covid, nurses doctors, front line staff retail workers wait staff. Local businesses hard time staffing due many illnesses.

It‚Äôs quite problem balancing people needing income, business owners low income living paycheck paycheck, minimizing risk exposure. It‚Äôs LOT cheaper shutdown economy month absorb long term health care costs smaller number people (due deaths disabilities).

This social programs important. We've got 6 states million people. North Dakota 4th least populated Europe second wave people stopped caring, yet world watching America. Fear mongering. global pandemic, American pandemic someone working person school, I'd love 300$ bonus US thus far done stellar job managing this. Bravo! IFR vs CFR. *South Dakota would like word* pro-lockdown people around going disappointed. Sooo like 12 people? Thanks Trump virus information. hail champion fake. gonna ""low"" weekend since holiday. always like that. Tuesday gonna bloodbath day. Next week gonna see several days 3000 deaths. American logic... ‚ÄúI‚Äôll travel covid won‚Äôt happen me‚Äù.....
Buys powerball tickets ... ‚Äúyou never know‚Äù foolish give blanket immunity lawsuits related covid workplace conditions. instances posted complaints workplace took minimal efforts sanitize surfaces handled general public provide PPE adequate cleaning supplies workers, employee tests positive, require immediate coworkers quarantine test negative. 

Requiring exposed potentially virus spreading employees come work infect workers customers....and someone gets severely ill long covid dies....thats negligent could prevented thus employer liability, responsible letting sick employees exposed employees work. 

Workplace safety never get free pass, especially something contagious employers need take precautions help limit community spread. 

One employee allowed work sick infect easily 50+ people one day....and many go home to, knowing got exposed? doesn't. Stop lying. actually dudes tho Yeah like heard predator shows it‚Äôs everyone [15,000 people getting beers may general idea, it‚Äôs know nothing USA, it‚Äôs detailed enough know story mentioned above. way. better economy. makes feel INSANELY better! skipped parents' (super small) thanksgiving spent today feeling like good. country advocates that. Well much ending Christmas. God hope I'm wrong 3000 deaths per day around then. Time hunker next 3 months. Hope rest family friends stay safe. TIDE PODS president Mexico charged murder? Meanwhile democracies like Australia New Zealand, we've hitting zero new cases *nationally* increasing number days.

And we're islands either. goes 11. one sicker. national shutdown would better economy.  [15,000 people getting beers That's works champ I‚Äôm Japan, could it. Japanese people, whole, intensely concerned state America right now. (Also state America previous 4 years madness.) 34000 people died State. Get life Stupid fear mongering. Sure won‚Äôt completely disappear something able managed. lame PR stunt Jeff nurse US, want cry. last shift 14 hours COVID hell performing back back bedside dialysis treatments full PPE. Everyone unit seen 12 hour shifts go 14+ hours, even enough staff, enough dialysis machines run patients without working overtime. Every day I've off, except today holiday, I've full-time per diem job call begging help. 

Today found bunch older risk family exposed Covid due antimasker family member, want know Healthcare workers working bone US destroying itself. asked father law virus disappear election...his response, ""Because election yet."" Keep mind couple days ago. US public hold beer. Seriously people already ignoring covid getting together today Thanksgiving, also Christmas /New Year. realistic think back normal March /April vaccine available. Smoking cigarettes (when near others) puts health risk, going big gathering puts everyone else‚Äôs health risk too. goal Sweden **slow** spread, **stop** it.

Yes, strategy mid-march now. incorrect thing calling ""herd immunity"" one possiblel outcomes. strategy actively working towardst goal - working slow things much possible. Mike Judge fucking prophet. understanding healthier immune systems easily adaptable target covid specifically, eliminate it, unhealthy ones adapt quickly instead immune systems go overdrive essentially targeting everything, leading worse symptoms. asking it? European living America, don‚Äôt think significant portion Europeans aware specifics happens Simple denial. think people can't handle bad things happening. There's complex reasons people behaving think good old fashioned denial strong groups. *can't deal* truth bad things happen, pandemic, climate change, jobs automated away fossil fuels bad environment. threatens little comfort zone free even elect people also deny problems. 

Then breathe sigh relief heads sand, seeing destructive trains coming full speed. deny reality way death, since brings much comfort play pretend reality. Co-vid new flu cold?

Always going around next corner curable people ending hospital dying? 1 10 infected surely everyone knows someone suffered too? certainly world leaders stupidity selfishness. HIPAA puts big damper shown. immune disorders? half Americans needs done.

I think likely number thought 'safer' drive instead fly. I'm hopeful well many avoided travelling. 

Regardless, travel occur similar turning logs fireplace make sure wood left untouched. fire likely going flare pretty bad here. Nah low. brother went Chicago hare usually busy large airport, went security, checked bag got gate 15 min. Media definitely lying N95s short supply rationed heavily. also extremely difficult wear long periods time. Even wear one 24/7 take wrong, expose yourself. suggestion thoughtful practical. There‚Äôs need lure.

People quite willing go outside things like normal worries is, probably won't.

I think people willing break rules willing keep breaking them. They're also kind people say ""It's illegal get caught"" actually mean it.

If government imprisoned something completely believed correct do, tried re-educate you, even pulled _1984_ stuff out, would convince you?

It's hard problem because, even sheer force helps little, gonna fix totally. sheer force may help all, knows. impossible measure people refuse studied. Pretty sure lot Trump's cronies turtle fuck would've wanted this. post text. Well needs cleaned another enzyme. cleaved bonds fine. would accurate. wasted exercise. think rest world better things do, concerned Americans Thanksgiving. guess socially acceptable thing holidays sit dark corner alone house time year get paid day off, stare void consoling knowledge maybe get enjoy see people care year He‚Äôs like premier province. thinks it‚Äôs easier ask forgiveness ask permission. asshole guy is. AMP widely criticized many tech industry¬†for attempt Google exert dominance Web dictating websites built monetized, ""AMP Google's attempt lock publishers ecosystem"". I'm still trying get fact two Dakotas! professors shared academics/scientists public health policy experts' works virus even issue least 2 months explaining different models groups who've working together pandemics made. models made help governments, elected officials navigate contain virus + save everyone + keep economy healthy. Different models different times, different models different Guess countries give shit.

We've known current response work people economy least since 1918, politicians give crap back care either (most places seem handled pandemic properly e.g many Asian countries, NZ, Canada's Atlantic provinces). interest elected officials interests.

It seems like care one thing: businesses would support campaigns kept open slavery wearing masks

This makes zero sense me. wearing mask global pandemic even worse walking around naked, basically killing people, people get arrested latter former ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  You‚Äôre moron ! headed home LA Bay Area last night. whole family tested negative couple days ago.

I'm sure I've ""reported"" thread well. Okay guys, slow chat me: USA USA USA read comment twenty children double take, decided go first interpretation. Congratulations impressive brood! saw New Hampshire plate walk today . live Texas. nurse best friend works covid ward says: ""we never shit, Americans selfish stupid"". 1) secondary source meta-analysis regarding BMI mortality COVID-19 patients general.

Did even try? neighborhood lined double-parked cars day :( far nothing disturbance wise way many houses thanksgiving outside households  America, trains LiBrULs! won‚Äôt feel impact travel another 2 weeks

Wrong. feel impact travel 6+ weeks. clock start time travel, starts 3-14 days travel. that's initial wave. 1 person spreads 5 people, 5 people spread 25 people, taking days weeks so. spike hospitalizations deaths we're seeing *HALLOWEEN*. month ago. see Thanksgiving's real impact Christmas, Christmas late-January. dangerous right now, despite vaccinations looking really promising, general public likely even access March later (on optimistic timeline, approval next weeks). events building building.

This we're still likely end seeing 400,000+ deaths pandemic US. People needs done large enough numbers, continue case vaccine, mid-2021. Lots people going die. Grocery shopping good metric. stayed home family bought shit-ton food cook us...at grocery store. aloud California time ? mean can't get die, get infect others possibly kill someone. grade stupidity. Yes Morrison opening economy like Florida governor states ultimate power tell piss off. Same. I've grocery pickup since started months ago. hardly represents market volatility. like regular fluctuations healthy index. seems forced manufactured Honestly would rather people walk away ensure health crisis point never happens again.

Nothing would get stuff done every doctor nurse ready treat patients walking demanding National shutdown, stimulus package passed start government actually supporting health care program here.

Tho would probably instead lead simply chaos power grabs think it...people jobs status quo strength weakness US. that's ~~worst~~ **truest** thing i've heard week.

fixed okay, right? absolutely have, covid that. health care available all, kills maybe 5%. humanitarian disaster wipe civilisation. Don‚Äôt worry, many us watching dread disbelief. 

I heard family dessert contest person could bring entry. 45 people brought something. So, there‚Äôs many adults, plus kids. two suggestions.üôÇ

**1.** Mention explanation vaccine quick develop huge resources put towards it, importantly one reason trials completed fast high number infections pandemic. 

Most vaccine trials take long time takes long time get statistically significant sample, since actively infecting anyone wait certain number people get infected naturally.

**2.** Link Medcram's 

I know YouTube channel builds trust honesty transparency Dr Seheult extremely knowledgeable team generates, (and I've followed pandemic closely since early January). 

He also actively treating Covid19 ICU patients almost every day lot real world experience shares. operate gas stations interstate. set records fuel sales week. Sales roof. prediction ""didn't hold water""?

Was one said Sweden entered second wave month State Epidemiologist admitted Sweden entered second wave?

Or maybe recent prediction Sweden would 7000 cases per day end last week, three days FHM announced seven thousand cases day?

Oh, exactly prediction made previous post? possible ""tougher restrictions"" might showing affect last week? might result testing capacity reached?

Those ""predictions"" could say made previous post. Everything else verifiable fact recent past.

You desperation ignore reality even worse Tegnell's. least finally admitted people like right denying reality nearly two months. bar little mask wearing, people inebriated, shouting one another confined space zero social distancing.

This sounds exactly like typical Christian church America. Mussels! confirm. work hotel lot people drove see family. hard understand take mind uncanny ability Americans ignore things inconvenient them. feel like nearly everyone life, including people took seriously, point they're pretending things back normal live life usual, despite ICUs morgues near capacity.

What fucking get ignore now, worse gets future. could've taking precautions month two ago instead dining indoors crowding stadiums high school sports could safe Thanksgiving now. could skipped Thanksgiving locked down, maybe holiday season would saved.

But no. People going continue ignoring everything, living life usual, celebrating holidays.

Meanwhile, suspect I'm family's shit list refused group Thanksgiving I'm afraid they're going freaking meltdown tell numbers bad here, likely be, I'm absolutely in-person Christmas. Rather placebo controlled trial astrazeneca comparative trial astrazeneca vaccine may compared moderna Pfizer vaccines trial candidates get benefit vaccine. meant 101  includes Morehead MN too.  That‚Äôs meant. Go cry river lul Agreed. I‚Äôm fairly introverted, even I‚Äôve crying like baby seeing close family friends weeks/months. Right? It‚Äôs ridiculous. aunt left sick uncle (she sure Covid pneumonia), visit family Texas. took bus train absolutely positive husband Covid without regard anyone whatsoever. won‚Äôt wear mask. turn one invitation. It‚Äôs unreal. Greece EU average deaths... wait shopping starts. persistent stuff seemed bios cpu related. really doubted cpu, latest bios patch notes seemed address issue.

What great way zoom university. least laptop. Hey, nurses risk. thick life? wake up. real. one said legend. MANY getting harmed. go bank ask give credit card essentially way paying purchases internet. serves purpose people spend money - mostly. dropping say thank post. many people *minimizing pandemic*. laugh mouth closed. Shades election. I‚Äôll see way out. understand wanting wait bit, that‚Äôs okay. HPV vaccine came someone knew I‚Äôd always with, didn‚Äôt bother it. 

I always bad allergic reactions immune issues, I‚Äôm going keep living life safe can, like always have. doctor tell later people can‚Äôt get flu shot okay getting Covid one, I‚Äôll go it. I‚Äôm sooty. It‚Äôs awful.   Ah ok. One reddest leaning states union. Anyone trucker. need CDL license. hard get. Getting nursing school easy. COMMUNITY COLLEGES state get 600 applications 60 spots. Anyone GPA 3.6 getting end. 

We nursing shortage. trucker shortage. Educated professions important society fewer people them. require training. Absolutely agree rapid response key locking down. live Thailand first covid-19 death outside China recorded. also #1 foreign tourist destination China. critical Chinese New Year's period late Feb-March case numbers started climbing would expect. around 40 total deaths 200 new cases/day government locked-down. Hard. One month everyone staying home except essential travel. 10pm curfew. alcohol sales. Shutdown international inbound travel (in country tourism 20-30%of GDP).

The country reopened stages, bars restaurants last allowed reopen. Since May26 couple cases local covid-19 transmission. majority new cases returnees feom abroad subject two weeks mandatory quarantine state-approved hotel.

It harsh. People suffered emotionally financially. country became covid-19 free also quiet pride everyone pulled togeyher get handle thing. Two people live there. hard could also make argument people usually travel broke travel. think great see huge drop travel year's Thanksgiving everyone staying back wanted to. Hah, exactly. DeBlasio asshat, Cuomo actually dick literally halts important decision making safety protocol one make call. really don‚Äôt know many people love him. even leaders concerned political influence. can‚Äôt trust them, neither Yeah actually put man moon measures applied include social distancing measures   closure  schools,theaters, churches, banning mass gatherings, also measures mandated mask wearing, case isolation, making influenza notifiable disease, public disinfection/hygiene measures. Measures 1918 extensive measures used combat COVID-19 terms closing non-essential businesses. instance, rather closing businesses altogether, staggered business hours introduced mostly avoid crowding public transportation. doesnt matter thick fuck. people putting lives line eat 4th piece pie agree people acted reasonably. agree (mostly) 80 year old make decisions. 

However, everyone protect isolation. high risk go work support family. cannot completely isolate home. Therefore, 80 year old‚Äôs decisions infect others, infect others, come contact place work, even take precautions. I've known many people took road trips year. pre-planning avoid public restrooms food stops hotels. Never sounded terribly fun. none got sick. It‚Äôs pet peeve. Nothing you. know said form irony. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs wrong whole thing. hard 10% population get sick there's 30 people whole state personal experience though. I'm talking community based mindset instead individualism (which pandemic shine upon brightly) open-mindedness willingness trusting towards government. Even masculinity aspects patriarchal head-of-the-family sense instead usual ones see US. Sure want see statistics based economy government level similar agrees original post retaining original western 'biological' family dna That‚Äôs usually things happen. Market indexes drop /rise 1-3% close major news. Still represents billions could signal short term trend, not. Def momentary sentiment reaction confusion provided Zeneca news. top glove announcement Monday significant curious trend towards major factory closures result latest covid surge. Vietnam? They‚Äôre dictatorship? Thailand? COVID-19 civilization ender..... it'll leave gaping hole populace. Given way election played fact people acted regarding pandemic see test.

I know wasn‚Äôt comment, truly appreciate replying (even don‚Äôt agree all, awesome, thank you.) I‚Äôm still losing pity people don‚Äôt care, don‚Äôt think helps anyone denies severity situation. exposed 8 people better 180 plane PLUS 8 family members? Here's what's worth. wife works retirement home. required tested week period, symptoms not. Last week ended positive although symptoms all. 

Now, normal circumstances would gone aunt's house whole family Thanksgiving. One aunts obese, pre-diabetic, high blood pressure, several surgeries last year etc. One uncles lung cancer, heart issues, lung removed couple years back. 

Now, agreed months ago take holiday matter what. However, bit less diligent wife worked somewhere else test would two people family sure would dead Christmas got virus, question. thinking today easily could happened innocently wanting spend holiday together. worth risk right now. right thing, feel bad question it.

Not every scientist belongs union. planet huggers refer Earth Gaia. Terra? Hardly ever used. Luna? Meh. 

I'm glad we've chatted. Get telescope binoculars! got union info, use Moon? makes virus truly frightening.

Good thing there's internet Covid yet Covid way contagious flu much deadly. see fallen trap comparing estimated flu death numbers Covid death numbers. again, post helpful explainer flu death estimates CDC, people continue misinformed. 

Why doesn‚Äôt CDC base seasonal flu mortality estimates death certificates specifically list influenza?

Seasonal influenza may lead death causes, pneumonia, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. recognized many years influenza underreported death certificates patients aren‚Äôt always tested seasonal influenza infection, particularly elderly greatest risk seasonal influenza complications death. deaths ‚Äì particularly among elderly ‚Äì associated secondary complications influenza (including bacterial pneumonias).

It hinge it, even lasting immunity impossible - strategy would same.

The problem describing strategy correctly mainly Sweden (and misinterpreted strategy) turned political tool US, think quite dishonest unhelpful long run everybody.

Yeah, people choose travel people meticulously clean hands touching shared surfaces? Well- state government going activate military procurement get materials y‚Äôall need? State government getting hospital anything needs enforcing stay home orders save hospital system. 2 weeks time solved Well, that's headline American exceptionalism, even negative.

Trust me, world watching disbelief, they're going: ""Oh fuck, Christmas coming"". Europe trouble too, people social animals they're sick tired restrictions. natural, also; we're fuuuucked.

Californians cautious &amp; proactive i'm sure different flyover states. Maybe activate National Guard enforce law order? Make people wear masks street, routine business sweeps. virus literally killing fraction population.

Let's calm now. people become weak one Thanksgiving done video call much sacrifice make?

I keep thinking constantly Thanksgiving. 

My mom one people ""needs"" regular in-person social interactions even though I've moved back her. thinks taking virus seriously takes ton unnecessary risks. think myself, would still things war invading army? live Florida never heard one fucking person say this. I'm calling gaslighters everyone reads mail know means, trying spin cast doubt it. think people want herd immunity they're evil, would cartoonish. totally agree! husband made plans months ago drive timeshare New Orleans, go bike rides cook meal condo. thing got worse, followed CDC canceled. everyone know Broward followed advice. But, rest state! Lord, help us! Sure might result exact outcome (lockdowns mask mandates least), Australia New Zealand right start aggressive test, trace isolate scheme. fact, around mid-February Australia conducted tests entirity US did, despite 14x difference population.

Even first lockdown, testing scheme continued go on. Once, Sydney 20 new cases day. response? Thousands tests. days 20,000+ tests turned one positive test result. Baaically, Aussie cities kept guard (aggressive testing contact tracing) despite experiencing strong declines new cases, helped prevent huge resurge like ones Europe (or even places US) managed keep numbers low point.

P.S. could expect similar even greater population densities Oz NZ cities compare US counterparts size.  Oh gets friend. ""let go"" thing truly control you. half thought space thankfully. traveled early work thankfully means isolate away me. stay away 14 days test negative.  knows travels like again, exact thing.  me.

IAC, I'll impressed vaccine rollout goes smoothly. untrue, 90% sub.

Your body absorb blood clots. blood clots dangerous, others not. blood clot last 10 years (biologically physically impossible) suddenly kill you.

Also original post (unrelated comment) says nothing importance. Blood clots form body active time (and add weakened immune system that). mean coronavirus creates blood clots. Literally every disease creates blood clots, look way.  there's effective leadership, one could make everyone work together common goal, would still work democratic country.

I think leadership, freedom speech, Chinese government silence dissidents, North American Western European governments can't, even dissidents spreading conspiracies. far fetched tbh, Kangtai Bio licence produce AZ's vaccine within China Specifically, going give pricey IV infusion doses best given serious symptoms. 0.5% build wall... He's liar... see that? ups downs. stranger entire family means life lessons passed on, lack important relationships.

That said, street PACKED cars yesterday Thanksgiving.

It true time, true announced recently separate press release conducting new global trial. part comment 'Russian propaganda'? enough. second wave currently 3 times worse first. people absolutely nothing stop it.

Sure, longer vulnerable getting infected 0.2% chance dying still bad odds. European, full entertainment nigh 5 years watching US slowly dissolve puddle stupidity self ownage. I'm still staggered despite erosion freedoms last 20 years, piece material face - keep people alive ot kind loss freedom - seems galvanising people protest. Never mind country's infrastructure tatters, people dying easily treatable diseases can't afford drowning debt, little thing mouth that's really got people riled up. 


It's long chalk yet, truck full popcorn order 2021 hopefully trial Trump prison time. Maybe pockets civil war spice up. No, downvote don‚Äôt understand difference disney company disney person. Australia (Queensland) 14 cases. (14 still high btw, would like 0)

The world watches dread disbelief *as prepares get together Christmas.*

We know what's coming, woods yet. üòï cousin, got positive covid test STILL SICK went large family Thanksgiving (it side family threw it, shared side). aunt flabbergasted horrified. posted photos playing little kids. don‚Äôt know anymore, angry, sad, exhausted it. comment making fun people saying flu. That's /s for. I‚Äôm discounting hardships she‚Äôll under, crazy good way human live removing replacing entire lungs. It‚Äôs perfect course, medical science astounding sometimes. Here‚Äôs graph airport TSA checkpoint travelers comparing 2019 &amp; actually conversation last night. watching Indiana Jones Last Crusade started talking Sean Connery (RIP). 90 passed, objectively old. realized young fight WWII. *That‚Äôs* realized everyone weak ‚Äî collective memory actual struggle disappearing. people actually lived anything remotely tough they‚Äôre dying even higher rates due corona. Good mentioned year. That's good point.  keep reminding grandparents survived war eating tulip bulbs, neighbourhood cats men sleeping floor boards. age kids now. kids ok. many parients making plans vacation visiting families. cancer patients, may another Thanksgiving future cant blame them. Without viable alternative, choose put lives risk say goodbye. That's true still test like 25% people. I'll getting vaccine soon I'm allowed world America. Someone tell Bezos hire better writers. gear going really bad December amount cars I've seen peoples driveways Thanksgiving went car ride horrible two small hospitals serve 3 counties already getting swamped cases exploded. Americans entitled, dumbest, selfish, irresponsible population citizens among developed countries. developing. Wow aware that...thank ignore elephant room long. laughing dead Americans believe actually happens. depressing sitting watching TV playing video games day

...lol Ok turns information outdated, 300 million doses august. cranked 610 million doses, link enough produce themselves. borders shut Australia too, even citizens struggling get back. govt release multiple vaccines . hope Fauci get . imagine lot people might valid reasons fly too. Oh well St. Louis problem, can‚Äôt possibly happen anywhere else‚Ä¶ /s joke grandma one family confirmed it. Got picked due random test appointment. joke avoiding grandparents safety ours.  Technically, need 7 square feet. would want family get covid got together thanksgiving? Thats pretty stupid Whenever see argument calling anything special healthcare workers, it‚Äôs always met ‚Äúyeah truck drivers farmers waiters and....‚Äù

So much America doesn‚Äôt want anyone benefit something aren‚Äôt directly benefitting too. It‚Äôs sad.  Absolutely. cavalry like Wuhan New York had.

We short ventilators, I'm sure people expected given 11 months in! supposed civil someone says they‚Äôd rather let die? Also add on, show symptoms test positive come back symptoms go away. get retested come back negative. still carrier virus return work hospital. Think many people don‚Äôt get flu shot year. they‚Äôre anti-vax completely apathetic idea it. apathy, especially time, scares me. least flu know it, stay home symptomatic. Asymptomatic carriers don‚Äôt care get vaccine every year danger medically can‚Äôt get vaccine all. great time Thanksgiving yesterday. Went gatherings 20+ sides family. Things felt normal there, relieved much stress hard, talking people thrown caution wind theres reason think they‚Äôd avoid going shops. Approx. 80% confirmed Covid cases smell/taste issues. regular colds going around addition Covid, fact taste/smell issues rule Covid. Um no. would thing would flu vaccines. Get booster shots year (or however long immunity effective for). vaccines life, last long need more. masses must remain distracted, alive. Jangling keys costs next nothing. That's works. know people come contact outside work day day. may wild night town last night got infected. Symptoms take 3-5 days show. wear masks work, husband protected certain degree. get together maskless bar work, get infected may die it. Plus, maskless restaurant bar people may infected.

Even workplace bubble, mean safe mingle outside bubble. coronavirus pandemic surges across country, hospitals facing crisis-level shortage beds staff provide adequate care patients. excruciating pain lesions face scalp, Tracey Fine lay 13 hours gurney emergency room around her, Covid-19 patients filled beds hospital Madison, Wis. nurse harried could remember Ms. Fine‚Äôs condition, staff slow bring pain medicine small rural hospital Missouri, Shain Zundel‚Äôs severe headache turned brain abscess. condition would typically required operation within hours, forced wait day doctors struggled find neurosurgeon bed ‚Äî finally hospital 375 miles away New Mexico Minnesota Florida, hospitals teeming record numbers Covid patients. Staff members smaller hospitals beg larger medical centers repeatedly take one more, one patient, many bigger hospitals sharply limited transfers accept, halls wards overflowing. Selfish weak morons, specific exactly embodies concern.

Right everything 'looks' good paper. Right everything looks safe paper. history shown new products new procedures new ways things unintended unforeseen outcomes possible. happened asbestos. happened Boeing. happened dozens medications medical procedures medical appliances past (which even begin address complete total lack support compensation get injured).

RNA tech brand new. nothing sinister may ever come it, comfortable complete total absence long term research new technology. 

I absolutely take one vaccines using traditional well-established methods. anti-vax person people concerned brand new *untested* technology portrayed such. new. reported many times. kid even lot adult teeth. Frim remember cause vascular, clots something. unlikely rare change confirmed happen numerous cases. Bison pleased hear news, ask humans leave land, leave gates open. Labor laws. example California decided Uber drivers don‚Äôt deserve health care. State labor laws: short staffed even pandemic. Nursing programs space 10 students yet 300+ apply every year schools near me. enough nurses training right bat, also pretty much every hospital chronic understaffed issues quality life issues, scheduling keeping little staff possible save money.

The whole system fucked, crumbling headed straight cliff shit ever happened. anyone shocked country one getting hit hardest? [archive link anyone trouble accessing article lack testing availability. Tests given across US free. greedy company doesn‚Äôt want pay employees protection well being. filter news corp rubbish interesting stuff remains. 60s supposed love peace. two guys want assholes? allowed? sanction somehow even seek testing own? see that's enforceable. mean, know they'd figure way penalize somehow, utter complete BS. Yeah, biggest point everyone sit outside. Kids never went house example. [There certainly Hitler Trump. One calling media fake, another moral tactics Republicans used Democrats. Ah yes. modern American's take freedom aka. ""I dont like consequences actions fuck got mine.""

Like communism idea social credit pretty good. Throw human greed propensity abuse fuck whatever breaks pretty fast. covid roommate? Sounds like good social distancing. Everyone I've talked parties covid. ones actually listened don't. really hard chill? nope y'all MUST leave house Eh, fair, us already pretty dead inside COVID hit. People contagious much day two experiencing symptoms. Covid, everyone Thanksgiving potentially exposed. whole reason authorities begged people large get togethers. could zoomed seen family exposed anyone. Urgent care LPN here. run dozens rapid tests day 24/7 clinic. I've come contact confirmed case every single shift. 3 day shift doctors tested positive, one hospitalized, guess got tested? None us. 


I coming shift oncoming team told me, ""hey hear [insert name here] tested positive?"" Well shit, work regularly. got tested symptoms got worse shift working. thing doctor ended hospitalized. patients come every week tested required job. Meanwhile, majority us **never** tested. 


When NBA still street Orlando, staff athletes got tested twice week.


We're exposed much compare triaged positive cases shift. 


Please wear mask make sure nose. breathe nose. Wash hands. Please stay home. state rollout plan. check government site state. part executive branch.

Sigh, yeah. otoh probably bunch bullshit propaganda russian troll farms astroturfing social media.

He's symptom disease, disease problem. Even outskirts, watch grow end electing dipshit Franco-Trump well clearly doesnt work health care

for every person helped, capitalistic health care taken life gf RN particularly busy nights she‚Äôll get floated Covid floor. also never tested.  also never asked doesn‚Äôt seem concerned it. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Well, yiu make necklace everyone see even wear mask. devgru seal team 6 elite operator level dumb take. 


Go Somalia doctors, let know works out. Must living 100 lack medical mistakes. info rollout states yet?

Hope everyone safe. :)  There‚Äôs thing 100% safe, always risk. Right risk nothing weights risk new vaccine presents. healthcare workers. want fuck too. Listen, everyone clapped sang songs March, nurses want? treated like hero's everyone claimed were?

Well score touchdown? Win NBA finals? Hoist Lord Stanley's Cup? No?

Then Americans care. never cared. Things like shooty hoops, football boring fucking baseball important ticket sales, merch television viewership.

America cares entertain everything else paid five minutes lip service How‚Äôs different eating inside restaurant? NY still 25% mandate there.  Bullshit. go get test want one. Oh no! fined insignificant amount money!? time hear 'essential worker' think scene Schindler's List old guy shoveling snow. tells SS man he's essential worker.

Then SS man shoots head.  He's totally one people year 2020. He's like world's doctor right now. We've depended lot man steady strong. love dude. really rather nothing let 100% people die let bunch people learn fly try save them? Even 99% people die still better trying all... point flaws logic? Ah okay. Thank informing me. Thanks link. strange symptoms I'm feel mild, I'm sure there's wide range symptoms associated mine worse most. already know nurses probably covid.  

If tested nurses, showed positive, would harder require go work anyway, might pressure quarrantrine coworkers. 

And maybe required inform patients, possibly setting litigation infecting otherwise healthy patient 9ie, one getting elective surgery etc). Fuck, that‚Äôs negligence.

I hope screening process works well protects you. Seriously? guys care NOW. Firefighters make average $15-$20 bucks hour. Could care less point trying make. argument draws comparison millionaire athletes literal fucking slavery downright absurd Agreed. grandma 81 told us come Thanksgiving might last wants spend people loves. holed homes day, away family friends, way live. Almost !RemindMe 18 days Outside helps sure. Doesn‚Äôt sound like you‚Äôre making claim lies. many lies. boyfriend works VA yet get test, frustrating let's hope distant future kind surgery looked barbaric there's insanely better noninvasive treatment option. lol sorry making joke one dudes comment basically saying NFL numbers exact figure nurses account ""individual experience"". go say mother law gets tested every week using ""individual experience"".

Basically dude exactly saying article fault doing. True, got grocery store option bread there. fault? Maybe uncle careful. Hospital clinical staff already that. showing visible signs wealth, already placed back line. feelings mean nothing compares spread virus. moment war something taking 1.3k+ people daily terrible way. terms virus. People miss friends family want hang friends family bad people.

They bad people struggling. bad people they're acting that. we're terrible spread we're point hospitals overwhelmed. usually host holidays family Easter Christmas. We've celebrations involving people outside house since March, including children's birthdays. delivered food love yesterday instead chancing health, absolutely Christmas. Meanwhile, I've seen family members FB birthday parties 1 year old 3 year old, visiting great grandparents, one wearing mask socially distancing. 2 family members even spoken husband since didnt show kids birthdays. point, wish harm, really wish they'd open eyes. Absolutely agree. 

What proves useful? point similar systems rebranded used countries. seems cherry picked. know 4 nurses 3 different facilities. tested regular schedule. asked (and families) test heading anywhere Thanksgiving. Look maybe amaze dots. Sure fine. also testing pretty wide spread general. get 15 minute rapid test number healthcare vendors. get free testing county day week. Obviously changes outbreaks capacity pushed. guys kidding aren‚Äôt options healthcare workers. Well, right now, pretty much one letting Americans in. escape tried. Same, NYC. yet swabbed lol Sounds like normal day Best Korea happened today, agree that's would go. curious see happens narrative January 20th. seems like least people might change views impacts personally.  It‚Äôs irritating, people need make mind up. un-notable, been? so, reward us attention, validating approach? It‚Äôs worst worlds. opinion still top lot fields: innovation, unapologetic capitalism, space travel, etc. people don‚Äôt want acknowledge whatever reason. deathcare Bahahaha, link tabloid news source? Well, right already 2,000 daily deaths US. Considering number cases deaths rising, Thanksgiving quite likely give boost, appear unlikely. Thankyou make doctors/nurses part healthcare system fucks people financially, yeah, people going start hating doctors nurses whether admit whether part problem Eric Clapton great 40 years ago downhill ever since. he's old, tired, right-wing hack. disgrace. I‚Äôm sure people expect first class care get infected.

100%, denial then. antibiotic, keen start selfmedicating antibiotics üôÅ fair people need CDC tell horrible time travel it!!! think people care?

The destination covid 'the end', however comes about.

It's 'defensive driving' COVID instead. 2300 people tested enough get EUA US, maybe higher dose given EUA, way lower dose given EUA.


Pfizer 44k people trial, Moderna 30k people trial, people still cautious it. one wants sacrifice. live parents knew visit grandma grandpa live street over. 50 degrees out, suggested thanksgiving outside campfire. dad board, saying really anxious it. soon get there, instantly went inside 20 minutes talked them.

My family 11 people, none us sick wear masks, gloves out, hand sanitizer on. made sure hug Holiday still gathering. 

I mean yeah virus sucks think really gauge family. Like family bunch hillbobs saying yee-yee going open mic night bars every weekend sure go visit family, guys taking care properly, treat yourself. Still conscious, hugging, kissing etc, see family. Australia New Zealand part Western world fail.  positive thing? means mortality rate much higher. aftermath two weeks Christmas holiday season quite scary assume. people social distance Thanksgiving certainly Christmas either. Well, ones intensive care least.  really disagree, Swedish updates happening since May far nobody argued inappropriate subreddit. specific country (and many similar threads Germany, Netherlands, France, etc) specific information local level, official information provided sources links databases websites get data. 

Furthermore, see 50-100+ comments regularly posts come people constantly arguing views (this discussion about) lot also people supplying relevant Sweden information.

But definitely dedicate next banana milk popcorn chicken you. clearly understand herd immunity then. mean disease goes away. means infections stop rising exponentially. herd immunity stuff like small pox/polio,

IIRC realistic projection 10% vaccinated then. vaccines approved could 0. everything approved quickly could more. know yet, I'm tired eagerness crucify Trudeau. None us know negotiations went. would shocked country agrees sell vaccines others people. Sure, would ignoring transmission, no? Woooo type gang rise up!! Mathematicians got this, trust me. sample, extrapolate, smooth, spline, measure errors. know. possible know, will. Never underestimate degree humans think low odds = zero.

It‚Äôs unlike anything we‚Äôve ever done before, lot fun. get theater yourself. could play phone wanted to. yelled screen bit even since knew coming (my wife never saw Beetlejuice before). interact humans wearing masks (concessions, ticket takers), felt pretty safe. 

If love going much, maybe that‚Äôs something consider? easy vaccinate quickly need hire lot nurses pharmacists administer shots. already nursing shortage due uptick hospitalizations. going pay people money vaccinate tons people. federal government find funding hire adequate staff lot vaccine doses sitting still. know exactly apples apples thing happening refinery. implemented bogus quarantine protocols can't afford entire unit out. required tests come back, symptoms 72 hours good enough. Close all. virus eradicated. fund them. Stimulus money. every person small business. Fellow rad tech, hospital asking get tested show 2 symptoms. Even possibly exposed tell us monitor symptoms occur tested. friend nurse hospital they're probably going run tests next couple weeks. shared example low quality studies ongoing misinformation campaigns still,promoting Hqz. seeing granddaughter til God knows when.

Make set jump hoops next time. survive holidays. Dread, disbelief bucket popcorn Uh government handles nursing license. also probably take away whim especially nurse causes trouble local province region based restrictions certain stores closed supposed travel regions, except work school, can't transmit COVID places.

Hiring populist assholes instead scientists educated people really impact time crisis Sounds lot like Reddit actually. ‚ÄúThink banned!‚Äù aren‚Äôt. Australian, living Berlin: agree! catch outside work though, there's way prove caught it. bare minimum would letting take unpaid time catch it, required use PTO. Cast system effect. half nurses facilities work area don‚Äôt work units designated Covid+ units. focus needs professionals. 56 year old aunt works telemetry unit doesn‚Äôt see Covid patients. like watching head collision two trains impact travelled length carriages yet. People train still sitting looking phones idea get thrown length car. wife‚Äôs Aunt. One sons living wife baby lost job. son dad tested positive whole family 6 children children got together yesterday. also anti-van refuse wear masks.

Fucking idiots.

My family wife‚Äôs family stayed home, didn‚Äôt even walk outside yesterday lol Thanks compliment fam You‚Äôre wrong arent alone...hang there! I‚Äôm saying Florida well means also run 5 times many tests Florida per day entire country Japan does. know discoatmyfuneral day? maybe they're mma fighter, work bomb squad.

anywhere could get sick. what's wrong small, careful gathering, especially happens outside? Tik tok? dad uses tik tok? Fauci sitting home right now, laughing ass I've seen evidence 'hating women'.

Then blind. Post article COVID affecting women. downvoted filled sexist comments. I‚Äôm physician two COVID inpatient task forces/groups local hospital tell exactly doesn‚Äôt happen.

Week week, hospital outbreak hospital outbreak, pushed staff regularly tested especially working Covid teams/Covid units. currently testing patients admission Covid, retesting day five admission still admitted -. many, many patients come back positive already admitted initially negative, either indicates window period initial testing, giving them. losing nurses patient care techs left right outbreaks go unchecked contact tracing minimal; direly need regular staff testing even practicing universal precautions.

If anything, hospital administration gone way make difficult tested. testing locations offsite (despite easily capacity handle testing hospital occupational health center), available times day feasible staff, long lines. fighting administration nearly daily basis past three months, fairly confidently say reason staff regularly tested hospital administration/business people want staff regularly tested. don‚Äôt want potential Workmen‚Äôs Comp. costs, don‚Äôt want deal staff shortages, don‚Äôt wanna deal back plans replace staff need Covid, don‚Äôt want sued patients/family find got Covid providers/care team members, all, want push narrative staff catching Covid outside hospital outbreaks units (because pay fix issue). 

Honestly point I‚Äôm kinda BS unfortunately worst yet come somebody voice reason bullshit press ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I've read predictions holiday spending projected up, possibly consumers still jobs spending travel entertainment. Still, find shocking. Everyone know totally lost interest shopping year...just seems pointless kinda gross may well that, makes sense care us. Agree...especially reading Australia...yes know got money too...just think many things could BETTER. can't imagine talk 20 individuals year. play cards right I'll never smoke someone again. It‚Äôs highly unlikely it‚Äôs 90% effective. AZ criticized scientists deceptive announcing numbers. least pulled numbers small subset patients made headline number. questionable ethically. Second didn‚Äôt reveal dose error small number wasn‚Äôt even prespecified analysis. highly ethically challenged. reason things considered ethical produce conclusions highly unreliable. tout way absolutely horrific. 

There‚Äôs zero percent chance higher efficacy numbers think end put complete picture together it‚Äôs going 60-70%. that‚Äôs everything know including low phase I/II antibody numbers know problems using adenovirus vectors. One Chinese approaches human adenovirus vector efficacy numbers also really bad phase I/II.

Finally things mind it‚Äôs still left ‚Äúif‚Äù. mRNA vaccines already showed effectiveness likely start vaccinating next month estimated 20 million already completed US end year. It‚Äôs beginning end nobody US going wait AZ quite honestly repair damage already caused itself. stop this.who gives shit pro athletes .why still kissing celebrities asses . Well, good enough fish...  sub hates women

How earth come conclusion? Also mods men here... biases found I've seen instances evidence 'hating women'. Well, could live that. everyone could. There's way way way nurses athletes. Aww, poor millionaires getting filthy rich playing games. 

The true victims guess. Check mouth piece, kinda cool. anyone else tired big group project feels like us work? (NY) normally 30+ thanksgiving. year 10 local tested. family Zoom dinner still got chats. See family, person. Survive Thanksgiving you‚Äôll enjoy rest them. That's okay. Friends let friends friends friends hangout friends friends pandemic. Sorry, could link article. As*

Not if. long share point view friends family, you‚Äôll never worry asked take care ailing loved one: they‚Äôll already know aren‚Äôt helping. Same, world. Same. And? What‚Äôs attempted point? find left leaning news networks repulsive. dont like opinions presented fact, told need feel certain way. find left leaning sources moral-authoritarian / disagree enemy sort stuff. Interesting feel right leaning people blind, see thing left. growing divide every time make sweeping generalities ""other"", try to. Yep, that's threat whenever Texans brag big everything Texas. Hospital near $10k bonus new new nurses. Still getting enough.  sounds, actions explicitly tell she‚Äôs POS. Good defense awesome controlling lmao  facility honestly Bread Circus must continue. Remember people said shit would blow summer. prosperous period America post WW2. 18-45 year olds lived Iraq war abs Great Recession. going second recession 10 years one generation. Income inequality time highs. 

Painting picture everyone easy bit misleading.

The hyper individualism decades neoliberal capitalist propaganda become cultural norms. consumerism, dissolving community, conflict attitude - matters everyone else. It‚Äôs rotted top down. satellite tv mostly reliable goes storms. land line phone 50% reliable. 

If wants cell service get car drive 5 miles park side road make call. restrictions charge.  Found missing link! definitely made point mention distancing (school online, safeguards within family) husband works public raises risk them. might retired working home am, spouse able customers coworkers comes contact turn safe precautions futile sacrifices unintentionally. crazy. Stupid. That‚Äôs word. Stupid. 

Sorry calling people like crazy. That‚Äôs offensive people mental health problems. hospital one top NyC. hospital charged staff $5 turkey lunch plate thanksgiving. Hospital staff died, everyone‚Äôs burned out, pandemic getting worse over. cheap. Honestly it‚Äôs weird like right things riskier ever yet people also lax ever been. refuse test nurses wife‚Äôs hospital get covid paid time off.

As result nurse work covid patients leaving they‚Äôre making floors send extra nurses work covid patients.


But it‚Äôs fine put sign says ‚Äúheroes work here‚Äù feel super appreciated. ""not bad"" extreme understatement. Spanish flu killed 1 150 Americans. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs testing shortage NFL players NBA players get many tests want.‚Äù

-my dad future? think biggest factor that's going ""It happen me"" mentality. - individually, that's small problem vast majority population brazenly thinking like - unfortunately, end result actually happen them. inflationary use strong words little things unsetteling. Agreed North Dakota Yeah, hindsight 20/20, agree, would voted every time came knew going big mess almost zero gain. Lol stop it! phrase never uttered sincerely. actually thought someone needed help cared well-being, offering it. really want tell think better me, mocking concept people helping other. Lol, know. commenting phenomenon large; predates sweater weather. corrupt crisis ever. test nurses? would send home lose profit. test athletes? otherwise would stay home lose profit.

Everyone sees hypocrisy choose convenient narrative themselves. like Soviet newspaper Pravda, everyone read nobody believed it. dont talk help get one every Monday facility, thousands nurses dealing COVID-positive clients region. don't, blame employer, somebody else's employer. name Oxford vaccine ""The like, 'Have got Johnson yet?'¬†It would nice gesture him, years would become kind generic name.¬†Have got Johnson yet? got Johnson; I'm fine.""

If worried sounds bit‚Ä¶ strange, could probably use ""Boris"" instead. Overpaid overstaffed career path actually step plate committed to.


If signed Army peacetime sweet benefits war hits, dont get complain it. surprising fact. festive season cases across world started rising, India‚Äôs cases started decreasing. whole thing hogwash.  people fucking crazy think stimulus comes from? already happened :( case haven‚Äôt noticed federal government, including OSHA, done fuckall protect workers. once, I'm glad something agree Kiwi. 

I sent question mods well referred rule ""keep information quality high"". even seen front page? really sucks, yeah, I've seeing something similar. grandmother-in-law died last week, in-laws decided wanted throw big Thanksgiving get together husband alone. yesterday, 7 elderly relatives 60-95, plus number kids grandkids, got together grand-in-law's house. confused slightly offended attend. Wishing best you‚Äôre family. anything catastrophic happen you‚Äôre mother would really *unlucky*. uncle who‚Äôs 60, overweight smoked cold symptoms. 

Take solace fact you‚Äôre mother almost certainly fine. Hope goes well. beat this!   Yes, made dumbass decisions like opening schools despite damning initial data Israel (they opened 5/17 within 2 months horrific exponential growth). Kids don‚Äôt get sick developed countries (they die poverty stricken areas malnourished anemia) kids carry viral loads higher hospitalized patients super spreading machines. EU countries allowed bars gyms - well known high infection places - open. allowed people gather large groups. Sweden learned hard way herd immunity without vaccine straight doesn‚Äôt exist experienced advantages initial policy.

The US simply never attempted mitigation. Decisions made politicians, scientists, sold false dichotomy we‚Äôd choose economy virus mitigation. we‚Äôre completely fucked, mostly fucked. true suppression we‚Äôve seen harsh, restrictive lockdowns exponential growth really takes off. NY shutting things 3% positivity rate. places Midwest 50%, days I‚Äôve seen high 86% (single day, 7 day average, still significant data).

If didn‚Äôt want people fly, closed airports. We‚Äôve already learned negative covid test doesn‚Äôt guarantee protection, especially considering much forgery we‚Äôve seeing. isn‚Äôt issue ‚Äúrugged individualism‚Äù - whole reason humans leaders make decisions hopefully benefit group whole. leader deliberately fucked things up, kept fucking up. Supreme Court headed full stupid mode opening churches - KILL PEOPLE. LOTS people. catastrophe directly due complete failure absence leadership needed most. government abandoned us worst catastrophe living memory. Thanks nuke kind stranger!

Yes, both. CDC numbers. guess don‚Äôt agree narrative. Real scientific you! Lol Facebook always trash. 

It cleaner Myspace, also trash, cleaner friendster, also trash... go on, internet social phone networks, trash.

The thing makes trash users, trash.

Platforms revolving around selfish portrayals never trash.

Trash in.. Trash out.. time Ivy league students make trash. Please Denver, recall hypocrite toss rear. 4700 last year made go vs. guess anywhere else? free education?

My childhood best friend went megachurch pastor holds completely opposite views virtually every topic, association place. Sounds like kind comment people make New Zealand Australia. Ignorant fact people live densely populated cities like everywhere else. Always Thank that, people blame one side another depending get news from. reality sides fault form another. it‚Äôs wild made information easier get, technologically, easy get largely incorrect information made really needed depth information. People also mistake communication factual information. problem convenience, bias, lack curitiba thinking. South Africa sale alcohol **actually** got banned while.... even buying cigarettes illegal

... months! Oh man turned MANY corners. 
Literally spinning control circles.  guess gets vaccine last travels alley holes it? \^\^ can‚Äôt understand large potion population don‚Äôt give shit, really don‚Äôt. selfish? Yes, thank reality. Also Ohio isn‚Äôt releasing data Thanksgiving RemindeMe! 2 weeks Isla Vista's hellhole due populated almost entirely UCSB SB City College students?  experts paid lie.

he high risk person it. Get life lol I‚Äôd wish felt passionate comes unethical practices hospitalization Yep. bothers requirement wear masks...also people think spend day around wear masks fashion, surprised still get sick. god‚Äôs sake, discovered eye doctor...and going around wearing shields. 
All said, I‚Äôd still rather see someone wearing mask imperfectly none all, fact least socially acceptable wear mask tell people back off, counts lot. new zealand, except also cold summer, spring autumn too. anyone see conflicting guidance?? ridiculous. ""I'm sorry saw I'm hypocrite."" slogan beginning look .... prophetic. 100 million by... mid Jan? Nope. half cases third deaths per capita. Right now.  must face facts. people living Dark Ages world science enlightenment passes by. Existence battle better gaming platform, sex, house, cars, boat - understanding world around them, matter, themselves, history, universe.

Lol, almost sounds like behavioral consequences come hyper competitive capitalism people conditioned decades centuries believe important thing life social/economic status comparison people always put interests material wealth gains concern environmental/scientific health hazards endangering people. cost getting rid Trump Hey game like living worlds.

I learn one day get isekai mc win dr stone. thing Europe. think Australia lying numbers, bad Europe USA, Australia tiny island middle ocean. Yeah that's nearly enough herd immunity. top that, many people already getting reinfected it. Casting doubts viability herd immunity workable strategy anyways.  Unless daughter adopted, inherited least 1/2 trash genes mom. Maybe dad shallow end gene pool too, F‚Äôd are.  I'm informed subject. number re-infection statistically zero. Yes number go up. Yes, immunity likely wane time passes. re-infection rate low literally statistically zero, time immunity wanes, well dozen vaccines. Yeah, fuck concept buoyancy!  People learn experience first-hand. information nothing hear-say. Especially multiple sources constantly contradicting other. People don‚Äôt know believe anymore. takes back original point ‚Äî people learn experience first-hand. No, hospitals don‚Äôt get strained point rationing medical treatment. Last time last pandemic 100 years ago Texans devotes life football can't even get NFL team winning record. SAD! came virtual family arguments. Someone please provide think bernie getting people hope another democratic candidate future.  Hadn‚Äôt heard that. source could link to? entire western hemisphere neverending cavalcade failure. could avoided every country taken short term pain eliminate virus, coordinated way, yet see shit lifting lockdowns moment infections tick down. ends virus migrate incubate places fewest restrictions, biding time reinfect again.

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED going on, they‚Äôve since died since restrictions mask use lifted last week. It‚Äôs comforting see people still wearing regardless rules lifted! Nah PM nothing this, Dan Andrews Overseas travel likely need vaccination certificate, like need Yellow fever vaccination certificate going many tropical countries. click bait opinion piece story ""news website"" written conspiracy peddler used work Alex Jones infowars. Theres info owns webpage like reputable news organization would 


The main point actual CDC recommendations gather people live outside home. 


All recommendations essentially people refuse listen main advice. glad we're retired.

good first :)

\- centers: agree. seems like crazy big numbers. basic maths I'm sure (The article says 4000 per center possible must base estimation something)

\- article talks Berlin. mean big German cities already similar plans

\- Pfizer/biontech reportedly produce 1.3 billion vaccines end 2021 (and there's companies well know equally promising).

Man know. I'm tired need go sleep. end day we'll wait see feel like finally things going us. think it'll easy peasy either. think next winter considerably better. maybe even decent. might wrong let's hope I'm not. all, can't trust stranger internet trust?

sleep well stay healthy! almost think would that. positive percentage 30 percent higher think testing 3x. Hopefully close French Laundry Newsom's winery. ""Fuck, Nino Christmas could lit."" 
""Fuck Nino Christmas"" ????????? attend game two shit teams 3-7 records 3-7 shit division. Gyms next business take off. Pretty sure comment mocking Disney, employees. work rhyme scheme probably put album together Nice point say natural selection? ü§î It‚Äôs end result Dunning-Kruger effect: it‚Äôs hard keep research new information; think lot people find easier promote salacious lie makes good story put time truly become knowledgeable topic. all, already know much subject: friend‚Äôs cousin really cool Facebook devoted facts rest sheeple asleep figure out. got spare $3,000 spend hotel quarantine extra 2 weeks vacation time spend hotel room starting actual tourism?

Then sure thing, jump line behind many thousands Aussie citizens abroad slowly returned home tourists considered haha

In seriousness though doubt open borders end financial year. airlines written international travel then, 2022.

Good luck there, hope guys turn corner soon! find difficult imagine government weak useless allow something like happen. 

This burn capital ground level government incompetence. 

I live Nova Scotia Canada government useless would take behind woodshed put misery. many checkpoints needed, BTW? right guess highway links SA NSW enough feasible? say ‚ÄúAustria Switzerland‚Äù, referring government, populations, businesses running ski slopes? thanks Herald Sun Murdoch propaganda outlet.

Downvoting this, actual news outlet whose articles posted, get traffic. Whenever hear someone start ""I research and..."" know crazy coming Well, corporations people, sometimes people make mistakes. ""Turn cheek"" /s owe lot. decided let thing rip, whole country would living differently right now. Kinda, think issue puerile trying get confirmation bias, yes happens social media, transmission vector.

The nazi party rose power lot disinformation western Europe Jewish people, new issue long evil people ready anything power go away. Peter Stormare.

Oh look found him!  PRINT MONEY -- PROBLEM SOLVED ...yeah, broad pretty sexy secrets! Get life. Nurses get salary. nothing billing. cold fuck winter  parents tested positive today, getting tested tomorrow. far symptoms symptomatic 6 days now. ate rest time separate part house arent using ac keeping windows opened. chances great probably infected too? left house since started feeling symptomatic lancet writes adenovirus-vectored vaccine may result men becoming likely become infected HIV. sure risk vs benefits transmission CFR different IFR, yes, essential looking vulnerable populations start seeing CFR rates. advocated well. trauma easy ignore. 

Most importantly, grave disservice frontline medical staff allowing people pretend anyway comparable flu.

I personally think every ER/ICU every town public feed showing staff facing every day, especially particularly hard-hit regions. jarring dichotomy nurses leaving emotionally-draining shift encountering blase public nothing increasing future workload. Sturgis Motorcycle Rally game changer. Well going believe? person spent life studying subject hairdresser? here. Ah yes, standard summers day wellington southerly blowing through. New Zealand beautiful, weather shite. Nah. ""Level 10"" dance club Grand Forks. need fat absorb fat soluble vitamins.

Absolutely. Plus hormones made cholesterol. Yeah. thing durable surfaces humans can't vigilant long enough avoid it. family member gets sick, buckling ride preventing spread within home.

This important stay home much can. can't vigilant must avoidant. would say trying change values america. Literally country freedom citizens. think 10s millions world want here. think last week article rising main page 50% infected infected asymptomatic carrriers, alone. Another word : Noem Given Alabama's poor education system, probably missing much. reality anywhere near 100% capture rate. sure they're detached. That's super cool hear! idea respected top shelf cat food! that's cool care cats enough would pay extra money it. import directly NZ sold somewhere near you? Sorry, didn‚Äôt exactly read manual Reddit. prefer content social media. Oh book in? Great investment portfolios though, especially oh-so-conveniently sold right pandemic designation crashed market, bought right after. think issue ‚Äúfree‚Äù aka fully covered insurance, order provider correct diagnosis codes. many people don‚Äôt PCPs, can‚Äôt get orders, pay tests. I'd argue vastly pressing people educated *collectivize* *do* control corporations, else may literally end species.

Teaching one person, million people, manage finances drop ocean comparison.

There's also question *who* really even talking to.

A household can't afford 400$ emergency really position deserve lectured finances case, household makes 60k year (which believe, without checking, somewhere region median household income US) ""experts"" innocent, humble volunteers North West England (population 7 million) 0.13% *everyone* died Covid. Estimates attack rate 20% would put IFR 0.65%

There smaller areas region UK 0.2% *everyone* already died covid. Tameside, Greater Manchester example population around 225k recorded 465 covid deaths. That's 0.2% *everyone* dead covid. 

You absolutely correct way IFR low selling vaccine Brazil. S√£o Paulo (state Brazil) deal Sinovac vaccines already arrived, still waiting regulartory agency approve it. probably start vaccinating people January. Yea that‚Äôs /s means, must new You‚Äôre arguing basis self esteem. That‚Äôs never admit don‚Äôt know. ""You see problem well educated fall shit. pity you."" want 6 feet anybody else, that's 3 foot radius circle, making œÄr^2 = 9œÄ ~= 28 ft^2 (and little bit small spaces circles), however covid really want lot 6 feet; make 10 feet need 78.5 ft^2 Lol level ten local bar highly unlikely still contagious. combination negative test time period mean almost certainly cleared virus level longer contagious. Sarcasm? amazing mental gymnastics conspiracy nuts go avoid basic logic education like advice changing coming months. . Nurses give anything ordered doctor, dumbass. Read book. Shut Donny! You‚Äôre outta league! Deep down, he's afraid walk ICU confronted evidence eyes worldview based complete bullshit. Almost universally, dare conspiracy wingnuts kind action support position, clam make excuses. routinely offer bets $1000 people Facebook. Like ""I'll give $1000 Obama declares martial law end presidency"". mean, that's money bank believe shit, right? Turns deep down, know they're full shit. feel special know spouting it. words, talk talk, walk walk. think anything gozer show up? Looks like brown black people starting die. Time start taking thing seriously!! Agree. dumbass covid-denying brother‚Äôs argument time. 

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs really bad wouldn‚Äôt someone posting overcrowded hospital videos?‚Äù 

To credit - don‚Äôt see videos. Seeing reality may help people still idiots better understand. Level 10? You‚Äôre using numerical codes? Color codes Canada  Anyone North Dakota? feel this? Er, could bit dense?

Its 6 berlin, whole germany couple 100 centers planned. include plane completely depressurizes? They‚Äôre symbiotic. locals depend jobs revenue proved, government depends taxes slopes depend people. remove one it‚Äôs like house cards might actually fix problem small way - could push things line trust things said internet goes away. may push us back news organisations established trust credibility, look multiple confirmed sources story, etc.

Idk, maybe I'm optimist see current trend unsustainable something reach tipping point reverts back normal. imagine scary hitting tipping point though. also filled disinformation general. Get rid share button. everyone cdc walked eggshells deserves raked coals violating hypocratic oath. pull someone's license that? Lol, guess family weird neither mine husband's family drinks holidays.. singing would definitely weird Mine free, paid employer. week could get site, give employee number could keep track got it. Man. That‚Äôs tough one. I‚Äôll ask. go again. 9/11 day Reinfection still proven super rare handful cases, could still lingering symptoms. Climate change make 2020 look like vacation decades. Covid end point sight, there's much left dumpster fire besides distributing vaccine. late January unfuck things means. end point climate change. Even heroic efforts lessen catastrophe that's store. there's still time something it. don‚Äôt test flu like COVID, number isn‚Äôt even remotely comparable. Trying even make comparison shows ignorance subject. also completely refuted original argument backed claims.

I also arguing COVID isn‚Äôt worse flu. blown way proportion. sub direct result that. factual statements downvoted oblivion doesn‚Äôt fit group think here. lived years. -50C windchills common. Facebook main offender, quickly put corner people predict Zorbing (bubble boy running) Covid safe alternative gyms, invest You‚Äôre confusing cfr ifr. 9 people ND getting nervous goal catch 100% covid cases.

That would goal USA Italy eradicated covid.

I ask question then: keep going vaccines, since 95% effective? Since seem believe 100% solution. I'll forgive reveals what's really going Denver Airport. think kink is..... lesbian trans teenagers? time still fuckin remedy. I‚Äôm sick mom sick. fuck get better ? Nobody knows ? time ? fuckin bs.... fuck life much anxiety right feel like ending bs. I‚Äôd say Greg Abbott bad sure. cause harm good. already backtracking previous opinion lockdowns. said, govt; local, state federal need step game up. recently tested hell it, asymptomatic, ended testing positive. means there‚Äôs probably way people virus, idea. Govt needs get tests, administer anti-body testing everyone wants it, get vaccine quickly. revamp policies future outbreaks.  positive test rate 12.60% week 14.27% month. That's high super high. percentage starts going higher higher 30-50% statement would guess quit instead giving care? us well aware charging goes on. careful dispense request pharmacy patient charged. calculate times drips order many bags. There's really much saying part ridiculous. aware it, hate know patients need care. without masks still levy racist insults China. ""we got to...."" general we, society, specifically family. Well, anti-maskers... course, certainly viable primary view, can't argue enough *confirmed* government conspiracies (and large corporate conspiracies) simply turn blind eye. Travel lock?

This guy's Democrat too, right? party hard-up candidates put people like power? US, virus ""out control"" political leaders made intentional choice control it. try control virus, controlled. leaders decide try, motivate followers, believe virus controlled.

information mess ITT: people bickering Fauci. person fauci follower, person fauci follower. Fauci said this, Fauci said that.

He's literally become meme days since trying beatify him, both. hampering response covid.

Fauci said many things, right wrong pandemic, time stop talking. effective. condolences 6 people. Live sports games like noisy picnic. They're fun good company. definitely pandemic. Oh they‚Äôll go full anti science None lockdown people care poor people. I'm doubting statement, references handy it'd go long way toward easing mind point.

If effective year immunity vaccine deployment compressed timeline.  Yeah, one many qualifiers.

How hard say ""I apologize disobeying guidance stay home.""

There's many facts play here:

- travel essential, explain that, apologize
- essential, apologize, add conditions Even gave every Amazon employee around globe bonus total cost something like $300 million. 

Bezos makes takes dump. strange sort ""nothing"" destroying question.

*When* picture taken? mom hospital for? bad headline. course media put fear tactic keep pandemic going ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è disease 3% mortality shut Canada?
There two problems question,
1) neglects law large numbers, and
2) assumes one two things happen; die 100% fine.
Canada population 37,742,154. today 347,466 people contacted Covid-19 11,710 people died it, 3% mortality rate! 
The second bit people keep talking deaths. Deaths, deaths, deaths. 3 percent die! 3 percent! One small number! big deal, right?
What people survive?
For every one person dies require hospitalization, permanent heart damage rest lives, permanent lung damage, strokes, neurological damage leads chronic weakness loss coordination, neurological damage leads loss cognitive function
So sudden, ""but 3% fatal!"" becomes: people hospitalized, people permanent heart damage, people permanent lung damage, people strokes, people muscle weakness, people loss cognitive function
This folks keep ""only 3% dead, what's big deal?"" get.
It's 3% dead. Imagine cost country, Imagine clogged hospitals. Imagine loved ones die suffer health effects rest lives.....and effects people aren‚Äôt even sick covid need medical care issues can‚Äôt access collapsed system.... numbers could astronomical.
So please:
- wear mask (and nose mouth please)
- wash hands regularly
- stay 2m apart.
-find new safe creative ways celebrate holidays loved ones afar
-don‚Äôt get complacent!!! remember reading book ""Orange New Black."" hated it. author touch rich girl. believe prison/the way prisoners treated blew mind. know people went prison jail. believe sheltered woman grew up. 

I feel way explaining poverty Americans. many people idea like poor rely government assistance. many people grew sheltered. Good never experiencing poverty. poor person tells like, tell ""no wrong."" third world country

For fucks sake that‚Äôs lunatics think college is. Make Canada Great American here: I'm danger. Biden said last week national lockdown wasn‚Äôt going happen presidency chances lockdown slim none. Plus lockdown, lockdown *everyone*. Essential workers shouldn‚Äôt exempt people luxury staying home, want packages delivered food supplied them. know won‚Äôt happen.

Unfortunately, think lockdown ship sailed. guess, vary state (US)...but I'd say would somewhat middle. Health care workers, 65, front line workers (police, fire, ems, etc), blood pressure/diabetes/etc.

My wife got house bit today. drove car lots bit came home. drove neighborhood ones around city (fargo ND) help notice... Driveways packed full cars town. one seems care around here. 

Them: happen me.

Also them: *buys lotto ticket* hey never know! 

My wife works ER nurse one hospitals said everyone covid seems. People come ER get tested (really stupid test sites place) also people come hospital without facemasks like clue what's going care. :( dick, I'm sorry loss. 

That said, think need embrace nuance figure deal virus. agree going football game plain stupid. mean breeze going make things worse. anything, help dispel aerosols collecting, although think right might help carry sneeze.

Again, sorry loss. think agree awful time many ways, us others, hope really turn corner point (March?). Disbelief? Come guys, still getting surprised shit paying attention. Sorry don‚Äôt speak Spanish, cannot read that.

Maybe misunderstand overly sarcastic comment.

If decade murders that‚Äôs twice amount country twice size isn‚Äôt going get anyone trouble, covid-19 sure hell won‚Äôt either. Yeah, logical comments get love lol.

Dude 22, he's adult. Young, yes, kid. Shit. waiting list pre-covid lonnnnng last heard. 

Good patient, takes. knew nation built worst British criminals time would prosper level headed place.

Meanwhile north Americans like ""omg rights"" traveling, would like planes, trains automobiles. Minus plane train... burning automobile.  America: Hold beer.
World: Please don't, already bad enough. 
America: I'm getting warmed up...  89% people think kind supernatural power controls lives. people dumb, never get thinking right. Bad bot. No. Driving much risky almost anything day. also dumb drive location could get sock dangerous disease. grew state obvious that. high school, spotting county plates ‚Äúpunch buggy‚Äù. seem trolling, per profile. president Mexico like Trump downplays pandemic. news story January 1, 2020, mentioning statistics homicides Mexico last decade site excess deaths Mexico year Get paid millions cant stay hell away people long enough fo damn job. try type phones kinda shitty . see comments. criticize way text text . says enough . able understand stand message given said Grammer issues smart enough know nothing policies behind virus right .

There‚Äôs literally way around it, side effects exist. placebo saline produce side effects purpose. course, likely percentage psychosomatic effects also. Even lockdowns face saving politicians. bad way round.

By way, please include Japan concept West they're basically boat. 10% North Dakota. Okay, like, what? 50 people? someone Australia lockdowns worked doesn‚Äôt mean would USA, eradication window basically you‚Äôd delaying. USA needs mandate masks, teach basic social distancing put measures least control spread. Unfortunately seems don‚Äôt even believe it‚Äôs dangerous convincing public borderline impossible Think everything know held sphere.    
The sphere know, everything outside sphere know, surface sphere stuff ""know know"".    
It well know truism know, aware know.   
This unfortunately holds true know little such, little awareness much know. I‚Äôm sorry endure despite contribution society. I, too, surrounded people think Coronavirus political stunt, Bill Gates microchipping Biden‚Äôs win solely due preprogrammed voting machines. 

The outlets perpetuating lies got dismantled. looking Fox News Facebook! idea many are: ""as long result official I'll consider completely fine, even almost coughed lung morning"" Even _Idiocracy_ didn‚Äôt predict this. Good, he's already proved he's sort person need stick around here. Get casket. Pay wall, Help? Hard lockdown 3 months. see things like ""host Thanksgiving get ready plan funeral"" vast majority people host Thanksgiving completely unscathed, time Christmas rolls around every single one say ""wow insane hyperbole ridiculous, host normal christmas party"".

Yes, that's another line separation fracturing society badly: generations. working class kid still able afford college education tuition (AND books) cost hundred dollars semester. tremendous boost upwards, since first father's family go college. Even so, taken decades reach salary level now, years retirement. I'd born 2002 instead 1952, future path would much different. Oh COVID response wasn‚Äôt run federal level, pretty much individual states manage public health response. main thing federal government provide states resources(eg defence personnel) jobkeeper jobseeker payment. comes actively fighting virus, individual state leaders.

Personally, shocked side effects reported low percentages. I‚Äôm willing admit may severe reaction, I‚Äôve talked many participants believe I‚Äôm outlier. need warn *some* may feel like they‚Äôve hit truck day two. 

And here‚Äôs obligatory participant statement saying something that‚Äôs golden light rainbows vaccine: went knowing I‚Äôd side effects wasn‚Äôt given placebo, prepared it. particularly shitty weren‚Äôt. never once, single time regretted it. side effects fleeting I‚Äôd heartbeat. I‚Äôm three months second injection things fine. Get damn vaccine. job burden Comparatively COVID first hit China equivalent Christmas (Êò•ËäÇÔºâ, fully shutdown public travel forms locked entire nation.

That's effectively 0 COVID right now. also US higher infection rate _India_ , per capita population, india third world country population 4-5x US.

Those 7 million travelling americans see spike infections increase singificant factor , that's 7 million extra people travelling compared non-holiday period. May ask why? ‚Äújust cause it‚Äôs new‚Äù ‚Äúnot tested‚Äù. actual legit reasons you‚Äôll passing? need start throwing fucks jail. don‚Äôt think US managed pandemic well. I‚Äôm even arguing that. really don‚Äôt know point you‚Äôre trying debate, it‚Äôs certainly one I‚Äôve made.

In event, adjusting population, US far worst. I‚Äôm sure metric you‚Äôre referring it‚Äôs pure infections, US worst. countries, including Europe worse infection rates. you‚Äôre referring mortality rates, population adjusted, US isn‚Äôt even top 10....maybe even top 15. larger European countries, UK, Italy, France, Belgium (and large countries South/North America) performed much WORSE US...and that‚Äôs despite consistent stronger national response covid. source make take back? think invested much.  That's odor works. Australian, resent that. single day? week? Or? Everyone thread wearing ten tons brass staying home heard letting COVID pos nurses work short staffed i‚Äôm gonna type sober possible

ah, shit, work I'd definitely listen folks arguing throw swords see survives. siblings test regularly, so, tested positive? Yea, feels rushed pressured, it‚Äôs hard trust trials given enough time. understand standards vaccine meet approved. I‚Äôve always wary getting vaccines right away, took like 10 years get HPV vaccine. DLT 1 year guarantee best. year 5 coin flip worse odds year after. pretty all. There‚Äôs people Fargo. 

There‚Äôs buildings 20 stories. 

No it‚Äôs big city call village bit weird. president cared, yes. Giants $5 beers look right vendor. Absolutely mind boggling true, chances getting struck lightning better chances getting struck meteorite, but...  AMERICA, FUCK YEAH! Yeah, many states employees sent home holiday. Makes sense nationally observe holiday release data. Tomorrow probably different story (and states probably add numbers since skipped day need make up) HIPAA want people drink, telling stay home day months way make happen... 2,700 people still lot people LOL Nice Sorry man, sweden tried approach beginning failed badly. ND worst fatality rate world going get better soon. They'd still find ways deny unfortunately so, kool aid stocks time high. People care multiple things. daydream without playing - chances slightly smaller. actually exclusively pump due low milk flow stay home. lot reasons mothers choose pump! whole could right giving additional perspective. consuming thought late Feb: many N95 manufacturing lines could built price F35, stupid jump starting saw Chinese lock Wuhan. Orange Face behind this! statistic. 10% entire state infected. well 50% positive rate testing. Really? wouldn‚Äôt call city population city? Who's better per capita many similar European countries. Oh seems be. actually listen experts movie. mean... general sense yes, times others.

For example, sex marriage legalized, population supported it, institutions place supreme court rules sex marriage's favor, sort mass movement would large tilt sex marriage's favor. needle relatively little chance going way, part status quo sort opposition wanted stay, part opposition already attempted constitutional amendments past theatres, part due prevalence support multitude various institutions.

This downplay fight sex marriage. fact opposite. working behalf put amazing ground game set things tilted give quite edge. Obviously even today still significant opposition, though seems primarily away population large, mostly way institutions vast majority Republican party state platforms (yep, that's still official platform get rid it).

But popular support there.  Vermont Atlanta. 1200 miles single 16hr sitting. twice started taking 2 days. agree you, don‚Äôt like ‚Äúdeal it‚Äù attitude don‚Äôt articulate well. fever normal side effect would expect vaccine. attitude rubs wrong way. People already nervous. ""I made decision husband father""

Yeah, that's everyone city made decisions travel too, fucking moron. I‚Äôm exactly watching disbelief Herd immunity finest long enough drive, also stops problem. everyone needs stimulus check say even though certainly loved getting free money. stimulus checks massively wasteful. got even though live New Zealand economy fully open. 

The government NZ government did, payments businesses significant drop profits lockdown long keep workers employed paid normal. businesses workers need bail-out get it. Plenty businesses continue operating lockdown. Level 3 lockdown NZ 80% economy still functions normally. Sweden tried exactly this, work. Y'all digging graves sadly. yes much simply people broke? ....you.......dont understand hospitals operate. there's reserve card table like restaurant. Science self correcting though, prove wrong win Nobel prize like guy discovered 90's ulcer's caused H. Pylori., Einstein guy showed Newton full picture. refuse click amp links. Fuck google. Yes basically US strong armed China letting people leave circumventing travel ban, thought China's policies lockdowns correct.

After anything infected returning Americans either. 

Even that, blame China COVID handling well enough. 

That's America nutshell. Zero accountability. Thank you! Im super lucky family aware what‚Äôs happening (my aunt uncle biologists.) thought sure grandma wad screwed, especially utah right but, she‚Äôs okay least. wish best family. It‚Äôs scar, really hope everyone safe:

I hope see you‚Äôre family soon though, too,, really do.

and you‚Äôre right- need less personal. know better,, I‚Äôm mad. I‚Äôm sick pretending world okay isn‚Äôt all.

I‚Äôll best, even though know I‚Äôll mad. don‚Äôt think said bad, see would
see such. I‚Äôll best lessen say.

I really, truly appreciate responding me. didn‚Äôt think would, it‚Äôs awesome people listening. Thank much.  Oh definitely. 

In mom group multiple ppl talked drove instead flew. course stopped hotels gas stations whatever else way. 

It's like think travel flying. Remind infections matter? ICU beds reserved COVID 19 patients? telling rejected giving ICU bed 25 year old favour 90 year old? Well, fix want too....

""White supremacists deliberating suppressing mention Vitamin MSM coordinated plan enhance mortality COVID-19 non-Caucasian populations.""

/s American definitely wrote this
 No, world really care much 

Just long stay away cost strain hospitals really change based mindset brought patients though. I'd let another 500k people die right opened economy country. I'm sure people arent trying virtue signal would agree. Nah imma eat turkey family 

This country built giving middle finger government 


Imma That‚Äôs true. Europe? Travelling European countries easy (often without internal borders) par travelling US. Another big internet hug europe, i'm sorry treating like shit, believe however always wear mask outside hand sanitizer me. world traveled summer travel Christmas?

Fuck off, isn‚Äôt issue that‚Äôs strictly US. say people like me, 4 person Thanksgiving dinner 3 houses. travel work, mom sister work customer service retail brother works home. 3 us work public places. big get together, get together. Honest question I'm trying dick. people think like probably majorly risk, people spread huge chance going ICU adding death toll.

So posit line America's foreign policy, ""You die live free."" Oh moms inherently stupid? tell moms idiots? going 'recover'. someone else's lungs. point future going 'back normal' dont care think would he? He's already it. Even he's one one-in-a-million might get second time, immune system recognize would zap almost instantly. He's also fit person late 50s, he? He's danger anyway. EU Schengen Agreement, dude. pathetically easy travel within EU, par interstate travel USA. switch inlaws! 24h shifts? all. reasonable hour shifts? unfortunately, job. 
 
Do firefighters get walk away fire people save? 
 
Do Police get refuse attempt stop active shooter? 
 
No. not. medical worker first responder unlike professions, right refuse unsafe work signed unsafe work. 
 
I family nursing. envy I'm happy position in. said, I'm decent person would look sideways nurses collectively walking away. would greatly multiply death toll suffering death. Reddit scientists...yikes Fuck 

I don‚Äôt support people traveling planes thanksgiving people driving fine

We‚Äôre taking risk leads bad I‚Äôll deal Although asked particularly callous immature way, fair question. 

You remember though young people die flu, get cancer, heart attacks etc etc. everyone lives 80 years old. 

My guess would either extremely high viral load (she's nurse all), genetic predisposition live NY. walk mom's dog everyday lives home sister. three us plus brother came together. 3/4 us see every day. planned something aunt uncle, decided cases rising. can't completely isolate months end. travel work. sister works customer service. mom works customer service. brother works home. None us isolate fully 3/4 us work public. That's 100x likely infect us 4 person dinner. Proof what? People overweight risking lives save idiots like you? 


Nothing American showing privilege thanks fucking giving done! fam. Feels fucking amazing past 6 months. Leronlimab completed 75% interim analysis severe critical. looks promising. FDA approves EUA soon...otherwise people die LOL @ trying make sense stock market, time high middle pandemic.  mean much coming rest world bastards drive left side road, wipe ass bare hand, eat guts everything kill. Oh yeah, lets forget chinese bastards eat turd chute anything started party. So...fuck all. Right? Compared last week pre thanksgiving week last year? started going relatively close parents last couple weeks.

We live Sydney Australia probably actually fairly safe (bar isolated cases right west) least couple months.

Seeing people US still nothing short mindboggling. whole family already got Covid recovered? Disbelief accurate. american government expert fucking people over, including citizens. article literally quoted international virology epidemiology experts **Ian Mackay**, **Yap Boum**, **Amrit Boese**, **Jennifer Beam Dowd**, **James Ball**, addition **Sydney Morning Herald** Germany's **Die Welt** newspaper, specific observations holiday travel USA's COVID19 situation. experts outlets ""looking Americans travelling internally horror outside America""

It also mentions Victoria came strict lockdown, populous countries like Germany considering measures. country live, Portugal, banned travel municipalities New Year's holiday subsequent Portuguese holiday. Clearly, many countries taking measures USA is, unknown thing.

Not everyone ignorant messed situation USA. You, personally, speak most, many, possibly even people around world.

Anything else like misrepresent? one gives shit. one cares. So, fake headline fake people nicely go fuck world give less fuck USA countries. Stop self centered me, issue seeing people outside = people wanting go outside. Monkey see, monkey do. hope practices changed, enough sometimes. Healthcare workers like person ""suck up"" bang 24 hour shifts watching people die? Disbelieve? still think muricans dumbos dumbos ( leveticus 9:15) lot martyrs around Yes.also canadian here. also comment double standard? planning gather christmas sat high horses bashed south Asian canadians gathering Diwali. 
 
""But christmas different"" gathering gathering. something like 50-60% short-term willingness

Is polling likely uptake Germany? I'm imagining population small % anti-vaxxers.  I'm NYC. One roommate went VA like 5 people over. Assholes. Buying single ticket best value. frustrating! Selfishness stupidity rampant here. Lucky enough live state governed someone cares saving lives overwhelming medical staff knows family gatherings big reason transmission. Tries keep us safe so
Densely populated tiers locking people always get irate refuse cooperate badmouthing forgetting pandemic response team dismantling, science denying idiot huge reason cases control many dying I‚Äôve got random ass cousin I‚Äôve never met trying organize family reunion cruise ship. She‚Äôs also trying invite everyone daughter‚Äôs wedding. pretty sure she‚Äôs gotta trolling. absurd. ‚ÄúHey fam! rates low! Let‚Äôs it!!‚Äù end *this* year? lolololololololol  drive thrus hopefully  Another case TNF-alpha targeting drug effective. We're getting really close effective treatment mild moderate Covid! blow end year so.

Maybe year 2029. quick question anyone knows, whats 108k cases USA world meters? I've internet deprived week saw like holy crap that's awesome. something happen cases reported? Victoria, Australia I'm guessing know, there's ton contact points point point B. amount family stops rest spots pee drive anywhere makes think anyone traveling covid gonna safe. beginning feel like ethics conference everyone attends high-minded lectures corrupt deals breaks. confirm. Good lord. Eat dick. Fuck yeah. proud Victorian. FLU BRO! /S could pull scheduling Covid test online Kaiser US, last week. symptoms exposure necessary, exaggerating, nothing. made appointment drove two hours later, members household. Got results three days later. completely covered. reason, several friends could drive visit parents. Doesn‚Äôt seem shortage neck woods. Australia New Zealand sitting pretty beat damn thing. ""God"" Given recent AstraZeneca news, vaccine definitely bring EU close normal 2021, sadly enough doses Pfizer Moderna ordered compensate. holy crap! worry, rest world Christmas hits isnt personal doctrine, command. I‚Äôm saying ‚Äúonly‚Äù thought would per hundred thousand. sure one sure. best guess 1,200 medical workers. responding to. Victoria's second wave peaked 725 new cases per day 5th August 73 August 31st. August winter month Australia.

If figure much time left, changes calculus. 100% agreed understand argument, completely disagree. think overestimating intelligence Americans. Rural America needs take vaccine virus go away, emphasizing side effects (which many Americans confuse complications) reduces chances taking it. 

I agree transparency important. think there's middle ground hiding publishing articles need mentally prepare bad side effects legitimate danger scaring people away. 

Maybe I'm overly cynical though. portion country beat every ounce hope left. Newer test hurt. American Empire ends pandemic would good. People polio children get post-polio syndrome 30-50 years original infection, one case documented 71 years post-infection. Chickenpox manifest shingles half century mild childhood rash.

The idea people get unknown virus somehow 'safe' based 100% wishful thinking. hope right, leaves people immune life relatively unaffected. know. Coast starlight gang. too. Skipped sisters. Actually lied quarantine exposed someone exposed I‚Äôd got test results. Also left dad assisted living facility don‚Äôt think happy about. 

I‚Äôm sure happen Christmas. dad‚Äôs Alzheimer‚Äôs progressing rapidly around next Christmas doubt he‚Äôd know are. 

This whole thing really fucking shitty. $90 make day appointment get rapid drive test results hour. tests scarce. UK they‚Äôre allowing family meet christmas strict limits gatherings. also made clear it‚Äôs allowed doesn‚Äôt mean visit family. Thanksgiving US seems free all. Shut Yea china government fuckin sucks. Easy force people lockdown marshall law prevail negligence case, plaintiff demonstrate, preponderance evidence, defendant duty protect plaintiff underlying harm issue, breach duty, breach caused plaintiff‚Äôs injury, injury caused measurable damages. It‚Äôs third factor: causation, going tough prove cases. 

It‚Äôs straightforward argue Publix duty protect employees requiring everyone store wear masks, breach duty failed so. Proving gets halfway though. Convincing judge jury it‚Äôs likely guy story caught covid work isn‚Äôt quite easy. burden plaintiff prove case. plaintiffs uphill battle unless victim spent time outside work hermetically sealed bubble. It‚Äôs possible jury could determine plaintiffs met burden proof, it‚Äôs definitely slam dunk. Publix likely settle quietly case avoid risk losing case like trial. really scares many people don‚Äôt see big deal. I‚Äôve trying vain convince certain people know take seriously it‚Äôs become politicized dig beliefs refuse budge. Even close friends family never thought would think act like this. 

It‚Äôs really disheartening. [The sun doesn‚Äôt scientific name goddamn condescending moron bragging you‚Äôre berating people knowing something made Honestly one upside terrible Covid situation rural America. many people would never get vaccinated catching virus developing degree immunity? Shut quit job beginning already seen bullshit. company tried anything everything could deem ""essential"" 2 week mandatory shutdown. sickening. Even that, open doors move tables around break room. Alll mindless morons worked happy acted like crazy thinking nuts. Luckily position able quit time. They're probably still complete shit show zero precautions towards anything. know anecdotal, live city multiple major cross country interstates converging. Traffic Thanksgiving week significantly better usual. Today roads wide open, rhe last days breeze. Typically higher average number traffic jams entire week. We'll see Sunday Monday look, road travel seems lighter region. Definitely. 

Most Caucasians probably deficient, much milder version darker skinned people.

Apparently vitamin deficiency common children started putting milk. Ever seen picture kid Rickets? good thing get. part non-US world watching dread disbelief.Why would I? Covid19 .5% death rate. Americans want resume normal life, so. Happy Thanksgiving them. Ngl sounds pretty encouraging. It‚Äôs super low death count top 10% even tested positive. great news! don‚Äôt see going well. It‚Äôs hard skip one year won‚Äôt read jaw open. Props mental breakdown. Really depends traveller, least harmful someone drives goes straight destination stops. much better stop multiple gas stations, shops, starbucks along route. might live till next Thanksgiving.

If visit large family get together probably won't. regret killed off. agree. federal guidance, leadership support. Shit still going bad come end January. hopes next adminstration turn around. Greece shit show right now, found family hospitals full beyond capacity enough docs nurses either. well originally opened borders...disaster Yeah, ""not flying"" ""self isolating"" really think friends colleagues Chomsky referring less educated *any* axis? doubt listened saying believe least people would much dark

That's incredibly wishy-washy completely meaningless. somebody Europe, impressed see everybody USA stopped flying. /s First injection wasn‚Äôt bad, fatigue low grade headache primary side effects. second game changer happened rapidly, eight hours afterward. 

And you‚Äôre absolutely right, know what‚Äôs happening there‚Äôs certain amount comfort that, day two feeling cruddy low, low price get return. hit Cowschwitz forget roll windows beforehand think do? makes sense Trump bungle COVID response bad did. times crisis, incumbent usually spikes polls, kind competent leadership would secured reelection.

But fans LIKE hype man okay telling reassuring lies virus going away vaccine ready election. I'd look car rentals know lot family drove instead 12 hour drive cost flight. already working home job anymore shut downs time. Everyone watching Americans thanksgiving. I‚Äôm waiting see happens Black Friday. county/state turn power water

Ah, Los Angeles Method! I‚Äôm North Dakota Manitoba. Winnipeg actually. Right code red 14% positivity rate. don‚Äôt even want imagine things would opened border.. scary. reference, driving Winnipeg border less hour. Fargo ( capital ) 3.5 hour drive. Oh sick nurses thing kinda fucked. telling I'm getting downvoted, scary time fsm It‚Äôs always percentage stupid mfs ruining everything funny, appreciate intention! (: economically feasible. can't invest hundreds billions $$$ find 100 people use it.

If 6 hours, Americans prefer Air Travel, less drive. That's fact. 

Train journeys incredibly expensive travel group yes is. cannot stop all. risks non flying also. minimize risk, pretty hard Damn. solo drive Fort Myers, FL northern Indiana Toyota Celica. Almost distance. Speak dummy.  life ever completely normal? I'd rather die trouble breathing rest life.

Survival everything, 20 year olds around caught 6 months later still get winded walking half mile (despite running 5Ks virus).

Just focusing death rate moronic. go live life, get aids survival changes really high! That's insanity it. around hundreds strangers day protection stupid ass mask, yet, Thanksgiving dinner? Forget it! coming antisocial person who's never participated get together holiday festivities anyways. make sense. Apparently thing country ever un-protested labor money. estimated 48 million people travelling year apt roman american comparison transition republic empire. I‚Äôm sorry, thank you. stay home. go thanksgiving family. came mask area incredibly small little cases. Everyone except staying home. go work make sure I‚Äôm clean. showed hour remain minimal contact luckily family understanding. aunt told vaccine available she‚Äôs going go get along brother I. No. started it. don‚Äôt tolerate shit anyone. I‚Äôm giving taste medicine.

You dating one wants you. unloveable.

More insults. Go cry sleep even mother didn‚Äôt want you. probably wished would gotten abortion. Free Americans need cdc's approval anything? dosing error much poorly results reported. results claim 62%-90% effective, huge discrepancy. also never reported type vaccine showed symptoms received. even differentiate got placebos got real vaccine.

Their results full dose half dose also full non consistent information. seems sloppily done. 

They also literally alerted Wall Street anyone else efficiency vaccine, says alot. 

It seems like alot fire good reason. 1% 331,002,651 people die covid....

thats extremely unacceptable number. Even many drove instead flew, I‚Äôd imagine there‚Äôs less chance spreading although traveling would‚Äôve ideal. edible ‚Äúdressing‚Äù know liquid. rice crouton dressings? city 28k person also 3 foot radius circle around them, summing 6 feet people still workforce age high risk COVID-19, give large government aid package decide go unpaid leave due COVID-19. Make similar FMLA paid. can‚Äôt many people category, way it‚Äôs still choice. Would probably cheaper business closures. 

The one issue may lack evidence high risk people are, point 8 months in, thats well known. 

Encourage rest society take precautions, give examples different risk level activities. might even get compliance Americans knew controlled risk management, voluntarily. 

You‚Äôd also prevent mass job loss. Travel service industry workers, employed early 2020, either furloughed laid off. idea indefinite closures, lack revenue, etc really isn‚Äôt acceptable make society safer less 1% it. took warehouse work destroyed body got laid off. 

But doesn‚Äôt even either or. Give people actually category extra support, keep going. minority. doesn‚Äôt mean discounted sick; cannot change them. 

I realize different perspectives; I‚Äôm giving mine, know sounds little selfish, is. honest. Actually strangely seems opposite: pretty unheard living long lives double lung transplants, unfortunately. Yet person considered someone survived COVID, people die 5 years strokes heart attacks due COVID‚Äôs clotting factor. 

Rough year man There's massive difference people take precautions hold large gatherings.

It blows mind morons pretending thing people isolate, test, keep small gatherings. Blah. Ya 86 year old grandpa passed away due non covid reasons long ago. would've gone way see family Thanksgiving knew likely would another one left. certain extent, need basic knowledge accept knowledge. need know what's patently absurd able identify expert hack calling expert, might true clearly bullshit.

Like, need study astronomy know moon made cheese, therefore anyone speaking basis cheesy moon ignored. we've got people like ""I dunno, moon *could* made cheese. know? Anything's possible!"" They're fundamentally ignorant topic nonsense sounds likely sense. end shit like ""evil microchip vaccine"" concerns, people know little either microchips vaccines magical logic anybody fill heads expert knowledge said magic. nerds MIT right now, throw enough money we'll get bubble head like Jetsons. 

Covid would chance. need throw enough money nerds. started talking bars live music, employment. might flippant said issue. 


Yes, employment effects painful potentially longer lasting (though hopefully employment eventually recover post-vaccine scenario). Losing job hard age, whether getting started years in. older people comfortably established stable jobs - company's looking bit shaky fear lose job (on family depends) it'll difficult find new employment age, everything could fall apart quickly stay way die. call things blip. call avoiding bars months spread disease blip. life recovers, ten twenty years feel months without bars made huge difference.

Good luck. comfortable living insecurity like that. forget Brett lot people seem think strangers get sick. age well. One month cases tripled 6938 positivity. Bad PR? lot bad PR. I‚Äôve seen lot cheerleading sub based suspiciously vague over-optimistic press releases. Meanwhile, facts stubborn things. guess Wired part conspiracy. sarcastic response assertations: beard, keep well trimmed neckbeard. shower daily. I'm 30s lost virginity George W. Bush president. I've place decade. trouble dating, although done much since March due pandemic.

You call misogynistic, seem misandrist. bitter every man want date would rather date attractive, pleasant, 20-somethings instead bitter, middle-aged hag like who's probably single mother.  Screw attitude. wrong think know it. want shame others feel better life.

If read steps took still problem it, denying science foolish.

Stop nonsense. Yes, even white people living sunny climates assume they're getting enough vitamin D. Yeah, literally see people shit intestines eyeballs pop skull. Fear greatest motivator. Thank you. hope gods years travel Or, half Americans see stats add up. lost right make promises bad things long ago. Plus can't ever sure asymptomatic. drove Carson City California, myself, mother (same household), uncle sister. rents falling lot cities. Sorry hear hope he/she okay don't, won't, can't. thing proper Covid measures restaurants bars. sit outside tables spaced apart even use restroom, okay work. Eating drinking inside winter? Come on.

""I jump pool get wet clothes on."" logic. always loudest abnoxious easier said done. players testing positive. support staff well driving instead flying responsible. Oh one ofthose ""I care unless happensto me"" types. quarter million people died US alone, number climbing. teach old dog new tricks sociopath give damn anyone themselves. think peaceful think that, think still get people make different decisions.

I think really difficult thing weighing effort vs amount change effort affects person's mental health. also pretty vigilant health. I'm young, used take multivitamin outside 85% time, also frequent tanner (cries). vitamin levels tested, vitamin deficient 100k IUs week. people deficient need 50k IUs week still huge amount. reference average recommend amount 600 IUs per day. easily deficient know it. easy way prevent auto immune diseases several types cancer! using exact reasoning anti-maskers.

Get nonsense. person we're discussing took every reasonable precaution. Comparing anti-maskers blatantly intellectually dishonest know it. trials already show immunity lasts longer that, yes completely sure. what's bad outdoor meal people? California fucked beyond point recognition. wow idea survival rate. ppl younger better?  Technically headline correct, stocks fell roughly time people feeling uneasy something other. got downvoted shit like suggesting thing. cases tripled 6938 positivity maybe people might like reflect that. yeah, same, someone forced capitalism exposed virus time, fault wanting actually see people give shit risk exactly going appreciable way it.

we fucked second bailed rich instead paying people stay home. sad thing living life. prisoner virus 99.97% survival rate. time move people. Best Coast legendary views.  


I [L.A. years back. Bummer YouTube muted [Red River audio track; really ties edit together. know dumb still listen smart people. problem somewhere along lines outright fucking moron became badge honor education became unfunded public education glossed importance critical thinking. Get crap. Headline joke Oh no

Anyway part. stayed put immediate extended family. older sister wanted fly New York City visit parents able put pressure reconsider. sucks bad guy eventually decided traveling.

I Aunts planning visit 93 year old grandmother eventually came senses election coverage died media shifted pandemic.

To non-Americans, Thanksgiving far important family gathering often time you‚Äôll see family members year. 

It‚Äôs difficult get even group Americans pull direction nature. also didn‚Äôt help President office politicized pandemic instead leaving scientists. it‚Äôs encouraging know millions us right thing. Hopefully enough medical system doesn‚Äôt get overloaded. 

We tried. cause don‚Äôt mean need to. get plenty time outside playing plants balcony, yoga 3 times week light weightlifting 3 days week living room. walk days I‚Äôm active. sub general agenda, super locking following strict rules ever, wrong. want see family, matter precautions take, bad person. Respiratory therapist here. workload obviously nurse, work, critically understaffed. nights, 2 us entire hospital. one person deals ICU 40-50 COVID patients, person literally takes care every area hospital, including ER always filled COVID patients. sit ER hours don‚Äôt enough beds staff take care them. keep mind COVID patients weeks. people ventilators weeks. spoiler alert, can‚Äôt pull equipment thin air either. many patients bipap high flow nasal cannula, talk quite often - literally run equipment? multiple emergencies there‚Äôs two therapists entire hospital. so, bad here. truly cannot fathom getting worse, based numbers, will, won‚Äôt pretty. weeks ago writing comments country, Switzerland, fucked USA. daily cases per capita higher USA.

The difference made changes, since three weeks -20% daily infection rate per week. pulled emergency brakes. still rolling towards disaster. course we're watching.

Just compare graphs keeping mind factor 39 population would disappointed? I'd imagine they're pretty used kinds misrepresentations Fauci actually said. dread held rest world justified, lack perspective Thanksgiving US equivalent Christmas W European countries (in terms annual meeting families big meals). particularly galling when, e.g., Britain exactly thing December taking moral high ground above. Vanta Black Friday 1700 day per center certainly possible. Assuming 15 minutes work per patient, need 30-50 nurses/employees working make happen.

Seeing know intended sizes centers, they're building 6 large city, seems plausible enough. NJ lot executive orders place, lot bigger towns like Newark emergency orders vague (Newark recently go total lockdown, saying everything non-essential close, lot clothing stores etc deemed essential they're still open example. didnt really say considered ESSENTIAL. There's one making sure places closed actually closed. etc.) 
I'm sure extremely big dense population doesnt help either, though. It‚Äôs would call comfortable! mixed feelings ones I‚Äôve seen news much longer stick/swab. ones send length qtip seems bit off, project funded Gates foundation would assume they‚Äôd vetted ensure accuracy. send tests anyone requests time fill survey many people you‚Äôve around, symptoms, etc. study spreads throughout community. update us results? think convenient dismiss analogy absurd. whatever, I'll pass utter lack empathy along partner 50% lung capacaty, asthma, compromised immune system. I'm sure completely agree half witted, empathy-less take. Fucking idiot. Fuck killing family fuckin dying goddamn meal right? Good thinking. new business raised money centuries imbecile want go bank, huge small business. terrible capitalists despise. Yeah wear mask everything stop act like common indonesia asian? Id say yes, subjective since Ive even heard filos say asian pacific islander something stupid, middle east could also considered asia along Russia, basically asia huge say stay home suck get together. literally hard. is, fact, effort get together. Average age victims virus 82+ years old. Yeah scary virus. Better shut everything Nice Darwin Game realtime USA :D 
If breed much, expect USA go back 3rd 4th world country mean? ""fox news"" say? When? someone particular? 

Do link? seen heard second hand dubious source post? Pay politicians low books, risk corrupted money goes generic retail store gave us coupon FREE Store Brand snack, Coca Cola. World here: watching all, let alone dread disbelief melodramatic muppets. Population density really poor metric use Australia. empty human habitation, population skewed heavily living cities. Australia 86.2% urbanisation rate, one highest world higher US 67% people even live capital cities. [2]

In Victoria, that's 75% population living capital Melbourne

It's mathematics. calculate cause damage overall go whichever believed cause least damage.

I know hard accept, certain level death completely acceptable grand scheme things, consideration governments need make. They're still gaslighting thinking never herd immunity strategy even leaked emails show lord savior Tegnell clearly stated goal many families, one family members last Thanksgivings couldn‚Äôt stay apart one year. 

Like article says, it‚Äôs family gathering, it‚Äôs family Russian roulette. removed family gatherings, parents still gathered sisters family, almost every friend know closely still met person too. quarantining 2 weeks before, outside dinners, nothing. thought orange bloke going fix  look covid 19, valued sacrifice community personal freedoms, I'd say makes us culturally like asian american. far know aussies burning 5g towers like uk No, infection fatality rate quoted worldwide figure estimated WHO. fact, credible estimates put even lower. let's go 0.5% now.

Your analogy absurd. one needs go plane, planes easily avoided. virus. can't hide it. going exposed it, sooner later. lockdown ten years want. virus still there. going destroy life, lives others, trying hide something cannot avoid?

And case, 70 without significant co-morbidities, likely die car accident. Even people 70, vast majority people survive it. really need get grip get irrational panic spiral. quite silly. worry level first wave hit. went number hospitalizations went increased raised.

Here picture original article I‚Äôd certainly argue year seen America lose Superpower status, slipping back Great Power. fair, looked rates per 100,000 USA better understand, there's states almost 10,000 per 100,000, Vermont lowest 600ish. comparison, I'm UK, city currently badly, worried rates 400-500, pockets 1,000 per 100,000. know people love deflect ""at least we're bad USA!"" imagine must super frustrating living Europe, rates miles apart - actually realise bad US looked up. schools. mostly people thing like normal boterhing anymore social distancing working home going holiday warm place. 

Even now, second wave, car traffic 90% normal, compared first wave could ride bicycle highway encounter car miles. 

People care anymore.

Oh people watching disbelief also ones watching disbelief countrymen/women idiots dreading christmas/new years. going fun fun start new year. ""the world watched dread disbelief"".  
What navel-gazing! Perhaps certain journalists Western world, World, means. common issue almost every sector country. Actions private citizens companies tied countries based in. Sometimes applies, like company extension government, usually think ban motivated racism, much geo-political middle finger China.

But virus prevention containment went, pretty lame looked suspect targeted single province country already locked epicentre (and more) days before; while, time, nothing similar done address countries local transmission (notably, Italy crashing time).

It's really quite sad that, nearly year in, aside targeted responses individual agencies, government (and perhaps country) still displaying ""barely-interested"" response patchwork measures... think that's works. inclusive problem leaving individual discretion shooting decide risky foot unless pass protective legislation financial assistance packages.

When teacher, absolutely would blackballed teaching anywhere district ""didn't fulfill contract"" file. reason mattered zero flexibility rules. Nothing changed now.

Any teacher cannot work going lose job, ineligible unemployment turned legit offer, get hired back over.

Teachers financial security need make individual choices like this. text also short-sighted drivel. ""nothing policies right i'm told something"". Sorry community scares you, must lonely. noticed deeply controlled means, appropriately reacting virus, feel sorry whatever conspiracy circle-jerk world live cooperation means communist dystopia. Gamers like always worst takes. painful fucking stupid are. Okay elderly person goes store bring necessities catches 'low-risk' people? suddenly gonna start thinking maybe everyone follow proper procedures? gonna keep thinking ""it bad"" ""that's rare case"" ""it happen often"" ""there's .005% chance happening"" Also 2 things point out: 1. statement lockdown leading job loss negative mental health conveniently ignores fact lockdown neither organized nationally completed, assistance gov support lockdown vulnerable inadequate non-existent. 2. hope vaccine act like miracle cure pandemic reveals hopeless situation is. current studies show vaccines boosting immunity individuals, don‚Äôt show prevents transmission disease. combines part population going conventional disease preventing methods (masks, social distancing..., future, vaccination) vulnerable population vector/ victims disease. US seems pursuing herd immunity Sweden. Hell, lame duck insist people church get together Thanksgiving. Yeah Yep. constantly talk bucking system yet there‚Äôs things like unrest protests (people actually taking system) police example putting blue light bulbs porch joking running protesters block road. Phew glad cleared up. I've worried unborn child months. /S do. However really optimistic highly unrealistic suggest reach herd immunity January vaccination. vaccine available required quantity soon. it‚Äôs not. temporary restrictions it‚Äôs over. it‚Äôs lifted. Everyone part. I‚Äôm drinking beers, going without worry one dying. Meanwhile Great Depression 2.0 coming way. Like Nero, Trump fiddled whilst USA burned.  could lying factor 10 point would stand. You‚Äôre delegating risk people work logistics. best thing minimize consumption. elementary schools 5 days person since mid October. middle schools moving back 5 days high schools planning 5 days starting Christmas break. county high metrics reported state health department. governor said last week would absolutely shut mask mandate. hey they're gonna provide rapid covid tests schools people take showing symptoms school. old article. couldn‚Äôt find anything recent, it‚Äôs start you. Google ‚Äúprone position covid‚Äù ‚Äúpronation prevents intubation‚Äú probably. Eat snort? fires no. feelings go friend. 

I sorry deal careless, selfish, uninformed people. That's interesting counterintuitive. think vast open spaces Upper Plains states--plenty fresh air wash away virus, right? Never considered different socializing habits makes perfect sense. dont know age potential person coming covid. cancer. Well, that‚Äôs thought prepared = ICU beds ventilators. aren‚Äôt prepared wear masks. Remember self preservation always top priority. Stay safe. People watching disbelief understand that...vaccines lead herd immunity, right? likely know someone knows someone knows someone knows someone knows someone knows someone gaslighted Swedenbros back Feb March... Back day, Pov-Ray hand-written text files. complete lack awareness viewed rest world, followed 'America number 1' defensiveness face criticism. That's worm-eater perception recent. Spoiler: world give shit. I'm sure Swedes would really worried Sweden herd immunity strategy. clearly says article beds 'reserved COVID patients'

Did even read posted? Write western world. cancelled flight home Xmas. first Xmas without family. I‚Äôm nearly 40 grew era America ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù, know 80s 90s. place seemed indestructible back spend lot life dreaming living US one day. 

Even Bush years anti American sentiment strong Americans wear Canadian pins pretend Canadian, defended people least. 

The last 4-5 years I‚Äôve completely turned place. despise US.

I feel sorry trapped want better country can‚Äôt get it. 70m? far I‚Äôm concerned worst humans planet. Worse Nazi Germany, recent history available still chose ignore it. Nazis probably would treated pandemic lot respect. Yeah dunno chief. Theres countries actual slavery, homosexuality death penalty women can‚Äôt drive speak public. go looked size US relation population density? believe line generally misapplied stated, idea MSM isn‚Äôt talking it.

I learned Vitamin deficiency news, referencing published studies reliable sources. never obscured learned tiny newspaper one knows about. Many us able discuss D3 link covid news informed us possibility.

The think larger issue correlation causation. news government PSAs cannot bang drum need vitamin pills. It‚Äôs viable treatment without study. reading info, individually decide whether take supplements. one take them, I‚Äôm also aware studies linking ICU patients may apply general population exercises outdoors already takes D3. personally may much relation; much taking fish oil pills related Inuits eating wild salmon. capital western australia  Make fun stock investing want hundreds peers take plunge reap benefits. risk sure. works: put cash company uses develop company.

They'll figure out, eventually. ‚Äùlive somewhat free husband also in-laws, management says we‚Äôre going in-laws, go in-laws. traveling Thanksgiving though. people still need travel work even tkme. fine, long none leading risky lifestyle. trust, what's shown happen already. gave people chance exercise personal responsibility squandered opportunity sway groups people need step up.

Funny, almost percentage people voted trump Biden. *Worries health

**Smokes cigarettes fLu! believe many people heard saying knew soon election hear virus anymore. 

I mean world pretty much hate Trump think anyone would go length get office. Europe super enlightened place better US every way. groups people, bit smaller amount. 

The US like 48% stupid anti-mask wearers, EU might like 35-40% something. MOM?! OMIGOD! Stop telling Reddit I‚Äôm bedwetter! long time ago! You‚Äôre embarrassing me! 

Side note: sars-cov-2 epidemiologically endemic United States. numbers keep going up. It‚Äôs pretty far steady state. 

(I‚Äôve also house broken several decades still like go nightly walk.) I'm beginning think US makes entire 50%.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^That ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^was ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^a ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^joke. Can't wait see history repeat month! Fuck go.  
Catch ZOOM nothing. fought husband week attending thanksgiving large family. 20+ people, age 60. family gave us much shit. Well guess started fever tonight feeling hot, husband. really hope covid, even expect family recognize bullet dodged. we're still likely end seeing 400,000+ deaths pandemic US.

Yeah, 263k now, going get worse. 400k sounds plausible. hitch road, may cross half-mil point. would say find something outside together, hike, fire pit, etc. #estamoscondenados Bro going happen every country christmas. Africa, duh. It‚Äôs almost like don‚Äôt know countries. strategies"", third reach ""hypothetical herd immunity"".

No third strategy allow spread. added effect maybe herd immunity.

Hypotethical = maybe. No. recommendation avoid situations mask maybe would helpful. No.. dont. R/coronavirus obsession shitting US, world awe badly doing. countries worse. Take Eastern European countries balance infections smaller population see double rates infection. mention countries 50% tests come back positive. definitely sitting high chairs judging US specifically something well without occasion like thanksgiving too. think tolerate year without new movies. Melbourne here. surreal life almost back normal here.

I guess level cognitive dissonance yanks need accept worst society (school shootings, profit healthcare, extreme inequality etc etc) help normalise covid nightmare event. lot people love raw dog Got longer clip without someone else telling said instead showing it? feel like that's highly selective cut larger opinion piece. news flash americans - we're worried situation watching 'dread disbelief', whole world centred around US  like dvt quick forming clot, no? shows increase risk one survived covid, increase risk couldnt detected problems? Enjoy gun. hope makes dick feel bigger. Take Murdoch. Hope lucky stay safe!  patch dirt. Trust me. I've chewed-out similar reasons too.

This like, Normal Person room. [Donald Trump: rounded Trump: virus magically disappear election aged like milk. likely vaccinated plenty times life, there‚Äôs nothing afraid of. 

That's amazing!

You tell FDA there's need kind safety testing future vaccines, since previous vaccines safe, means future vaccines also safe, there's nothing afraid of!

/S think still horribly done. less previous year doesnt mean much. look countries % drop probably higher, even cases much much less America. distance NZ Asia Europe farther distance North America Europe. Wtf comments? Since sub start turning around common sense?

My friend caught cause went gym without mask told dumb assume safe Bad bot Yep, Europe may Thanksgiving, going happen Christmas. People going skip family gatherings suspect even government guidelines going allow somewhat since know they're ""too strict"" everyone going ignore guidelines altogether.

At least Dutch government banned fireworks new years eve, prevent lot unnecessary strain health care system. live South Florida idiots Miami-Dade believed Biden Socialist, governor head transplanted Trump's orange butt attempting herd immunity! ready retire, I'd leave state full ""Floriduhs!"" I'm thinking ""herd"" thinning soon. sad...So stupid. not. even mentioned several times aren't. Hence defenders ""the economy"" wrong assume that. USA allows everyday people casualties over? love WTF? think given low totem pole terms sources transmission. think may iffy certain regions like ND positivity rates skyrocketing past 20% retail staff refusing mask. kind culture possible obviously sick workers still job symptomatic potentially coughing leaving traces cash. But... that's impossible! Giesecke said so! Tegnell well, think! Heck, highly qualified respected infectious disease experts Mark Meadows Rand Paul too! FaKe NeWs!!!11

^^^/s ^^^yes world actually doesn‚Äôt think that... go make friends Twitter find out. love Trump also hate lockdoens Good good. thinks sign weakness wear mask stay home party get vaccine. Millions minds wandering globe. Id√≠ots exactly know wrong oppose stuff look tough feel weak. totally forgot he's Pres country moment, personal take topic totally irrelevant. Speaking thinking.

Years decay educational system caused funding diverted elsewhere rise political machine based ignorance opposition science name ""faith"" caused problem. flying much? Unfortunately yeah :( county Europe hit badly, live different country. explaining mom 10 minutes can‚Äôt go home even though I‚Äôd love traveling risky, responsibility citizen risk people well. nodded understanding, hung said ‚Äúoh make sure check plane tickets!‚Äù like mom, I‚Äôm traveling, isn‚Äôt money. swear god, woman says ‚ÄúYes, yes, completely understand everything, check anyway case!‚Äù stupidity selfishness overwhelming. Well that‚Äôs really stupid That's crazy think about. Chicago Denver almost exactly 1000 miles feels like halfway across country Fuck we? keeping close track. Could get 4 5 then.

That's towns gone days.

The worst bit there's light end tunnel. Vaccine, good weather, enough vaccine might need restrictions next fall. signs point one rogue strength coach apparently cool follow protocol. point doesn‚Äôt look like players fault. yeah, agree, much people get paid, you‚Äôd think would extra vigilant. players miss game, even Covid, lose game check. 1/16 salary gone  I‚Äôm sorry, people sit well apart office plane, don‚Äôt find say it‚Äôs likely office plane believable. There‚Äôs studies pointing indeed true. care that. cares himself. means huge amount people going business able see family 7 months CCP.

I'm gun-owning American. How's gun ban doing, Aussie? get you‚Äôre saying think would great government provided aid. us Americans watch dread disbelief, too. Lol! Americans really full ya? give flying f**k u guys r doing,we enough problems take care of. say fucking leave, yeah it'll absolute horror shit show, maybe that's takes everyone wake fuck up? heck 4th world country? much densely populated retarded.

You're frothed can't even process language thoughts presented hospital work sent everyone equal bonus checks staff management level got 2% raise last week. don‚Äôt love health system work definitely glad get money incentive vs branded shit reluctantly wear mask? Wtf? Anyone getting giddy serious problem. completely messed up. I'd say disbelief accurate didn‚Äôt read it, I‚Äôm sick seeing stupid shit wild animals get spamming feed.  Jesus christ people like problem society, can't see what's happening, think happening. hoope natural selection takes place nano-brain twats like yourself. Ugh dumb. agree forgo Covid treatment needed 4:00 see post. irs compared two people wearing mask consistent messaging harmful actions. comment way defending way US handled it. even read comment?

Also, sit post borderline CCP propaganda throughout thread. Sadly true. end consumers consume it‚Äôs *supposed* job look workers. Nope. It‚Äôs quite shame species potential. Sweden recommending people wear masks yet? last checked couple weeks ago *still weren't* Imagine caring able make decisions, I‚Äôm sorry hear; hope everything works out!

Also remain impressed Taiwan well handled pandemic. Taiwan‚Äôs diligent response major proof could good handle virus strict protocols public‚Äôs cooperation. Unfortunately many countries lost cause hope expedited vaccines coming work. 4:00 mark. work proven studied. successful countries like Australia especially New Zealand Limited delivery Ethiopian food quoted over, paraphrasing referenced first quote. okey edit back can't understand Ok cool, arguing anything? Masks preventative measure, lose nothing wearing one. Yeah it'll back since theyre opening borders. I'd suprised didnt.

I dont think people realise contagious virus sometimes. read Florida trying change ""Live Free Die"" business strategy make appear like they're ones that's gonna free. Smart. strangest map projection I've ever seen! don't. Noone cares outside US. Typical far-right twat, deny everything, DENY IT!IT'S FALSE UNLESS SAY TRUE. mean North America British use send prisoners Australia. test, cases find - becomes difficult get R number

L.O.L. Thank you. Asap, getting shit arm. That‚Äôs reading responding article. ""It's runny poo!"" well definitely way solve nursing home/senior home shortages. think pandemic shine lot states believe community aid community values. willing sacrifice personal freedom short-term happiness save lives others.

Nobody said anything bad thing stop strawman even get started chief. *You* chose words even attempt assign take sort pathetic fake moral highground.

As original inane assertion: completely utterly factually incorrect statement. 'value ideologies' Australia New Zealand 'of Asians' eloquently ignorantly put it.

For starters lumping entirety Asia together single set values ideologies insulting. incredibly diverse region vastly different cultural historical roots. Glad BBC given measured response/update reduce negative press spin. safety issues data efficacy good result classed FDA. vaccine appears comfortably Sarcasm? Australian beyond words. can't fathom life like America right now. given giving shit hopeless like ""I can't beat them, join them""? much freedom enough sense? lived America dad would dead Covid find unacceptable outrageous. message receiving guys like ""Meh, life goes on"" can't even sympathise more. scared I'd like mention everyone USA brain dead think okay gather right now. still well 100k cases. wear mask. literally can't get store building without one. Wearing mask issue spread Evolutionary pressure selected paler skin Africans left continent North, reducing Vitamin deficiency either helped us stay alive reproduce humans went higher latitudes. really shouldn‚Äôt surprising Vitamin important!  simplest way say is; think dirty rice casserole without beans okra.

If family would cornbread dressing takes way much time make, especially making cornbread scratch. really realistic drive need get somewhere. Remind Me! 10 days people denying coming. still can't believe people blind. Chicago beaches closed restaurants open. Pathetic. Yank here. It‚Äôs cognitive dissonance, implies thoughts actions opposite foundational beliefs. 

People literally do. Not. Care. don‚Äôt care friend, family, sure shit guy never met. care one person, them.

Rinse repeat. guys crack think precursor rest Western World Xmas paying attention. Ok, start entire family friends first.   demoralizing see anti-scientific carveouts restaurants. personal sacrifice kind gets pissed away let uncareful stupid people want. Here‚Äôs graph airport TSA checkpoint travelers He's joke, politicians, mainly Republicans like Noem &amp; Trump, ignoring health/science experts pathetic jokes getting people sick Sounds like great Surprise Party me! Literally every american: ""I know I'm supposed travel could kill family want."" boyfriend's family upset sister longer live home told going Thanksgiving. mother Florida day Thanksgiving (she fly) attend funeral. asked possible could come Thanksgiving, mother covid hotspot wanted prepare everyone's meal. ma'am. fuck data showing 10pm curfew anything productive

Anything denial restaurants part problem.  SARS-CoV-2 going wipe civilization. cases continued soar Since sub start turning around common sense?

Um seen Chines3 shills here? 5.5 million people age 85 US. That‚Äôs lot people vulnerable age group thought. even talking about? guy tried argue lockdown restrictions saying they‚Äôre bad holocaust people think he‚Äôs saying something profound lmfao. less money pay politicians, money they‚Äôre going motivated take special interests lobbyists.

Great example idea looks good paper, completely breaks think it. this. growing real distinction 2. bread stuffing usually stuffed bird (or whatever could stuff in) stiff was. dressing usually never gets pushed bird though cooked pan. point, may well call whole thing dark Superspreader Winter holidays.

I usually keep slightly above-average attention US barely remembered holiday all. Completely is. bring much get paid though. NZ pay joke, Alot us fuck Australia make decent coin come back :). He's probably confusing trial run distribution real vaccine. IAC know next week. China 1.4 billion people. can‚Äôt produce enough meet demand, let alone share North Korea. watch NBA NHL, think sports important continue spreading COVID19 them. there's real justifiable reason there's fans NFL European soccer completely fan less, NBA. No, really don't.  world give fuck. Media part propaganda usual. boring drive I‚Äôve ever done i70 Kansas City Denver. Nothing fields 8 hours. I'm Belgium same. friend family insist come Xmas. They're pretty careful somehow Xmas brought weird insanity them. said everyone going wear masks socially distance that's great what's point? Let's Skype skip Xmas laugh next Xmas one that. tough part finding place people go bathroom They'd boat rest america got fucked pandemic. 

Long term, virus eventually reined Vaccines treatments. 

Let's think second, current shortage along health care workers die virus, along anyone going healthcare field know situation like possible. think sudden surge health care workers able find job post pandemic? would China share Sinovac North Korea? Sounds alot like NZ....

So whats excuse? logic behind it, freeze virus can't reproduce. /s know someone believe Yes Buy what? data? company going give away data unless absolutely necessary.

If it‚Äôs vaccines you‚Äôre referring to, China‚Äôs Sinovac hasn‚Äôt produced enough yet, start exporting meet demand. may raised couple rednecks never finished high school, sent Montessori elementary school eventually liberal arts college. want grow like many children peers. That‚Äôs argument. also value economy deaths sacrifices don‚Äôt make stop deaths normal times. You‚Äôve decided stopping particular deaths, never price high. like saying it, feel soon see waco/ruby ridge/bundy ranch style even vs COVID restrictions somewhere USA.

In Michigan upper pennisula there's reports people protesting local health building. Imagine trying walk building help others pandemic, people waiting work front door. city 30 million, big deal seem think is.

Don't get wrong, good, (yet) *that* scary. mean...not us? Anyone didn‚Äôt expect shitshow hasn‚Äôt paying attention since least Sturgis. Sadly, UK Govt screwing guys financially years. Austerity budgets end starving economy. know problem is? know many things. knowledge clouds judgment.  American living America, also watching dread disbelief. Care explain how? drop conspiracy theories? Talked mom yesterday phone. great aunt/uncle felt sick last Friday (coughing, fever, etc.) flew anyways Florida. Got there, hugged daughters/granddaughters went house. Monday lost sense smell taste. flew sick... one MANY stories think we're gonna see this. week‚Äôs national ensemble forecast predicts number newly reported COVID-19 deaths likely increase next 4 weeks, 10,600 21,400 new deaths likely reported week ending December 19, 2020. national ensemble predicts total 294,000 321,000 COVID-19 deaths reported date. getting two times incredibly rare getting three times really likely true. Ah yes daily reminder America filled idiots. Thanks get it. barfed little mouth @ name Well articulated argument don‚Äôt know validity article saying, seem directed adenovirus vector vaccines. that‚Äôs case, could focus populations receiving mrna vaccines they‚Äôre high risk hiv exposure. Good thing family family gathering like 10 years. could buy it. simply untrue. Moderna‚Äôs vaccine stored long term -20 degrees temperature chickenpox vaccine. also stored regular refrigerator temperatures week short term. basically doctors office America store moderna‚Äôs vaccine long term anyone refrigerator store week. it‚Äôs 95% effective, it‚Äôs mRNA vaccine produced quickly traditional vaccines. Spoiler alert: We'll Christmas well really isolated problem US. Look don‚Äôt care enough explain there‚Äôs thing called Google look things like covid death reporting lag find wrong are. look horror Canada exact thing Thanksgiving? or, 'okay, election Media go back actual job.' Yes, that's exactly do. would done already go ahead keep feeling sorry hundreds thousands die. acquaintance told doesn‚Äôt believe wearing masks outside ... he‚Äôs downgraded stranger. mean that's happening right now, paid less least able see one driving Lambo taking vacations 3rd house prolly bought. Good see indigenous Indian vaccine candidate getting Phase 3 trial. help initiate vaccinations quicker lower income countries Asia Africa given India's vaccine production capacity. Rich foreigners large corporations buy real estate cash, likely. reaction...? Stereotypical reddit shilling: ""BUT WHATABOUT USA"" would China access data AstraZeneca vaccine? I'd still like know working home spring summer shit closed business usual everything watch numbers. wrong wife's cousin fly home via Europe last spring quarantine wanted fly Japan US
Or, perhaps opportunist got three-continent trip doting parents.

I get bent shape went home 90 y/o grandmother carry one oxygen generators ah yes,other countries really care much Usa Interesting, done 1st quarter 2021 article says, that's light years away. majority USA could vaccinated Pfizer then. really suspect New Year's Eve even bigger super spreader event. Muh freedom liberty! ridiculous, people spouting b.s. selfish children. won‚Äôt let 20 somethings house -just visiting backyard. get lot pushback I‚Äôm really tired it. rules rules aren‚Äôt changing! would easier time believing masks chips vaccines  Trump's right, we're tired much winning üá∫üá∏üíÄ Yeah call DPH tell job something illegal, call back three days later ask want connected resources rather than, idk, sending someone spot check. 

(And get many public health departments overwhelmed right now, larger point without enforcement penalties, regulations world going shit.) don‚Äôt example widespread negative effects 3-5 years vaccine administered previously issues don‚Äôt see reason continue discussion. fair, know it‚Äôs never happened, don‚Äôt example unless I‚Äôm missing something. 

Again, good one man. exhausted conversation. going circles.  work hospital ""covid attestation"" every time come work. Obviously everyone answers one questions ""Outside work exposed somebody covid 15 minutes"" something like that. know small phrase hospital tests. violation

Hahahahaha.

Have living rock last 30 years? know inevitably give rise workforce robots begs question humans do? makes clearer then.  easily tests needs national teachers strike this. teachers told thing district... Administration doesn‚Äôt care is? teams leagues federations paying it, countries Good call!! Fear mongering? Like said pandemic ignorance would result lot death suffering? fear mongering like dipshits constantly make excuses wearing mask hospitals forced turn people away full? fear mongering like watching couple YouTube videos deciding vaccinations secret plot humanity? There's lot fear mongering days. Gotta specific.  looking many countries well, great see! Shows good leadership really effects pandemic many die it. US worst leadership possible last 4 years.  That's bad. Hope get outbreak control, too. Well working, get tested positive allowed back work. Sounds like different works though. That's motto, believe. hand, European countries taken individually ventilators African countries combined. Africa, even younger people richer countries would almost surely survive high chance dying simple lack adequate care, unfortunate enough get seriously ill. median age covid victims European countries around eighty; South Africa (the African country know data), sixty.

South Africa - carried highest number tests Africa, far - hit quite hard, 20,000 officially confirmed covid deaths nearly twice many excess deaths.

Outside Africa, Iraq median age twenty suffered far 12,000 covid deaths, mortality applied population Africa would mean 360,000 deaths. time much bread. hospital sending people back work still symptoms. Yay us footballers paid native country? Apparently nobody cares. It‚Äôs money Yeah would figured half assing infection prevention efforts everyone could backfire like this?! almost public health figures say EVERYONE needs stay home starve virus really mean pretty much everyone! celebrity publicly discovering menopause covid symptom, sad. you, obviously! literally nightmares kid. 7 day average deaths per day Wednesday (I'm ignoring yesterday since underreport holidays) 1,663. next 18 days, that's 29,934 increase per-day death rate. Add additional 6,400 deaths mid December 15th exactly middle week ending 19th.

Assuming 5 week lag case death:

Two weeks ago (so 4-5 weeks mid-December) 130,000 daily cases. October 21st (five weeks prior Wednesday) 60,500 daily cases. double daily cases would raise daily deaths 3,200 per day. (this would also make 4-day mid-December window additional 13,000)

We could easily hit 320,000 mid-December. 

This assumes death rate per case rise due hospitals getting overwhelmed taken tests outside work? sound like big fat shining dick Oxford astra-zeneca. 
I hear second dose one side effects I've sore arm like flu shot later night next day, bit fever today mostly feeling knocked ass. 
Pretty much little bit intense version reaction flu shot. work essential, worker treated disposable. Yes,

Schools manipulate data. K-college

For instance one high school know of, school kids/parents go remote voluntary, parents disclose test results. Classmates notified possible exposures.

Having schools self report act contact tracers joke. can't hire people unqualified hired.

Also, can't hired they're dead. COVID killing lot healthcare staff. think lieing tested? sub puts trash like day, surprised? Im getting mushroom growing tell ya, whipping flame needle sterilize mold growing bags. Granted, that's protect vulnerable fungus spores, ward human infectious diseases glass. quick passover nearly long enough kill *everything*. gotta get pretty hot that. Yeah. governments want people comply process, stay restricted, masked life limbo duration process, better show us process working. 

Oh, 15% population vaccinated, including elderly/vulnerable? Ok, re-open outdoor dining, re-institute social ‚Äúbubbles‚Äù allow offices/in class learning return masks on. 

Oh, 30% population vaccinated? open indoor dining, capacity limits, small/medium sized outdoor gatherings like small weddings resume, etc. 

You get point.

Taking approach stay home orders + current restrictions it‚Äôs safe *everyone* result disobedience public, including myself. Hopefully take smart approach. aren‚Äôt English British. Look up. Also ironically can't inconvenienced support troops either, goddamn love say Contact media. 

You ask anonymity, sake job, guarantee journalists looking sources like you. people refuse take hardship, political leaders speaking public uniformed manner. lot people refuse wear masks think uncomfortable, politicians listen telling big deal politicians like trying take away freedoms. 

I would blaming wimpy idiots take precautions, government communicating entire nation clearly people need do, help it. ????? What??? call non British UK residents British? William Wallace would like word you. right scares me, 25 y/o hypertension discernable cause, probably due prematurity. control wow need additional heart problems. saline placebo. Obviously could placebo reaction I'm hopeful ü§û claim never heard point official policy.

""I recall conversation"" &lt;slides policy across like style. $$$ thing live another city. lived city would think something like that, adding whole bus trip that? No. people work specialists.

Medicine highly specialized field. can't post ad rando flip machines.

These people require training. qualified train often also qualified currently work field, operating ventilators emergency. LOT folks, emergency now. Medical schools hospitals even given emergency authorizations medical students residents work COVID. They're still short staffed.

Oh staff hospitals healthcare centers have.... dying COVID alarming rate.

How wear masks next year? That's best, lowest cost solution reasonably help us. That's good question. problem solved. ripe innovation something work solve. solution right mean always exist. Capitalism lifted people poverty system ever has. Hate people shitty morals. way you‚Äôre better schools, easily triple ...you think nurses laid off? think staffing hospitals?

Even ones laid probably found jobs (I know have). guess what? I‚Äôm even exposed new job before. F patients staff closely interact jobs. Teachers similar albeit less dangerous boat. basically claim cannot prove teacher caught campus ""on clock"" quarantine time comes PTO. Straight bullshit. wonder lawsuits brought hospitals unsafe work practices? mean, know hospital probably know risks working going in, seems egregious.

You can't spend money end dead. Report her. America needs nurses, dangerously misinformed nurses. Wow told someone bigger picture resources management. Oh lockdown proving difficult multi millionaires? Fuck touch losers That's super good question nuanced answer! absolutely right, that's one paradoxes PE -- alone suggests loss lung perfusion primary driving factor mortality! least medical school level, we're taught combination couple things. First, occlusion occurs, going cause inflammation area clot, cause problems lung function. Second, PE cause right heart strain -- make difficult right side heart pump blood lungs left side heart. such, PE cause right heart unable send enough blood left side, left side can't maintain blood pressure. result pulmonary embolism hemodynamic instability -- known massive PE. That's what's going kill you.

If real docs (or med students know better me) want clarify correct this, please do! I'd love corrected I'm wrong something. mean health insurance go anywhere accepts it. companies illegal, depending live. Here, contact tracing quarantine mandatory Yeah working covid ppl coughing face really wanted find good seal o_o Unlike Trump tooted earlier, feel like real light end tunnel! There's lot evidence COVID actually endothelial/clotting disease. Get poked Johnson defeat Covid time We've watching stats long. hope countries develop dashboards showing numbers ongoing vaccinations. Would nice see cases go vaccination numbers go up. Watching fatalities go icing cake however.... Grandma died republicans decided covid fake news. Nurses don‚Äôt make people really rich get shown TV would fitting end 2020. According recent study Johns Hopkins, 250,000 people United States die every year medical mistakes, making third leading cause of¬†death¬†after heart disease cancer *A lot* nurses died actually. think test going hospital means nurses aren‚Äôt taking care Covid patients? Yes can, propaganda piece, like almost everything here. It'll higher...there already states counties refusing report I‚Äôm saying 100% looks like April-May range given multiple signs atm. Realistically tuesday/Wednesday see huge surges lowering think. LOL *NEXT* election cycle? kidding? I'm sure living MARKED increases following labor day Halloween 30 states. States like Iowa &amp; North Dakota almost 50% positivity rate, Texas hospitals capacity literally paying prisoners help morgues. state alone seen almost 400% increase ICU usage last month half. Lies. Icu nurse here, get tested every 3 days. 75 sounds insane even family connections wider stronger. (15-20 max usually)

What sacrifice previous, annoying norm! Looks like it‚Äôs going near may. Dude, you‚Äôre giving monologue Jurassic Park shit. Reel back. &amp;#x200B;

Maybe make 99% people's lives miserable 1%. Maybe lockdowns long lasting effects worse old people dying. sounds harsh, unhealthy people 70 people morbidly obese smoke probably going die next 5 years anyways. People's livelihoods, small businesses, jobs, guaranteed come back lockdown drags on.  feel like troll looking bites. states don‚Äôt free easy access tests. Go see hematologist. Clotting disorders mutations fairly common. Could within days said Fuck man... really, whip flame across times like drying joint. think flame kills germs instantly, let glass get really hot. Note, infectious disease expert stoner. video call Thanksgiving dinner, lovely, many Americans could done that.  No, use paragraphs French too. Nurses make Tik Tok dance videos show care...  Nothing black white. grey areas. Im sure good people, like Afghanistan. always hear good things people Afghanistan. good place visit? Nah. Conservative? Religion obsessed better word. disease completely different, would people behave differently? think guess answer ""What know now"" less confirmation dire (but reasonable trustworthy) warnings coming January, know would go differently could go back year warn people. warnings first time around. Belgian death count bit tricky. Belgium one countries unexplained excess death. 

I say handled property, compare neighbourgh keep account lab tests service industry personnel favorite entertainment district Dallas! Woop woop!! wanna test entertainment frontliners can! uS? Y‚Äôall act like didn‚Äôt sign shit . You‚Äôre contact people everyday. want test everyday ? don‚Äôt understand . Thank ... fucking job Pretty sure get tested matter are... area anyone go get test half hour thought everywhere us? Sorry, make people big bucks. Well media may entirely ""fake"", certainly strong biases. Every news source except AP Reuters, even slight biases, biased, either left right. grey area true fake. It‚Äôs question resources. It‚Äôs question will. massive number Americans convinced universal healthcare bad. never vote Democrat. never vote someone pushing ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù.

This something like Germany‚Äôs public option well lot industry regulations would closest hope better healthcare immediate future. That's he'd prefer, actually. people simply hide away accord, say things got better without ever lift finger. He'll congratulate ignore people died going die negligence. 

The problem is, think far many science deniers TX simply hide away reason. They're ones driving surge continue drive even hospital system breaks down. right, that's still quite high...makes realize deadly COVID really is. may take long. Thanksgiving infections rise exponentially next 2 14 days. Christmas New Year celebrations build that.

2021 poised make 2020 look like amateur. Heart issues also symptoms covid we'll see increasing well. Also STEM, observation. Natural aptitude also thing, everyone head sorts things, observed. think Johnny Cash's covers end impact had. People strong skills could totally more. shame. That, English version French news article. NFL teams paying tests employees. nurses employers choosing to. think measure nots, think poor ownership decision making hospitals, clinics, etc. Germany - exemption anybody!

You wear public - except crowded areas, public transport interacting someone - indoors everybody to! isn‚Äôt obvious athletes far important medical personnel. haven‚Äôt given another round bread, can‚Äôt take away circus did, winning! Count cases #1! count ballots. RemindMe! 18 days feel like taking crazy pills. mother works healthcare Ohio considers whole thing blown. working nurse position still, still works hospital. understand someone close could concerned it, especially much shortage workers numbers still going up. understand. don‚Äôt know anybody that‚Äôs enjoying ‚Äúconstitutional freedoms‚Äù six feet under. Still decided state error press release, seriously casting doubts credibility. ""All wanna say dont really care us"" Im Michael Jackson fan, song sure going mind lot 2020 That's problem, that's two birds one stone solution... always get real tree. really anything like it. lights even look different real tree somehow. incorporate buh mah freedumbs crowd? really idiot think football players provide value society doctors nurses. Truly smoothbrain stuff. Great troll though, got bite. That's quite strawman built yourself. People talking remote working opportunity. That's it. Four Moroneers: Trump, Bolsonaro, Duterte, Putin.

There trend world, WWII 75 years behind us, people vote power retarded assholes think of. get feeling COVID deaths distributed evenly throughout population, rather dangerous older get, mask wearing would common? part problem danger real enough certain elements population? I'm sure agree. keep mind western democracy around 250 years; far system government available. modern incarnation it, universal civil rights (or least claims towards that), less 100 years old. 

And yet pretend democracy obviously best natural system, though around forever everything else terrible. look number people want Trump retain presidency US despite election loss - nutcases *want dictatorship*. people US actively want dictatorship rather democracy have. make everyone realize that, even among people claim love democracy most, lot people actually think dictatorship better. means democracy optional, people may genuinely prefer different system. I'd say wrong prefer different system, people different values reasons crazy decisions. Yep, insurance covers states mandate free anyway. places charge least $120, others $300. reason investigated mRNA promotes gene expression places body typically get growth promoted. mRNA vaccine covid tricks human creating proteins, building immunity them. hypothesized may become unregulated promotion MYC genes long periods time(cancer) trigger autoimmune response, already shown do. holding COVID aid packages hostage effort get corporate legal liability immunity reason. I'm going limb maybe Sturgis something this.

Letting 250000 idiots sit around together can't dangerous.

/S nurses, work lab incredibly short. people prep work covid testing end working 12-14 hour shifts everyday. cannot keep management refuses back promised turn around time. Eventually going result complete shut testing. risk nothing weights risk new vaccine presents. 

Does it?

In city 2 million get 200-300 cases per day.

We maybe 3000 active cases.

 That's 0.15% population.

I hang around people practice social distancing, everyone wears masks.

If cross paths average couple people day (it's go out, every day), 3000 2000000 infected, what's probability one people walk past part 0.15% population infected?

A stats calculator says 0.3%.

That means sure I've crossed paths infected person go every day one year.

Since walk past actual contact defined CDC, everybody wearing masks keeping distance 2 meters, likelihood get infected one contacts? 0.01%? many hundreds thousands times must walk past masked infected person catch virus them?

Since would take average year meet infected person, realistically get infected way pandemic lists test natural life?

Since beginning pandemic ~3600 deaths city, ~50000 cases.

I'm exactly 40

The 30-39 age range 0.1% dead (and 13.6% cases), meaning ~4 people dead fatality rate 0.06%. 

The 40-49 age group 0.4% deaths (and 14.7% infections) , ~14 people dead fatality rate 0.19%.

Since I'm right middle age range, let's cut middle say 0.1% chance death get infected.

So exactly survival expectation continue I've far? 

How many nines want put decimal point 99.9999...%?

So now, rush get new vaccine, wait let others guinea pigs? False hero worship needs stop. mean bad thing? really sucks. I‚Äôm college athlete I‚Äôm getting test regularly 3 times month. wealthy powerful sweep buy foreclosures low rates, rent sky high prices flip sell.  see, that's thing. hard live someone. lot people live alone dealing lot mental health issues isolation last months. Fuck sports... pandemic we‚Äôve proved sports non-essential entertainment. cost get covid test US? 2022. Unless way submit federal legislature medical resident constant contact Covid patients. Starting symptoms day literally cannot get results 4/5 days. WORK HOSPITAL, tests taken resulted hours. blatant disregard healthcare workers, workforce perspective, can't even get back work im cleared get results back. especially awful think fact already modern day slavery prevalent U.S. across multiple industries sex work, agriculture. media love bit sensationalism. woeful. even two weeks.

Oh no, sumo wrestlers trouble then. Yes has, testing indicating important are. Testing might result out. job important. it‚Äôs backwards sure. super late signing vaccine contracts, months countries already so.

What's source that? Canada 3rd country sign Moderna (after Israel US) 4th sign Pfizer (after US, UK, Japan). get it, would keep going job actively trying kill you, eight months later.

First weeks get it, certainly expecting employer step take care everyone.

Eight months later? That's you. going ""shocked"" tell come work sick anyway? person working next known sick?

Just aware people mean people there. False comparison. One reporting individuals create harm (having gassed) financial compensation, status increase, incentives. reporting people decrease harm (overwhelming hospitals) increased safety community.

For right now, let's say end date October 3, 2021. it. Nasty drug. damage nerves. see coming? trying make joke drunk employer purchasing performing makes billions dollars. Getting takeout/delivery/drive-thru probably safer going grocery shopping since less exposure time.

Remember wear mask keep distance. state Australia covid outbreak 7 months. lockdown like 6 weeks. close state borders enforced quarantine. go well.  likely blame young people state making swipe ‚Äúliberals‚Äù like last time surge. Despite maskless rallies state definitely full young people, pretty much every person interviewed shutdowns hate definitely young. experience anecdotal, STILL see huge amount elderly people wearing masks stores. Hell, take word it- Washington State Department Health specifically endorses seven day quarantine negative test result valid exception restrictions gatherings. take exception compared anti-maskers. anti-maskers selectively ignore mountain evidence says masks simple effective way reduce transmission. Anyone who's familiar available scientific literature COVID incubation time, time test positive, transmission etc reason right combination isolation testing makes things way safer. I'm outside nobody within 50 yards stroll park, street, see reason wearing mask.

Really, really hoping keep streak going vaccine she‚Äôs age lifestyle it‚Äôs leveled her. understand acting like theres lockdown lockdown order. dont read news enough know, upturn cases? clearly know I'm talking about, January. mom swore covid back November '19; ""It's sickest I've ever been.""



Fast forward September, ICU. massive blood clot travelled legs lung. Three days later, dead.



A week passing, tested negative covid.



She 66 years old died 12 days 67th birthday. Silent Christmas Fucking seriously lol. go thanksgiving? Yeah, lot groups sacred cows they‚Äôre afraid get touched convention. existing right unionize, example, means unions basically never support convention, even though obviously heinous stuff rest constitution, like jp system. You‚Äôre part problem guts speak parents.

Grow up. Anyone trucker. need CDL license. 

And 99% first world would dead month truckers stopped jobs, people would die nurses quit, majority people would still survive. would *love* explain easy woman pee bottle. don‚Äôt believe numbers Southeast Asia lol. Don‚Äôt get wrong, US going well handling covid we‚Äôre better job testing counting cases countries also fumbling.

It‚Äôs harder tell bc don‚Äôt money resources track covid well do. mention China long history fudging numbers make look better. discussions ignore obvious idea could *not gotten hair done all*, like rest us 8 months. feels lot like Puppy Lost Way analogy Happy Gilmore. Da fuck read? point incoherent rambling even approach rational thought. award points may God mercy soul. Covid clotting disorder, even respiratory disease. Inactivity certainly make worse, science covid causing blood clots really clear. summary librul snowbirds really problem. ill-liberal snowbirds midwest north central states.

The travelers' neighbors northeastern states say 'Don't come back vaccinated.' stand original post? got downvoted shit trying offer advice/warning UK/Europe 'spikes' happen. countries/states serious outbreaks re-open (even restrictions) borders open cases still able re-imported, virus one trajectory.

My point obvious back simple spike would settle existing rules/tracing UK/Europe experience telling - everyone piled dormvotes.

A month right... Exactly. Much like deficit, they‚Äôll suddenly care covid party power flyover states actively getting decimated though? high infection rate liberal yupee cities. 1200 *more* cases province. believe Doctor Fauci same

You'd mistaken. [He said lied regret anything said context time said it, correct. told task force meetings serious problem lack PPEs masks health providers putting harm's way every day take care sick people,""

He lied wanted PPE available health providers. Whether agree 'For greater good' mentality, fact remains blood hands same. world doesn't. Aircraft indeed continuously filter air, much frequently buildings, example.

That said, lot research aircraft tend low humidity levels, results airborne particles able remain suspended much longer. 

But main issue air travel can't go directly car plane. need congregate lots people inside airport security, baggage, etc. could wind telling funeral director. European living Japan, I've realized, mid 40s, US disaster area, somewhere anywhere rest world trying emulate. totally Covid specific, kind tie neatly-tied bow conclusion. 

To think, interested moving US early 20s. seems like dodged bullet. whole milk though. exactly. literally nobody cares lol Americans self centered ""You're wrong think know it"" - I'm sensing serious projection here. hazard guess, I'd say probably gathered others yesterday, advice health officials CDC, implored public ""host virtual gathering delay travel"" 

I think know deep wrong. know indeed, one Americans outside world looking horror judging per original article. prioritized desire gather holidays health safety community, comment thread making feel uncomfortable deep down. lashing assuage cognitive dissonance. all, ""it's people wrong - *I* definitely part problem! I... took precautions *I* gathered! Virtual Thanksgiving?! N-No! I... *had* gather, nothing happen *me!*""

This attitude country quarter million death climbing sharply. family gathered country Thanksgiving yesterday. video called me, weren‚Äôt socially distancing, weren‚Äôt wearing masks, getting ready eat food. called make fun taking virus seriously. ‚Äúmissing out‚Äù mom‚Äôs food (who could end ICU catches COVID). Mind you, believe somehow can‚Äôt get family. Part wants get virus karma, another part doesn‚Äôt healthcare workers don‚Äôt actually want sick. feel bad thinking it, I‚Äôm angry disappointed them. [1912 Republican Convention have/could months ago everyone got page

No, really have.  
This assumption reflects lack understanding society works. bravely sacrificing freedom name getting sick, people keep lights on, provide food, make sure potable water comes taps, keeps internet working Amazon orders coming still work interacting one another goods workers nation sometimes globe.  
It's everywhere else too, functionally impossible shut society complete isolation virus already globe back November thanks interaction required. much worse first started ü§£ People denial love conspiracies - gives sense control. stand original post? got downvoted shit trying offer advice/warning UK/Europe 'spikes' happen. countries/states serious outbreaks re-open (even restrictions) borders open cases still able re-imported, virus one trajectory.

My point obvious back simple spike 
Obvious... Everyone dormvoted Didnt already covid? Wow. really need take look reality. delusional.

You one person saying opposite almost entire global field virology epidemiology, mention doctors nurses front lines, claim experts side expert disagrees extreme minority say believe quack. governor that's everything get everyone infect other, makes things even harder. stories places TX patients treated days days ER things like sepsis ICU. transport others wait bed open up. Although first vaccines use RNA particles instruct cells make viral protein, vaccines use parts virus, rather whole. far, Dr. Kennedy said, evidence show one type vaccine would likely drive resistance. ‚ÄúWe seen vaccine resistance evolve many different kinds vaccines,‚Äù said, ‚Äúbut also plenty examples resistance never emerged.‚Äù

So need concern, something keep mind.  thanksgiving super spreader Black Friday shopping super spreader well underway, Imma watch behind windows. tip anything spouses workplace 9/12 employees quarantined due COVID one get tested though symptomatic continues work refusing wear mask? husband can‚Äôt get get test tomorrow asymptomatic coworker testing tomorrow well. continue working today take work quarantining staff.

Prep coffins boys Civil liberties really suck. Hopefully find way get rid soon. level ignorance staggering. Cases growing exponentially...and stopped. lockdown, additional safety measures installed. SOMETHING end exponential growth, case it‚Äôs pretty clear simply that‚Äôs it‚Äôs hard spread virus half people around already it. Honestly ""world"" care much. mostly trying survive themselves. Fox co-conspirators right wing news bubble fanned flames Covid need held liable hundreds thousands wrongful deaths long term disabilities.

Rupert Murdoch reaching expiration date. Next want Lachlan replaced sister law, Kathryn. might compromise husband, James. Dude let give one better.

Not country's [one top infectious disease general masking, [prime [top infectious disease control past respiratory outbreaks like 2003 SARS, 2009 pandemic flu Nipah Virus outbreak. 

But numerous reports shown virus high rate presymptomatic asymptomatic spread, unlike SARS behave like SARS, updated protocols one safest place world pandemic. 

I believe Doctor Fauci same, getting reports true traits virus, views. hold learning know. us never experienced those.

Those experienced hardships appreciate good things (though rarely appreciate much)

There case someone became obese escaped homelessness, poverty hunger. Even financial stable still eats large portion food fear next meal arrive enjoy life full stomach Take grain salt think would following order

Johnson Johnson single dose vaccine (possible early January, infection rates pick late december)

Then comes NovaVax. UK trial 15,000 volunteers completed December January 2021 get interim analysis.

After anyone's guess. Chinese Vaccines would answer followed one India.

Then Medicago's phase 2/3 clinical trial. sure mid 2021 half dozen phase 3 results multiple manufacturers.

Sanofi GSK interesting one get results mid 2021. live Texas governor said ""absolutely lockdowns."" going interesting see holds that. Reactions vaccines vary lot. kids got flu shot year laid us 30 hours. Muscle aches, fatigue, lack appetite. Husband got flu shot month later symptoms all. I‚Äôm aware....

But making point post something actually happen flu makes look like idiot. specific 321 know Oxford vaccine age bellow 55 90 percent effective including asymptomatic cases.

we know that. oxford vaccine number different arms. seem cherry picked two number, one 62% one 90%. pooled data that. 100% looks like managed data give effectiveness, big no. cherry pick data. pool data uses different methodologies. ended making food separate trade offs parents in-laws, masked up. Got see people briefly, good meal wife. government. Fuckkkk offfff u mountains? Rangeley? Can‚Äôt even access mod logs anymore, would see word triggered removal. good person cares others? One largest disconnects I've seen large lack empathy compassion fellow people, I've literally people tell gave covid older immunocompromised relative would suck risk willing take. sure american media. lot covid deniers/anti mask/no vaccine/5g crowd keeps telling us well sweeden herd immunity thing. might false herd immunity strtategy... oh boy loud group saying was. guess happy China longer ""pillaging"" iron, produce, wine, coal.

Have fun recession deserve all. Congrats living personal hell. Yes that's exactly I'm thinking stuffing face Turkey.  ‚ÄúEven is‚Äù - is. Prove wrong?

You‚Äôre right quacks high places, got sucked like everyone else batting wrong team. people price, rest scared speak loose jobs get attacked publicly brainwashed. It‚Äôs really hard understand, tale old time itself. It‚Äôs funny quack owns company makes tests though, matter look opinion flawed. 

You say I‚Äôm anti science calling experts fields virology epidemiology. aren‚Äôt expert neither I. 2 sides people contrasting arguments. You‚Äôve picked side I. difference I‚Äôve researching corruption whole adult life keeping kardashians. It‚Äôs impossible faith people lie continually relentlessly. Maybe you, though. Easy low counts, dont get tested! Same. governor said morethan 2 households (in MI) strongly urged recommendation. one actually enforces anything didn‚Äôt even bother calling cops. probably would guess would‚Äôve neighbor across street anyways. According Facebook feed, family one stayed home isolated. don‚Äôt know why. general theme you‚Äôre either taking precautions, ‚Äúyou know risks,‚Äù you‚Äôre bunker. ever realized going downvote something first sentence in? dude, chill out. good old ‚Äúparties switched‚Äù myth.

Some people highly biased insane liberal news sources rationalize everything confirm worldview, huh? parties get one day decide ‚Äúswitch‚Äù. 100% effective preventing disease

no makes sense. fully realize there's pandemic also acknowledge amount bullshit that's tied it. Also literally fell ladder died pretty much instantly. would label right mind dying virus. There's pandemic also clearly taken advantage of. long think take Berlin even open centers? One year? Two? TEN?! friend LA posted pic dining room - space 20 people. Insanity. Went walk wife baby saw 5 families large thanksgiving dinners 6-10 people.

It‚Äôs craziness. miss family. live 30 miles away. always exception involves personal sacrifices everyone U.S. put replies context, say ""yes did"", mean there's small &lt;1% population fit. guy said, went shopping saw two without, we're 28 days clear everyone still diligently following orders.

We history clashing government police. we're told something it. There's pros cons sort carefree attitude, course, that's reason we're today. realize questions complaints, right? Like ‚Äúwhy neighbor‚Äôs party loud?‚Äù 

The venn diagram ‚Äúquestion‚Äù ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù overlaps. sister reasonably well educated understand I'm one family seems worry this. mother elderly suffering copd, could die regular cold. Thanksgiving, insisted get together despite kid running fever. went get tested... decided wait long would next day. talked mother visiting, course. Exactly!

I facetimed hour half yesterday family. aunt/uncle cousins another state earlier one risk parents (who would never risk going house pandemic period). Zero issue great time. 

A lot people clearly zero self control refuse make sacrifices. frustrating. Jesus Christ, can‚Äôt actually stupid? getting infected doesn‚Äôt prevent reinfection vaccines we‚Äôve working complete waste time. Literally everything happening past 6 months built premise infection conferring immunity. true flying relatively safe right now? air purification system get duped fellow moron know all? (They're not; they're worse Americans. people even get damn flu shot.) overall data better Astrazeneca vaccine?

The important part comparing 'seriours' infections. ratio AZ vaccine like 0/30 compared 1/19 0/11 Pfizer Moderna...iirc MSNBC said thing Rachel Maddow. news like this. What‚Äôs point? worry rest world catch christmas, new year, chinese new year etc ""Puts hazmat suit, looks jumps boat* nice try cant give rona! sorry loss.

Over would put hotel (paid government) nowhere live money pay accommodation. application housing benefits usually takes 5-6 days, meaning could able find place rent, use housing benefits pay it. (Norway)

Again, thank sharing story. touched heart, ways one.  Fuck, man. never manage type word right. 

Yeah, intubated probably. might failure compared Nordic countries. compare US though? Yep, wall street.   I'm guessing ""informal discussions"" taking place.  I'm sure would worse, apply EUA/approval get denied, apply months phase 3b trial.  

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone clue would interesting hear opinions. Would great weren‚Äôt family refusing wear mask coming within 1 foot covid positive beg stay away Meanwhile red tape still tying operation warp speed US. I'm RN Ohio test negative come back work must symptom free *3 full days* returning work. cold beginning November missed 12 days symptoms 8. suggested get tested cannot enforce it. did, negative.

I also missed 5 days due stomach bug August. get tested time pretty classic case. puked 12 hours it, go back 3 full days afterward per policy. 

Fortunately absences excused pre-covid way would miss day two work things, absences would excused pre-covid either. homeless people live? (not snarky genuinely curious) definitely. America showing house lies turned time crisis. many times, we've portrayed heroes would rise country would show strength. took cancelling football steer sheep rebel front line workers fighting pandemic. would take it? He's recently antibodies. North African knew meant reading news time time.
Could've also guessed based site.. 
Maybe widen horizons instead expecting world cater your... Intubated? go get tested New Zealand. Taiwan. think someone told Iceland, fact checked it. Supposedly Vietnam Thailand also well. nurses ridden billions, start giving shit /s. think mean ‚Äúfree-dumb‚Äù... like August onwards initially what's tier 2 since lot googling symptoms US.

it's found diabetic. fair, like went doctor got turned away, started feel awful, googled symptoms went asking tested specifically it. I'll never forget incredulous look nurse (I 20) solemn confirmed dont lot homeless people live warmer cities. dont houses summer dont houses winter Man shit makes wanna go many reason. nurse. take chest X-rays EVERY covid patient comes hospital. Since day 1 seen nothing imaging personnel. Hospital administration gives us absolutely zero support cus ‚Äúthey‚Äôre techs‚Äù, getting N95 like trying perform tight rope walk, sometimes nobody even tells us patient suspected covid. It‚Äôs fucking infuriating. fucking director got god damn bonus. love nurses, really do, never even come contact fucking covid patient knowingly fucking faces every night pushing imaging receptors backs. Sorry rant everyone shit shits eating alive. No, made story bullshit. Testing free everyone. could sign appointment drug store clinic urgent care get free test tomorrow maybe next day. whining boss testing? Yes several weeks US glide herd immunity. 80% from? CDC estimate 99.8% survival rate. booze do? Thin blood? survivor post r/COVID19positive RemindMe! 14 days run faster maybe get front queue. another point, drives nuts sports(wo)men referred heroes. 

What exactly heroic sport? get it. Go save lives, educate people, stop atrocities - anything beating people physical exercise. Found doctor downvoted me.  completely touch. boss made 6 figures ask similar dress purchased store. Like mine isn‚Äôt lily pulitzer $200 it‚Äôs thrift store $20. 
When stared job told hard find millennial work non profit. place ran money fired millennials told us come back senior positions got masters degrees. Like ok let spend 1/4 salary masters degree take year off, unpaid experience walk another job. isn‚Äôt going happen.   can't go race extremely wealthy African Americans, know.

Are telling millionaire Black movie star sports athlete given vaccine first minimum wage White cashier Walmart much higher risk exposure? nurse confirm.  It‚Äôs much worse comments let on. survivor post r/COVID19positive Chill, nurses literally first revive vaccine comes out. rushed vaccine first time longest historic medical field.


Early coronavirus drug trials tested vaccines mostly White people; next phase aims diversity. think Leicester ever actually left they? I‚Äôve lived PA covid states bunch places like walgreens rite-aid giving free covid tests. Perhaps person referring hospital. ""what's that? payout companies again? Also another stimulus check reaches working citizens?"" doesn't. Goal save hospitals plan vaccinate hospital workers risk / seniors first. vaccines live viruses. cannot get infected, meaning cannot experience COVID symptoms. side effects general immune response side effects. They're vague non-specific. Oh absolutely. management seem care. work mental health, consumers severely mentally ill. lot consumers think COVID fake many lie screening station. We've couple positive people building, ok since wear PPE, quarantine üôÑ millions who‚Äôve already it? Like me. statement quoted true massive subset population. Yuuuuuup. Finally got tested, husband got fever tested positive. Admin tried figure might gotten it, obviously couldn‚Äôt work covid patients. Smaller, compared last year, yes. still pretty big things considered. Went little drive today see parking lots full. Chillis JCPenney. No, watch facepalming. I've always wondered avoid responsibility anyone take kind action based proposing.

""It's 'call arms,' 'entertainment.'"" Here's funny part, even know ""free service"" giving ""fuck you"" downvote for. I'm questioning even know. sure made feel good though. 

Btw, point proven. poster one respond post, wound deleting, idea downvoting. Cheapest censorship thought earth Ok since english, based title only, assuming mink spread virus cats put too. assume mutated virus spreads cats. keep cats inside, maybe spray thw bottoms shoes come home article misses fucking point. like saying since 99% patients Egypt attack doctors nurses, violence towards medical practitioners real problem.

It's problematic logic pilloried infamous study slavery, Time Cross, authors argued slavery brutal since chance one slave would flogged small little fear. point averaged population large plantation, whippings corporeal punishment would daily spectacle.

Of course salient examples disruptive, hostile patients stick one's mind. real problem, even 1% patients like this, large hospital seeing multiple examples fuckers every single day, constantly impeding doctors work. often IP address *and* browser linked. Opening link incognito/private window works websites. websites like New York Times work method I've tried. varies it‚Äôs retardation muricanism makes give fuck nothing except yourself
many family member suffer Negligence failing predict. Nature never loses. 

House always wins. die end, forget part think robot something? lol Many countries do. seen Europe lately? Specially murica. Easily half think Wired article bullshit. personally know anybody working medicine right know covid-denial real problem.

The article saying covid denial problem. saying CNN story check out. Lol what? deny anything? simply stating covid mandates laws, apparently that's controversial statement we're seeing, ones need hear understand it, neither; understand since day one, need convincing.  


But admire determination unwillingness give up, incredibly commendable. observation flaws American society observations opinion proven understatement. Social distancing mask wearing stop virus, also protect economy well. Look New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, etc.  half Americans needs done. Though I‚Äôll agree far many not.

Why sound awfully familiar...? Wait see lines Black Friday... amazes even non-pandemic year stupidity people show mere hours ""giving thanks"" save couple bucks something really need. read response thought thing. Ironic.  athlete tests positive sit player replace and/or postpone games. nurse tests positive already short/understaffed unit one less nurse understaffed. postponing shift care patients. think hospital would prefer know many nurses positive. we're symptomic we're tested. tested everyone hush hush quiet tested positive letting person even see actual results. Faucy delay Thanksgiving famaily guy could done same: mayor future. Right. Person also said peaked mid winter. I‚Äôm guessing ‚Äúpeak‚Äù near ‚Äúpeak‚Äù seems like seasons huge impact numbers Yeah. I'm TX. governor......he really govern best sense word......recently blamed exploding Covid rate on..............family gatherings. open bars, restaurants, etc. 

At least Round Rock, city wide mandatory mask ordinance. think many anti-maskers comply gives cover comply.  Yeah, plenty mouth idiots, overall, works. don‚Äôt know man. hardest part whole medical training pipeline wife stint children‚Äôs hospital ER.

So tough see. Yeah, think factors too. Nobody wanted cancel year. mom urging invite family members apartment ‚Äúthey won‚Äôt give you‚Äù.  Yesterday, quiet Thanksgiving partner, isolated get vulnerable extended family sick, looked window saw house street massive gathering...at least 25 people, multiple generations even little baby. Cars kept pulling house, people walked without even wearing masks. depressing casually people treating this. type weak bladder? think athletes pay tests. one people I'll bite (bring downvotes). family taking Covid extremely seriously since March (pretty much never get house, wear mask everywhere). son seen grandparents since March (We video conferences, let's honest, really work most). 

For Thanksgiving Christmas opportunity take time work quarantine test degree. case, Family able isolate 8 days contact parents. Covid symptoms would cancelled plans. expect Christmas.

The short long keep multi-household bubble, never safer get together Thanksgiving Christmas due ability take days self-isolate. get together Thanksgiving Christmas, looking maybe May optimistic vaccines become wide-spread enough everyone take (I personally think likely something like August September). see family now, looking year without son seeing grandparents. No. Wrong continent. Sweden neutral country France Germany. Thank you! Yeah many people longer afford them. get choose either lower price get nothing. People still vacationing snowbirds NE here. It‚Äôs crazy people aren‚Äôt staying home global pandemic. BRUH

We've eradicated two diseases, neither SARS. studying virology 2004, yet paying attention SARS epidemic? add up, all. know SARS SARS-COV disappeared own.

No, coronaviruses known relatively unable mutate. still mutate, dramatically. example, SARS-COV-2 mutated. February 2020, found G614 Germany, SARS-COV-2 mutation. increase number peplomer glycoproteins virus' capsid, minor mutation.

And yes, SARS vaccine tested. Throughout 2002, 2003, 2004, went phase 1, 2, 3 song dance COVID-19 vaccine. worked, ready ship China, Singapore, Canada, disappeared own.

You mean countries buying stuff them? thought economies ruined? 99+ survival rate. better chancenofndyimg someone coming shooting home invasion. emotional appeals dont work bro, sorry. Looked comment: It‚Äôs part checks balances. actions also checks balances. üòÇ well least reality star longer President January. that's start. Haha. sure update.

I've never got many nasty replies. lot people think parents root evil going 5-person Thanksgiving. Yikes. Absolutely, I‚Äôve learned US history hate country. people continue day believe propaganda wild. ""traditional"" BF shopping ""I've done research really best price year"" stores I'd usually hit today.

Nope, nope, nopity, nope.

One clothing store question 40% August (versus 50% today), stocked August knowing full well we'd mid shit show Thanksgiving. rest items, nice-to-haves needs, getting skipped I'll figure creative workaround BF 2021. think it‚Äôs estimates. fewer cases capturing, quicker thing peters out. hope right me.

""A bit"". 3 months. lockdown way harsher Australia's first June 3 could freely enter Schengen area, you?

Yes, open borders kinda essential European economies avoid completely collapsing - I'm talking finding food grocery stores kind collapse. australian policy - keeping borders shut vaccine comes - sustainable there, way dependent other. soon factories started reopen, happened mostly May, reopen borders. Overwhelmed numbers going thanks close herd immunity. Oh come on, nice. Anyway, can't. That's point. That's there's local transmission here: government runs quarantine system there's real way game it, even wanted to. never really considered would rather vote Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho Trump, are, absolutely would. explain Taiwan, South Korea New Zealand, much freedom speech US. Also, lot countries strict anti-dissident policies got wrecked COVID-19 governments get control. got test needed one, got stimulus money, dont see wouldnt get vaccine, well.

this virus changed relationship suspect millions like me. I'm resentful hateful behavior. 

I made lovely Thanksgiving meal husband kids, people share back fence big party loud music laughing....I fucking hate people. need super careful going know people got infected week. Lol. OP still right, still wrong. post \*NZ\*, Australia, quickly shut non quarantined air travel. stated incorrect referencing New Zealand Australia, nothing discussion. OP proved wrong, tried reframe discussion exclusive Australia.

Somtimes better walk away mate. Wow.... wow. 

What hell mods thinking? Given heavy dispersion reliance parties dining, absolutely possible eradicate it, lot less effort would needed flu.

Therefore, every susceptible kind animal sustain disease, many live crowded conditions like do. they'll like Belgium: symptomatic still working. matter test says.

And that's enough, let everyone work walk ICU bed. experience many years ago DVTs pulmonary embolisms left venous insufficiency leg clot originally developed. 

Now leg swells frequently suspect vulnerable another clot form whatever reason.

The pulmonary embolism kill left damaged life.  cost matter resident UK? developed countries government paying everything 320 sound better reason...? Stop believing bullshit read Reddit Bedside RN pre-hospital RN checking in.

When we're forced interract daily choice go work store, everybody gets hit.

But get make choice go hang family not, idiots get hit. Add vitamin supplement top that.

Lucky guy Humans share 99% DNA chimpanzees. first six months highest deaths last 150 years, suddenly June November everybody best health ever?

Misleading link? 
‚ÄúCOVID-19 meant deaths 10 percent higher average period last five years, Statistics Office said. April number deaths almost 40% higher average due surge COVID-related fatalities.‚Äù
Tell fits narrative Sweden lower death rate year. anyone know would able expect results? don't. numbers covid going back too. Stop BS. ""Lot people saying it."" Oregon Dem. here, rationally upset state doing? 

Sure, low numbers also suck testing. work place close contact positive case but, ""it's ok, test positive 2 days contact."" in, left work, got tested day, results come back 2 days. Smh Small business tyrants care petty power trip anything else. This. It'd different everyone following guidelines enough people refuse to, making effort effective be.

I last game went college. like 25 closet here. partner/family member positive you‚Äôve still work show symptoms. Cases rising don‚Äôt care staff. Mine drive-up. meant, drove get tested walked Quikshade tent. wording confusing.
Also, totally agree. testing en masse see looks drive-up. It‚Äôs absolutely outrageous. infrastructure place eight months mass test EVERYONE. There‚Äôs nothing disagree said. one handle pandemic. lockdowns used first response, seeing that‚Äôs good response, last tactic.  Really hard accurately make claim. real way getting even close accurate figure guess stared joint seconds went friend's house. dawned might never share one mate shook me. I'm housekeeper get tested every Thursday. Yeah, America commit crimes point black person crime goes away anf police high five you.

I'm going add /s. 

I love US, wonderful place live, problems, experience news somewhere else fuck idea like living here. 

Media would believe seething racist shithole nobody wears mask kill put crack nearest black neighbor cover up. Thats bullshit, US fucking huge ton bad examples bad eggs, large nice place live people nice loving one another. Ive lived life experienced 1/100th shit see media.

Shit would probobly lot easier racially homogeneous population miniscule population like every miniscule country Europe dont easy. giant goddamn melting pot culture *everyone comes accross globe*, yeah bit racism, we're best. damn mutated virus likes jumping around... seasonal flu spreading around world day descendent 1918. stopping flu-like transmission.

The virus us forever. ‚ÄúThe world watches dread disbelief ‚Äú silly think world gives shit happens America American holiday. think spot on. I‚Äôm lucky enough work home, know plenty people work retail/in service industry, government basically telling ‚ÄúKeep going work risking lives don‚Äôt dare fun activities make life worth living‚Äù. situation don‚Äôt know would made far without saying fuck going eat. one know talking america cares much.... happened us. MIL told us plane tickets months ago visit relatives. declined. MIL cancel trip one family got Covid got exposed. Unfortunately, reason people backed forced someone actually got it. 99 percent? country lol. I'm taking risks, saying fuck government, definitely 99 percent survival rate. Like except one country lol Yeah hair too. know people gone shop point. would quite surprising disease comes excessive coagulation autoantibodies cause damage milder cases. Oh jeez woke see comments removed. tea?! Why? burn fucking things!!! ""the world watches dread disbelief?

what bunch lil bitches
what absolute asshat wrote douchery? pretty brash accusation, really true, since like many people heard news.

It's easy fun bash media blame covering things. know what's hard? media. People complain people jobs try themselves. Unfortunately dark people abiding rules. gathered thanksgiving Christmas holiday feel Honest question... report whom? Yes. I'm teacher person students. told longer considered close contacts work quarantine work. literally said treated like ""Healthcare professionals"". apparently means treated like crap. Hats Healthcare field. truly appreciate work dedication! real MVPs. Huh? Grammar dude, please. Fair enough. know conservatives listen Rush, watch Fox News/OAN, read Breitbart. seems endless appetite conservative media sources, people engage seem engage quite lot. I'm genuinely curious is.

Happy hear apply you. No, would torching economy delay inevitable. Note wear mask everywhere I've staying home, working home etc. I‚Äôve working Covid patients since March don‚Äôt really want tested. I‚Äôm feeling sick, would I? don‚Äôt expose others. respirator exhalation valve, I‚Äôm breathing virus, would already contaminated room. also wear shield respirator anything coming shielded. came positive, would miss work I‚Äôm badly needed. reason test me. know protect public (and family) me. It‚Äôs public I‚Äôm worried about. Along massive &amp; unnecessary Thanksgiving travel government refusing pay people stay home...yeah long dark winter. always option (at least NY, imagine states well) go state run drive testing facility. perhaps that‚Äôs efficient testing strategy one highest risk groups. wife works hospital patient care told gets _one_ free covid test (also one n95 mask per week). don‚Äôt want know people exposures send people home 4 days wait test result. Hospital systems simply decided they‚Äôre okay people getting it. Bullshit. Obama pandemic response prepared years advance Trump threw window. CDC recommended masks, Biden put one wearing ever since. Trump said basically ""You wear one want to, I'm going though.""

There 300 million+ Americans fucking idiot stupid pieces shit. fuck American website hate Americans much? read article?

Um, no. here. self-proclaimed experts everything everyone. real world cannot much different imagination, it? trustworthy friend tells getting symptoms tested positive tell people trust around quarantine trust actually supposed keeping people hospitals ventilators. goal avoid 100%, goal avoid flooding hospitals. mature. mature. Tegnell: think achieve herd immunity ‚ÄòThe world watches dread‚Äô

No don‚Äôt lol. don‚Äôt really care Americans get to. like don‚Äôt care get to. comes slush fund. ^

Hey Reddit, get load Internet Tough Guy! based less 3000 people though. Yes dose 1/2 mean data data safety efficacy gets ignored regiment. still vaccine similar immune response similar safety profile. Pretty sure people got tired lockdown ones *not* wearing masks person close relatives health care workers. astounding. multitude problems taking face value. 

1: dad works hospital, got tested every exposure every symptom. reflect priorities nation, one hospital 6,000 U.S.

2: Med-care workers extremely valuable irreplaceable. isolated every worker symptom exposure, you‚Äôd workers. It‚Äôs realistic. What‚Äôs testing going realistically resolve? nurse gets covid, happens? Well, feel good enough work they‚Äôre going allowed desperate situations. Nurses feel responsible lives care, extra work-load put coworkers working instances over-capacity. literally work death, it‚Äôs horrible, testing doesn‚Äôt solve issue make better. ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù systematic changes made institutions themselves, higher supply nurses. Neither viable options point time. 

3: Individuals get tested, free, time want. institution isn‚Äôt issuing mandatory tests, may get tested yourself. work hospital, there‚Äôs avoiding reality you‚Äôre almost certainly going infected. Realistically, that‚Äôs I‚Äôve experienced. epicenter GA wasn‚Äôt Atlanta, Albany. went 2% 100% capacity within 72 hours suspected covid cases test kits available early on. Every single person needed intensive care got intensive care, although outsourced. Realistically, infinite test kids would saved 1 life, time resources valuable, tests near bottom list ‚Äúessential‚Äù items. treat somebody who‚Äôs critically-ill suspected covid exact way treat confirmed covid, reason waste resources confirming resources limited. Completely mindblown... Yeah. We've spending billions stadiums decades asking homeless vacate premises lay foundation.

You expect U.S.A. culture change NOW? dont understand concede.... Lol every time mentioned mortality rate comment thread say working age group. See? altering numbers facts fit view. 

Small businesses adapt done well, small businesses want stay stuck middle ages dont. go small locally owned grocery store, order online wait car pickup. resturaunts go also that. havent gone business. Maybe people use billions dollars handouts improve infrastructure. 

I guess arguing stupid arrogant. I'm sure could sit days talking like could brick fucking wall. 

And people way. People make economy work. everyone sick indebted medical bills, see well economy does. 

Have fun buzzwords altered statistics, imma go back real world actually give fuck people life. Like fuck hate everything stand for, still value life own. hope stupidity doesnt get anyone love killed. top everybody oughta aware already big scarcity lungs needed transplants Covid. expect transplant Covid norm. It‚Äôs last resort many factors fall place get lung fits (group blood size etc) 
still healthy enough undergo surgery. would count that. 
And it‚Äôs sad say everybody needing getting new lungs Covid another otherwise sick person gonna die. literally compete lungs.
So people‚Äôs sake don‚Äôt get situation denial virus taking serious wearing mask got illusion mask kills freedom. popcorn got tested went way so.

My job informed weeks ago might exposed coworker, want anything monitor symptoms negatively affected.

If read paper would understand taking measures LESS NEGATIVE IMPACT letting virus run rampant.

Had dealt properly start could back normal safe now, instead economy still hurting fucked another 9+ months.  Yup. test positive cases. test staff continue put work they're actually symptomatic. already enough staff start taking people 2 weeks time test positive really short. Better know deal become sick work. breed vote *more* rational people unburdened critical thought. 

Want kids? kids, reason deliberate afford kind world bringing into. 

Passionate single issue? Vote R, reason consider broader scope issues affect life, even well informed single issue claim care about. ordered clippers scissors. feeling get spent half rent money cart full plastic chinese crap. nurse surprise  Nah, much coughing silent. knowingly maliciously sharing false information probably via fake accounts using anonymizing measures prevent identification. proper measures place conceal one‚Äôs identity (VPN, public wifi, false accounts, MAC spoofing, etc), probably infeasible track suspect down. Yes *sport* completely non-essential function worldwide pandemic. need understand priorities higher whether team well. say shitty? I'm arguing all....

The OP concluded comment Half time half deaths (ish) 

While technically correct, interpreted correctly. Spanish Flu, significantly smaller population, ""half deaths half amount time"" support point. That's literally saying.

Also, say ""*we* fully understand data"", person clearly not. *Maybe do*, don't. similar thing happened  Heard MouthPeace Mooselabs? work well sanitary. Come man...85 older? Give break. many Thanksgivings possibly have? 7 million people monumentally stupid, that‚Äôs exactly great news... Cost living also low, weather decent year, world's best beaches.

""The world""? world better things watch America. Peaceful prosperous time? 
I think 9/11, dot com bust, housing bust, war middle east, stagnating wages high inflation, astronomical student dept, pandemic economic depression would like word you. name few. healthcare getting tested? get tested weekly work building poor fuck. think hospital/network dependent. work hospital part large non-profit network. symptom, supposed report work. call covid command center, speak clinician get routed covid testing site. allowed report work test negative symptom free. Thats right, even test covid negative, coughing bit common cold, allowed work. kind sucks miss entire week nausea diarrhea likely mild food poisoning.  another note, personally know anti-mask nurses.

I know too, although work patients. think since they're healthy (bodybuilders) virus nbd get it. times I've seen mask noses uncovered want slap upside head. literally don‚Äôt know anybody stayed home didn‚Äôt Thanksgiving maskless.

Which baffles me. Even care anyone else, think self preservation thing. healthcare conglomerates

I'm starting think healthcare like prisons never run corporations.

I think doctor private practice fine insurers hospitals fully transparent non-profits.

With non-profits competing get entrenched bad organizations like see many government run things US. one non-profit starts siphoning money inflated executive administrative pay another replace it. answer is:

Stop speaking nuance exist.

Surgeons wear masks proven prevent blood transferring disease.

This relatively new virus little proof masks make difference many settings they're recommended. though speak like adults never agreed upon. ""Even nurses test positive working""


That's insanely irresponsible sets possible future lawsuits hospital nurses. OMG bro! vision~! ""What? actually want us focus medical personnel truly getting us pandemic? Okay, fine. start calling guys heroes again, make happy?""

I hate way country works... think found possible Philadelphia incident work CNA around positive COVID patients even tested positive. get rapid tested every three days. Tomorrow marks year since I've movie theater. Usually would go 4 - 6 times year. think theaters open since March. miss them, point I'd willingly go one right now. hope end breathing tube inconsiderate fuck check floats water think lot news newspapers fault. people trust news. frankly agree point, lie stuff, quiet happy ignore news get ratings. Look occupy wall street biggest example, one largest country wide protests took felt like month get byline. Thousands people gather streets celebrate Biden.

This sub says nothing.

People visit families Thanksgiving.

This sub acts like they're commiting murder.

I personally think absolutely fine, shut country virus, goodness sakes r/coronavirus, consistency. Yeah spouse household member confirmed covid, hospital test you. report work symptoms. least two coworkers situation. hospital says can't test anyone left come work. Nevermind fact people asymptomatic spread virus, masks 100%. *You* deeply stupid person, though don‚Äôt think speak hundreds millions others. honestly know whether county better next time.

I do, answer no.  OH IM SORRY THOUGHT AMERICA cluster 5 set mutations observed couple months. definitely eradicated now.

note information showed cluster 5 immune escape mutation humans. since spread human-to-human contact also likely less fit wild type human virus.  easily go bankrupt charges network hospital. don‚Äôt sympathy Covid deniers point in/out network system US specifically designed screw patients maximize profit insurance companies. It‚Äôs criminal. clearly comprehension federal spending money supply works. That's sadly 99% sub ya.

Everyone die, billions young people symptoms lasts ever, get clots die horrible death despite death rate people 50 less 0.1%. happened friends. sat ICU father week (not Covid related) dropped God son's bday gift porch &amp; said come I've ICU. friend's husband said he's worried &amp; need mask visit inside. 

Well, need mask I've been. kids in-person school daycare people wear masks around since county shut schools Covid &amp; rising. appreciate trust, that's going make immune.  much wrong comment, nothing referring blaming problems foreigners long time.

Your former president ALWAYS blames countries. Mexico crime, drugs rapes, China covid(going far call China virus), Canada lost lumber auto sector jobs, etc, etc. Republicans quite too. don't.

UK spend time Family like Americans.

Stop melodramatic. Black Fridays ever usually stock cheap movies games, rare new TV computer monitor something. really need electronics year (and even did, still step foot store), easily get movies games home shipped me. Got delivered Thanksgiving even since online deals started Sunday year. Holy shit. Democrats don‚Äôt represent left. represent liberals, basically centrists, base leaning slightly left, establishment leaning good bit right. left doesn‚Äôt representation U.S. federal government. important thing getting many people vaccinated possible. fewer places virus go less opportunity mutation. I'm going published website. I'm assuming careful wording given data due published Lancet peer review within next week. mRNA vaccines look promising, Oxford/AZ vaccine one used outside developed nations vaccine prevents severe disease big win. Drinking helps. gotten us? uneducated populace voting politicians oppose interests, spreading virus that‚Äôs killed hundreds thousands, track kill hundreds thousands  Wow! didn‚Äôt know...

But, research suggests immunity lasts anywhere months [years comfort you, tens millions confirmed cases worldwide, confirmed reinfections [measured typically, always, milder first infection. Yeah, turn positive, miss 10 days work using PTO. get screwed either way.

If hospitals really cared, would give nurses extra PTO get screwed catch it. Going Mars different exploring Earth astronauts would spend 3 years packed like sardines tin way back.

Exactly, people love shit eat up.

A little bit OK amazing many people entirely focused around stuff react really angrily imply something bit there. Y'all push universal healthcare system, addresses issues raised Neither people UK according article.

America month. work healthcare hospital, place work at, say test unless show symptoms. said test showing symptoms, even test positive, quarantine, still come work. Flattening curve never end goal anything. merely means survival vaccine cure arrives. flattening curve meant happen done correctly... needed done constantly. various means including limited lockdown.

edit: typo Australian US? Sure, know COVID does. don‚Äôt know vaccine lack transparency process institutions politicized trust right either. I‚Äôm alone here. Literally half Americans concern right now.

And again, offense random person internet. article weeks old... newer data suggests pose nearly threat worried might get tested exposed and/or symptomatic fact falling employers another sign complete failure government leaders drive adoption effective epidemic management.

Since employers drive policy affects society?  Thank explanation. situation seems worse others specifically banned masks, suppose proven Covid-positive individual working (without mask) possibly knew it. could proven knew (or forced) someone Covid work around others, would change anything case, open penalties unsafe working conditions? company cited unsafe conditions first, would help civil cases? important remember politicians themselves, us.

On top that, sports entertainment aren‚Äôt useless all. entertainers massively important, don‚Äôt understand people intent criticizing importance many us spend majority free time consuming content create. life doctors/nurses save worth living good time, entertainers big part that.

Infact initial lockdowns alcohol sales deemed essential. need people withdrawals hospital full covid Yup employers hit miss whole thing.

 I'm healthcare Frontline occupation co-workers wife tested positive boss told quarantine 14 days since wife caught use PTO goes unpaid. tested positive company would paid quarantine since wife take two weeks paid since board year yet PTO.  uniquely American problem. seriously feel guys. Canada, Ontario specifically, want healthcare workers get tested. worst, tried pay people tested positive 14day quarentine even Union back 70% pay.  What's happening US feels like ticking time bomb point help donald called covid democrat hoax held super spreader rallies Haha, herd immunity. That's good one. greed/corruption that's run rampant years finally seen first hand every corporation politician shows true colors. come that. comes people buying stuff need watched lot someone playing. ever thought _mechanism_ behind players earn lot money? _just_ people coming look them. tremendous amount things like cable.

There's similar lesson music record industry.

Capitalism fair system, someone getting compensated rates 10000x someone else, asking why. athletes. managers coaches, too. always asking why. told years years years ask why, are.

Same corporations making loads money ignored externalities, climate change.

That money magical, paid it, just... necessarily money, perhaps something much valuable... simple: however want cut it, US highest COVID infection rate capita sheer raw numbers whatever metric want use.

Why deaths high Italy, UK, Spain infection rates higher US? already starting happen. next month healthcare system collapses mortality rate covid-19 going blast early 3-7% figures projected January. shithole one. *cough* Seattle every park *cough*

I generally nothing unhoused neighbors, I'm also baffled they'd want stick November-June weather. stay home Thanksgiving better ICU Christmas. Highway 1 high list. scenic highway 12 Utah year absolutely floored beautiful was. want say don‚Äôt really care us things enjoy.

For record, I'm saying get rid sports, say they're irreplaceable silly. Hey pretty dumb comparison... realize sporting leagues ones paying tests using labs? lmao. Maybe ire thrust upon nurse's employers cheap pay tests? I'm trying dick understand situation currently in. Say Nurses get tested, bunch get COVID told isolate. going take care current increase # COVID patients? say yea better healthcare, policies, wages, etc agree I'm trying figure best solution.

Certainly. everyone making worth it? think so. think I've seen surge pricing nurses making months back US. one redeeming factor inhumane conditions they're working, assuming they're able travel, meet criteria etc. cannon fodder test subjects guess

Young age fit, ideal. Mostly Americans though right? Thanks killing humanity btw People believing Sweden's strategy almost starting bother actual pandemic. getting ridiculous. US trying well seems mention take lots drugs rest life, quality life surgery like terrible. better dead awful It‚Äôs annoying explain seven months became common knowledge there‚Äôs really thing ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù populations virus bad ‚Äúlow risk‚Äù populations it‚Äôs big deal.

It‚Äôs stupid thing even talk about. Pretending it‚Äôs fine people get binary death/undeath two outcomes stupid.

I 8 year old know I‚Äôm doing? I‚Äôm going let get virus. years peers going suffer lifelong health problems stupid ass parents thought weren‚Äôt vulnerable population virus harmless them. think so.

Basically could potentially save bring wallet bank cards, ID card driver's license etc. Listened BBC interview two Americans, one family gathering 12, one home alone. one gathering said it‚Äôs people they‚Äôve hanging pandemic, started talking ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù believed family. saw red. believe family too, lonely Thanksgiving extended family learned zoom. I've witnessed flu-shot vaccination actions throughput less 1 min per patient Germany (but Berlin).

That still university. Essentially, vaccinated everybody entered room. asked questions. even ask insurance stuff. think university paid full bill medics orders vaccinate everybody run away. somebody affiliated university entered room, somebody got vaccinated.

Step 1: Get sheet paper side effects etc read sign. step needed 1 min, people need assistance here. could ask questions, people did, one person answering questions enough 20+ patients reading. step still high throughput.

Step 2: Trade signed paper flu shoot nurse/doc already syringe hand. step needed time sit down, empty syringe stand again. patient stands nurse/doc grabs next syringe next patient. two people step. Probably, avoid screw ups. step one minute. 

Step 3: Take sticker vaccination certificate box. Paste sticker vaccination certificate. 

We told also skip Step 3, wanted next year's flu would different anyway therefore nobody cared vaccination one year's time.

All all, estimate 3 nurse/docs throughput 1 patient per min. 

Now lets assume every center 30 nurses/docs, 4200 shots per center per 7 hour work day. (More 7 hours repetitive work per day work, many mistakes crop in.)

Now let's assume 13 weeks 5 work days 6 centers. That's 1911000 shots. Assuming, everybody needs two shots, that's 25% Berlin. doable.

However, fully agree doable usual administrative overhead associated regular doctor's appointment. work soon add form bureaucracy. cannot check whether person insured belongs special priority group anything like that.

What actually might problem stupid people come multiple times thinking ""more vaccine = better them"".

Unfortunately, agree, scaling vaccine manufacturing process likely bottleneck. knew infected - sounds like - yes, have. also confined room much possible.

Getting people earlier challenge. Hey friend, thought discussion [this popped - someone time, resources (probably) intelligence us interested topic. choice Overall, estimated **6.1%** (95% CI 4.8 7.5%) excess deaths study area attributed winter holiday week 9, proportion varied substantially across different countries. Large number excess deaths attributed winter holiday week 9 regions Germany (Bavaria), Belgium (all 11 regions), Netherlands (4 regions) Sweden (Stockholm 5 regions; Table 4). contrast, winter holiday week seem explain excess mortality UK France. comparison, **19%** excess mortality (95% CI 14 24) attributed population density 100 persons per Overall, 20% excess mortality (95% CI 17 22%) study area attributed response stringency week 11 average (Table 4). Sweden, estimated **55%** excess mortality (95% CI 49 61%) associated less stringent response.


So, yeah, looks like main explanation situation Sweden according government response, Stockholm winter holiday week 9 - even though certainly played role, too. However, comparing countries shows us main reason.

One thing explain France holidays seemed effect all. One explanation come amount travel - like also speculated here. However, actual numbers dug really seem support theory Swedes travel much everyone proportion trips Q1 (first quarter) least one night stay international destination, 10% France, compared example 73% Belgium, 29% Denmark 27% Germany Sweden according recent European quarterly travel statistics 2011

Hope find interesting, well! fool confront TABC officers Texas like that. party 40 people, ate tacos, sang really loud laughed morons. damn blast!

Can't help stupid Germany seems always proactive taking good steps fight this, kuddos them. french, completely failed nation virus, frustrating. *confirmed* getting downvoted virus stay bad people. people die them. /s good :) unexpectedly nice response, thank sir :). Yeah easy, necessary. 
German here, Thanksgiving thing here, Christmas grandma staying one family branches ~4 people guess, ~24 usually. 
Happy holidays anyways. I've seen people social media, live L.A., freaking calling human rights violation. report obviously incorrect many us pointed tells lot Swedish Covid-19 handling presented international media. Like countries especially Europe failures. Sweden bit better back spring virus seems good catching people guard. mean I'm European I'm watching amusement. clear anyway pandemic get better we'll get vaccine. Rule law changed significantly. understand police side virus. live don‚Äôt wear masks. multiple outbreaks jail. tried keep secret. Police exposing potentially every person interact with. don‚Äôt care. all.

It‚Äôs like.. rule law degraded intelligent people avoiding palace guards costs. There‚Äôs coming back this. really. trust me, learn fucking thing. Well yeah. loves em, love him.

Crazy show. Avoids responsibility. fear January going really bad month. think capturing much. Experts estimated capturing 1/3 1/4 real cases right now, compared 1/10 1/20 spring.

""Bedford‚Äôs ballpark figure three four infections still go unconfirmed. (Other estimates even higher.)"" 50% go herd immunity great said that, urged side caution sage thing.

But no, mUh fReEdOm! strategy.

No article entirely future projections concedes point there's proof existing strains changed much better worse.

Furthermore there's lot selection bias claiming viruses become milder time. never case Smallpox Ebola. clip said, sure Reuters cut segment (this part longer ~40 min event). seems somewhat ambiguous. generous maybe means they'll delivered anticipation approval? understanding approval happen least Dec. 10th. Well way stop people dying shut businesses worst places spread play anymore. could done instead gave seems. far tell, constitution hinders curfews red zones, closing gyms, restaurants etc. Still, could right thing go bubble like NBA did.

The issue sports athletes high-risk activity continuing mingle community potentially spread whatever picked work. actually unethical, think it. Trump killed many turkeys year, monster forget started Chinese new year still celebrated world watched disbelief.... I've heard Vitamin mentioned several NPR stories related Coronavirus. Nah i‚Äôm laughing ass thing gonna happen us France December. Better 40k new cases day lose sweet sweet Christmas sales. countries case. However, Germany Italy seems struggling get numbers new measures.  Around August thought would 400k end year. might month off. people countries care all. got situations worry about. I‚Äôm afraid world doesn‚Äôt give shit Also, it‚Äôs time? metric? think conclusion virus lie people dying figments imagination dude... Would please state ‚Äútrustworthy‚Äù sources clear are!!! Thanks.  haven‚Äôt applying jobs. public facing roles risking life others minimum wage. COVID serious cant believe people aren‚Äôt treating such. Never forget. Trump removed watch dog hid away trillions dollars relief fund. call BS lived normally. Fwiw Queensland lived pretty much normally, even 50k plus crowds sporting event. I‚Äôve seen US sports zero crowds. would impossible live normally pandemic even ignored virus let spread. see hundreds thousands deaths, empty crowds sporting events, negative impacts economy nobody living normally.  Hope world finally close doors america enough stupidity enough. What??? think lockdowns done counties cities. Nationwide would require whole hell lot stimulus Mitch ain't it. value lifestyle prepared go greater lengths preserve it. Welll that's anticipated... R number measurement spreads. estimate number take account effects like increased testing. R number becomes inaccurate. retail job gave us ¬£150 coupons spend store anything alcohol. 

I kinda needed point... could moved people taken seriously first place. people ‚Äúliving life‚Äù, words inconsiderate, need isolate ‚Äúthose people‚Äù. Yeah shut first wave post summer. Obviously social media big issue - think need think deeper. magically got rid Facebook, TikTok, Twitter overnight social evils disappear. 

Millions white families voted Trump despite 250k covid deaths due facebook due reaching towards hate racism. Without facebook misinfo reduces still got Fox News. still got racism. 

Education, public spending great equalizers vastly helps. 

End day feel bad even racists. Yes, us inner sexist, racist we've learnt evils. Trump GOP adept bringing inner racist every white person. 

But many people vote Obama, they've always thought terms hurting brown people. living conditions coupled lack education, health, jobs propels towards primal instincts racism, sexism, jingoism. 

And that's need address. plants crave? Good Victoria, see one broad 28 days Covid free world news.

&amp;#x200B;

(jk sorry bad joke) everyone watching home would mean eyes screen advertisers feel bad employees got laid fired. said, fuck Disney right thing, hope figuratively burn ground bubble inevitably bursts. Fuck guy anyone works and/or supports guy. That's half third size NYC? trump tried failed state legislature larger California‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt make sense since state less people San Francisco. You‚Äôd need convince people vote medium sized city council state rep. would nuts that‚Äôs real number. saying isn‚Äôt, bit would pretty shockinh plus people covid wind hospital even survive viral load hospital likely Frontline workers get extremely sick ill mention mentally exhausted mention people need go hospital reasons able get care need ...That's point. see it? one make choice minimum wage (or poverty adjacent) job they're already taken advantage catching deadly disease. someone makes 1 decision that‚Äôs detrimental health doesn‚Äôt somehow mean okay decisions detrimental health. 

What kind retarded logic that. smokes cigs fuck it, full send COVID thanksgiving party? congress members stock credit companies go jail. necessarily. article states, ""The CDC calculated 53 million Americans infected end September, eight times confirmed cases time.""

Those figures make sense since testing capabilities weak beginning pandemic. 

Our testing capabilities much better now. Scott Gottlieb, many others, estimate we're catching 1 5 1 6 infections recent months (That number may change testing sites face pressure). 

Calculating true IFR requires steps. One also consider deaths tagged covid. Many experts, including Fauci, explained true death count higher reported figures. 

In short, can't multiply official case count 8 divide number reported deaths get IFR. Yea implies CA WA took better care get go NY let go rampant encouraged stupid decisions it‚Äôs spread. autistic people allowed unions? made joke? still remember months back guy company pouring R&amp;D developing tests said ""nah, testing end it. vaccines"" 

I wonder he's mental breakdown office right Let's hope right. I'm convinced. you‚Äôre going troll least put effort it? June next year pretty reasonable return larger indoor events. mom died that. Even treatment terminal 50% time. Shit luck, either way. üòî  makes think certain illnesses people generally associate ""bad decisions"" like lung cancer, heart disease etc. 


This helpful thought process non smoker lung cancer, athelete heart attack etc. Yes peoples actions impact probabilities outcomes, means absolute. Recommendations behaviour make sense population level, shame useful personal experience dealing individuals risky behaviours. Johnson Johnson mRNA well?

Oh right, rules thee me. posts show declining, taking prescriptions, etc. understand someone state may thinking clearly, also infrastructure health workers would call patient home. Ideally would checking friend/family member could remind time go back hospital. Sadly, we'll seeing situation next months. Next press conference dangers upcoming obesity epidemic. Time money. spending hours line get something, 'free'. There's reason food pantry lines long normally, can't figure own, think would waste time try spell you. Well guess we'll get see herd immunity threshold first hand... win science guess. I'm immunologist anything think really boils healthier begin with. 70 year old necessarily strength get infection barely affects 20 year old. think describing Spanish Flu *did* affect young people old. particularly nasty turning immune systems you.

Like things biological, guess, balance. Left completely unchecked virus kills you. immune system overreacts virus also kills you. you‚Äôd forgive think you‚Äôre cherry picking data fit narrative. sure you‚Äôre downvoted. seems true asymptomatic cases don‚Äôt infect others, it‚Äôs incredibly positive tests amongst 1,174 close contacts asymptomatic 10 people. Exactly this. also hard buy argument given skeptics encouraging people break rules real world impact. Everyone knows rules right now. significant percentage people asking questions receive validation skeptics trying give them. ""Wishful thinking denial guess. cases seeded across country lockdown 100k deaths. millions cases people attending pool parties. would say 300-500k end year.""

&amp;#x200B;

\^ comment six months ago. pretty right Face shields scientifically proven ineffective wearing mask it. link confirms World Health Organisation advocate lockdowns **primary** means control virus,‚Äù Dr Nabarro¬†told Spectator. ‚ÄúThe **only time believe lockdown justified** buy time reorganise, regroup, rebalance resources, protect health workers exhausted, large, we‚Äôd rather it.

That's inconsistent they've said before. think it‚Äôs couple weeks behind Italy‚Äôs outbreak March people took seriously government listened health experts introduced restrictions (along financial assistance). could see testing important South Korea great testing early keeping things control. Things like mask wearing etc, normal Asian cultures wasn‚Äôt introduced Melbourne‚Äôs outbreak even country doesn‚Äôt wear masks time decided masks work country already virus control.  Meanwhile one ""conservative"" also, called ""big news, trusted national news etc""....Are LIARS create spread propaganda rich backers friends agendas make laws, regulations ultimately screw working class citizen over. That's fuckin ironic! went thing Anaheim recently. Grocery stores people jammed together covid lines way worse D-Land. would safer wore mask. definitely get less initial viral load. Really interesting site great data analysis. 
The data site suggests actual COVID death toll US currently 320,000 730,000. Wow seems like number gets higher every decade. graduate HS 2006 seemed like ton college graduates back then. sovereign sedan! Bullshit. Prove it. far clickbait-y title 2020. that's saying lot. Gonna need something like 60% previously infected herd immunity become (eventually) meaningful . likely plateau due test capacity constraint. Username check out. good encouraged daughters better themselves. wish certain parts circle felt way Exactly. simple, logical, well-reasoned perspective. excessive fear here. 

Would still elaborate missing IFR department stuff? It‚Äôs possible seek others position never exposed, safe are.

I‚Äôve made friends people like this. need CovidFriends matching app, put locale interests find matches. think we‚Äôre going mess long time, lonely dangerous long haul. can‚Äôt easy wearing clothes store?

I worked store hard enough get people wear clothes store....I dont know many pairs underwear found produce section (which unpackaged food). don‚Äôt understand comment, clarify? There's pretty good chance guess. Giuliani said much, appreciated rulings coming quickly could get Supreme Court faster. trouble ever actually gets they're going laugh hard endgame Supreme Court declining pick case exactly ruling pretty darn close.

In mind pretty hard imagine Court's unfair roughly 40 different Chances coming judges shared political party virtually ruling level sarcasm rulings Except Australia basically eliminated (except occasional outbreak) require anyone travelling overseas (except New Zealand also eliminated it) undergo 14 days quarrantine hotel covid testing required time prior release.

So entire country basically live normal non-COVID life result. strange virus, like majority people get never even show symptoms, totally believe 100 million cases US, people know covid someone home covid, probably also covid.

If 100 million number true, Virus lot closer ending thought. Plague Inc right. Iceland always holds out. right that's fading antibodies meant. Bruce Willis ghost. short, can't multiply official case count 8 divide number reported deaths get IFR.

This correct. can't ignore implication IFR really high initially though. I'll upvote remind me. I'm thinking 5 years 80% vaccination. You‚Äôre slow. I‚Äôm sorry. That's meant. Plus punched face, fatal too. yelled, screamed, spat on, pandemic spreads respiratory droplets. experts lie, tons distrust rightfully so. went college sickened experts lie. experts/paid experts what???? Paid!!!! who? what? person company testify falsify research back claims. happens medical community, 50's sugar companies, cigarette companies share started nonsense vaping somehow bad you. scientist's job report TRUTH, fucking twist companies poison us decades, round ring bell? make telling lie illegal federal level, great country life. Smh forgot people want: üç∑üç∑üç∑ fuck Wyoming? Sounds Chinese. america "" (it‚Äôs connected employment like USA). ""

Right there. That's big problem US insurance imo. Kewl nerd That's always weird cognitive dissonance. say spread way worse reported, admit fatality way less reported. say spread way reported, admit way fatal reported.

Zealots either side get real mad this. heartwarming thanksgiving story... /s record honestly matters... pandemic? That‚Äôs actually really encouraging. 55m infection, 5 reinfections. That‚Äôs lot reinfections. pretty well accepted 10% point, comments parent said 30-50% likely even CDC contradicted national numbers. Testing capacity fine moment, % positive going means testing amount people finding less positives. They're CDC numbers - certainly fit narrative, truth. real CDC numbers, easily explained can't misunderstand notice provide link (as can't provide link false numbers). 

Let's pull relative ones:

""The CDC's overall IFR estimate implies COVID-19, nearly lethal many people initially feared, **six** times deadly seasonal flu.""

Sorry. Daaaaaaamn Could learn bit Asian countries dealt SARS, this, well. 99.anything quite simply lie. misinformation. 1000 cases day? That's far Western powers. US we're 200,000. hear medical professional tell anyone non-fat diet good you. low fat diet, maybe. need fat absorb fat soluble vitamins. need fat make every single one hormones- everything hair growth metabolism controlled hormones. skin dry, hair nails brittle, constipated fuck. Human beings need fat diet. Fat bad thing.

And EVERYTHING ok moderation. mean everything. Fast food included. Ice cream. Candy bars. Cocaine. Whatever. excess. daily. Especially several times day. can't tell Republican data. worst outbreak media essentially useless, preferring run scare stories ahead information might help.

This one thing pissed lockdown. weren‚Äôt helpful press conferences better help inform public motivated get sound bites rage pieces. Fuck them. fuck Rachel Baxendale especially. Quite lot - checkpoints Victoria states also 'ring steel' metropolitan Melbourne (capital city Victoria) regional Victoria (which lot porous).

There also border cities (literally sitting border NSW Victoria) regional communities closer NSW SA used resources (hospitals, clinics, grocery stores) rather ones Victoria normally. Gift cards!? outraged Report says worker docked ships, it‚Äôs possible got directly ships.

What worries dinner Tampines Mall. could cause transmission new cluster. everyone infected 80% heard immunity,   immune. Perhaps, still dumb. afford best education best tutors, make smart. mean I'm family Thanksgiving that's come contact regularly anyway. much travel miles road lol. Please post articles previous years care rationed treatments halted Said I‚Äôll say again, national lockdown bitches They‚Äôd probably happier. think large disconnect assuming everyone goals concerns. virus kills far less 1% people infects. plenty folks uninterested shutting society, losing freedoms, harming economically combat believe sufficient threat justify measures. everyone things stake lose either. Everyone entitled opinion matter, calling opposing viewpoint ‚Äúuneducated‚Äù kind intolerant.

I agree society little hope biased opinionated ‚Äúmedia‚Äù everywhere. add CNN MSNBC list too. actual fuck. agree, whole covid situation REALLY fucked depression b/c really shown society give fuck communities need us. heartbreaking selfish ppl are. Betty Devos wants word. winner game first place Yeah, there‚Äôs really way excuse this. Even early November, nobody recommending non essential travel. Oh sure, ways worst aspects can't see visible method payment (facebook, Instagram, youtube, etc), payment.

In case, tax dollars. Right? Don‚Äôt people usually show right dinner served minute earlier?? linked article reinfections another comment, see it, another. Different article Gof gene? feel bad working hospitals. Every time turn news, see doctors nurses pleading, people still dont believe virus exists even dying. shame Dr Amy Acton viciously harassed threatened Yeah nah. Australia particularly affected MERs SARs. Certainly population way prepared - useful mask, social distancing hygiene culture already place could stop community spread without government mandate place.

Australia locked early international arrivals go mandatory 14 day hotel quarantine arrival. less stopped covid getting wider community meant parts Australia essentially covid free (this tactic used New Zealand Taiwan easiest method). 
 
Then, June, covid got hotel quarantine Victoria (the second wave) began spreading widely community. stage, stopping reversing infection rate harder (this rest world is). rest Australia slammed shut borders Victoria (which hard Australia ever police internal borders like that) state went 100+ harsh lock control spread. we're seeing result entire state knuckling going lockdown together. Facebook evil. Twitter right probably quite bad. blaming way shift blame pretend like responsible.

That's knife cuts ways. wealthy corporations world would *also* like blame someone else. tactic they're trying use climate change.

The pressing, relevant question *true*.

I think said substantially accurate did, think ""blame people"" crusade going help, can't stop you. that? Like 15-20 people?  Love cop lovers forget first amendment doesn‚Äôt suit them. Well sure could true. trying say since enough people already new infections slow per se. doubts anyways, point merely already herd immunity. 

With *only* 10% population infected.. still lot room growth. Like another commenter said, could also simply due testing capacity plateau. could things. I'm saying 1 way know. Sheriffs various counties believe mandates unconstitutional refusing enforce them.

Law enforcement judges constitutional not. force laws. said many times, can't economy dead people. Losing 1 month lockdown production better 1+ years. know difficult since people like family, minimize contact warn talk keep BS themselves. better Thanksgiving result! city can. agree lot people, would tragedy happened 

All saying number really 52,000,000 people lost sorry actual number 250,000 precent low really low. 

There better way control shut everything let people suffer poverty hunger. Also government really worried anything help people suffering. 

Shit give money banker friends leave us dry. 

Come fucked up. one taking that. fear death front center. bad people doing, suffering. 

But yeah callous saying shocked low, infected number high. You‚Äôre part problem. not. feel sorry every drunk driver crashes telephone pole dies? Well, maybe little, much. Half would even feel good it, died could hurt somebody else. dont think true. Although missed many cases spring think best indicator hospitalizations.  think testing catching good amount cases. 

Look chart see chart near amount daily cases spring based number hospitalizations.  although missed cases beginning pandemic high initially thought infections beginning localized primarily New England States. summer saw infections South. seeing infections throughout country areas urban rural.   


Could 50 million cases US already? seems somewhat likely. 100 million cases... seem likely all. Yeah doctor, really stop pretending internet less cases documented reinfection count 2 hands, globally. point going take yes answer immune response. Fingers crossed They've weaned societal libertarianism liberal individualism, taught social values far important anything else.

Couple fact west taught values like communitarianism prioritizing greater good ""authoritarian"", personal national sacrifices ""are fascistic"", are. fruit way thinking, ultimately. completely agree sarcasm.

And completely topic:

But world could bit better nutrition science professionals would get date studies validating low carb diets. say that? saw case rates listed? MMR vaccine Vitamin play huge roles Covid-19 response. Older folks never got MMR vaccine even did, Mumps titers low provide immunity. Young people recently gotten MMR vaccines effectively immune. updated you.   taxpayers. 1 month am.... Anybody remember ‚ÄúSpirit science‚Äù heard single case worldwide someone reinfected rather still infected test came back negative.

So reinfection possible, means may well go herd immunity die. Agreed good boss! I'm sitting work Thanksgiving night one guys (who gets paid overtime mind lol). know I'm willing pull weight think feel time family important time theirs. way something happens mind much. I've always taught lead front! gonna go back normal life stops circulating population

that probs never happen handling pandemic abysmal. Let's start there. said, 100M people United States infected, actually good news? think helps support Fauci's estimate might get virus control 40% getting vaccinated. gives close 70% often thought needed heard immunity. Sooo, that's like 50 people? I'm getting ""page found"" error

Does anybody working link? NPR take story down? I'm really curious see many people tune in. Rokie number, Poland around 40% positives test, got pum number You‚Äôre asking prove negative. find study study article article saying scientists ‚Äòstumped‚Äô confused idea long haul Covid. 

If hasn‚Äôt confirmed real obviously may real. 

It‚Äôs much like morgellons. That‚Äôs Reese Witherspoon. spring priority testing throughout entire Sweden, positivity rate never went 20%. think partly test everyone, least 10% official deaths based certificates people diagnosed COVID-19 tested. Another reason highest incidence rate actually younger age groups rarely get severe symptoms, means rarely tested priority group. 

Unfortunately, past 2 weeks 4 small friendly circle gone sick - traced back physiotherapist one them, session days later notified tested positive; meanwhile contact others 4 sick 99% certainty COVID-19, region restricted testing none risk groups weather home, quarantining waiting symptoms go recover. quite normal story right even normal spring - main recommendation ""if symptoms suspect sick, self-isolate gone sure getting ill"". think also reason see sky-rocketing positivity ratios either. talking about? herd immunity maybe enough start making difference case rate. Even 10% start measurable effect especially super spreaders start get immune (super spreaders also likely get first place). God praying RNGesus. agree balance, I've also observed undesirable behaviors mention. think unavoidable part coming social consensus ""acceptable"" world radically changed past year. 

Personally, think pointing ""bad"" behaviors, defending person executed them, pointing good excuse (i.e. here) something needs happen figure handle society. words, part it, value contribution process.  It‚Äôs funny read words hear theme music start playing head immediately... Yeah I‚Äôm not. Quite opposite fact. It‚Äôs enough herd immunity it‚Äôs enough slow spread partially

There fewer 100 confirmed reinfections worldwide, that‚Äôs contributing factor Maybe should, since attending class requires self-motivation self-discipline usually good qualities working world. even close. left promotes inadequate public schooling **500,000** dead, worried this?

...I honestly know say you. universe 500k preventable deaths acceptable? Let's forget death rate higher 0.82% is. 

Suppose infected 300 million people USA. Would personally able shrug 2.8 million deaths? Realistically looking 6.2 million let's pretend second actual death rate 0.82%.

2.8 million still lot people. mommy groups Facebook alone fucking risk public health. Late press conference + north face = üëåüëå

Fuck off. parents become deniers, separated decades, even got covid. Thankfully one day hell can't breathe normally. Hopefully long term symptom, get checked calms down. dumb were. difference dumb something ashamed reality TV turned something proud big thanksgiving spike isn‚Äôt inevitable? enough people played safe? reason hopeful maybe could avoid big surge? Except antibodies run 30 days, infections starting happen Grand Forks. Senate represents state, house represents people. always been. People keep saying we're #1 anything downplaying important are, it? Yes, valid residency visa allowed travel China now. would minuscule compared pre-covid travel sort get it. Folks live there, point need able get back country residency (China otherwise). actually think saying one thing another lot worse consistent (even don‚Äôt like message) - sends even worse message people crow science don‚Äôt believe enough follow advice. he's sorry... he's sorry got caught. Yet another politician give crap people elected serve them. bar little mask wearing, people inebriated, shouting one another confined space zero social distancing. importantly numerous outbreaks linked bars NY.

There zero outbreaks linked Churches Diocese Brooklyn mask wearing mandatory time, social distancing place, sanitization precautions place. Saying 10 people church fit 1000+ people clear violation first amendment. Antibodies measles go away like year. completely inconsequential measles pandemic. ""It is."" Says major developed nation can't almost everyol nation did. really think work home hasn‚Äôt implemented? That‚Äôs pretty ignorant take, obviously work home implemented places be. Along this, much fewer office jobs overall small states like ND. reason smaller states higher cases fact didn‚Äôt resources make college k-12 students school online. transitioning online school everyone. Stand beer see miles. Yeah shut let herd immunity happen one gives shit seems. million people flew holiday week Well, reach herd immunity old fashioned way: lots people dying.

But agree you, want stop short killing 1 every 100 people earth, need vaccine.

What encouraging reinfection rate low enough virus can't reinfect places good disease control policy like far east. people get vaccines likely spread virus due false sense security. thank you! Typically end trial would 2 years. gets covid probably say. nothing Jeff Bezos still many essential workers receive. Whole world care less, got problems. short-term sacrifice long-term gain, gain people alive willing go spend money. Melbourne I'm seeing businesses booming post-lockdown we've stamped virus people getting back beers.   Forgot 0. is, extent. antibodies wane point longer sterilizing immunity. Probably somewhere 6-24 month range per viruses family. 

There forms immunity, like memory cells reduce prevent symptoms. without sterilizing immunity retransmission likely still possible. 

This never gained herd immunity similar RNA viruses (among reasons). sterilizing immunity temporary well seems, continue circulate endemic disease. dangerous point, still around. never exposed could still vulnerable vaccinated lot things make sense.

Lucky kids go school get beaten laughed day governments react quickly

My professors shared academics/scientists public health policy experts' works virus even issue least 2 months explaining different models groups who've working together pandemics made. models made help governments, elected officials navigate contain virus + save everyone + keep economy healthy. Different models different times, different models different outcomes/goals.

Guess what?

Most countries give shit.

It's like never zoonoses Earth, like groups experts/academics/scientists join force understand work stop/prevent them.

The interest elected officials interests.

I remember arguing people months since February ""huh guys, worry economy..."", instead many people brainwashed thinking government support them, protect literally slavery wearing masks, keeping distance staying home month more. Lol bad sounds proverty mid town edges town really nice. even 2 fine dining restaurants downtown, many brand new houses apartment complexes. frequent number 1 college hockey team many jobs people. proverty meth trying. Yes ""many"". many mean extremely tiny amount. Seriously, give amount impaired compared impaired respiratory illnesses. said Canada unique. Anyway, gonna waste time this. good day. Hey least talk keeping things going going get quieter. Lol came see someone would ask Yes, yes, yes - hospital Covid Units ICUs must SEEN. Blur faces identifying details get info there! tactic might chip away ‚Äúostrich-head-in-the-ground‚Äù ‚Äúflat-earther denialist‚Äù types - incentivize take care. $hit REAL.

Lame irony rich comment. can‚Äôt see difference. don‚Äôt want to.

Lol. Oh you‚Äôre contrarian. 

Not gonna waste time arguing idiot. good day. Seems like hardly enough. Yep. real...even airplanes open, happy hop one right now? Plenty economists national security experts saying months good health care policy good economic policy. suck ass Well, literally used hate speech rant. see public health officials struggling right thing getting pushback regular people politicians reluctant implement strategies country. I'm sure perfect actual power we'd much better. ski holiday

I live ski resort town. I've *everybody's* ski holidays don‚Äôt hoard. money lost value spend it. didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúsame.‚Äù word choice, mine. Chill.

I asking Canada uniquely impacted covid US. response economy, trade, diplomacy, politics. agreed that, simply saying countries also impacted areas, relates US....not Canada. 

Feel free freak now. ignore maskless idiots then....they'll get fined sooner later hypocrites. There‚Äôs zero excuse. Unless hospitals get overcrowded people can't get treated wich unrealistic many parts states TIL entire state North Dakota local bar. Nah use colors too. Although iirc Department Health Safety come additionally color level North Dakota‚Äôs numbers bad. also possible that, certain point, people remaining gotten sick either interact much society anyway already taking precautions remained protected. joking?

Passed vacation fifty states year. 

Felt *zero* inner city town feel them. 

Poverty? Oh yeah. 

Felt like poor tiny version little small towns ring big cities like dallas san Francisco I've trying load goodies, popcorn, sparkling water, energy drinks, etc. enough stay home go anywhere indoors public weeks/months stretch bad COVID-19 surges, too. That's it? politicians getting sick brisk clip, noticed please form union bribe testing roughly 1.8M per day. Back October around 1.2M per day. Back May, roughly 400K per day. definitely testing more, maybe enough explain difference greatly expanded testing Lol, cute problem too. People wear public, take private gatherings. Europeans prone human failings Americans are. Wtf anyone die??? basically left right? quite simple yet ways simple that. way really think it, providing adequate testing accurately reflecting case numbers, reproductive number. many people average case infects. one daily cases go up, less one daily cases go down. ""Control"" would imply reproductive number one less. 

If one daily case numbers (better look 7 even 14 day average) going current measures adequate control need increase measures otherwise keep going reach herd immunity peoples behavior changes enough bring down. 

In case South Korea exactly should, soon they've realised cases going increase restrictions. Nov. 22 (Yonhap) -- South Korea Sunday decided enforce tougher distancing regulations greater Seoul area southwestern region health authorities try stem resurgence novel coronavirus.

The government announced Level 2 distancing, third-highest country's five-tier COVID-19 alert system, applied nation's capital area, North South Jeolla Provinces Level 1.5 distancing two weeks starting Tuesday. reason wait without changing anything trend continue might well act now. threshold increase levels 7 day average 200 cases, simply random events result bunch cases without necessarily trend. 

To address question specifically quarantine stops new cases coming in, really limit always risk leaks. makes things easier control population need worry existing outbreaks occasional leaks. 

Contact tracing saturation point vary based amount contact tracers efficiency system. effective numbers low address case quickly thoroughly. told taking seriously since March, got idiotic brother law works husband. work home, homeschool kids... bronchiectasis months recovery ahead Mid January hospitals capacity. that's almost admitting wrong. hope fall vat molten steel, Terminator 2 style. SK followed *your* example, pandemic protocols adapted US. certain politicians really took fat shit though Bro everything fascist people. I‚Äôve quarantine since march. work, workout out, go grocery store talk shit online. I‚Äôm killing people. I‚Äôm home avoiding dumb fucks. 

If die, die. Better safe sorry, waste hard work we've done one case cause exponential rise deaths lockdown  Oh god, go again... don‚Äôt reach herd immunity eradicate virus go back ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù. Even ‚Äúenough‚Äù people take vaccine, even vaccinating majority vulnerable population bring fatality rate enough treat like seasonal flu. guy fawkes day? problem is, oddly enough, people (and people personally know) know got virus celebrities talking it. describe like flu. serious virus may be, infection rate numbers see everywhere appear big never compare population. example, 6000 cases seems big province, that's 0.04% population. That's quite small. Canada major spikes neglect recentness Canadian Thanksgiving. Used see lots Canadians GF. Now, household doesn‚Äôt go Sam‚Äôs, Target, Walmart anymore. suppose it‚Äôs hurting without guys coming south shop.  great, govt really pay people take it. Shot arm people economy.

Which people say risks COVID. We're worms know cancer drugs lead weight gain? know doctor? saw overcrowded hospital videos Italy virus even made stateside. I‚Äôve seen short clips mobile morgues filled. aren‚Äôt hard find. th US estimated around 40,000,000 cases? never confirmed, would roughly 12 percent. Guy internet says thing. Oh wow. really like Dr. Fauci's optimism. However, seems like Nationwide lockdown might thing save Americans themselves. cept cat better half made crouton dressing. Feels same. going stupid continuation last years greater consequences. Salem Sue! One interesting things ND. No, seriously, giant state cow one interesting things state... local hospitals diverting patients weeks due increasing cases. Know first thought was? happens get car accident get diverted hospital network insurance? barely afford ongoing copays chronic illness. emergency occurs can‚Äôt go local hospital network copays astronomical. Yay America. Actually wondering one thing:  everyone  received real thing opposed placebo kind recognizable side effects, equivalent telling participants inadvertently real thing placebo. vaccine study supposed randomized double-blind study. Randomization means person equal chance receiving actual Moderna mRNA vaccine saline injection. Half volunteers (50%) receive vaccine half receive saline solution placebo. Double-blind means neither participants study team members know whether participants received vaccine placebo. done protect integrity study. Since people study pretty much know got real thing, integrity study protected circumstance? course do, said American (and moved USA October). perfectly aware international news reports Us. definitely doesn‚Äôt go saying Americans travelling internally thanksgiving. That‚Äôs strange. knew!? Good her, guess. slippery slope.

You went family shopping trip, indoors, covid. That's exactly woke. Would enjoy called that, public? selfish put others' lifes risk?

On practical level, also understood confrontation approach unlikely change lady's views. anything, dig in.

And bit cheap shot criticize grown-up, social norms protect shelter full payback.  Tell [the Obesity virus killed little girl. Child obesity child abuse. insane child looks like this. please provide citation? sad time American. us actually care. seeing family going anywhere.

Then people care, believe real, sick wearing masks, still think political even though said would gone election. idiots get believe exist claiming full immunity going around without masks coughing sneezing like idiots.

Unfortunately die selfishness. Trust us constantly watching dread.

Also. buy alcohol recipe store made take mask! worried getting virus 16 year old buying alcohol. Thankfully liquor stores don't. many detrimental things people die.

All non believers saying well vaccine coming go away, another reason wear mask. Nobody cares think. Don‚Äôt get then. Shut idiot mouth go scrape knuckles want. Loser. interesting 10-14 days now. Basically adopted kids Asia. values ideology Asians still retaining western biological parent traits can't make baby one month combining efforts 9 people. Long-term safety effects totally new vaccine type can't rushed, matter much money throw it. released vaccine fast human history reason. 

We see course next 2-3 years results rushing safety trials, especially old pregnant women, fertility general. Stop listening people. virus real pandemic absolutely fake. creators PCR tests wildly used test says accurate way track infections. insanely high levels false positives, politicians making restrictions based inaccurate data. counting flu respiratory illness ""Covid"" deaths. misleading hospitalizations well. Hospitalizations always go around time year due flu, suicides, drug alcohol/abuse. Ask anyone works hospital, annual phenomenon. ruling class becoming absurdly corrupt authoritarian world this.

/S needed vacation spot like masks stop flu better covid. I've seeing people talk make yearly state half day holiday. ""Donut day"" make colorful masks, eat donuts get beers 7 day moving average 2 three weeks probably around 3000 deaths per day.

USA: 812.42 deaths per 1M, 901.25 excess deaths per 1M

Missing Thanksgiving **not** big deal! Elderly people pre existing conditions mix poorly dying. Bad reports usual. One companies work someone fall 8ft ladder counted covid death certificate ""was system"". Corona evolved suplexing victims now. Quite compared places, since population small people North Dakota still probably small percentage total attendees. stats worked number infected every 2 weeks eye opening. assumption rate infection increase remain constant. 43% every 2 weeks.

The tests?

I realize stage people take test want now.

I know working hospitals nonstop entire year. Don‚Äôt know can‚Äôt catch coronavirus thanksgiving? /s Prime watch it. Thank you! Honestly would good news...sorta...than anything.

First IFR would pretty low. Around .25%. would nice. 

Second would mean sizable portion population would level immunity. hunch, many infected probably strongly overlap anti-vaxxers. Even 50-60% population willing take vaccine, 30% already it, might closer 70-80% effectively.

Still..I think unlikely missed many cases. Keyword ""Gatherings."" Reading comprehension extremely valuable, dude. Lol Dan Andrews caused outbreak first place. 

I praise people heroes put fires started. convince 100% people. Even enough shock 30% taking seriously it'd dramatic effect spread virus.

At point I'm sure we'd love see incremental reductions even solve whole problem. Don‚Äôt forget Chicago Mayor Lightfoot ‚Äúthey would showed not!‚Äù

At least republicans honest giving shit. Sick hypocrites. ""Will testing vaccine require take longer""

What sort question this? lived tiny middle-of-nowhere towns like life we're generally super wary getting flooded city suburb-dwelling idiots move ""get away all"". good thing people say shit reddit actually follow pandemic North Dakota stepping they're really trying prove herd immunity thing all. North Dakota bigger size average US state. One least populous. Never term ""Consumer Confidence"" meaningful. definitely possible.

Look, people certain places culturally norm abide mitigation rules, many many people changing plans.

I know terrible can't avoid holiday infections, think would happen behaved normally do. Huge super spreader gatherings, black friday mobs, packed restaurants workplace holiday parties. Even though enough stop hospitals inundated, many people trying best safe may already saved hundreds thousands.

Is enough? No, believe could ever enough. I'm dubious. 

In [CDC's ongoing commercial lab seroprevalence (which samples blood used routine medical care), recent actual data mid-September, median state 5%. Top 5 states population averaged 10%. 

We're certainly midst terrible 3rd wave, cumulative cased doubled 6.2 million Sep 15 12.78 million yesterday. I'd expect current seroprevalence correspondingly higher released. 15% nationwide, that's 50 million. Use brain please. zero way national forced lockdown could even announced much less managed enforced. Zero.

Look buddy family owns funeral homes since 60‚Äôs, worst death season 60 years. no, spring time prime time deaths covid arrived Western Europe US. No. really. IFR lower first thought. Old news. missed lots cases. Old news. changes whole lot. 

Why? 

Well lets say danger measured death metric. measure danger equation: rate spread (how contagious) x mortality. one increases, moves way accordingly, overall danger value remains same.

Say virus kills 60% people it, gotta open mouth kiss spread became symptomatic. high mortality rate seems scary, virus probably kill near many people easy spread virus low mortality rate. 

Its viruses like Ebola high mortality easy spread kill people. 

What makes covid deadly ease spread, symptom timeline presymptomatic/asymptomatic make easy pass around. Along realitvely low infectious dose able trigger infections thus drive cases course. part equation raises impact ease spread part equation. even IFR lower, able infect people, end killed amount (way reported judging excess deaths).

This factor variables like possible long term effects looking like could fairly common severe disease cases well experience long haul covid. 

In end fairly dangerous virus grand scheme things. worst ever, capable overwhelming health care systems contained. Living Petri dish. add Christmas New Years. did. hit records VA. Agreed.

I'm still risking health, traveling see grandpa risking others. probably like 50% actually infected. Number actual cases wayyyy higher tested positive. also looking excess deaths much better indicator many people actually died due Covid, simply looking number tested versus number dead tested positive. easily extra 50% deaths earlier on. That‚Äôs really sad let happen. 
Do think incoming administration chance working out? two family members traveled today yesterday. One Chicago one Las Vegas saying empty..... people distanced masked events pretty damn safe police attack start kettling people using chemical weapons. 2nd dose mening based vaccines always brutal. body knows bad protein fights like hell. one way know working!

America: No, don‚Äôt think will! people downvoting comment? blatantly true. Nobody said ""hey travel thanksgiving UNLESS a), b), c), etc. instructions unambiguous, still found way violate also waste scarce public resources time.

For close relationship US South Korea, really wish followed response example. don‚Äôt know could accomplish similar plan late pandemic, plan implemented. Wondering many already infected, chose get away police decided enforce mask mandates Governor enacted them. Numbers spiked.

But past curfew protesting equality justice? Rubber bullets, maced, beaten streets (literally happening here) one example, it‚Äôs one best ones done almost nothing slow spread. Depends, sometimes use different vaccine placebo prevent that. always though. really much testing I'd like.

I'm even bothered brother. sad state things. actually think consensus mask wearing covid scientific community hoodwinked. I've thinking thing happened. bad science used support bad policies. think comes psychology game theory. Politicians doctors choose option covers ass. That's it. Also, there's archetype person afraid want something it, anything, even help makes things worse.

Anyway, randomized controlled studies meta analysis concluding masks stop spread viruses. scientific consensus decades. Read don't. care. already fucked:

Thank you! You‚Äôre right thing. Earlier pandemic didn‚Äôt end going big family event, canceled night before. Fam wasn‚Äôt happy. 3 days later colleague spent week found positive. 2 days symptoms 3 weeks! family still unhappy. know Made right call. statement kind contradictory. state ""exactly I'll last get it"" reference article states clearly expected reaction specified proportion population determined large scale trials. 

Then state feel safe rushed politicised. 

Surely either trust data rather believe bad good. 

Both valid reasons get vaccine really seem congruent. 

Personally feel safe due large numbers participants trial well defined risks rolling dice covid, mention societal benefit. One redditor pointed consecutive surges mid january, starting election week, veterans day, thanksgiving/ black friday, christmas, new years (possibly) inauguration day.

 I've seen enough ""but polititian x following rules!!"" know ""People refuse postpone celebrations later date"" main headline moving forward. it? Airplane transmission shown pretty low. Driving opens make stops bathrooms food, risk minor accident puts contact others needing even minor emergent care, running sanitizer/masks, reach destination hard hit area can't secure more. necessarily seem less risky overall, different kind risk. deaths sky rocket right Christmas. HO HO HO! absolute capitulation leadership done damage could take years reverse. Trump let anti-mask shit propagate.. people diehard attitudes. situation - I'm American living Hong Kong I've spent months asked variations question ""what earth there?"", although much recently - think people stated sense painful unpleasant question answer really best ask it. Absolutely: paid trolling makes sure spreads. One troll scripts/bots 100s alt accounts skew thinking thousands people Skiing issue. Skiing naturally socially distanced masked sport. problem bars restaurants social events towns provide support. Let people ski.

Seems model interpretation played/plays political nonsense around ""herd immunity"" death rate magnitudes lower actually is. wife Filipino sad see one. would agreed heard 90+ vaccine efficacy rate. Global erradication well within reach. could also short visits masks social distancing... seems they‚Äôre even that, instead ignoring pandemic get holiday feel entitled to. Dominic Cummings (UK Gov) similar thing. he's work. Good point.OP deleted. like 10 people? Totally normal country.  Nope. 
Economy, politics, freedom, religion, antimaskers antivaxxers ... Worth risk cult Dionysus gonna make comeback. :) Yup, state 1/4 million less people city. Sorry, world; we‚Äôre freedom selfish shortsighted ones nose hanging certainly rare exception. great see Lol Well, without even looking numbers, blatantly incorrect. ND passed 1 every 1000 population *dead COVID* like week ago. 1 10 infected 1 1000 died (and low side compared actual numbers) 1 100 get die. 

So... 99% chance would accurate, assuming long term effects either outright die live. Clearly number people get severe damage bodies living, less even that. Wait....we agreement right? sure mean outlive  people go work Lol sheesh Cars inherently dangerous too. still significantly increase risk dying acting like total dumbass, like guy OP. end holidays there's going lot families saying goodbye Grandma Grandpa U.S. always unfortunately Yah, betcha!

Anyway. leadership needs tried genocide. swear God may greatest failure justice human history trump, administration Republican party get couple people going jail totally understand point. 

I think real conversation public forums needs happen regarding Social Contract priorities health policies pandemic.

Sacrificing life 25 year person save life 10 elderly people mathematically makes sense since needs 10 greater needs 1. 

But start analyze 25 year person potential live 75 years 90 year persons saved potential live 1 year more...it easy choose anymore, it? Ha! countries? nice virus take Thanksgiving Florida

/s Geez, really would help knew talking about. federal government busy telling everyone COVID contained offshore botched testing let spread silently. Shame people believing them, right? Absolutely true already excess death numbers indicating considerably higher toll (somewhere 50-60k higher last estimate 330k number saw mentioned). Yet, whenever choose engage them, still people making various versions denial argument: old people, mislabeled deaths, comorbidities, etc I've noticed pretty much always go back denying scale deaths. Try Richard Hofstadter's Anti-Intellectualism American life, Paranoid Style American Politics little background. Flavor Frances Fitzgerald's Evangelicals modern context. Us think right, I'll probably get downvoted making next comment, anyway, believe.

As much Fauci others tried get us pandemic think important accept mixed messages really helped increase credibility among 80% taking things seriously enough, one reason another.

Here one example ampng us remember constant messages months telling people wear masks, wearing mask supposedly INCREASE risk infection, know take safely?üôÑ

Or Surgeon General tweeting ""Stop using masks!"".üôÑ

In days looked people ""the crazy lady wearing mask even said clearly work"" public.üòï

It fun, hey brain, wore old reusable N95 used painting, disposable surgical mask outside, think logically concerned.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I really wish world leaders mass media learn mistakes future, doubt will.

By honest important facts later proven lies creating foundation conspiracies. add idiot WH making political statement wear masks well, lot people simply confused.

All everyone seems shame stupid enough believe conspiracy theories, *the old message* ""masks work"", zero accountability words actions may actually created climate confusion conspiracy theories.

Trust takes long time build up, quickly ruined..ask woman, (or man) who's cheated man! üòî

I really fear future America, short-term long-term hope people find way respect listen again, despite different levels understanding political beliefs, late.üòï Yikes. walk quiet suburban park regularly dog. time carry masks pockets case situations busy time pass maybe four people usually distance quite ways side grass pass instead. residential sidewalks people still cross quiet street give ample distancing space forcing close contact. Ah, classic yellow, orange, red. It‚Äôs crazy might work. US never really implemented plan curtail virus.Contact tracing interstate travel bans  implemented never was.People pack Gyms bars malls wonder virus control here. gym actually busy af since opened!

they ghost town short break middle. Even /s comment stupid Mundane Vegetable Peeler Look well-protected chins! isnt playing golf. legalizing firing squads. No, metaphor. think Biden talking Dan Andrews (Victoria Premier) rather asking PM Covid-19 advice, cases rising Victoria June/July Scott Morrison nothing help state, Dan make necessary changes get today article provides couple numbers COVID infections. top fine mask expect charge assault. think USA could end reporting 3000 deaths tomorrow. one lady's mask...? $2,000 fine part genuine? would never every fly US A, lol. moving target, largely treatment improves. 

February April, .8-.9% US. (Brazil reported .85% UK around .9% early months pandemic). 

In Summer right now, around .45%. 

In near future use recently approved treatments, even lower .45%. 

After vaccines, around flu. think lot people want see family. I'd love see family. also common courtesy decency stay hell home advised so. mom elderly family members work public like do. earth would want mix people gatherings there's potential spread Covid? seeing family *that* important there's global pandemic going on? Yup. work company boss asked constantly things supervision, theirs, willing necessary job constantly talking need job descriptors were... That's shitty fuckin boss. scenario employee Denver residents, held accountable. Unfortunately won't. None do. there's vaccine 6 months. would it? closed borders. ""Page found"" link working. Except suggesting, reasonable, found unconstitutional early 1900‚Äôs.  Jacobsen vs Boston. 

Not arguing point. explaining US doesn‚Äôt act way countries address this. Yep. ask something do. üëç True, notion people spread evenly across whole state like stat posted ridiculous. That‚Äôs 6 people pathetic.  NY State FAR fewer cases (by half) per million, even tho population density much higher. 

Everyone wears mask take seriously. true. next door neighbor, everything directly affects us. even going supermarket food people getting planes? money real, fuck not?  I'm envious Aussies lol. I've lived normally cases still low. Vaccine coming soon too. Good know change stealing go good use. lead people knowledge, can't make think.

To paraphrase friend, ""You lead horse water, can't stop peeing it."" Still half game back division. complicit system fucks everyday people health you‚Äôll go grave knowing bad fucked people hope live won‚Äôt live small country Europe people, North Dakota almost four times larger population that's little half ours. could also take yes answer killing neighbors. Expect one side jackass I‚Äôve tested three self quarantines year waiting peoples results. 

The fact others aren‚Äôt willing make even minor sacrifice depressing say least. really hate seeing ""police refuse enforce law""

It's really fucking stupid. 2022 timeframe crazy. Mississippi goddamn guess stayed home anyone huh? idiots plan gather. must missed social worker isolating, remember offered Exactly.

Again, think fault. respect guidelines, I'm incredibly disappointed actions. mistakes excuse mistakes others, (and media covering them) make easier resist temptations gathering loved ones time.

-those previously infected much careful avoid getting infected again

-given various quarantine mask measures chances getting infected twice simply lower

-we simply haven‚Äôt enough time data definitively say whether COVID-19 immunity permanent, partially due reasons above.

And caused first wave. summer know people came Greece holiday got Coronavirus took back U.K. 22 them. 

I‚Äôve shielding 8 months won‚Äôt bore why. adult child lives US I‚Äôve able see due EU/US ban understand support. 
I know others like personally feel like we‚Äôve got make sacrifices next couple months help make virus burn going probably carry like till next fall 21 matter media Governments tell us it‚Äôs impossible vaccinate us time it‚Äôs going take time atriums month vaccine offer protection.

So we‚Äôve got help fight adapt. Technically, leaving states decide gets first, EUA allow anyone age 16 get vaccine US, Florida wanted vaccinate every 20 year old healthy person first wave, could, obviously would horrible strategy, states right decide end.

I've spent almost whole year wasting away apartment alone, trying responsible safe. Yet others go nothing wrong.


I lost job opportunity Great job company downsized result lockdowns.


I want life back. want lose another year life. 

I know long keep going like this. hope get 6 million doses April.

 want see friends person again. want able walk strangers street without anxiety. want see family again. I've seriously depressed whole year, finally got hope we'd similar shape US 'back normal' April. guess not. Agree 100%. super easy point laugh shake head disgust selfish stupid ""the side"" is. we're locked ideological war, win making fun side. win empathising trying get root believe.

it's easy thing accept everything believe wrong. know better i'd say impossible country fucked, retain tiny bit hope. Fever actually pretty common side effect vaccines. means vaccine job triggering immune response one aspect.

Everyone talked except plans. Stores packed. traffic again. Kids released school time.

The instructions cancel social plans gathering home residents. 'dont take plane', 'just invite people less', 'dont stay long'.

Given already peaking.. going bad. part design, splitting people rich prosper. Feudalism never went away evolved. think Europeans certain genetic immunity diseases ravaged long time. Especially plague. 

Not complete immunity resistance. Can't gather Thanksgiving work cleaning Covid rooms! Take America!

Happy Turkey day.

STAY HOME JABRONIES. MAKE JOB HARDER. What‚Äôs alternative? Funny though people barely exist real life common online makes wonder Russian trolls/bots. fact I've never met Trump fan news stories Trump comments 50 per cent support him. (reposting like nickname used) didn‚Äôt really take way. didn‚Äôt think 19 different people. 

I comparing day. wife three kids. 

Went see parents, work see dad every day 

My sister brother law three kids. 

Do 12. much change 20. Beautiful slow. I'm American Minnesota come? Promise I'm sick likes cambridge analytica made active thing.

Canadian lives north I5. ldr guy Sonoma, always hit states. first summer 20 years haven‚Äôt gone Oregon. Yeah I5 boring it‚Äôs familiar fond way attempted turkey legs. failed miserably. potatoes fantastic though! Let's see EU ultimately approves it. I'm confident will. do, another discussion this. presumably took spouse him?  Last time checked, mate, top 10 movies ever released plus top 10 probably every conceivable mainstream genre world released American cinema. It‚Äôs entitled, it‚Äôs secret America dominates movie industry.  flu bro! I'm sorry, majority US vaccinated, wont continue wear mask, I'm college, I'm going go party, fun. Like we're going exactly shit month today.... know. really, wait January see we'll stimulus help not. two Senate runoff races Georgia last hope. sad fact this: late really help people. Inauguration day near end january. then, people evicted,small business owners gone, god knows many people dead, people debt, lord knows much jobs lost. America's downfall. what's sad Republicans seem realize people help,become broke,homeless, dead, etc. economy shit. Probably bad great depression. I'm sure typing comment thinking *boy hope one brings secondhand smoke* Always KN95s good? bought KN95s Ace Hardware(10 $20). effective blue surgical mask? wear two mask times public blue ones significantly cheaper   Ok, see saying, although think definition ""herd immunity"" complicated say, perhaps I'm wrong. Anyways, whatever call what's happening ND, happened way hope wakes people get various governments, mainly federal, become better prepared next pandemic. It'd nice doubt would light fire current people power, they've got funds means ride almost anything, even vote office, they're set life.

Money politics paying politicians 400k year insane imo. 100% agree. People sacrifice lives willfully ignorant. needlessly tragic.. Posting elderly women pre existing conditions struggled covid going convince anyone exception rule. Yay cheaper housing though? Americans reddit self-hating agree! There‚Äôs one solution meet safely. pandemic show lot people families really give shit them. There's going lot grief regard. Yep, bad, even though I‚Äôm early 20s. couldn‚Äôt sleep back, simply couldn‚Äôt breathe way. Sleeping stomach great technique get ""Facts stubborn things."" - John Adams I‚Äôm sad ever left Santa Clara county. fantastic move. yeah. countries things... Getting pretty authoritarian around here. Stayed home today. Spent day girl zoom calls. us selfish. think point comment... yeah. Sure. depressing numbers almost line party voting percentages well. I'm good this, every time get flu vaccine prepare myself, usually get Friday afternoon usually left severe headache 1-2 days. /shrug. guess mindsets different. 

The Thanksgiving host question sending 19 invites _potentially_ dangerous real awareness relying entirely good faith responsible behaviour everyone. There's lot undue risk sake turkey. wrong you‚Äôre overestimated natural herd immunity. level herd immunity happens soon one person population longer infected, total herd immunity occur nature. colonists infected native Americans total immunity, wouldn‚Äôt spreading smallpox. I'm aware flaws. Higher education also sucks big (ofc mean prices). 
Still Europe also big flaws. pay taxes everywhere, almost everything. Car? Road tax. Phone? Money artists. Car insurance? Insurance tax. salary around 30k per year get benefits. would like stop working here, would get almost 1k per month government, couple almost 1.5k per month. That's expensive, working getting ripped taxes that.
I would prefer keep money way smaller social security (social security IMO enough comfortable life, make feel humiliated push work). Except Italy, Spain Greece (they big unemployment) unemployed Europe means ""I can't find good job me, decided live benefits find one"". Wow, sounds terrible. That‚Äôs never experience here.

And personal comments unnecessary, thanks concern! backcountry setup, lift lines anyway :) We.are planning stagger injections someone look kids side effects rough. Yes, that's thought. I'm advocating herd immunity, think cruel strategy. I'm saying happening certain places, least time being. 3 million 8% Canadas population.


The US 20 million people vaccinated end 2020, 6% US population reference. common thing government now? they‚Äôre taking virus seriously, say? eat dry turkey meat. ma'am. Actually women 5%more likely become obese men hou check out, men likely overweight. I'd willing bet significant portion percentage due lack funds well. People broke, flying cheap. I'm aussie always joke 'dumb' lot Americans are. üòÇ  didnt even know dead lol someone posting paywalled source, cut paste text. think I'm physically capable shoving swab far enough get accurate test. it. got test, went DEEP, myself.

Moved rural area bigger city school 2018. Grad student budget, small apartment.
Since pandemic started, cases bad city, home see family friends, since one case covid town. also seeing local friends, obvious reasons. Lost job opportunity field company decided hire/laid people summer. Human nature makes pandemics end socially medically Covid different Everybody gangsta till whoever's playing Plague Inc Earth starts stacking upgrades. workers owned means production jobs would safer. AFAIK regulators known dosing error confident allow continue. I'm thinking UK go 2 full dosage route now. We're pretty used now.

Thing is, Fauci pragmatic. like it, recognize it. Lockdowns would worked, implemented properly time spent lockdown used strategically beef testing, medical supplies, contact tracing. that's like saying fire extinguisher could prevented house burning down. true used early properly, let whole place burn several hours.

I know going happen now, besides lot people dying. every non-American looking us disbelief, there‚Äôs American same. I‚Äôm going try claim idiots rare, it‚Äôs means ‚Äúall us‚Äù.

Out lf curiosity happen doses second one?

It may trade efficacious significant immune response much common. Nah, hundreds thousands people travelling Thanksgiving manage keep pandemic going 
Hey, make random hypotheses related market movements too!

Asian indexes early trading Weeknd‚Äôs new album snubbed Grammy Nomination. heard Boris Johnson? Yea thought so. essentially agree studies lacking they're impossible do. say proven science. yes, problem claiming masks proven panacea, shifting focus important mitigation strategies. least maybe people finally forced empathize 8-months-and-counting long covid! Also dog loved dinner made guest year. thankful 2020 isn‚Äôt hard /s also careful language define terms.

Does vaccine prevent us *having* virus body? Certainly - it‚Äôs like kills virus particles inhale them.

Does stop virus reproducing body? Yes, maybe immediately - it‚Äôs open question quickly stops virus reproduction levels virus may reach immune system wipes out.

And don‚Äôt yet know reproduction threshold retransmitting virus others, level requires levels allowed vaccine.

You said - I‚Äôm mostly concerned precision language, think imprecise language problem throughout pandemic, including persuading people follow needed precautions. downvoted viewed selfish get vaccinated otherwise could be. many can‚Äôt be, may die live lifelong impairments due vaccine aversion. 

For record, think it‚Äôs fine avoid vaccines, long don‚Äôt try participate civilization. Dense, modern civilization works vaccines, antibiotics, sanitary sewers. sub. big anti American circle jerk. Best wishes keep typing. Canadian definitely look horror. Considering massive border, it‚Äôs best interest America stops shitting diaper again. mockery. ghost cities come from. They're able manipulate economy level mantain 'shovel ready' jobs millions.

Or, said another way, China's economy strong afford pay millions people build entire cities one ever use, give job... Small town civil liberties important too.

Well, depends. precautions take take way destination protect/expose parents. need know know enraged get. That's scientific it.  Cant speak rest world, Norway definately cutting back travel visits Christmas. government said years Christmas different encourages people travel little possible. family already cancelled several family gatherings, meeting already live town. None co workers friends travelling across country family gatherings Christmas  clarify/elaborate:

It stuffing actually stuffed something, otherwise dressing know insinuating, like conviction 90% population Africa 55 years age. game changer there. choice, think choice vaccine get? already dividing winners losers press reports, wait science.  Interestingly, pandemic curve UK [for Spanish showed peak mid November US similar graph. Flu lower mean incubation time, theory, conditions right, Flu spread quickly, even though appears (full disclosure: education whatsoever epidemiology) Covid might ways contagious, non-scientific usage word. Ie, flu prevalence way previous years, yet covid rages on. 

&amp;#x200B;

100 years later, science advanced provide better information public health directors, mention viable vaccines forthcoming, socioeconomic issue balancing public well-being economic function remains challenging. Generally speaking, humans, like animals, like corralled. think Spanish flu possibly ran course freely, average, worldwide, Covid outbreak. 

&amp;#x200B;

All said, think right, peak likely Christmas US, although completely depends handle it. European countries saw severe second waves, like France UK (UK nudged past peak cases, quite deaths), starting see evidence decline cases, likely due elevated health recommendations restrictions. Many places US ratcheting restrictions hopeful peak sooner bad think. somewhat possible Mom Cool story bro Christmas New Year's celebrations kick nice third wave Europe, time devastating vaccines widely available.  behalf serious, precautious, non-risk taking, isolating Americans..

I apologize behalf slower siblings. Many dropped heads baby became selfish fucks. 

Terribly sorry. Also even summer predicted surge fall, still let happen. looks now, Christmas New Year's celebrations kick nice third wave Europe, time devastating vaccine widely available.  sometime run ventilators get thousands deaths. Lol sure Lame Lmao live country built bodies natives, much racism garbage anyone else. make mistake thinking constant scrutiny country somehow morally superior. Life free die. Even Doug Ford looked reasonable compared lot US least listening experts getting somewhat way. heard last true least, that's streets ahead much US. called back March plummeted climb time high, right... Compared thanksgiving week previous years. (Meme two Spidermen pointing other)

Looks like Europe America simply taking turns. flavor stupid different, level per capita far away. 

In particular, US politicized pandemic - online-only education widespread. 

Meanwhile, multiple European countries right thing avoid first wave... relaxed decided opening schools in-person September great idea. started [a huge 2nd wave exceeded US levels, even per-capita #1 [in per capita long? Stay tuned! projected herd immunity rate? Notifying bar though? laws break? cow smell really lasts minute two. good reminder progress made - find looking forward lol. Plenty history's greatest monsters died comfortable death. Things always fair. world looking disbelief four years, bewilderment.

Be safe. certainly do, actually. still requested explain people understand. go-to lines... example, explaining culturally, masks seen similarly Japanese people view tattoos-- ie, degenerate criminals use them, strange reason global pandemic could mitigated everyone got large prominent tattoos, Japan would resistant idea. beyond that... constant conversation again, answers. FF. wish Google released kind data us plebs play People age 70 .005% chance dying Covid19 infected.

You might well look stories teachers died car accidents way work. silly. need gone forever. self defeating think elimination (not eradication, different thing) worth another outbreak could occur. 


If another outbreak extremely well placed squash local cluster level, meaning 10s cases, hundreds thousands. See SA. 


With rest Aus also enjoying long spans elimination (we make big deal Vic full tilt second wave, rest Aus didn't, got sorted first time round) ability quarantine returning travellers vaccines appearing viable distant future extremely good position in. good now, good in, even event outbreak. Starting zero hugely better rampant community spread makes contact tracing impossible.

China, Thailand, Korea, Japan handled virus well. Yet Americans think wearing mask communism Half population average intelligence, another 10% aren‚Äôt much smarter.   

Of 40%, many poorly educated, limited thinking political, religious dogma, substance abuse issues, busy, maybe half?

Flight Radar's data TSA processings supposedly showed 13% drop travel. Herd immunity appears thing, short term. Studies confirmed immunity lasting least six months, simply know. yes, would slow promote herd immunity strategy beat virus.

I think without vaccine two things would happen. 1) Life expectancy could lower 2) we'd learn lot makes virus devastating certain people find ways enhance general immune health. third possibility virus eventually kills genetically susceptible it. Probably things go:

[Voight-Kampff Agree one hundred percent, could get people realize handled could way clear covid. dance TikTok ICU patient playing violin? Presumably sure medicine works properly would save lives lost trial. dark is, think scientists know play numbers better do. Thats slippery slope. Giving citizens right issue violence asking abused. available USA? wasn‚Äôt aware sex thing might bullshit. Either way guards given task particularly short notice little training. put risk associated cases psychiatric disturbances suicidal behavior given COVID-19 patients

fucking phenomenal. trial bit mess right now. 

I think that's issue. may fudging results. start over. sounds good true, probably is. Hire people work specialists. works professions. option let people die see harm least trying. tested everyone hush hush quiet tested positive

Wouldn't HIPAA thing, though?  normal circumstances, develop vaccine 5 years considered amazingly fast extremely rare. surprise mRNA vaccine 5 years ago made past stage 3. would surprising vaccine type 5 years ago made far.

These normal times. vaccine type ever finished stage 3 within year (or 2, ...?), yet 5 cusp so. company work actually conducts COVID testing become symptomatic you‚Äôre expected go get tested dime. Thats risk want take guilt want carry me. cause death another person? no. even die. Complications? knows. Germany, major delivery network ""contactless delivery"". pay online, put food front door, ring bell, step 5 meters back. take stuff in, leave made sure delivery successful.

Oh, yes: people involved wearing masks (and government-mandated ""free sky"" well beginning December 1st.) 

Personally, I'd ok anyone found outside without mask relocated lepra-colony style island whole charade over. Let live freedom there. Hell governors hypocritical large gatherings families. Caught wearing mask red handed well agree. Every person seems shut unable comprehend people like go gym, go out, social lives etc. Whatever. need hope that's I'm hanging hat on. half populace cannot stand even tiny bit hardship

It's that, simply unwillingness coexist mutually beneficial environment. pursuit unbounded capital led here. end result capitalism. Well played. Yep, one unethical things pandemic use placebo's. use medicine see making difference. suddenly death rate drops significant amount shock horror found something works. I've downvoted couple times subs saying find types trials unethical, get people think they're necessary, think keeping many people alive (if possible) always main objective.  AGREED. wish fellow citizens would wake fuck get board. It‚Äôs utter insanity. awful message is....you cost money, athletes make us money.

Sad world live sometimes pack bags bags possession since?

Has anyone asked watch bags you? removed felt people took wrong way, felt offending people better deleted. Thanks reanimating shame. US Oh, hospitals. We‚Äôre also limited doctors, dentists (for carry separate insurance), prescription drugs, procedures, therapies... list goes on. 

Also many go bankrupt even network insurance. God forbid ever need ambulance. mostly Midwestern issue ER gives covid test like banks lollipops life worth throw catch ball. saves lives. atleast America Wait minute .. 28,000 month nurse ? Herd immunity happen ever thing. 2 million would die still happen certain. like said. uncharted territory far modern systems concerned. feds really need step lay good employee safety net comes covid issues. longer goes, people die, employees lost, permanently, money lost business worker. notion giving free lunch lazy people like spout fuck right off. want pandemic over, one ways that. supporting sick ESPECIALLY supporting sick healthcare workers. know it! I‚Äôd honestly rather fail people hand hold them. people meant certain degrees. use degrading degree making easier them.

Some people don‚Äôt even try. noticed classmates. put effort. want graduate make money. don‚Äôt want learn material. you‚Äôre saying everyone‚Äôs going catch it? got exposed someone CoVId university oregon last Wednesday Thursday. latest would've gotten test result (through university) Friday last week. person activities Sunday Monday (with masks face shields), receiving email Monday afternoon, informing us classmate tested positive. told us watch another email let us know whether close contact. email come late Wednesday. took 6 days knowing case, inform close contact needed quarantine. I‚Äôm RN knew others dropping didn‚Äôt think this. Yikes solution, choice, room. prevention could saved them. like war.

The hospital work normally medical specialties available. Back march, matter 2 weeks, 500 available beds filled covid, people could stayed home, mind you, people scratching necks air. thousand stayed home too. no, 500 hunderd beds. beds would receibe 1400 people really needed hospital, 400 would never go back home would die alone. ICU normally 16 beds, went capacity 55. Even hospital library turned beds.

So would kindly tell could treated patients could offer level care could offer month before?

Covid like fucking tsunami. prevention could saved us. health service, none, prepared handle 10% population getting sick time. systems rely patients arriving small numbers orderly fashion.

So no, lockdowns kill people covid. Lockdowns thing save us tsunami comes. sooner use better. fact, earlier lockdown ""usual"" patients save. Explain college professors salaries then... Radical Terrorists 

It's currently undergoing phase 3 trials Moscow (well, one need live Moscow volunteer trials, travel there) problem Facebook social media become hobby majority Americans.

Delete social media pursue hobbies. You‚Äôll much happier won‚Äôt missing anything. deleted Facebook 700 people regularly contact like 10 people...the rest gossip busy bodies wanted see timeline could gossip. mom's birthday birthday December. I'm going miss Christmas. Somehow prefer missing birthday missing funeral. life spent service others. Thank work, Doctor. Failed state  great. Another animal reservoir hide in, mutate, possibly make way back humans again.  Good hopefully normal life resume even earlier :) Good God, man. sounds like sad scene prison movie. Based Someone know happen years, covid related, due degenerative bone disease. blood totally painless. No, given ‚ÄúCOVID pass‚Äù current administration. That‚Äôs interesting, thank taking time explain me! Lol, really all, resist pointing out. Frivolous decisions one thing. one thing someone goes watch football match. days low key thing something regular people fun different story.

What right this. giant machines promoting sorts stuff extremizing attention. People watch things, idolize athletes, celebrities, actors. freak critical mention faults. People get used forgiving idols major slights, drives value society. People start riots shit. People care much higher level frivolous spending, wanting cool down, wanting fun, nothing all.

And people cared calmly, none would earn much money.

Then corporations grab idolization use drive sorts ideas well defend business practices. Sports monetized sell sorts questionable crap. Soccer makes us bat eye stadiums built slaves (see Qatar). Whole countries got fucked law Disney sit tight someone dare watch movie ""shouldn't"" have. Privacy surveillance got fucked someone want someone else listen music. NFL major medical coverups oh can't admit bashing head is, like, bad.

It's ""merely"" entertainment. 

That's mean things free. focusing attention intently fucking belong opening lies disinformation.

And later people ask someone like Trump could get elected.

Worship worthless things shamed. owned shaming gamers care way much game, harm analyzed, rest follow suit well. People done stupid shit generations, yes, also mechanisms discourage stupid shit generations, too.

And starts talking it, yet every time did, someone smart would show telling wrong, think average absent-minded person promoting crap. Yes, lifelong politician surely save us. leagues paying them, creating contracts companies would otherwise buyers, quantity ordered. nation supporting measure looking increase testing hospitals workers also praising testing done company/league rather demonizing them. apply housing benefits government housing?  would probably 'god no' cases.. proved crap agenda wrong, helped stomp deadly virus. people money watch football game pay hospital stay. 

And scientists full actors clout instead innovation. 




This sound like conservative shit Tbh it‚Äôs work trash organizations, hospital test anyone feels need test. test every patient comes ER without exception. required quarantine getting negative test symptoms. hospital takes seriously. 

I honestly think reason one nurses beginning got patient ended ecmo 2 months. risking happening another staff member. required wear n95+surgical mask+face shield every patient encounter, least surgical mask around hospital. Doesn‚Äôt seem case work at. get tested twice week. People test positive symptoms take much time want. asymptomatic ones allowed go back work long wear PPE get assigned COVID unit Probably not, though. people believe covid real. think flu come ER already dying. beds occupied long. live Norway last night first colder night winter. 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit), FREEZING due moist air. can't imagine sleeping tent conditions. Makes grateful warm bed. lots elective procedures heart hospital. I‚Äôm nurse cardiac cath lab state shut elective procedures getting downstaffed constantly many procedures got cancelled. 

Nurses willing work inpatient covid units ICUs absolutely short supply tons $5,000+ per week travel contracts. pandemic also seen TON turnover nurses quitting staff positions go travel covid hotspots money don‚Äôt blame all. you‚Äôre already working covid patients getting treated like shit home hospital take contract somewhere else exact job pays 4x salary put contract require appropriate PPE times? Sounds like win win me! Say me: majority Americans embraced evil. It‚Äôs wild seeing poorly pandemic handled. 

If wife gets poke (torn gloves/broken skin) working normal high risk patient (hepatitis, etc) gets routine free testing. pandemic routine interactions covid positive patients tested facility housed patient. test antibody screening donating blood. [IASIP pulling Charlie's Two weeks? parts restrictions 6 weeks. But...wasnt right tho? Majority people wearing correctly, actually increasing risk catching virus also increasing spread always touch mask washing hands touching doors, food whatever.  
 
I haven‚Äôt seen evidence people using masks wrong making things worse one wore masks. Also, I‚Äôm convinced people using masks wrong would stay home didn‚Äôt mask.  
.  

If pushed mask wearing, DIY mask creation education proper use starting back March, we‚Äôd much better place today. understanding aerosols still major vector touching surfaces hasn‚Äôt shown nearly big problem 1st thought. stuff never touching outside mask taken hospital procedure good nearly critical don‚Äôt spend 8 hours day COVID ward. I‚Äôm seeing US people pretty diligent mask use people bare minimum, like putting mask they‚Äôre entering store they‚Äôll let maybe wearing mask nose hanging üò°. there‚Äôs ding dongs won‚Äôt wear masks ‚Äúmuh freedoms‚Äù. America stupid, stupid country we‚Äôre killing stupidity. hate say american selfishness (maskless public) indirectly killing innocent people dying catching last breath misinformation. Stop.

Wtf talking about? don‚Äôt think going countries forcing ideas killing others coward move. USA directly attacked sure, defending country coward, attacking countries... Sure ya did, fill instacart ya fucking loser see bump cases mid october, majority schools open weeks?

Or mid November, weeks Halloween? 

Same Spring Break earlier year. remember people trying track cellphones coming going Florida. noticable increase cases.

Thanksgiving might different, elderly staying family. also remember New York, excess deaths elderly living younger family. get mean think employers healthcare testing employees. makes sense counting individuals take tests. doctor want pay bills, that's affects them. doctor want get COVID test, could affect lot patients. significant source misinformation internet. Fact.  someone (for example) goes store, gets covid germs someone, immediately able start passing germs others? take time like, manifest body? example, catch germs immediately stop friend's house 5 minutes drop something without mask, friend high change getting sick now? issues, seem larger specifically discussed present per capita. think anyone saying there's epidemic male teachers getting canned sort thing, stories real enough dissuade many people. much money nurse generate? transport ~10 covid patients week far every partner covid covid symptoms.we go find places get tested wait insurance actively discourages getting tested test us without doctor referrels. doctors insist covid matter u tell them. 

I'm going complain athletes getting tested, pay lot money it. wish companies paid employees get tested too. ya know, accessible insurance PAY point flattening curve reduce pressure hospitals slowing spread. expected virus would continue spread, exponential curve unchecked spread cause deaths hospitals run resources. curves flattened, while. people rigorous distancing masking, curve could flattened death rate reduced. never supposed, never promised, once-only action would fix everything. live Michigan work nurse nursing home, wife works nurse ER. get tested twice weekly, doesn‚Äôt all. Bonkers. Good, afaik people predicting CDC committee would meet FDA gives EUA would slow Distribution. I'd risk nearly certain death 7k/wk, either die make shitload money. sign? even far truth.

Of 54 African countries, four carried one million tests: South Africa (five million), Morocco (slightly less four million), Ethiopia (1.6 million), Egypt (one million). Another five carried 500,000 850,000 tests, rest less 500,000.

In USA, 37 states 50 carried one million tests, another nine 500,000. Yeah, Georgia fairly easy completely free get tested, even you‚Äôre first responder/healthcare worker.

Health Minister Matt Hancock asked authority determine vaccine ""meets strict safety requirements"".

The British government ordered 100 million doses vaccine plans start distributing December approved.

Oxford Astra Zeneca announced earlier week vaccine appeared 62 percent effective people receiving two doses 90 percent effective volunteers received half dose followed full dose.

It later revealed error resulted ""half dose vaccine given first dose"" participants. supervisory authority informed error discovered.

Astra Zeneca said plans conduct new clinical trial assess efficacy vaccine. expected delay approval UK EU. fuck forever $8k week great, except might *die* job. house busy intersection. partner stayed home alone, watched cars hour yesterday morning. packed full people, clearly traveling somewhere.

There‚Äôs millions people pumping money see unpaid kids field, literally least test them.

That doesn‚Äôt make okay nurses aren‚Äôt, tested. public: need prosecute coronavirus rule breakers fullest extent law.

Also public: Whoa, like that.

Yep. use tiny amount ambiguity invalidate cause &amp; effect. bullet generally won‚Äôt kill you, blood loss organ failure bullet severed something kill you.

Coronavirus doesn‚Äôt kill. It‚Äôs lungs fill jelly, die suffocation. Can‚Äôt count covid death! GF nurse also tested multiple times, full time tested positive, work told stay away negative test 

All comments concerning... live UK way, horror stories US based? tried get tested?

I live one biggest cities country there‚Äôs dozens urgent cares around us. wife nurse get tested anytime wants. needs ask. friends moved rural states testing sites too, need travel little there.

If you‚Äôre expecting people run test without asking one, it‚Äôs probably going happen. Logistics tend work way, everything going utopia way want be.

Some people want find reason complain everything. take initiative get tested all? completely silent whole time? working ‚Äúbed side‚Äù haven‚Äôt thought go get tested all? I‚Äôve tested back May via saliva. Don‚Äôt even know accurate was. patients, still nasal swabs ED work. I‚Äôm sorry, hopefully okay coming weeks.

Americans nice people, mostly. America whole care anything money, politics, fame, sports, etc. really like caricatures countries. Yes know NYC people waiting long lines testing thanksgiving. don‚Äôt know difficult get appointment places weren‚Äôt walk-in. love acting like know cyber security researchers assuming pulled ass work urgent care test ~60-70 people day tested total zero times. We‚Äôre allowed unless symptoms. Actually, coworkers tested positive weren‚Äôt even notified going fine. told southerner yesterday front lines overworked essentially administering chicken soup. got mad someone dismissive disease people fighting it.

Like, fucking duh police sides. seriously can't pretend they're equal. wife nurse Texas asked hospital tests it‚Äôs employees. said yes, experiencing symptoms test quarantine test positive. said she‚Äôs never heard anyone say get tested. 

So guess varies place place depends hospital. It‚Äôs like everywhere. Cornbeef?? love guy getting executed brief forethought casually talking economic sanctions frustration Chinese trade impact.

Obviously thousands die to, there's really nothing point, already leave house live middle nowhere. way see it, we'll bust ceiling get half country antibodies, march/april hits start getting vaccine everybody else. virus die even faster go back normal. Happy cake day! right manufacturing capabilities new types vaccines require. 
It's labs create vaccines, do. type. 
Luckily government hedged bet pre ordered sources like Pfizer, etc. yes, may get vaccine first, government exactly should/could do.
They also pumped money upgrading couple different labs Canada. One Vancouver live, one Saskatchewan I'm from. 
Don't let anyone fool you, Canadian government done WAY citizens certain people want project. Step 1: Mandatory country wide mask mandate- exceptions. can't wear one--- stay Step 2: Break rule #1 = fines garnishment Step 3: Break rule #1 = house running concurrently said definitely time overreact.

I led astray description sub specifies SARS-CoV-2 sure heavily downvoted. completely right. can't let thing run rampant vaccinating 70s. hospitalisation fatality rate still high younger age brackets switch mitigations.

I guess 100% prevalence anything close see many deaths. hospitalisation rate still far high though. busy making tik toks Honestly, still can't understand.

Why think it‚Äôll long Canada? I've heard many stories like this. Covid exposure workplace becoming new ""don't ask, tell"".  Great. time blood streets. founder actually discovered types RNA vaccines also Moderna Biontech use. Curevac media spring Trump tried buy US. They're involved Bill Gates Elon Musk (altough indirectly). 

Very exiting stuff, corona also diseases. Americans care Americans. data behind current foot traffic US? I‚Äôm asking whenever go somewhere seems like nobody gives damn pandemic things normal I‚Äôve ever you‚Äôre going see people staying home obviously avoiding crowds. Oh dude going love place.

Just hang monkeys thieving little bastards penchant nicking cellphones cameras. think options 1,2Billion - ‚Äûpromising‚Äú oddly framed! last time said something nurses unions people protested saying don‚Äôt. vaccine ever released fast human history. cited numerous vaccines first seemed work great early trials years testing cancelled. 

Vaccines released typically 10-12 years testing prior release, course shown safe problems few, even years release. 

Again, many vaccines first years seem great, years testing problems show themselves. Problems serious enough cancel entire vaccine. SARS 1.0 vaccine, vaccine type coronavirus prior November 2020. 

This rush Phase 1-3 trials normal vaccine development. 

Once again, can't rush safety trials. basically going long term safety trials live. never done before. employee pulled teeth make necklace made video, yes called cops Wow, thanks info! Humanity empathy? Stay home countries selfish bunch jerks, leave airports planes empty people *really* fly. Wait till see whats going Illinois! i‚Äôm shocked.. ‚ÄòSociety‚Äô isn‚Äôt deciding test athletes, right? It‚Äôs leagues play require testing pay it. don‚Äôt know much it, seems like decision made teams players allow keep playing. 

Shouldn‚Äôt hospitals medical industry making priority test staff? USA, millions religious workers working hard convince followers Communism evil, along atheists moral. 
All started lie ‚ÄúGod real‚Äù, need one thousand lies cover up. Viruses evolve? Wow NY times broke story century üôÑ never said that.

I think liking something unimportant much consider irreplaceable silly. people don‚Äôt seem realize disparity testing. place like NY almost many tests per day Italy example.
They‚Äôre missing lots cases Tokyo. hypercoagulopathy serious Covid, capillaries lungs, heart, kidneys, visibly, supporting hair follicles dental bone sockets, blocked clots, pretty well demonstrated.

Tooth loss seems later appearing manifestation. three nurse friends, different hospitals owned different companies. One Mayo.

All frequently tested. spouses tested less frequently, don‚Äôt recall spouse testing mandatory not. 

Perhaps regional thing.  false; IFR projections across age put number 80% reduction deaths. [know projected US under-70 population 100% prevalence would include around 700,000 deaths. Perhaps number could lowered since would arbitrary scenario also -80% pressure hospitals. work ambulance. wife immunocompromised. employer offer testing. offered choice work home office choose go that‚Äôs fine. Good 

Many offered choice put lives risk productivity benefit. Paid time includes sick leave, maternity leave, things generally determined government. USA laws anywhere regarding treatment full time employees really shouldn‚Äôt gotten rid protections guess. used to. RNs unions, may make easier voice speaks them. ""Pumpkin headed dipsh*t""

And get work grocery shopping even everything right. fault.

Yeah normally year. Every year potentially maybe, year fucking idiots. 
/rant Well, nothing new outside perspective. usually non-Americans dying part. Anybody else put constant cheerleading healthcare staff? Even worse done politicians. Nurses doctors trained deal difficult health situations (althoug maybe pandemics). acknowledge amazing effort, pay properly, provide tests/PPE need. Talk cheap, providing proper pay PPE investment. You‚Äôre one shaming people taking pandemic seriously, enticing others pile call loner losers don‚Äôt luxury people see real life.

That, common sense far common. hardest thing ignore, Sandoval says, comes coronavirus testing, nation haves have-nots.

You could quoted ""this nation haves nots"". Russia already vaccinated 2500 soldiers (they starting military). total bullshit. Bread circuses Rome burns. Watch athletes get vaccine first too. far I'm concerned, nuke entire pro sports industry. lol, okay let‚Äôs every essential worker quit job middle pandemic. could go wrong that? short ventilators, I'm sure people expected given 11 months in!

here's world map centered New Zealand: virus get there, hard guess? Shit man, there's many idiots country too. America. Christmas right around corner. hey it'll gone Easter, right!?  So, funny story happened yesterday. JHU's student newsletter published article (written student) days ago claiming increase excess deaths all, despite COVID (just clear, true check [CDC yourself).

Someone found yesterday spammed right wing subs (and i'm sure elsewhere) titles like ""SEE BULLSHIT ALONG"" lots back-patting covid lib/media hoax. comments article pretty atrocious too.

Anyway, went look since removed article. still google cache want look - wonder much damage ill-conceived article done terms fuelling conspiracy theories.  Imagine religion going lost bit luster over. prayer jack squat. going get much worse.

Those got thanksgiving giving 1-2 new generations cases, contagious christmas. get christmas cases. exponential growth involved hard fathom.

I'm sure could spaced worse. I'm predicting early february mid march we'll seeing collapsed medical system 2,000 3,000 dead day. I'm going deny happening. would silly.

But something medical community seriously concerned about, keeping schools open rather dangerous. mom works hospital Southern IL across river STL still believe hospital overflow Listen/ watch NPR. 

\+panic? 10-20% think hoax.... rest saw coming even worse that.

Those got thanksgiving giving 1-2 new generations cases, contagious christmas. get christmas cases.

I'm sure could spaced worse. I'm predicting early february mid march we'll seeing collapsed medical system 2,000 3,000 dead day. Found optimist!

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll fine. felt, me, totally unnecessary put whole trip risk, however small risk.

The socially distanced part sitting opposite ends massive table. Nobody watching dread neither disbelief shut fuck center universe we're dealing damn thing, think give shit Americans celebrating thanksgiving?  know what's wrong read ""asses jab"" confused thought got vaccine arm. got 5 years..10 most. FREEDOM^^^19 Statistically know likely age COVID hospitalisations see what's hard checking social media, that's anyone time anyway. here's extension automatically bypass paywalls (on chrome think exponential growth people could infected didn't, refusing go likely saved dozens lives. Many countries *uncontrolled spread COVID-19* US does. Yeah Taiwan seems top it. supposed return America June luckily gave huge visa extension. America even worse went another told ""sucks good luck corona town"". least town one better ones guess.

Real jealous taiwan situation. new Zealand getting mad respect. also never reported type vaccine showed symptoms received. even differentiate got placebos got real vaccine.

Your mistaken here, differentiate got actually vaccine otherwise able know efficacy. differentiated trials run UK run Brazil, use different comparators. sounding like approach get past regulators US would suspect UK. 8 months pandemic, feel handling cash? still fomite vectors coronavirus fear highly reduced since March? Thing is, nurses sacrifice lives *victims of* willfully ignorant, too.  Sooo let spread wildly then? seeing point here. thought. mean you‚Äôre driving long already, make bit (ok, lot) longer actually enjoy it. seen new macOS Big Sur wallpapers? That‚Äôs exactly you‚Äôll get Thank much. insisted every year's thanksgiving proclamation. text made text blocks, add custom stuff middle, even written him. maybe find older proclamations online somewhere, whitehouse server seems hosts Trump stuff, Obama that. think constituted socially distanced thanksgiving? people over? outside? Would love see data whole world. Site show 50M US citizens contracted Covid19, that's 4 times reported number almost many cases reported worldwide. Lmaoo terrible kid. get it, though. driving potentially coming contact less people. Obviously ideal given circumstances, still reduction none less. Realistically, best way stop COVID everyone stay home go anywhere officials give clear. however pretty unreasonable given economy set up, need accept move forward calculated risks. Ivermectin effective prophylactic literally many dozens observational studies effectiveness reducing severity fatality. But, single big Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). 

It costs $1-$3 per tablet requires total 8-12 tablets, say $20-$60 whole treatment. Apart non-COVID drugs may use like azithromycin, paracetamol, etc. 

There dozen small RCTs developing countries (India, Egypt, Iraq, Bangladesh, Peru, etc), single big one Western world. 

Make that. Someone else's greed killing people pandemic many, many ways.  Yeah, thanksgiving odd, mom good night one thanksgiving either 2 us first time life. would brilliant happened. Imagine thing happened 50 100 years wear masks, yearly reminder effective one time.  People would grow associating masks donut good time. Hard anti mask point. funny many people okay too. seem mental acuity see absurdity. That's Reddit bot. 

But translate mystery. 42% less infectious... never get bonus checks do.. unfortunately turns friend mine one. gone full conspiracy theory too. started trying understand perspective open conversations I‚Äôve unfollow across social media sanity. 7 million half amount people flew last year. 17 million people would flown pre covid, half decided follow covid guidelines stay home half didn't. They'll also remove meter entirely file charges. Depends province, use levels/numbers NL Yeah read that. Kind fucked let permanent residents in, IMO.

Taiwan pretty fair system. Permanent residents never barred entry, since around mid-Feb (and citizens) course subject 14 day quarantine entry. It‚Äôs extremely strict. months hotel quarantine dedicated hotels allowed. home quarantine, you‚Äôre heavily monitored. leave home, it‚Äôs big fines. personally haven‚Äôt left Taiwan since Jan.

Those short term visas given extensions.

And starting June, began allowing entry certain reasons: business, family visit, religious service, etc. ones know of. parents qualify family visit since granddaughter Taiwanese.

I‚Äôm grateful government allows types visits. It‚Äôs really important done safely. parents test flying, aforementioned strict quarantine upon arrival. There‚Äôs zero chance infecting anyone. It‚Äôs expensive, it‚Äôs worth it. First grandkid all. never get time back. notice source mentions dropped number people ""great"" confidence authorities. english article makes seem overall support dropped much. and/or increasing exasperation pandemic altered lifestyle time methods fight COVID improve P: ""The third strategy allowing spread maybe getting herd immunity.""

Tegnell: ""Yeah think number three anyway.""

The gist leaked email Tegnell **clearly** stated goal.

A smoking gun ain't.  Look probably won‚Äôt convince replying comment I‚Äôm going try. Democrats eat own. It‚Äôs Republicans allow whatever. got pass orange idiot office steals spotlight every day dumb shit every single fucking day. Instead acting like president, acts like common moron. course common morons love shit. silver lining (according airline data) 7 million people traveled, last year 17 million did.

Silver linings indeed. likely Wuhan traveling new year original super spreader event though .. figure estimated around 5 million? can't serious... 
It sure looks like anywhere else world... 60% population following guidelines enough contain highly contagious, deadly virus. Maybe would enough virus contagious, 60% mask usage, small reckless group stay-at-home contrarians, in-person schooling we've dragging feet ever since May. Either national leadership needs take meaningful, decisive action soon possible something else needs change motivate least 3/4's irresponsible 40% get care. Well handling disaster par Michael Scott would done :p Get help wish guys best! strongly support introduction financial assistance anyone truly needs self-isolate needs care someone truly vulnerable. also support making obligatory businesses (large ones, anyway) public services make special arrangements workers vulnerable. closing schools, shutting economy, isolating people loved ones, etc vast overreaction.

I know heard rubbish. Even lockdown, able take dog walk exercise. Canadians talking shit US always hilarious lol favorite pastime becoming borderline creepy. ‚ÄúLooking horror‚Äù BAWAHAHA new business raised money centuries imbecile want go bank, huge small business. terrible capitalists I'm sure despise.

That's arrogantly stupid ngl. little interesting I'd curious see Fauci say since he's expert HIV awhile now. Sure I‚Äôll try remember comment week they‚Äôll (hopefully) negative flight Taipei.

I‚Äôll relieved. saying they'll reach herd immunity January? good Northeast branches get not? Headline bit bait-ey. us western countries something similar Christmas (regrettably) Hope roommate (and yourself!) stay safe man I'm really surprised letting people, especially America, in.

Is says? Yeah that's clots work, go away. Clots form years blood vessels, generally causing problems break travel somewhere else causing thromboembolism. Brain, thromboembolism stroke, lung thromboembolism pulmonary embolism heart causes myocardial infarctions (heart attacks). Anything increases risk blood clots cause long term thromboembolism risk. don‚Äôt understand, keep wrong people getting help? Nobody gives fuck happening America.

That country like zoo rest world laugh at. hear that. grandma dead af. still wear mask. LOL live Berlin even news. Every German state open vaccination centers. We‚Äôve glue eating window licker years already. everyone knows it. long woman hospital? day 1.7k people die heart disease US, 1.5k people die stroke, 2k people die Covid-19. ""thousands problem whatsoever"" true. Yeah half assed lockdown everything stays closed forever terrible. I'm Adelaide we've spent pretty much whole year business usual. Unemployment went March like everywhere else, recovering. I‚Äôm American watching dread. 

As much hurts cancel person holiday plans, would hurt watch older family die younger family become permanently damaged.

Not mention fact extended hospital stay plus lifetime lung damage would likely bankrupt me. life already permanently altered negatively virus, don‚Äôt need get worse. I'm fine shit like wearing motorcycle helmet,

Even destroy family. Guy knew Maine died 22, 4 brothers, fianc√© baby girl. devastated. would roughed ok worn helmet. Would saying something pessimistic better? Spreading optimism best thing do, even believe it. Really pissing places still Black Friday first place. incredibly fucked, especially corporations likely afford give people time . Hope stay safe, though. seems kinda flippant compared gravity situation. :/ liquor agents ones jailed, something else can't recall. email.

The first guy says, like quote summarized: ""alternative 3 herd immunity strategy"". afterwards says personally would never choose would lead thousands deaths.

Tegnell says ""we landed alternative 3"". Well, totally disagree cuisine part.

German cuisine great lot regional differences, traditional German cuisine heavy food.

Well, German baking traditions even UNESCO intangible cultural heritage! Keep simple. However want cut it, US highest COVID infection rate capita sheer raw numbers whatever metric want use.

Germany Canada actually far lower rates US.

Amongst western nations, China lowest COVID rate actually something it. 

Not China. entire region East SE Asia New Zealand Australia largely COVID free _because_ followed guidelines COVID hit.

Man , even teach maths science American schools. watch reruns fox news follow politicians tweets take gospel. least there's olives antivax antimask America‚Äôs future rests whether madness anti-science, racist, homophobic, xenophobic anti-truth ideas leak significantly youth young adults decades come. I, too, fearful possibility. people going say realize British government encouraging people travel across UK Christmas?  wanna say, love work. drive Weed Shasta pretty. problems I‚Äôm speaking here, there‚Äôs something selfishly comforting watching Americans deal struggle problems. problems look huge they‚Äôre far away stand across road watch someone else‚Äôs house burn. doesn‚Äôt speak well think might mindset us non-Americans. wish well, guys wonderful holidayed think deserve much better way seem treat yourselves. Oh fuck can't get anywhere without mask obviously wearing masks nothing authoritarian piece shit Again, age they're likely bring strain hospitals anyway mainly classic case ""rules me"" mentality. want benefit without sacrifice part. Selfishness, essentially. super sucks. grandmother also 90s sisters brother. Last year mom died, took toll grandmother. family collectively skipped Thanksgiving year sucks there's chance may last holidays us, time, think taking chance may last holiday season better taking chance catching COVID, suffering weeks months, dying alone hospital. hate too, light end tunnel. eventually. know, nobody this. country doesnt need that, one way get citizen obey pay fines. guy social bubble ends somewhere traffic control couple months waving fantasy driver license. ;P  dread disbelief - deserve everything comes acting like morons. strive best bit much - someone tell they're already #1 Corona cases &amp; deaths. No. really want herd immunity strategy. mentally inserting ""strategy"" guy says herd immunity.

That make proof. split along party lines? shit politicians would considered moderate worst here. Reverse psychology -- would worked great North Carolina. Dunno guy, I‚Äôd say way similar western countries Asian ones, Go family. politicians really telling us we've played. ‚ÄúThe government's job bomb governments.‚Äô

‚Äî conservative acquaintances We're already seeing 2000 dead day now.... Jesus christ I‚Äôd say opposite, Though one apart maybe expats looking dread disbelief. expect USA. Also UK looking forward albeit restrictions Christmas. looking forward next lock whilst small businesses go bust. CCP. Yes is, country sends garbage back, claim you‚Äôre folk saved us. hospitals get filled 85 year olds due COVID, means non-85 year olds need get treatment non-COVID related things aren‚Äôt able to

You fkn dipshit. legen-wait it- Hopefully blessing disguise. see hypocrisy realize we've scammed.  going take longer people realize virus give fuck feelings. *Deer leader Yeah blacks 60s obeyed law. Fucking moron. 


People like hold us back fucking much. Why. disgusting taken family Asians? I'm curious India's COVID deaths 10/100K (I use deaths control testing). going pretend that's awful huddle, even western countries like Denmark, Germany, Canada higher death rates.

Also, one believes China &lt;5K COVID deaths. Science always matters. best sales pitch I've ever heard moving ND lol I‚Äôd daydream without throwing away money lol also shown America following achievable:

* gun reform
* universal health care

But something something deaf ears. took, what, 9 months recommend exercise? Lol. overweight, take vitamins, 99% happening. Buying things mutually agreed upon transaction save lives ""pillaging"". Love weasel words expose racist beliefs. Yeah Go Travel pretty wild/ballsy. I‚Äôm actually travel industry we‚Äôve working government supporting it. haven‚Äôt followed Japan super closely, saw around 500 cases/day, reminds HBO Chernobyl quote: ‚Äúnot great, terrible.‚Äù

Anyway, hope works you, come pay us visit TW over. certainly can‚Äôt wait get back Japan explore small town rail lines. window basically you‚Äôd delaying

I'm sure Wuhan-style lockdown would able get virus numbers level Australia. can't picture US this, think principle possible. Lol. Clearly indeed. Proof 73% nurses hospitalized covid-19 obese.

Not overweight, obese. Hopefully anti-maskers COVID fake people. Lmao. Moronic people continue amaze world. Smh least porn get tested STDs drowned bodily gluids.. world watching disbelief lol.

It's America lol Previous discussion remember still don‚Äôt know long-term effects virus. god damn family. half brother sister went see mom last week, thinking fine went Thanksgiving. Well mom tested positive days after. sister hanging dad, way grandparents house car broke down. picked took home. next day find positive test. They're ""quarantining"" now, could effectively spread Thanksgiving gathering grandparents, aunts, uncle's, cousins, etc took place. reckless anyway.

I put ""quarantine"" lives roommates, Thanksgiving house together. You‚Äôre ignorant truth. life? I‚Äôve driven gas stations I‚Äôve always wondered. like 2 week shift go back city/town? station close enough commute? quote said alternative they're going is:

""L√•t smittspridning ske, l√•ngsamt eller fort, f√∂r att uppn√• en hypotetisk 'herd immunity""

which translate to

""Let infection spread, slow fast, reach hypothetical 'herd immunity' ""

Then Tegnell replies they're going one.

If can't see true goal then, denial. said ""hypothetical"" herd immunity mean they're unsure want herd immunity, means they're unsure herd immunity even reached know virus. tried go anyway. Grapevine around Frazier park Pyramid Lake area fucking nightmare winter.

I made drive valley Seattle relocated never want drive pass Castaic Frazier Park again. are? ya sorry threw spanner lazy circlejerk supposed it, enlightened brother?

RemindMe! 8 days Oh Japan. wording kinda seem like Taiwan. Japan actually kinda dumb. amount people wearing masks properly, socially distancing straight partying real annoying. Like every new case I'm karaoke bar. 

The government even dumb campaign promote travel prefectures due lack tourism. know government posts sort excess death statistic Id bet Japan way worse letting even know about. I'm pretty sure think Corona transmitted foreigners. taking extra vitamin D? hurt may protect you. Stay safe good luck NCLEX. would flown flights available.

Every flight packed things work.   mom‚Äôs upset husband FIL hunting, i‚Äôve got work, sister one make in.

American? 3rd dinner tomorrow, can't wait üòã  New Hampshire - South North Biggest covid denier know, yesterday: ""Maybe deaths go cold, heat didnt kill it. Somebody said go cold"" paying attention American dystopia shocked this. day cool dumb know shit.  Stupid comment. Island + countries never deal amount positives cases.

The pandemic already uncontrollable march Europe lot knowledge virus protective equipments available market. Democrats would panic, Republicans would blame democrats strike, democrats would condemn it. Republicans would put bill barely stimulus massive bribes big business, democrats would capitulate sign ""because optics"" 

that's exactly would happen scenario, support walkout, definitely would.  It‚Äôs amazing many people cut life measures adhereing nonsensical. pointed out, nothing. Maybe there‚Äôs vaccines repair relationships even point then. sad. probably monitor Google search volume things like ‚Äúcovid test‚Äù, ‚Äúcovid symptoms‚Äù, ‚Äúcheap flights‚Äù üò£ 

... even Mayor Denver advised constituents stay home Thanksgiving ‚Äî flew state Thanksgiving daughter.

Millions thing, rationalizing rules good everyone else don‚Äôt apply (insert rationalization here).

If anything, think deaths higher. hospitals already full, many nurses sick, nowhere transfer patients time surge countrywide ... I‚Äôm hunkered hoping supply lines US mail hold up: get much food mail.

Canadian I've got say. disbelief. like par course. read comment shouted Lewis Black. Yikes almost makes worse. would terrified sense impending doom. least spend time family though. hate living sometimes. many selfish people prolonging pandemic. smaller chicken breed. course stay rest lives. think? masks, lockdowns vaccines kill virus? want believe five adults could completely self isolate every exposure two weeks? grocery shopping, work, stopping take out, nothing. Plus rely honesty everyone involved truly isolated everything. One slip someone exposed spread rest group. much even trust neighbor, parents, even selves done everything correctly?

It's people think cautious believe can't happen families keeps spreading thing. Yes ways migrate risk, mixing households still creates additional risks unnecessary. tell we‚Äôre super racist. used think true moved Asia 2008 came back 2016 time something appears broken america, people super racist super open fact. It‚Äôs university paper nobody read anyways. spreading disease promoting alcoholism. probably one appropriate thanksgivings ever. *I speed* Vietnam letting people work really tightened requirements also 14 day quarantine arrival. Think like $1500 two weeks hotel supervision etc. 

No community transmission around 60 days think now. yeh man pops gonna live like 105 something, watch. Fox News still never reported fact viral load matters too. would break every narrative they've tried spin, yet probably single important, unreported facet virus. Good luck you.  Best wishes.

I sorry let down! estimate little misleading compare previous quarter like this. U.S. biggest increase history Q3, Q2 worst second-quarter GDP fall worst modern history. Sweden‚Äôs gross domestic product (GDP) tumbled 8.6% second quarter year.

To visualize 

1000 - 50% = 500

500 + 50% = 750

The best way compare historical data, like 2019 Q3 - 2018 Q3 Definitely bizzaro world. It‚Äôs bad covid became political. don‚Äôt know employer could deny what‚Äôs happening. mess.

Wait tell you, thought double blind study? mean even though Australia size United States, near completely empty New Zealand island. understand anything Donald Trump says newsworthy? person stated he'd US election US would soon recover Covid. 

This news, Donald Trump saying things loud.   ""I give really old people pass risky behavior.""

That certainly seems like 'inferred' stated. Chernobyl vaccine North Korea, could politely *ask* instead. workplace like that.

Authoritarianism good handle crisis, crisis over, authoritarianism stay convince people always necessary, that's problem China. world watching dread disbelief.  Yes. New Zealand, Australia actually eliminated virus masks lockdowns. remember early part pandemic, family met regular Sunday dinner ended dying virus. keeps replaying head times. crazy plot twist inadvertently caused dosing error led higher efficacy finding. China's giving North Korea hookup vaccine? Usually help neighbor. Bummer, guess communists support own. mom went get rental car car shop two weeks. 

She sent away told go way closest airport rental cars spoken place nearby cities people traveling. Somebody said go cold

It's amazing effortlessly it. Amazing disturbing way may sound awful pessimistic world watching dread disbelief.

 We.... care, I'm sorry. problems Know? plague?

And even although hope guys stay safe anything stupid. 

Recent years taught lot us that.... guys probably will, mean yous usually wrong thing given opportunity. people think world cares America, world isn‚Äôt watching, get yourself. Lol county 10 active one point summer, college started. Thank you. Take poor person's gold üèÜ Truthfully, people COVID serious deadly even painful go through. see people get covid come fine less less people care. get it, quarantine 10 days, resume lives like NBD is. 

The mindset virus kill would spend last moments locked away loved ones? 

This complete cluster fuck mismanagement levels government. large portion industries cannot shut down. people work jobs risk getting covid co-workers every single day. risk getting covid working ""The Man"" risk getting covid spending time friends family. many raise children grandchildren go school. great uncle aunt raise 3 grandchildren. Children go school already quarantine 3 times far. 

And need keep mind, many deep south Christians, death thing happens. ""If good Lord wants take me, he'll take me"". sentiment parroted firmly believed 99% family members. 

Then people see cases like 74 year old great-aunt smokes cigarettes daily. got covid already sick pneumonia. fine (for is) Thanksgiving dinner rest family. 


The majority south honestly care. majority family already covid kids school co-workers work.

 dad school bus driver drive 2 different busses full kids school home. That's 2 different busses enough drivers children get school. 

The government could done much better job point damage done hope curtailing problem gone. 


Case point, went Thanksgiving. majority family already covid. 18 people, 5 yet (10 count babies). seen family 8 months. what? got anyway still work kids still go school. fairly isolated Nashville got covid work. got well rural family got it. 


And come south whole ""why can't see people"" attitude. largest single employer young, southern men military. used family members gone years time. 



I'm city know collective mentality rural America really give fuck. 

More damage done half-assed government shutdowns restrictions covid south. named one person live one last counties isn‚Äôt worst tier California live casino county business comes town population low cases life death small businesses area. dreading US celebrates Thanksgiving year? least Germany, don‚Äòt see it‚Äòs list things worry about. got enough deal country right now. Drunk alcoholic people need reasoning call Main Character syndrome. No, potentially could power, politicians would put effort ensuring guy charge. Credentials would minimal (or absurd) ensure right person in. Also rules would constrained even politicians would charge. 

What comes politicians give power easily. often split season, half would get infected game. wAiT tWo WeEkS

~this sub, last 10 months Oxford bad vaccine trial received constant good PR real data came whole house cards fell apart. vaccine soon. Really point worrying people's behavior anymore cuz vaccine gonna make lockdowns mask wearing unnecessary. grew US left 2004. I've US since 2012 seen mother person three years. done holidays family already live since 2011.

And yet live. Spooky. coach refused follow team protocols, players. 

A coach unemployed. breathtaking nature. world watches dread disbelief? Doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe world‚Äù coronavirus issues fucking deal with? Lol never, point, expressed joy countries suffer.

In fact think what's going Sweden huge tragedy. sad many people suffer die much could prevented. Rural NH complaining tourists coming since April. apartment buildings Chelsea Lynn cases Coos Carroll county combined act like attack. Guaranteed outbreaks happen going due local spread, tourist. curmudgeons like complain. Meanwhile, go none locals wear masks. Soon *dead* idiots  Fucking idiots Good bot :) suppose windy 40 degrees are, outdoor meal proper spacing safe possible. again, tertiary events involved that.

Did cooking take place outside? everyone stay outside entire time? everyone get there? stops made along way? special shopping trip food?

All contributes spreading disease, current level spread across nation, 'i didnt know it' factor, given number people thanksgiving gathering... huge risk. 

I guarantee numbers go way week two; time problem Christmas. buying guns. Lots them. ü§Ø Ok ratlicker there's news report new cases Taiwan couple weeks, we'll know brought in! made choice drive fly, they've put critical thinking least. Whoa... consider cautious? five sit inside houses two weeks? go work, grocery store, get take out, see literally anyone else two weeks, etc. Yes, mitigate risks, however soon mix households potential exposures added unnecessary risks everyone involved. Politicians caregivers decided long ago playing games easier actually trying fix thing. _Hypernormalization_

So best policy combat pandemic? _Too hard!_ Let's make wearing masks left/liberal/socialist thing see wins disinformation wars.

Rinse repeat.

We definitely need discussions that's impossible can't agree facts are. gotta remember social media works. It‚Äôs small percentage people even comment posts, compared amount users Reddit Thank you! helpful Hahaha Username checks actually got 3 times would medical miracle unicorn doctors would want study. would huge news actually true. Much likely false testing assuming got didn‚Äôt.  Sorry, forgot people like spoilers. bad people tought ""so bad"" summer. Entire civilizations wiped disease. I‚Äôm sure people thinking.

They thinking. They're acting using feelings only.

Take lesson: use head heart make decisions. Ummm didnt massive spike thanksgiving celebrations? I'm United States might left right essentially switched places US American here: Thanksgiving favorite holiday (it's one feels like family primary thing celebrate). family got Zoom short Thanksgiving meetup online. nice, can't deny overall pretty sad day.

I really hope families made similar sacrifices yesterday, doubt it. Hope guys stayed safe yesterday. hunker bunker face cot lot.  Thats heading across US days/weeks totally hospital beds kind. can‚Äôt make baby one month combining efforts 9 people 

That literally comparison points talking man. Frankly i‚Äôm even sure respond that. I‚Äôll ask: example previously successful vaccine results widespread problems 3-5 years years later, reason choosing 3-5 years? I‚Äôm going say answer no, far I‚Äôve found nothing haven‚Äôt produced it. seems arbitrary theoretical, based anything that‚Äôs actually happened. 

Have good one man. hope get vaccine, even wait months (which likely case anyway since I‚Äôm assuming aren‚Äôt EMS worker member designated first groups). 2020 isn‚Äôt yet, don‚Äôt give ideas now. shootings. media showed results shootings graphically, would lot calls restrictions arms.

Like insist lying exaggerating? What‚Äôs end game? try make sound worse is? I‚Äôm genuinely curious keep trying throw lies exaggerations in

And You‚Äôre confusing literal fright gentler form fearmongering you‚Äôre I‚Äôm paramedic regularly transport sick COVID patients around state due lack beds. Last shift stuck back ambulance 1 patient 2.5 hours. never offered test. Amazon offers everything ""need"" survive.
- food
- medicine 

Anything else think ""need"" absolutely bullshit. need go restaurant. need go outside shopping. need car fixed leaving home. need anything.

Everything Amazon hospitals closed point blank period. Amazon PPE 1 warehouse entire states Walmarts combined. simple. grocery stores taking proper precautions care. Literally buddy told come work even confirmed case covid. works tech support offloading trucks correct stops. He's close facility workers inches desk. companies milking every bit left offer.

If shutdown prepared next 10 years covid deaths. 1 vaccine 11 mutations going fix problem. Especially already track mutate multiple times per year. People like reason people lives shambles next 10 years refuse stay home. surprise me. topped 10k couple days last week honestly expecting 2 day total higher even holiday. also backlog presumed positive tests confirming, number 15k. IIRC said expected 75% confirmed. number supposed released separately think.

So yeah, ain't hot here. Anyone surprised racist junkie eric clapton would collaborate formerly relevant science denier doesn‚Äôt understand history, lies. kidding? hospital tests symptoms exposed without PPE. really get tested every 3 days?

wtf? OP mac &amp; cheese around world? freaking love Governor Florida

He basking constituents love then?: love showing humility time around demanding well deserved apology at:  ‚Äú2021 poised make 2020 look like amateur.‚Äù

Oof. ain‚Äôt truth. There's already mass casualties, we're looking 300,000+ deaths New Years. 

That's 100 9/11's. Yes even playing 2019 3500 daily death cancer heart disease. Monster gonna sick 4 years? wife told local members Facebook groups angrily insisted hospitals would *have* continue provide care patients ""against law"" turn patients away *no matter what*. entirely different sun skies folks. Hey, now, need harsh. soybeans, too. Thank good luck too. plan pray China away? I'm bullied family right wearing mask Thanksgiving break. many friends family members visiting other. also friends pressured visiting families. really looking forward holiday season 'm scared feel like crap. would agree. place work testing since first couple months, we're testing twice week. CNA MN nursing home. I'm thankful employer taking seriously reading thread guess taking granted. Florida success story. even close. 6% number actually Science Denier Michigan. disagreement infection rate calculated based numbers data accurate. haven‚Äôt seen family since last Xmas either.

Oh wait, that‚Äôs right, live interstate (north south me) perfectly normal, like year. must special how? always homeless people, suppose never went vacation either? #SIR YES SIR! Glad work hospital mess around like this. readily available tests state offers 80 hours paid covid sick time, believe. exposure intubation like 20 staff members isolate 2 weeks (staff various specialities present came contact them). busy 2 weeks got people picking shifts. People dying. fun job.

And FYI, shut fuck ""freedom."" It'll interesting get them. said 4million Pfizer 2 million Moderna ""between January March"", clear would one go trickled either. 

In case neither terms contracts international priorities companies seem public knowledge, debate seems speculation, hearsay personal bias. Bill bill passed house giving relief everyone yet senate doesn‚Äôt shit it. Explain Pelosi‚Äôs fault again. Lol. Yeah US doctors extensive testing. 

I losing vision, went 6 different doctors/ophthalmologists said ""let's wait 6 months see gets worse"" real significant testing. lot googling symptoms US. Florida's virus cases continue modestly rise, state remains 23 rd place country, average cases deaths per million--The Midwest many states getting killed: North Dakota 101,000/million, South Dakota 88,000 per million(South Dakota equivalent 51,000 Florida cases today) Iowa 70,000/million, Florida 45,600 Evil incarnate Aw that‚Äôs cute! would enough literally everyone age 50 country, good shit  $7,000 week offers? fuck? think people would work matter $7,000 week. I‚Äôve worked humid 110 degree weather sick, suffering food poisoning, broken bones, etc, fraction that. know opioid benzo addicts would come work 12 hour shift withdrawing, measly $65 day, withdrawals hell lot harder deal covid sickness. Sure people *say* don‚Äôt want get contagious risk getting others sick, $7,000 week $7,000 week, people would take offer knowingly work sick infectious even others around got sick. they‚Äôre wearing Hawaii requires test boarding plane...

Unfortunately ppl probably breeding higher rates rest us too. college may lab. know scene that's repeated across country, still find sad many people state unwilling wear masks dutiful seat belt wearers, despite fact literally 13 times (and counting) likely die COVID year IL would car crashes typical year. think act like hyper dork. commenting part good NZ shut travels China, ineffective really was.

Shocking.  disease like perfect revenge libertarians one small, nasty package. could always covid crash course hire bunch starry-eyed volunteers help out. doctor said me: ‚Äòhmm, interested involved medical study?‚Äô

I replied: ‚Äòagain?‚Äô young reduce case numbers/positive rates?

I'm thinking case number could low countries random testing (asymptomatic test), I'm pretty sure there's something unexplained age alone African countries low positive rate also low number cases. that's random testing. I've changed mind. expensive 90% effective vaccine key workers great.

70% good enough cheap enough general public third world.

No one living outdoors. Oh fuck give rest miserable twit.... mother (older higher risk category) tried get us come yesterday even *all* agreed wasnt good idea year. Then, today, asked could come pick Christmas tree. got annoyed reiterated isnt safe, especially considering health. live county highest warning level due confirmed cases. 

She retired nurse know better. It‚Äôs documentary isn‚Äôt it. freaking love Governor Florida, freedom unlike California's governor, Florida's economy rolling along, 7% unemployment rate, California's 11% NYC's unemployment staggering 16% 1000 percent.  So.... Tobias? NFL : 5.5 tests per person. 

That nurse frontline, getting tested, whole staff hospital isn't. 

One problems profit enterprise vs necessary service conservative, right-leaning, point let idiots idiots? cannot legislate stupid people. 
I don‚Äôt know anyone argue guy isn‚Äôt effectively Hitler. Nah, it‚Äôs way good now, sorry. Yes! Please let nightmare end! are. average fellow human cares lot less probably think. much small government America's keeps finding new ways assure pandemic kills many people possible. foolery, ignorance, recklessness strong.

(Before anyone accuses xenophobia I'm American.) Pfizer perhaps defined efficacy differently phase 3 plan, prevention symptomatic infection.   would make easier recruit people get swab nose every week.  all, much fun get swabbed. fact she‚Äôs debt $100k nursing alone obscene, let alone pay cut pandemic.

Your country ass backwards. *former* leading cause death. 

Today, leading cause death absolutely coronavirus. That's pretty crazy figure population Ohio.

 mean, crazy almost population, case even crazy context US. Yeah family I'm nervous them. dad died suddenly last month, surprised COVID least related even active infection time. ""bronchitis"" couple weeks died seemed better besides normal pretty bad asthma. sheriff initially going autopsy backed explanation why. Fair enough, apologies. Read fucking constitution pea brained fool understand lockdown anti american bullshit. symptoms immune response.  ‚ÄúTwo weeks!‚Äù satire? that‚Äôs motto comments subject since started Associated Press, White Earth Red Lake bands Chippewa filed motion Wednesday requesting Minnesota Public Utilities Commission halt construction due COVID-19-related concerns. wrote tend rare. That's case. Either way, ever know vaccination widespread. African Americans built country slavery we're still essential work drive economy low struggling wages. vaccine help. takes several weeks even becomes effective. Bad bot.  Americans: Healthcare expensive means higher GDP.

/s definitely willingness versus resources issue. think root attack truth general distrust anything already conforming ones existing viewpoint. 

In early 90s massive disinformation campaign US Bush Snr administration attempting convince american public socialized healthcare ineffective, using Canada example. Reality lied almost every aspect campaign rhetoric used still hear today ""Long wait times"", ""Bad/Unhappy Doctors"", Exorbitant cost etc. bullshit. 

We need figure effectively convey reality large group people US. basically education. Education socialism communism actually would certainly helpful well. public services privatized. favorite ask 'well healthcare profit policing?' 

No one effectively explain police public service healthcare. careful, though: fat-soluble vitamin, Vitamin dangerous high doses. I‚Äôd probably recommend 2,000 IU per day maximum supplements. Canada hummed hawed way long late getting vaccines Pfizer Moderna summer (per Maclean‚Äôs), refused invest Montreal lab might mRNA capability, they‚Äôve continually lied pushed back predictions vaccine delivery. Federal government fucked man. conservatives would‚Äôve done better per se, Trudeau choked he‚Äôs cautious. 300 million doses vaccines won‚Äôt delivered several months years, us fuck all. Im seeing alot this. federal government dropping ball helping stressing states relying overworked labs testing. guys front lines hospitals clinics lab testing victims incompetent government bet hygiene theater cover asses lawsuits there's outbreak. ""But look, cleaned surfaces every 3 hours jotted here, could done?"" thanks Wait minute... already? I‚Äôve worked many students found online learning heavy independent studying agreeable educational personal needs.

I also worked many not. Guess happens flu cases majority folks wear masks, socially distance, don‚Äôt patronize dine-in restaurants bars, frequently clean common use items surfaces, go it‚Äôs necessary get food household supplies? dramatic drop flu cases occurred Southern Hemisphere neighbors winter season.  high rate probably mostly due employment since African Americans tend overrepresented essential jobs underrepresented jobs worked home. 

So including race may redundant since essential workers high list, know extends 'essential' jobs outside first responders. CDC classifies first responders essential may fact make sense include race decision.  And/or *willfully, obstinately ignorant*, I‚Äôd say worse lacking critical thinking skills desire read (being chin-maskers Uhmrrca). 100% suggested it. can't imagine would implemented enforced, curious there's epidemiological justification thinking way. precedent, matter. took paycut needs quit find new job hospitals paying fucking ass right nurses.... irrational statement. still pissed Kathleen Wynn toileting Liberal Party last election member public Service Union?  almost Florida‚Äôs numbers yesterday today 21M people. you‚Äôre saying said.

Frankly, find line thinking dangerous don‚Äôt want part it. 

I want perfectly clear important, comment indicates afraid vaccines; not. trust mRNA vaccines moment one available line family get it. harshest longest lockdown Europe near least deaths Europe. People sick stage, economy tatters, highest unemployment Europe let elderly protecting nursing homes. 70% deaths nursing homes. fucked years come. nurse, sorta hope deter people going healthcare. career brutal unforgiving.

If still want go healthcare, welcome! Let's suffer together. Forget fines, capital punishment much higher compliance wearing mask. ""There always balance life finances, think harsh balance. consider Sweden's reputation damaged, also effects economy long run. Internationally, people think Sweden chosen successful path"", says Hubert Fromlet.           
Kvartal magazine analyzed Consensus Economics' latest GDP forecasts 2020 number countries, compared number deaths per 1 million inhabitants. figures show economic development Sweden similar rest Nordic region, death toll differs sharply. example, Sweden eleven times deaths per capita Norway. First all, know rare? Stay hospitals kill you. Click discover 10 things doctors want know! really true, mean yes program exists denied 99% teachers tried take advantage program. believe NPR report it.  US spends far money per capita health care. Comparing countries pointless; get money without private side leeching funds. 

Even literally NOTHING else changes, look much money goes insurance companies billing departments hospital. Seriously, keep high end clinics etc - stop paying middleman overbill people they're bankrupt. Also quite difference saying ‚Äúonline schooling trash‚Äù ‚Äúmany students find online schooling difficult.‚Äù thought Pfizer specifically declined accept funding US? sensible thing would give first people A) Covid (duh) 2) encounter lot different people good amount time. Personal care people like barbers masseurs. Lawyers bankers 15-30 minute appointments lots people day. Bus drivers who'll take people around several minutes get off, sharing air supply. Sigh, no. 

The ifr percentages hospitalized based estimates infected. estimates increase, percentages decrease. 

Because 100 million infected, doesn‚Äôt mean people would died hospitalized. numbers static. means percentage infected need hospitalized decrease. #""It's failed strategy""

Lars Calmfors backed Hubert Fromlet, affiliated professor economics Linnaeus University former chief economist Swedbank.          
""It failed strategy, enough look death toll. bit gullible rely people taking responsibility. addition, Sweden's economy developed much better comparable countries.""

Astroturfing 101. think meant vaccine :) anything subreddit taught me, need religion become radicalized.  Yeah power. criticize current leader without supporting opposition. Guess I'd using pto every year lol like since way pandemic. Real answer government (federal, state, whatever) needed step mandate unlimited paid sick leave covid related cases. provide funding companies provide this.

It'd nice companies could, know, actually take care employees instead leaning government handouts prevent wage slave workforce dying. statement true, feel like Trump brought US new low somehow.

Lars Calmfors long questioned Sweden's corona strategy. economics professor repeated criticism seminar last week, according Nyhetsbyr√•n Direkt.         
""As see it, Sweden clearly grossly failed careless strategy, led many deaths,"" said.           
Calmfors referred new study International Monetary Fund, IMF, shows economic effects countries strict closures differ significantly Sweden.            
At time, prolonged spread infection, result soft restrictions, also risks negative effect economy.           
""The closer get vaccine, easier think take costs shorter shutdown."" There's many African American doctors either that's part reason make sure short life spans deception. Yep. work cancer patients. thing here. scary [Google (google translation)           
**The economic development Sweden similar several comparable countries, despite fact stricter shutdowns pandemic.**     
**At time, Swedish death toll significantly higher.**

Thank thorough posting even including archive link.. kudos you! study showing 20% richest became richer pandemic. Basically was

\- Precarious people lost job got stuck exceptional covid part-time 

\- Essential worker keep working lockdown despites risk 

\- White collar stayed home, obviously appartment large enough comfortably 

\- Rich went second home countryside/mountains/beach stuck Paris haven‚Äôt. nurse 14 years numbers would‚Äôve playing hospitals across nation months. Sounds like bit narcissism thrown mix too! mean even today, 2020, don‚Äôt know many people ‚Äúreally‚Äù get infected flu year. It‚Äôs quite possible never learn true numbers virus, either. Masks may reduce transmission rates 22% (but better nothing.) low rate may due noncompliance improper use.

I prefer different approach: want wear masks socially distance follow quarantine guidelines put lowest tier comes time triage COVID patients. first dine restaurants reopen, last shortage ventilators. full disclosure, spelled via warning signs menus, etc. Eternal September lives idea folks can't see family flu. Gimmie fucking break. society left this.

Please remember, doctor kill quicker covid.

Recent studies of¬†medical¬†errors estimated errors may account many 251,000¬†deaths¬†annually United States (U.S)., making¬†medical¬†errors third leading cause death.   US agreed buy $1.2B worth doses vaccine passed FDA approvals. lot countries struck similar deals Pfizer. Kim taking virus seriously. Trump isn't. That's North Korean numbers low US numbers high. Also Trump got covid Kim doesn't. Shittiest pivot yet. Kudos. Good redditor :) agreed me

lol really? news something?

We‚Äôve punished society lockdowns restrictions name greater good; would odd time suddenly take different tack. Probably true. 5 mill country. 121 hospital moment, 328 covid deaths. I've seen reports Governor allowing medical staff North Dakota continue working long they're asymptomatic

This math. potentially life changing infection LOT unknowns lot people legit scared. important show work. 

""JUST GOOGLE IT!"" .. have. think have, ANOTHER reason want prove it. think going hard time finding reputable sources going agree you. 

You could literally save economy solid proof. hospitals work, specifically ICUs. It‚Äôs strange, icu full covid patients, nurses short staffed, overall mess. Then, I‚Äôll sit lobby shoot emails totally empty. stood lobby, would look like everything totally control. 

It‚Äôs disservice American people cannot see critical care units around country look like right now. It‚Äôs sobering. government-run, there's loopholes outs.

Sorry, forgot competent leadership possible. Hey now, us retarded. ones follow Trump ilk. i.e. SARS-COV-2 mutation SARS-COV, far know. last saw SARS-COV 2004 China. first observed SARS-COV-2 Spain 2019. known mutational relationship. Great, sounds like bunch sociopathic morons showing ignorant normal human psychology are. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

If can't comprehend reality, stick heads back precious Bibles. Maybe pray COVID away!

Ohwait, work anything, heart disease (and entire thorough study found prayer worsen survival rates patient knew prayed for) cancer (bye bye Steve Jobs organ donation system bribing two-wasted-organs asshole self) gun violence (former Gov. Bevin)... COVID.

tl;dr: Nobody cares. could use Plastiq, fees really make worth unless hitting minimum spend something tell working healthcare patients run spectrum. people good patients. cooperative appreciative. bad patients absolutely terrible patients. So, believe people getting diagnosed covid denying dying breath? yes 

But, people truly worry ones deny sick healthy enough go home. people listening us tell quarantine going spreading virus? look numbers? It‚Äôs barely worse flu numbers show it. Cases rise, deaths not. know treat virus getting weaker passes along. 

And spending time family yesterday great. fact, since June I‚Äôve traveled many states done many adventures weebs stay home. realize you‚Äôve had?

Especially killing young healthy. ""These results suggest substantial proportion persons infected SARS-CoV-2 might negative serologic test results months following infection. several important implications. Cross-sectional seroprevalence studies estimate number persons infected SARS-CoV-2 likely underestimate incidence proportion previously infected persons likely serorevert thus counted previously infected. addition, results challenge notion using serologic testing results individual level designate previous SARS-CoV-2 infection."" Here‚Äôs ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù downvote fellow American. didn‚Äôt get paid this. It‚Äôs free service provide heartless assholes. You‚Äôre one thinks it‚Äôs okay spread deadly pandemic virus around 8 months. Enough enough everyone happy useless leech social interactions really regrettable even lower efficacy estimate vaccine 62% meets FDA's target. Oh well, AZ's vaccine still godsend developing world give low price storage requirements... society literally hanging scotch tape. would've avoided sane thing lockdown two months. I'm sorry losses. aunt, whatever good may towards children. Holy shit that‚Äôs bad around. people see going around still don‚Äôt care? Sure may kill you, wants spend month hospital bankrupt? Sorry, full.

We going send Granny farm upstate plenty room run play Grannies. we're suffering petty political differences. another stimulus done back September. worst thing parties agree stimulus. 

There's blood people's hands, Americans can't afford work, everybody dying. Definite anxiety here, I'm meds postpartum depression, helping keep emotions level keep obsessing Covid news like back April.

Quit using dead americans nothing fool human shields lmao Yeah there‚Äôs denying plenty pandemics ended without human intervention. There‚Äôs also millions people haven‚Äôt died since early 1900‚Äôs vaccination chosen herd immunity. seems like there‚Äôs enough people camps moment neither perspective likely back down. reenacting giving native americans small pox mean antibody decline normal process. cell mediated immunity matters I'm one compromised immune system?

Or, know, us anti-social see family every major holiday happens, want involuntarily expose beloved family members crippling sometimes deadly viral disease that's spreading country like wildfire event unknowingly carrying it.

It definitely one two things.  Yup. neither getting hit bus bus hits Maybe disagree meaning contain there, see ever going contain something borders open countries different ideas without strict quarantine.

It's true Italy closed bit, June 3 could freely enter Schengen area, you? Even Sweden, certainly *not* following kind elimination policy. people got tired pandemic lockdowns use mask started relive lives close normal could be. peril, apparently, virus still here. tipping point depends contact tracing testing capacity country. real life data, minimal level contact tracing needed contain covid-19 outbreak level F2. paper average number contacts 1 day ranges around 7-8 different countries sample. bit napkin map: conservative estimation, assuming testing relatively accurate (low positive rate, WHO's recommended safe range successful control &lt;5% least 2 weeks) epidemic still early stage (not widespread community transmission like US Europe), absolute minimal number new contacts traced day contain epidemic (new positive cases per day) √ó (7 x 7). higher ballpark would sth like (new positive cases per day) x (8x8) x (estimated number days since infection) x (1 + R0). capacity contact tracers minimal number stricter measures need enacted slow outbreak contact tracers testing catch up. South Korea right now, need enact stricter measures, absolute minimal number people need contact trace per day 500 √ó 7 √ó 7 = 24 500 people per day, higher ballpark 500 √ó 8 x 8 x 5 x (1 + 1) = 320 000 people per day.  limited experience talking friends colleagues ""anti-vaxxers"" cautious/hesitant, happening pretty quickly now. 
Personally think wont first waves get it, even wanted priority essential /health care workers. Im pretty confident whatever vaccine end getting. Again, came coronavirus thread mock laugh people dead family members.

You‚Äôre basically waste life. That's 1,500 people per center per day. 

Wasn't current US plan hit 75% 5 month, something like that? it‚Äôs allows feed kids pay house. sufficient reason you? Many, majority, Americans stayed home avoided family gatherings though. can‚Äôt judge everyone vocal minority proudly (and foolishly) gathered spite warnings.  completely missing point. Staying fuck home, instead traveling Thanksgiving, best way minimize risk. problem zinc hear often, zinc plays role immune system generally, one supplements gets recommended positive data common cold, influenza, name seems limited benefit taken prophylactically.

Schools closed two weeks February... bear mind US Europe thought COVID anything Asia problem. Since two weeks Feb, schools open.

The economy relatively fine. actually layoffs company, quite tough, US company global layoffs staff Taiwan affected. would surprised Taiwanese companies laid staff.

There's virus speak here, there's need deny it. folks complain mask usage, way less US (near-universal mask usage back Feb/Mar main reason virus never spread - direct flights Wuhan, all).

Today, place mandatory wear mask public transport. try get Taipei MRT without mask, staff standing *will* ask put one on. guess could refuse, turn around leave station. also levy $NT15,000 fine, needed (around $500 USD). brain read shooting sprees. Bad brain! We've got enough real shit worry rn without adding it! You‚Äôre dead? banged chick smooched kid day tested positive CHI-VI neither got it. yet walk someone 5 feet away t-shirt face will??

Also since give dam ""world"" thinks guarantee one else world gives one F America. notion ""world watching America"" BS speaks narcissistic liberals think center universe way controlling feeble minded actions. celebrate family ""the world"" mad. Meanwhile world living lives even THINKING America. Even antibodies show up, people still partially immune. Meaning reinfection would require lot larger viral load hit.

My teenager brought home March serious contact positive COVID19 band kid hit hard...came negative.

I've exposed since March, antibodies test 5mos infection came negative. Every suspected contact known COVID19 contact March given sore throat most.

I've feeling infection would years (1-2) would contract IMHO would milder today. do, create panic people crumble panic. country failing this. met family Thanksgiving, that's already see regularly anyway since live close proximity. Korea also banned fishing salt production sea prevent seawater infected virus, NIS told lawmakers""

Lmao what! 

Also indirectly saying NK's fisherman salt people could spreading COVID? To...... Seawater? worry ones deny sick unhealthy enough admitted hospital. fear assholes ones carry like normal spread virus others. assumed back March discussed topic.

That number also high fucking morons like trying downplay virus every turn. 

If people actually took seriously stopped acting like 3% death rate disease readily available cure normal, would even less deaths. shitstorm preventable, many people like exist, are.

LMAO, ""south"" living in? USA. Taking another page playbook across pond, see. wrong. Even nurses test positive working CDC Thanksgiving may increase chance getting spreading COVID-19. Postponing travel staying home best way protect others year.

It‚Äôs due hands since Trump took office. Like still drone/ air support. However usually we‚Äôd troops call fight alongside Afghan forces. much now. Advisors kept saying afghan army able win fight themselves. It‚Äôs still young, new military nearly equipped handle conventional war.

Syria, CENTCOM treated. We‚Äôve special forces train fight alongside FSA Kurdish forces. joint effort, ISIS pushed back capital. battle Raqqah happen projected rather quick ISIS defeat. Instead, Trump announced withdraw without consulting centcom pulled out. battle ended lot longer deadlier. top that, really hurt relations FSA Kurds. know FSA viewed radicals governments. there‚Äôs potential another group trained armed turn us. 

It huge mess unfortunately. There‚Äôs lot stuff done, I‚Äôve never heard anyone served support Trump all. second lowest incidence EU people still able get tested? I‚Äôve 8 tests 3 different states always free. Like y‚Äôall wrong? It‚Äôs vs. nots thing, it‚Äôs search Google closest testing, circle box says symptoms get free test thing. nightmare fuel. either. hospital relaxed points system whatsoever. least we've told of. I've cough congestion entire week, showed work everyday can't afford take quadruple points calling holiday week. penalize us right thing, wonder culture people show work sick.

With said, tested COVID twice negative times, crazy call without worrying losing job. tests done private labs sports? Plus lots teams/ leagues donating money public testing sucks, teachers IL make 2-3 times that. I'm hearing is, let's make fake protests?  like last time. People overreact extreme panic shop buy, isolate society, people forced continue working pandemic increasing exposure. country try moral encouragement people working slowly turn self serving congratulations.

The measures taken prevent exponential growth lower death rate survivors talk everyone reacted.

This sneaky situation people correct thing feel justified efforts everyone reacted correctly also makes people take seriously justified.

The worse part take seriously, catch zero symptoms go spready someone chain dies. consequences far removed person cant see results actions change. Exactly. them? Convenient viewpoint boss, wish could get coughed twice bedside see cavalier feels then. Clearly lot people since make money fans big tv deals lmao live upstate. seen one person wearing mask indoors since May.  part people stand 6ft away shops choose stand outside rather indoor waiting areas. People walking outside busy streets wear masks. I'm sure pockets true experience people taking seriously here.  ‚ÄúTurkey Apocalypse?‚Äù misleading headline. starting worry zombie turkeys! /s carefully worded, intent make sure masks could procured healthcare personnel. read lines, sounded like saying masks effective. way 'chin-diaper' 'neck-guard' entered lexicon, try view paradigm. We're going back late February people- STOP BUYING MASKS! effective preventing general public catching healthcare providers can‚Äôt get care sick patients, puts communities risk! 

His intent say 'don't hoard hospitals need you'. 

But added ""they effective preventing general public catching Coronavirus"" created lot doubt uncertainty. message taken away tweet 'wearing mask pointless' sentiment lasted Fauci recommended them/governors started mandating them. parroted social media weeks comb Coronavirus posts late Feb/Early March see dozens people making argument masks pointless wear them. spawned triades virus n microns wide N95 n+1 microns wide virus would penetrate mask. 

Then bit n95s must ""fit tested"" unfathomably impossible educate public properly fit them.

Three months later everyone making distributing homemade cotton masks, government begging us wear ""face covering"", public opinion masks completely flipped. knew masks effective 1918. 

I'm starting go tangent, insane much time lost early stages thing WHO, Surgeon General, CDC, President sending half-truths conflicting information. we're really can't blame anti-maskers, chin diaper wearers, conapiracy nuts. spent first 4-6 months spoonfed garbage government instead treated like adults. treat someone like toddler, they're going act like toddler. read COVID people? bad enough whole world heavily impacted prevent spreading it. worst pandemic we've past 100 years. Versus vaccines already years research behind them. Yeah trust vaccine. I'm random person internet, I'm summarizing multitudes articles research that's done. really think can't trust anything risk getting COVID less well researched vaccine, nobody going convince you, half America refuses cooperate going drag lot longer needs to.  hospitals done this. hospital created two new categories pandemic leave. get 14 days test positive. also receive 14 days take care positive family member quarantine due exposure positive case household. afford beer regular salaries? nurses hospital workers matter.  I'm defending us

another thing add list things happening. Good luck. I‚Äôm comment, sucks. Point case:

Look celebrity sub group exist 30 years ago: streamers. Today systematically promoted supported bought companies, originally something originally arose organically people simply liked it. first ""streamers"" people recorded hobby passionate it, wanted share world. monetization commercialization aspect came later.

On paper easy imagine world popular streams playing video games unboxing products, horticulturalism, assembling electronics, political deliberation body work would marketed commercialized that's simply prevalent interests viewership are. think pandemic going cause major shortage certain careers. right minds go field basic safety employees ignored, much less fact work dumped expected it. Healthcare person. I‚Äôve confirmed exposed multiple times. never allowed stay home point take test unless became symptomatic. place work get tested anytime, whenever, weekly biweekly monthly. employer treat us better There‚Äôs something called scarcity. don‚Äôt unlimited resources fight disease 99% survival rate. tests need them. get free. panties bundle? There‚Äôs something even better test coming pipeline. There‚Äôs good chance many nurses received vaccine year ended. sitting thought long Well, terrifying... Good. FDA needs analyze data themselves. slower better. Safety first. definitely recall Hogan (MD governor) mentioning back normal first lockdown.

Countrywide terribl, misleading, contradictory messaging this. tested positive yet? mean way is. Lots leagues operating loss or, minimum, dramatic loss profit lack fans, drops tv ratings, test protocols. one favorite forms entertainment, including fantasy football. missing? get tested twice month free insurance, co pay anything every time sign option say insurance case free bring DL social security card. I've never wait 24 hours appointment. places case? state state thing? Turkey real goood 


And cider point General practitioners overpaid, IMHO. 99% scientists scientist, 1% paid USD 500K-5M/year. 

Education mostly automated perhaps exception social interaction aspects.

Nurses temporarily important also automated. ""important"" work needs done, otherwise die, sensor measuring water quality 24/7/365 also important. lot women like work people paid well. 

If want get paid well, figure something excel something everyone hates (for example, imagine working bomb disposal unit makes money someone guarding mall). 

To put everyone's favorite villain perspective:
Jeff Bezos superficially exact thing people (selling books), efficient. Whoever invested Amazon thought added market capitalization Amazon value economy.

Hollywood actors provide value society see. box office returns, measurable, every minute every day people spend entertainment makes society safer threshold. Now, Internet existing, think value actors gone likely technological development might even put Hollywood actors job someday, virtual characters might look better, sound better, act better anything human do. Imagine next Hollywood blockbuster ""actors"" make much average models. look way, Hollywood actors limited amount time make lot money, like athletes. Making decision become athlete often financially sound decision; expected returns low. 

I get tested, need it. However, still think health system sucks, lack pandemic tooling installed. feel like government shown fully incapable handling pandemic shown fully dependent big pharma produce vaccines. would like public outrage level incompetence, going happen, every inhabitant country prefers watch Hollywood actors brain smaller cat.

Pandemic preparedness would cost USD 10,000 per home per decade, I'd guess. politicians would said ""an enormous waste money"", that's easy thing say. Even power hindsight, telling *nothing* going change. Canadians area pay $1,900 quick helicopter flight border Buffalo, drive cars (cars taken border car service) Boggles mind almost US structured really badly right needs progressive reform bring power back workers give everyone affordable health coverage much better standards living. Ugh. know several. tests I've seen $150 lab fee. Luckily insurance company covered maybe college students testing could make money insurance payouts students required get college?
Edit: would $900,000 week testing charge average I've seen. testing options area? Functioning adults get new information adjust view. Idk holding grudge... German virologist Alexander Kekul√© saying Covid-19 originated Northern Italy spread Wuhan. Recall biathalon February Rasen-Antholz, Italy, participants world including China.

# Athletes = $$$$$ diehard fans/donors

Medical Staf =/= $$$$$ diehard fans/Donors sre acting like I'm one following rules? mask, social distance.

Quit pulling idiotic comparisons ass. Leaders need lead example, enlightened need listen political leaders mean people country are. Christ.  final arbiter vaccine's efficacy scientific community, specifically, whether results clear bar get published peer-reviewed journal. Luckily, comes science, hot takes NYT critiques (even they're coming people like Fauci) matter there's rigorous process place weed ""flawed"" studies accurate ones...and I'm pretty sure critics (unlike politicians) back AZN's study actually gets published respectable journal...and doesn't, I'm sure they'll keep working like good scientists do. really get public dismay this. research works... Especially America, people seem live sport. Wooosh. 

The point employers athletes facilitating tests, employers medical personnel not. 

Yes, testing available via weird 3rd party testing sites sign happen get lucky enough get spot maybe you‚Äôll get results might 7-14 days anyway. 

Hospitals tests (duh?) *could* use tests tear staff ensure they‚Äôre sick spreading plague sick/infirm people coming close contact with. they‚Äôre not. 

The NFL, however, is. 

I don‚Äôt know else explain I‚Äôll leave there. Envomask one got comfy. ""Lol you? actively making us richer every day? Obv not"" - rich guys somewhere, probably spend hell lot time wringing hands businesses suffering relative people fucking dying alone miserable pain. government plenty resources help people weather storm concerned lives corporations. 35k, this? teachers need come California. I‚Äôm nurse, perform Covid tests lab. ‚Äúlet‚Äù us cash PTO many people didn‚Äôt use much PTO 2020. shit ton PTO, able use different story. Wait WHAT? thought approving December 10th moving forward vaccination healthcare workers, high risk people, military, law enforcement, fire/rescue, etc next day (December 11th)????? Watch also politicize refuse get vaccine, undermining herd immunity insuring covid stays around.  people complaining pandemic restrictions dragging people follow rules. made excuses day one, excuse nobody put lives hold year, conveniently misses reason gone year put lives hold month. think fair athletes paid ton money generate ton money. think whole problem society unable properly assign value things, say ""when dude throws ball, people stare screen lot, ads screen, earn lots money dude throwing ball"".

That's saying ""the free market take care it"" paying attention. ACTUALLY generating money effectively gullibility, think it, lot cultural political problems rooted advertisement industry negative effect pretty much everyone. Sports funnel it. earns lot money.

In reality, worth dude throws ball well approaches 0, matter slice ball throwing critical, slightly worse ball throwing would good lots people that, would nothing without apparatus around him, that's leave sports often serious issues private lives. Nah, let‚Äôs force COVID unit sleet us go maskless IM lIKe WoMenz PleAse AccEpt MaN ClUb 2 times I've tested outpatient urgent care places. Usually wait several days make appointment took several days get results. also got tested county drive community testing. took week get results. Whole time working Corona patients. Including one caught Corona hospitalized one wearing proper PPE. Never hospital attempt test staff. may recent: large cross-sectional serology study New York City finished around 20% prevalence. 0.33% PFR, implies 1.65% IFR April well-thought-of study nationwide middle summer, averaging 9% prevalence across US. methods may scalable (it seems likely dialysis-needing population would greater prevalence general population, also study ended right middle ""summer"" outbreak), would add around 30 million infections ~July. Getting matching deaths number go hard; could pick something low 140,000 via tested deaths mid-July, high 225,000 excess deaths late one done Chicago. may still it, last numbers saw implied 0.5-0.7% IFR there.

Figuring correct deaths number use studies trivial, especially serology survey done middle outbreak. know seroconversion [happens 1 week infection deaths may spread 2-6 weeks. also know (by comparison countries federal response) US undercounting deaths substantially (excess deaths steady 40% COVID deaths, seem happen exactly almost exclusively COVID outbreaks).

Note average time infection death reporting month (22 days median infection death, 1-2 weeks death reported). we're using deaths estimate infections, timeline infections considerably date.  Colorado AFAIK one place world publish case death counts symptom onset date, allowing easy inference infection date. chart average time infection releasing death public numbers.

The highest possible infection count (through ~1 month ago) could estimated lowest conceivable IFR 0.4% highest possible death tally ~35% deaths now. would give value 90 million range. large estimate possible data pieces quite unlikely though (probably within 95% confidence interval). unheard unappreciated. many think everyone army stand every day. know struggle pain losses.Please know ignored.

There lot silent admirers can. Homeschooling, work-from-home, food deliveries. nature, we're silent. you.  :( Okay money comes people paying watch play. would money go otherwise? Well that‚Äôs lobby everybody vaccinated instead none. need minimum vaccinated efficiency stop pandemic.

I look masks, you, me. [NFL Ten yes colleges spending hundreds thousands COVID tests play football games make millions good investment University taking away anything students. sounds great!!! toddler nothing. another day. Lovely thanksgiving. probably indicate think does. Millions people trying kind responsible least get confirmed negative test traveling/gathering Thanksgiving. uptick demand tests necessarily mean people sick want testing. RN, I'm 100% behind somebody ED checking people's social media accounts get much kleenex. wish could change self-defense laws allow us defend people without masks.


Doesn't seem uniquely american? could fucking shoot them? Ahh yes good old Republican strategy means testing anything beneficial point making unobtainable.

Fuck already. know hospital saying test employees enough tests go around. tested employees start still almost run tests time time.  Letting small numbers people strict quarantine rules luxury countries afford they‚Äôve got virus control. Unfortunately Europe, Americas, parts Asia Oceania basically fuck late. wear mask public due California regulations anyway public spaces. Prefer cloth mask they‚Äôre comfortable face. people really need relax. You‚Äôre trying take away everything alive entails. Quit living fear. You‚Äôre likely die car crash virus (by lot). Live life quit telling people go live you‚Äôre it. refuse wear mask come sick go back line. That‚Äôs totally unfair comparison though.  depression famine weren‚Äôt ‚Äòvoluntarily eating strip meat wrapped around oil-soaked bread‚Äô ‚Äògo forage good strangers don‚Äôt know‚Äô.  direct personal benefit.  advisor also walked situation choice, personal gain.  

People always people.  Compare black market sprung around rationing WWII.  People always selfish, romanticizing necessary hardships example ‚Äògrit younger generation lacking‚Äô seems unnecessarily self-flagellating. Shhh doesn‚Äôt get clicks much ‚Äúthe world mad u all‚Äù

I think shit silly family world they‚Äôve individual (smaller, course) holidays year. find ways safe precautious can‚Äôt stop human. article desperate attention. Right enough go around somebody getting shafted. One things started back March taking regular multivitamin. perfect protection figured get sick would probably help since low vitamin seems make reaction worse. article 4 words: ""Hurr durr, 'Murica bad.""

We know. Sit down. see politicians medical professionals telling us take seriously ... treat like crisis.... people going say ‚Äúfuck it.‚Äù

If Gavin Newsome go Laundry zero attempts social distancing masks, tell people can‚Äôt thanksgiving, people trust government. take hospital beds first, next three weeks, right thing stayed home finally catch it, SOL.

Holy fuck. people spreading lies virus hoax who've risked infecting others around get priority everyone part eventually got infected die.

This pure evil. Waiting Gavin Newsom drop dead time spending time whole group people indoor restaurant recently. country full selfish people making poor decisions:

&amp;#x200B;

Having big rallies political pandemic

BLM protesters gathering huge groups pandemic

Anti-maskers big babies wear piece fabric mouth

People choosing travel Thanksgiving knowing cases rising

&amp;#x200B;

This virus go away lots people vaccinated government media politicized it, people ""us vs. them"" mentality everything virus-related, people care unless directly affected. 

The issue lot people someone dies goes ICU immediate circle, take seriously. says areas took action less economic impact able return normal quicker.

You also ignore reasoning Covid restrictions higher due fact Covid much contagious.

And that's fucks do, take single paragraph context twist match narrative ignoring 99% information. disingenuous tactic. think conflating worldwide, least western-worldwide trends much America.

I'm saying changes overall point entire Western democratic world seeing rise populism, anti-science/anti-authority rhetoric, etc. Sorry mom man. Growing ridiculously close moms side family. died 11, I‚Äôve talked side family maybe 3-4 times 14 years now. It‚Äôs weird knowing really came called mother. 

It takes two relationship, aren‚Äôt reaching visiting, try feel bad. trial vaccine 100% effective stopping severe symptoms hospitalisations. think anyone vulnerable would take that. Oxford vaccine vaccine far indicate stops asymptomatic infection means might benefit taker.  really. Millions people flew drove see family Thanksgiving. huge explosion cases, 3 weeks, deaths. CDC said family friends visiting number one way covid spreading millions people ignored it. expect numbers higher. r/nottheonion Looking several hundred million bottom feeders, heads sand country burns make think. God damn, that's 350 million morons, can't bad lol. Might average, Americans definitely below. bigger problem several generations parents teaching children empathy. parents enough parents end 40% country caring people. 

There's also huge lack education country. Schools overcrowded, underfunded emphasis critical thinking skills. end generations Americans ability look data understand means. Instead, they're educated serious subjects Facebook memes. recipe disaster. #1 reason *hated* Survivor first came out. Backstabbing, plotting, etc etc... world already f'ed enough, glamourize feed millions too. Anthony Fauci Bill Gate creeps!! blunt enough? danger whole world, especially USA. embracing party wants destroy Bill Right, yet quickly use First Ammendment back freedom. Sorry, dude, one censor also censor YOU!!!!! Go Bison! Ok I‚Äôll prep now. Done angry long pandemic lasting, almost never home, always things every single day. every day boring, SUCKS.

Something really helps something look forward know sure happen. Things like vacations, outings, parties, etc. COVID ruined that. main coping mechanism available right now, it‚Äôs exactly need most.

At least bored better going irresponsible, since makes COVID last even longer. States closed borders. Prime Minister (fuckwit is) Federal cronies argued borders reopened. Thankfully State Leaders ignored him. current success Australia thanks great leadership State level - particularly Daniel Andrews team Victoria place world beaten back eliminated second wave. said, can't get cocky, virus wildly infectious could easily escape hotel quarantine system let guard down. people know probably stay home every day. still hope one lifetime event. Perhaps next Thanksgiving fine. different kinds antibody tests choose from? keep reading IgG, IgM, neutralizing antibodies, antibody levels - commercially-available tests measure this?  whatever reason, get less irritated looking traffic pics pictures in-airport traffic ... millions millions people absolutely positively must fly time period?  Families stagger gatherings period weeks, possibly minimize risk? sure minimize spikes ... Hard times make strong men, strong men make easy times. Easy times make weak men. Weak men make hard times. 

The good old USA come full circle restart. rest world approaching different rates. Crazy close america voted president. 


Lol isn't. Americans half retarded. agree woman 100%

In Texas last April/May couldn‚Äôt get covid test unless 4 6 known symptoms, negative flu test matches risk box either traveling country exposed someone ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù positive test 

Meanwhile local sport teams testing players staff every day. Absolutely fucking amazing best messaging. People LOVE hate Fauci dishonest messaging around masks early on.. making right calls. 

It absolutely reasonable need tailor message audience especially apparently selfish childish. advocated lockdown half country would scorch it. message higher chance succesful. find even covid naysayers (as long think fake bbeen better masks) I'm conservative there's nothing dislike told think. goal left alone, folks seem insistent telling feel/should feel things, issues I'm supposed care about. I‚Äôd interested know much uptick compared rest year. Obviously zero air travel isn‚Äôt realistic, airline travel still needs happen. travel baseline like 1M 7x‚Äôd it, that‚Äôs obviously bad. normally 6M people fly, 7M actually pretty good. Harris Ranch, anyone wondering. Google good Lord depressing sight. realize website currently based San Francisco, right?  mean thanksgiving...I don‚Äôt blame them. One day without giving numbers won‚Äôt hurt anything pay fucking horrible Alabama. blame RNs wanting work there. Shit, someone tell $30,000 ""good enough"" salary software engineer there. Bread circuses. staying fuck away everyone xmas. side music, retail ruined that. great creative idea. share u got urs Oh god! point spread! sure defense would entertainment medical expert channel. viewer know. mean whole thread consists comments people‚Äôs motivation watching football so... Probably doubled rate it‚Äôs going, factoring won‚Äôt even see spike yesterday today like 2-3 weeks. Yesterday underreported right holiday, Wednesday 2332 people died US alone. Sorted deaths per million people 9th place worldwide, new daily deaths we‚Äôre #1 double #2.  Oh know. can‚Äôt believe that. Uncle ended hospital 3 days pneumonia sepsis. He‚Äôs fine now. Aunt still Arkansas. Btw. We‚Äôre California. post locked due sexism incivility. think could day dream buy one. would trust absolutely win what's probably going happen.

I trying picture excited winning, think would be. I‚Äôve 2. Feels good did. rest family didn't. felt really sad yesterday. feel pain. fucking sucks Simply appaling. Interesting profound replicated. need work public cannot get tests people like you.

Why? get priority testing?

This seems like system problem anything. Sorta makes worse, means letting permanent residents months months. People literally live 19 year old moved May one main reasons thought overreacting Covid. even said using excuse control her, despite part personality before. I'm 40 everyone (that know) age group taking seriously, older ones younger ones around here. ‚ÄúBut trust family!! It‚Äôs okay!‚Äù Thanksspreading I'm sorry loss. mother law can't say anyone lonely. take precautions daily life blew Thanksgiving. can't go see I'm hoping survive long enough see grandkids (she's 78). NFL team performance soooo vital nation pandemic /s  Dread? Maybe
Disbelief? Naah good know richest, powerful country world ""can't"" anything useful days. alternative apparently everything possible make worse. One good places comparison, then.

I suspect branded shit even ""thank gifts"" get written tax time, maybe single lump sum attached receipts (""employee gifts""?), vs bonus cheques raises require additional paperwork literally every staff member. Still, none misogynistic comments going removed. get hate women. call ""bad decision juice"" nothing Still, none misogynistic comments going removed. get hate women. don‚Äôt caare Still, none misogynistic comments going removed. get hate women. lot responsible bunch shit heads going eat friends hugging ignoring masks. 

I almost point say fuck them. hope get covid. healthcare worker. Still, none misogynistic comments going removed. get hate women. Africa never going hit hard rest world mean age 19.7 years old. Europe 43. Still, none misogynistic comments going removed. get hate women. hides yall ugly faces. Lol, think leader Americans thing.... Idiot. Let tell you, trump make Americans pieces shit, made okay scream cheer shitty things do. Still, none misogynistic comments going removed. get hate women. Nobody really cares think applies boomers able benefit times affordable living good pay. 2 jobs healthcare splitting apartment barely get hope ever owning home. ones go three cruises year corona-cruises.  Yesterday day lowest number new positive tests since beginning November. something celebrate? OMG easy understand business. 

Maybe people want settle businesses currently worried social contract businesses society large. Yeah. Even plague still exists places. vaccines effective looks like they're going be, see anything like current pandemic happening (with virus...) Yet somehow still manage end stupid fuck? rapid tests available every corner RX, rn?? bc cost subsidizing US? really 70% efficacy though. one trial 62% another trial supposedly 90% (it smaller sample 55, knows). know average like that. 

I still think vaccine value seems prevent serious disease. seems like hard sell people two possible effective vaccines, especially developed countries. 

It's mentioned before, give too? people would prefer get effective vaccine could. teachers Trust me, us Americans flabbergasted. Totally agree Well people move back folks roommates obviously virus spread rate infections *slightly* decreased last week. wonder starting reach herd immunity certain places. Either finally starting take virus seriously, honestly doubt case. Nice pick up. Hey, sometimes need rely massive logical fallacy tell good story. also dart tag serial number make sure data collection get mixed subjects. School reopenings largely driven politics, science. find independent critical thoughts, context matters - appears willfully dense context inspired original /s comment. Danish government killed mink, it‚Äôs unclear mutated strain eradicated   exactly!
just two weeks! ‚Äúinoculation size‚Äù? China multiple vaccines though. government pays nothing. money always opportunity cost. much smaller quantities. UK secured 100Million Oxford Vaccine, compared 30 Million Pfizer 5 Million Moderna. AstraZeneca really silver bullet us.

In total we've ordered circa 350 million doses 6 different suppliers. Spread bets say. 9 people Thanksgiving last night.

Each 9 got tested received results day two prior yesterday (was requirement dinner). ""And thus, one ever told John Snow 'winter' *have* mean 'the cold'..."" It‚Äôs weird. measures control virus destroyed career, look data, annoyed/angry get, simply think method used cause lasting damage.

The irrational fear Americans have, less chance going back career is. irrational fear.

I also sibling high school forced switch online person schooling it‚Äôs definitely affected learning. 

Also since part society ‚Äúinfecting someone‚Äù chance isn‚Äôt 100% 0% it‚Äôs somewhere middle. 

But good day. Nurses hospital get tested request it, know exposed. Testing nurses staff free available. 

I know isn‚Äôt case everywhere. it‚Äôs also case medical systems assholes this. 

Everything needs context. Sounds like chapter World War Z. Scary. Even figure accurate, enough end pandemic. COVID natural infection rate 3 (on average, infected person infects 3 more), need ~66% immunity get infection rate 1. Add 75% vaccination natural immunity already established well way erradication.

Besides, easy check ""no"" hypotheical survey. different thing actually refuse vaccine could end global pandemic. bet refusal rate lower think. Right. anything claims covid isn‚Äôt bad deleted, that‚Äôs case.

Doctors scientists come talk virus light suggests ‚Äúmaybe overreacted thing‚Äù get suppressed muted. 

‚ÄúAlso, clear conservative bias‚Äù.

Okay? And? sources liberal bias. don‚Äôt check side once? Whether believe Republican values not, republicans muted every social media platform. 

If liberal party honest nothing hide nature virus, would suppressing people?

The time happened prior election Nazi germany early 1940‚Äôs. 

It‚Äôs time wake up. COVID deaths deaths influenza, isn‚Äôt reported year. 

Again. It‚Äôs time. wake up. 

Clearly, [this doctor conservative studies viruses sells covid-19 testing kits. says it‚Äôs bullshit hoax. Clearly, man lying incentivized reasons. Yeah, totally. 

Wake fuck up. I‚Äôll say again. 

This whole sub *wants* believe COVID horrible virus. whole sub *thrives fear virus.* looking honest work regards nature it, would reason sub exist. 

Funny, true. Face reality. dogma you‚Äôve fed. don‚Äôt care feel conservatives. isn‚Äôt conservatives liberals. It‚Äôs allowing America fall totalitarianism.

The truth come eventually. reason hasn‚Äôt media done phenomenal job lying people it. Truth always prevail. still socialize people husband‚Äôs work outside work hours. It‚Äôs don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs danger they‚Äôre ‚Äúin-group‚Äù, it‚Äôs calculated risk. 

There small group people husband required spend time share space daily basis. one contagious, husband almost certainly exposed work. marginal benefit choosing spend additional hour two people almost nil. 

But benefit comfort mental well-being people outside immediate household socialize substantial. choose take larger benefit. 

If, you, small potential benefit seeing coworker 8 hours instead 10 hours given day valuable benefit social interaction, calculation that‚Äôs fine. people aren‚Äôt stupid making slightly different calculation. It‚Äôs concept behind ‚Äúbubbling‚Äù another household two - small additional risk, large additional benefit. See that's crazy. got flu last year first time. Temp 97.9. I've never registered temperature 99.0 life. Despite episodes sinus infections bronchitis one time appendicitis. sister likely Covid early (NJ anyone really knew going sure) registered mild fever, 100. here. That's sinister shit. Sinister *effective* shit. many reasons spread goes way does. America, tend ‚Äúdo want‚Äù dont like people telling us do, there‚Äôs tons reasons people end catching virus. I‚Äôm seeing lot nurses coming sick time testing backup case they‚Äôre sick. 

It‚Äôs time cancel electives backfill positions non-ER, non-inpatient nurses wherever able. ICU nurses, hand ... there‚Äôs earthly substitute. *We already clapped yall like three times want?!* Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

""Withdawn....due clear need reexamine evidence,""

Underlying causes. mention seniors died (of COVID19) may continued live, may died without virus picture. quantify that? 

You can't tell 12 deaths space *week* *single* nursing home *not* related COVID19. many nursing homes see play out? many deaths small space time? 

Okay. could say underlying illnesses, heart disease, one. COV19 culled people early, quickly, rather allowing rest time Earth, escape fact highly improbable would die 9 month period?

They missed factor equation. Whoever okayed publishing reprimanded sent way. Nasal throat swab. you‚Äôve following along everyone really concerned efficacy coming phase I/II relatively lower antibody levels. went ahead anyways point might well. phase III results really confirm everyone concerned phase II. put data points together it‚Äôs surprising it‚Äôs 60-70% effective.

And issues trials well. Bottom line think approved UK mainly political reasons even can‚Äôt believe someone UK would get real choice mRNA one. US maybe 50/50 chance approval issues would take choice mRNA.

The pricing issue US. government paid doses several billion dollars minuscule compared hundreds billions already invested vaccine programs. Pfizer Moderna vaccines contain *any* active virus. hypothetically impossible get symptoms COVID vaccines. fact, they‚Äôre even recommended people immunocompromised 0% risk infection vaccine itself.

As other, non-virus related issues vaccine? You‚Äôd talk someone knowledgable things. said, Pfizer didn‚Äôt participate White House‚Äôs Project Warp Speed didn‚Äôt want beholden politicians. wanted science drive development vaccine.

Yes, vaccine developed quickly. yet see anything implies significant corners cut, safety concerns brushed aside political reasons. Okay. Betta fish first two years here, passed July. guess could look getting another one! people charge hospitals. Tested covid?? temperature taken crappy thermometer. HUGE difference Part ‚Äújust flu‚Äù folks worthy derision don‚Äôt take flu seriously. flu giant, deadly healthcare problem, believe may agree. go dentist ass hurts?

Ultimately comes basic choice ethics morals. contribute extra 50,000 100,000 people dying holidays kid see grandparents year. Right wrong family made choice together millions families made. best mitigate choice (minimally going out, 8 day isolation), ultimately level interaction important forgo long. Nah brilliant.  build hero's can't ask hazardous pay. Heros grub money. Superman never asked $2 hour raise, he's hero.

It brilliant part management. Yeah, horrible policy. Glad gone now. live Lockdown Heavy, Liberal State. thanksgiving 50+ People, masks social distancing. regularly go large social gatherings nobody where's masks socially distances. AMA! He‚Äôs saying: ‚Äú I‚Äôm sorry don‚Äôt understand essential travel.‚Äù
For sure apology. don‚Äôt understand people always trying compare teachers athletes. Teachers deserve get paid more. Athletes deserve get paid get paid. It‚Äôs competition know things reach sort 'normal'... Well may new policy it'll save money. hope that's always worked, went without never got back I‚Äôm 28, fit healthy, literally zero preexisting conditions. almost 0% chance come close dying Covid. yet I‚Äôm subject restrictions everyone else. 

And isn‚Äôt bigger issue spread? healthy person give someone? I‚Äôm anti-lockdown play side people complicit killing grandmas need stay home. infallible example denial. Ill leave it. zoom much family could nobody practicing cdc guidelines. One grandmas went far offer plane fair December come visit Christmas see 1 month old nobody gotten meet yet. started saying ""I know taking covid stuff seriously but...."". politely declined told nobody would allowed visit settled people start using heads again. sad seen family almost year I'm willing make sacrifices like means worry elderly grandparents families personal well being. Awaiting Onion's story opinion. get tested he's scared might test positive lose work? That's fucking irresponsibly insane selfish !! instead he'd rather risk possibly infecting patients, care givers random people never mind likely means anyone else household well. cases skyrocketing throughout much world, something tells filled dread disbelief people US partaking something might increase infection rates. Yeah didn‚Äôt think actually tried get walk-up test friend doesn‚Äôt speak English well way without letting borrow car. OP county sheriff's department (Which policing many cities area), no. city police departments yes. people including maskless driverse interact think they'd want wear PPE sake nothing else (i.e. actually good masks, departments easily afford) seem prefer show solidarity Trump. Stop dick, attitude loud one hear point you‚Äôre trying make.

I also took virology 2006. don‚Äôt even remember learned coronaviruses though remember living SARS panic caused, said born. much remember classes took 12 years ago?

I took virology 2009 veterinary school, several orders magnitude difficult - wasn‚Äôt much focus coronavirus. remember learning dogs vaccine them, that‚Äôs it. also learned rinderpest smallpox eradicated veterinarians considered frontline defenders zoonotic diseases. 8 years far practice, I‚Äôve seen one case coronavirus doctor confirmed expensive special send test. ended irrelevant patient. I‚Äôve huge degree brushing virology year, past education merely gave deeper broader baseline understanding. 

Coronaviruses ‚Äúrelatively unable‚Äù mutate - even read article? read part three letter deletions? knowledge base understand diseases get worse every species jump mutations? That‚Äôs bird flu swine flu bad. may see rapid, dramatic mutations single person region, however, it‚Äôs like pulling handle genetic slot machine time virus jumps animal due differences genetic code. virus spread across entire globe faster disease ever human history. Different countries spontaneously getting different mutations, spread quickly others. Different mink farms also seeing different genetic variants - cluster 5 one several already found. They‚Äôre little mutation machines, like bats.

The scary stuff happens virus hops back animals people, hence mink situation needs monitored extremely closely - article also explains. Yes, SARS1 scary mutation spike protein mink disappeared spontaneously came, it‚Äôs naive foolish think correlates safety. 

Now think happens farmer gives SARS-2 minks, minks pass among like wildfire abhorrent way housed, give barn cat gives back minks (maybe farm road), minks give back person - sort mutations accumulated? Every species jump mixes genetic data. Denmark already seen single farm two separate SARS2 outbreaks second genetically different first. farmer hopeful surviving flock could breed covid resistant animals second outbreak devastating first. dead cull. They‚Äôve also found 4/5 wild minks Denmark born mink farms (farm minks eat ocean fish, wild eat freshwater fish, difference molecularly identified teeth claws) it‚Äôs safe assume handful mink impacted farms escaped. It‚Äôs unlikely positive mink would - least 30% dead (sometimes way more) within 1-3 days symptoms first observed. Several mink also escaped cull (there‚Äôs video this) there‚Äôs also pictures video overflowing trucks spilling dead, rotting mink along KILOMETERS road (we learned March/April dead bodies infectious morgue attendants, pathologists, body handlers started dying). I‚Äôve seen video farmers put dead minks huge dumpsters shipping containers could close didn‚Äôt fit left extra ones nasty piles open wait gov‚Äôt send trucks pick up. said couldn‚Äôt stop foxes coming get them. Dead minks bubbling mass graves wreaking similar environmental havoc. 3x many minks Denmark humans. 

Let‚Äôs forget states largest mink populations, like Utah Wisconsin, also experiencing catastrophic human outbreaks. Correlation doesn‚Äôt imply causation, definitely worry US mink farmers going bar hopping weekend. God help us anti-maskers. mink versions aren‚Äôt worse, per se, definitely speed mutation process region. haven‚Äôt seen much data/research US minks, worries me. 

See shared without asshole attacking you? want sources shared enough info able google own. say you‚Äôre young expect search engine savvy am. I‚Äôm mood create huge references section you‚Äôre jerk people rudeness uncalled for. Thank god! Stay safe. reading comment presented - making assumptions cuff sarcastic comment. won‚Äôt even admit it‚Äôs Covid take last breaths. Mil would 100% used covid keep husband apart college kid still living house. parents would use control. Important sure exactly we‚Äôre talking about. yeah said pure evil Maybe ask really nicely 1% let us little. think society understand, think society care enough anything it. see sentiment reddit time, still see people talk following celebrities Instagram, pay fortune cable watch sports, X celebrity Z company paid athlete team (I'm saying people you, sentiment shared people this).

As long keep giving attention celebrities, advertisers continue paying fortune know they'll get eyes. ignored celebrities outside movies in, ignored athletes much ignore nurses, followed nurses teachers, bet they'd getting money instead.

In words, people get it, nobody's willing act it. long celebrities athletes followers fans, that's money going accumulate. kind like recycling: people chuck different bin easy, comes actually washing recycling *can* recycled (God forbid) *consuming* less, no, getting done. That's people aware would help problem, people willing act pretend important them. December 20: ""COVID surges UK; lockdowns follow"" guess fault? Im leaning towards exagerration too. 

not say isnt manifesting anywhere, find hard believe large scale problem (relatively speaking course).

its also possible people like us r denial bad might be. that‚Äôs problem here? Yes, family, live middle nowhere, rural area, come Covid. It‚Äôs everywhere. F staff place ig Trust spreads STDs also! 7.7M vs 60k wtf smoking also wonder fact doctor mentioned story named ""Yap Boum""? one making dine-in restaurant pandemic.

You near anyone eat. put simply, stupid people think know everything need learn anything more. Smart intelligent people know know everything something learn, always. Bread circuses keep masses docile. terrible comparison. Society definitely doesn‚Äôt value teachers considering people always trying cut school budgets, teachers spend money school supplies. 

I think it‚Äôs fair athletes get paid ton money considering generate billions dollars extremely limited supply talented athletes.

But doesn‚Äôt take away fact teachers overworked compensated poorly fills joy. making first dish turning good nice feeling. okay? Yup.

In early days admins wouldn‚Äôt supply masks wouldn‚Äôt allow self procurement either, demanded double blind studies prove efficacy.

Had enough anecdotal data Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan eventually make masks mandatory staff patients. realize someone, somewhere pays right? Wealth grow trees. part. wonderful thanksgiving wife daughter. Wishing everyone well. Yes many people antibodies decreasing antibodies think world ending. cells difficult test for. Yeah, husband work retail. go work soon anxious fuck today. don‚Äôt want go. :\ store, last weeks we‚Äôve beating last year‚Äôs numbers significantly. It‚Äôs surreal. also teachers instead 7,000 week make 35,000 year. Teaching US completely free fall rn pretty fucking obvious I'm talking working class americans. Seems you‚Äôre projecting. outdated analogy anyway. Taxable Income Migration maps shown age demographics coming thousands.

That's happens health care privatizated. know feeling. lab processes plasma COVID-19 hyperimmune globulin. asked early pandemic would tested regularly help prevent outbreak. lot vulnerable workers. surprisingly, answer remains no. lab goes down, company's entire plasma testing system. Yet, despite us told we're valuable, give us regular testing even pay someone stand door check temperatures. Tent cities homeless shelters. exist here. Entertainment America's chief export. That's saying within weeks. mean take long. Means could come point timeframe. they're wearing masks, working home, going restaurants etc see huge deal. 0 I'm sure public hospitals hesitant spend public money comparable private entities (sports teams) spending private money.

Government owned entities operate differently private owned entities. statement athletes important nurses, least directly. Let's say care workers' rights others. meant site, right? March: patient it‚Äôll 2 weeks!

May: patient it‚Äôll October!

September: patient it‚Äôll vaccine ready!

November: Actually can‚Äôt trust vaccine patient it‚Äôll 2025! Like said, heart hospital.

Not elective care. guess always assumed testing regularly. 

As regular dude makes sense me. prove covid infection work related? workers comp easily cast doubt thats needed claim denied. may heavily regulated existing agencies lot power, easy take step. Low hanging fruit.   part, can't believe ""dine-in"" restaurant service allowed. risk factor talking someone 20 feet away outdoors start coughing open mouth? comment removed. beside his, know, job. Gotcha. best way react wear masks right? /s Sorry sounds mean guys haven‚Äôt earned right family gatherings. 

In Australia opening state borders months closed, Melbourne came multi-month ‚Äúcan‚Äôt leave house without paperwork‚Äù lockdown, international borders closed since can‚Äôt remember now. We‚Äôre even allowed leave country. Returning citizens must enter mandatory quarantine two weeks military guard tens thousands still stranded overseas. 

And finally, weeks 0 deaths 0 community spread, we‚Äôre allowed Christmas gatherings limited number people. *That‚Äôs* takes earn it. don‚Äôt get decide you‚Äôve done hard yards. staying relatively isolated avoiding air travel definitely safer drive. know criticizing people trying make responsible choices. mom going working home, inviting friends over, wearing masks public etc see big deal driving see family Holy moly. ü§£ It‚Äôs worse that, since half population isn‚Äôt even experiencing tiny bit hardship - wearing mask standing 6 feet apart takes effort doesn‚Äôt represent actual hardship. We‚Äôre world hurt selfish stupid people. see, exaggerating. nurse article was. Sure, definite peaks numbers. defending nurse? travelling nurse get tested income affected. Oh right, sure help stop things getting worse. travelling nurse. Jesus christ. recently went testing us housekeepers hospital month quarterly. here. one us tracing, they're entire department That's ..

You know what's weird though? boss actually smart record season result decisions. he's brainwashed far right politics. plenty like him, educated smart people reactionary extreme. afraid ""communist"" existence rationalise kinds illogical thinking. mental gymnastics astounding, truly. keep mind California pro-active pandemic response. Gov. Newsom even expanded state-funded labs double testing capacity bring prices $25 $30 pop. state done anything like this. We're basically federal government refused do. literally ""if everyone else jumped bridge, would too?""

If Newsom said ""don't litter"" dropped trash ground, would litter too?

If Pelosi said ""drive safely"" flew 120mph freeway, would too?

Are shitty it? Sure. everyone shitty too? 

Who smoothbrains needs see ""leader"" (or do) something they'll objectively sensible thing themselves?

Go whatever want...get covid, die. maybe need lung transplant. cares? Give family. cares? Hope everybody else right thing beds healthcare workers available you. Enjoy $50k bill comes. 

Hypocritical leaders get round clock care + monoclonal antibody treatment free. 

Will you? Agreed. Though BLM unfortunate added risk loud verbalizing people closer quarters longer periods time (at protests, course, all), argument could made *more* risky beach, despite rather disparate media treatment.

That said, last sentence spot on. ....i think missed point.

Using word describe means discredit technique point. know regulations better hairdresser? know get knowledge local health ordinances barber lol Cool, there‚Äôs 263k dead people US, god forbid sit sports out. COVID virus wrote this. Thanks clarification. Viruses fascinating! low level almost biological Lego sets. I've wondered long time, suspect many medical personel got sick early on.. exposed massive doses.. anything back up? Good, severity disease doesn‚Äôt warrant taking away livelihoods citizens. wear mask, social distance, practice good hygiene they‚Äôll alright. surprised racist fuck slowing spread COVID, seems go hand-in-hand drive 6 hours one way PA last July. Went Hershey Park. Wore masks ever got car. Carried hand sanitizer bodies. Made down, park two days, back Covid. Thank you. Another thing left out: governor reduced testing 50% could get results back ‚Äúfaster‚Äù 

Apparently department health said would useful  don't, everyone's believes shit one's dreading it. block anyone whose states coming country absolutely fine live Sweden. article garbage.

No isn't. could switch baby one ethnicity, parents know difference. Send picture tell want live long enough actually conversation child what‚Äôs unwise it, considering quarantine measures place?

Your fundamental mistake thinking decide go Taiwan, instantly transported Taiwanese quarantine. No, first pass airport US, sit airplane sit besides who-knows-who also coming US. traveling next people living country worst covid outbreak. 

To put another way, would much rather board airplane Taiwan go they‚Äôll far safer COVID US

Again, overlook fact get first. Factor in, no. general, anywhere tourist visa middle pandemic unwise. Stay home. Strap cause idiots gonna deny vaccine like ‚Äúwhat thought worked Hurr durr‚Äù state needs take immediate action require journalists licensed know republicans never pass national level. haven‚Äôt stopped watching dread disbelief years lol Cut off. Without consequences they'll actually feel, change. Money clearly effect them. Stop taking risk explain why. Lol yeah - doctors nurses get exhausted taking care idiots - give - helping grocery store workers people like that.

I hear you‚Äôre saying - pretending virus affects deserve stupid. sad part 41%. example: people work vigilant virus. Wearing masks, cleaning spaces constantly, washing hands, staying home. Everything asked us we‚Äôve done. Sure, sucks times everyone safe that‚Äôs matters.

Then co worker comes work finding daughter tested positive virus. people sick. strong weakest link unfortunately honestly infuriates me. So... part Asia, way whatsoever? think whats actually making hard people believe herd immunity strategy seem think bad people. Se Thrustmaster calling us gaslighters. That‚Äôs crazy. would thunk it. country world three peaks number cases. wonder half though.. Wishing work Donny boy. never learned difference words action. world actually really care socially unacceptable reddit. Plenty people real world apathetic support people making decision themselves.

Also European Governments loosing restrictions Christmas period I'd find strange European part world looking disbelief regarding Thanksgiving. Theres uncle sides family gave families, neither side gathering. I'm genuinely bummed also surprised. 7 million people flew Thanksgiving year?! That's terrifying.

No amount comparing years pandemic make seem better. half-dose error still embarrassment Oxford though, think everyone expected them. It‚Äôs 19 day old account lot comments seem responding someone negativity, might possibly try stir arguments like since least 2016. I‚Äôm St Lucie everything packed ever, business apparently booming. work home continue quarantine family. didn‚Äôt go family‚Äôs thanksgiving dinner either people did. People stopped taking virus seriously first two weeks pandemic. Maskholes..

Dont feel dread disbelief. Australia closed borders states, right. happened US think laws. hookers. 

oh wait..., that's wife  back 2018 levels, basically offsetting extremely low mortality 2019.

It's drop, drops months happen while. Anyone didn‚Äôt catch thanksgiving party going say ‚Äúlook, see it‚Äôs safe!‚Äù go Christmas like normal sees real me. Crazy huh? live popular tourist town florida. Walked thanksgiving dinner parents. way back, figured i'd take long way home plaza look lights. packed! turned around, went back block finished walking home. 

anyway, tourists everywhere. 

as stupid. ask necessarily know effective is?

We find effective vaccine mass vaccination. phase 3 trails small give exact results. know Oxford vaccine age bellow 55 90 percent effective including asymptomatic cases. Oxford trail much better monitoring/methodology trials import me. ""for profit"" vaccines ""sales"" oriented methodology opinion. Something keep hearing friends say show caution around work retail ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok don‚Äôt worry, trust you.‚Äù ok thanks trust virus doesn‚Äôt operate based much trust person you‚Äôre hanging with. Typical far-right twat

I know, right wing country actually heavily supports social distancing measures covid. Respected idiots, maybe. way answering offended insulting I'm wondering offensive. 

Just stop, honestly pathetic think tactic work.

The fact responded three seperate times with; 1) weak strawman, 2) pretending like insulted 3) throwing *actual* insult last comment shows weak know arugment is. Ideally would lock looking 3 million vaccinations Jan March. Oxford get approval would change picture significantly, may wait US research data come in. He's mixing IFR CFR. several counties IFR 1%, Italy, UK Ireland. affected elderly, 40% deaths UK first months involving care home residents. IFR initially 1.4%. also improvements medical care. 

The Oxford MRC biostatistics group tracks IFR time, figures suggest IFR 0.52%-0.69%. &amp; Merone (2020) a, long list IFR countries around world, like Spain, Italy reported IFRs 1%.

Meyerowitz-Katz, G. Merone, L., 2020. systematic review meta-analysis published research data COVID-19 infection-fatality rates. medRxiv. Safe say they'll worse now, even. feel like US given information. another country would clear messages broadcast wear mask put hobbies hold order help healthcare workers. WTF watch. would work lol? need study it, common sense. rooting Trump (I zero association USA). Fox News closely related Trump? anti-American propaganda. thread acts like Americans simply case. families ignorant. Seriously.... disrespectful good points think replies kind nitpicking point. There's really 5 major conspiracies go around, know made-up entirely. mean panel approves whether post conductive materials fact-based rather post 5G spreading Covid via chemtrails. Social network platforms already btw.

Further point, people endanger others unbased claims need accept polar opposite beliefs otherwise excluded society. One could argue world let lunatics '20s '30s spread hatred Germany, would avoided one biggest tragedies human history. Ah see. No, usually. talk terms ""occlusion"", i.e. proportion vessel blocked. People vessels heart 50% occluded without noticing. Eventually result symptoms ischaemia, i.e. enough blood oxygen reaching muscle symptoms vary nothing, death.

As long bit blood get vessel symptoms minimal. 

The main danger DVT thrombosis could break cause heart attack stroke don't. literally care people thanksgiving Tons countries position Xmas I'm thinking Olympics might legit cancelled. agree strategy currently slow spread, ""as much possible"". many things could do, like things done rest Scandinavia. certainly seem want slow spread, maybe avoid healthcare system falling apart.

However see emails strategy beginning. lot people think Sweden nothing, that's true. lot, strategy ""to reach hypothetical herd immunity"".  ""The estimated risk infection touching contaminated surface low (less 5 10,000), suggesting fomites play minimal role SARS-CoV-2 community transmission."" 

/r/COVID19/comments/jm18yh/longitudinal_monitoring_of_sarscov2_rna_on/ so. talk intelligent ppl. Sorry person responding discuss intelligently rational arguments without name calling. guess intelligence you? Seems like Drink milk. Yeah far... looking trackrecord related illnesses like SARS MERS, knows might find years long-term effect couldnt know beforehand...

Better safe sorry, much one can... must like human mink Heavy lies crown... Typical.  It‚Äôs baby. It‚Äôs them. live whole life see grandkids, it‚Äôs real loss miss seeing babies.

As trip... what‚Äôs unwise it, considering quarantine measures place? It‚Äôs expensive, it‚Äôs important enough parents they‚Äôre willing pay. parents pose risk Taiwanese people, quarantine measures place pretty ironclad. fact tens thousands, maybe hundreds thousands people (mostly Taiwanese citizens) entered country quarantined caused exactly zero local transmission since March proof that.

As parents themselves, they‚Äôre staying Taiwan 3 months total, they‚Äôll far safer COVID US, plus addition getting spend 2.5 months granddaughter, they‚Äôll able spend time going restaurants, malls, museums, crowds, etc., life &amp; normal Taiwan year. COVID since March, lockdowns, masks required transit. sounds great! made meatloaf stuffing. Food food Sometimes smart people believe they‚Äôre smart decision make could possibly bad one. I've thought too. wonder take account efficacy calculations. would think people severe side affects would probably less risk averse people side affects. EU struck six vaccine deals AFAIK. 

¬∞ AZ deal 300 + additional 150 mill doses
¬∞ Sanofi 300 + 150 mill doses
¬∞ J&amp;J 200 + 200 mill doses
¬∞ Pfizer 200 + 100 mill
¬∞ Moderna 80 + 80 mill
¬∞ Curevac 225 + 180 mill

That means EU already secured 1,965 million doses population almost 448 million. Assuming vaccines need 2 doses per person, bought double doses needed vaccinate entire population. There's enough even without AZ, although doubt case end. miss grapevine. live like 200 miles away could go needed 101. 101 pretty cool whole ""open waterbottles dont explode"" fiasco while. always going town open water bottles look squished.

Its elevation, deal day, live mountains, like sudden incline dearly miss. Ears popping, temperature dropping, waterbottles nearly exploding, shit experience often. exactly thinking. live Europe, I'm getting tired seeing smugness shit going great either. still plenty people pretending pandemic going on. We're lucky major holiday right moment. guarantee going lots hypocrites around world come Christmas holidays. They'll visiting family too. said values all. can't deny that. value don't. way answering offended insulting I'm wondering offensive. said basically adopted meaning Asian views. way recoiling says anything else. ‚ÄúLive free die you‚Äôre it‚Äù. Yes got lot deep ethical problems issues constantly growing growing calls end it. 

I lived couple neighborhoods racetrack Brunswick West. nice harassed assaulted drunken, high race attendees almost every year seeing even corner store get private security night People misunderstand Fauci's role. He's presented infectious diseases expert giving advice, REALLY PR US pandemic policy.

He manage balance two extreme opposites pissing Trump administration keep job.

Don't listen him. I'm saying opposite says, read lines listen medical expert community large. Disney Plus steady revenue stream Pandemic. Buying Fox bad idea. Also remember coming February huge shortage n95 (p2) masks bushfires January. work place sold pandemic, Dec-May pretty much out. would get order pallet, stick near entrance sell within hour. supposed flying, leaders right thing ban flying. outcry guy's actions completely unfair. thing millions Americans doing. one support flying pandemic think shut down. been. right scapegoat individuals. Politicians citizens held standard.  Retail slave here: 

TVs, air fryers, electronics like Beats, surge Switches hilariously good deals. 

Mostly TVs though. people afraid stay home rest go lives, know, like freedom? coronavirus knows related transmit them. #ShittyMedicalAdvice country laugh Americans reasons state Queensland pretty much cases winter without harsh lockdowns too. lucky think were, contagious virus get hard stop. I‚Äôm sure hotter weather makes harder spread, Australians recently seen South Australia, hot doesn‚Äôt stop completely. Anyone spent time Singapore see case numbers would know still become big problem hotter parts world. US still hundreds deaths every day summer. cooked 1 turkey leg everyone immediate family... including baby. corn muffins. certainly smaller risk remaining US next 3 months.

As wrote above, comment proves parents live quite comfortably US, given money already spent go Taiwan. No, safer staying home. give going restaurants, malls, museums, crowds. things people do. correct) assumption Americans travel right now

It correct, otherwise. Stay home countries, friggin' states. Leave planes empty people *really* fly family visit visas.

Same thing, see difference. short-term visa affords almost protections. Fox news shut down, killing people number re-infection statistically zero.

For immunity likely wane time passes.
It will, ""likely"".

There natural herd immunity. historically rare phenomenon. course, vaccines make that.  poor old minority folks dying.  ridiculous someone say business (small big corporations) 18 months emergency funds sitting around *AND* continue pay workers working. lockdown disaster. next door neighbor whole extended family over. Oh boy. sister works hospital food service, cafeteria running food patient rooms. ""COVID bous"" got 10$ coupon to....the cafeteria....that working COVID running food COVID rooms. Granted, food service equal nurse doctor, huge slap face. Especially since forgotten department therefore kept loop protocols latest COVID information. country healthcare organisations arent allowed make profit. government subsidised. Long live socialism guess. strategy. graph presented yesterday predicting remission mid-december makes think they're still herd immunity. Oh misread comment thought said already selling vaccine Brazil. correct, Sinovac selling vaccine Brazil, applied yet gets go regulation agency.  People Reddit hesitate speak things know nothing about, insane. 

How many businesses happen 18 month supply emergency cash laying around? Practically none. anything, would stupid business practice take 2/3 money invest expand business. article addresses lack data, evidence showing treatment actually works. ""Men really pathetic days."" Sums world view one solid statement. Man-hating solid way sexist misandrist. Try consider irony title one post has. article even mentions women previously chosen go fields that, essential cases, due outbreak closed prevent spread. Meanwhile men gone fields closed, atleast I've heard people know Canada. who's carrying bigger burden? woman who's earning less, gets spend time kids lower risk getting infected virus? man who's earning more, spends less time kids higher chance getting infected due working? genders carrying massive burden, since LITERALLY EVERYONE CARRYING FUCKING BURDEN RIGHT NOW, GLOBAL FUCKING PANDEMIC FUCKING MORONS. STOP TRYING GO ""HURR DURR SEX WORSE/BETTER"", helping anyone. Yeah, kind articles basically useless. could least bothered link video Trump's address. Tbf depends size clot, single clot thumb likely pretty tiny likely disintegrate without causing problems. always seems case. Wow college debt year mention even get shipped hospital hundred miles away... that's lost time adequate care. mention enormous bullshit ""out network"" billing subjected happens. Ah. SIL husband live Taipei. impressed entire time response CV. living Egypt moved Taiwan, luckily relative beginning. 2 week quarantine, got call check didn‚Äôt answer phone reason, showed door. playing around. Reddit seriously knows absolutely nothing business - FINE way ya'll insist speaking things know anything insane. 

Businesses meant year's worth money hand emergencies. would awful business practice use half money expand grow business. think likely number thought 'safer' drive instead fly. It'll difficult enumerate those. I'm hopeful well many avoided travelling.

I mean, they'll pull highway data see uptick weekend. method use flights. Shut fuck Diaper mad internet won‚Äôt believe Seems like guy shaping sacrificial lamb fuel US media's tokenism limit attending games residents Japan countries pandemic control (i.e. Taiwan, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, China, hopefully South Korea time). Since countries relatively prosperous (save Vietnam maybe), enough spectators fill seats stadia halls. reason read close like close window. thought legit telling close aunt uncle like browser window, ending existence. hate he's unreliable idea statement trustworthy used car salesman making claims car he's selling. Reuters say anything else explaining facts might back statement known pathological liar. could say happened mom, treating seriously enough caught influenza, even though sister doctor caught herself. thought Covid 19, make better. roommate relative works popular bakery told us $10k sales Wednesday year last. Maybe little different gas sales people don‚Äôt buy 8 pies small household gatherings. Excuses still come thick fast. Island low population popular choices. I‚Äôm taking though vaccine shipments moved place last-mile delivery approval sent final destination storage approved. Maybe blatant lie POTUS misleading. lol nah. People cry [politics] anytime lockdowns get floated. Oh, yes indeed. yeah, Trump cross Potomac march DC army? natural selection work, let thing, planet better off. Finnish living city Tampere, must say claiming ""Only essential business allowed open"" Finland moment complete misinformation. 95 percent mask usage sounds extremely hard believe, too.

Where get information anyway? 


I know guy trolling what, believe says. tiny bit it? I'm sure reach top spark wonderful discussion low standard OECD reports. pandemic 10% people fuck things everyone. Taiwan isn‚Äôt issuing tourist visas now. 90 day visas arrival, one got 2018, suspended. So, parents applied for, granted, 90 day family visit visas. Imagine upset someone across planet eating turkey family.

It someone. millions people. Potentially spreading virus efforts made keep contained.

Remember, whole thing started one person eating bat across planet.. can't trivialize making seem ridiculous people worried happening parts world. agree completely. (or used be, sure anymore) extremely social person. Forming maintaining relationships people literally important thing life. I‚Äôve invested lot time energy social life

Agree 100%

At point NEED end date. Even another 6 months, need see clear light end tunnel. half-assed ""wear mask see friend park"" I'm talking real social interaction. I‚Äôm waiting ‚ÄúAyurveda‚Äù crowd turn up. news, sun came morning. surprise: states fewest restrictions run GOP. keep everything open sake 'freedom' economy workers dropping like flies? Yeah, even accelerated schedule fluke avoided. Still, long full Phase 3 data demonstrate safety effectivity run additional trial clear things up, see problem it. Remember--do allow bosses mistreat using covid excuse. heroes, workers; labor properly compensated. Yeah honestly sounds like horrible person overall blockade giving us Eucalyptus trees. lot virus subs give ""wanting socialize means selfish understand big picture screw feelings"" vibe

Because socialize pandemic either lot Taiwanese people live US. Since start pandemic, many thousands Taiwanese, perhaps tens thousands, returned Taiwan US. They‚Äôve done safely, they‚Äôve done planes airports. Sure risk, looking data, it‚Äôs small risk, certainly smaller risk remaining US next 3 months.

I‚Äôve made ‚Äúfundamental mistake.‚Äù You‚Äôve made mistake: you‚Äôve jumped conclusion based (otherwise correct) assumption Americans travel right now, you‚Äôve thought parents‚Äô situation specifically. have. great length.

They visiting Taiwan tourist visas. Taiwan isn‚Äôt issuing tourist visas. They‚Äôre family visit visas. family's Sri Lankan us without supplements sit 20s Vitamin levels (minimum normal 50 lab use Australia).

Scaring shit me, ultrasound scheduled tomorrow blood clot thumb (not DVT), first thought torn ligament. Everything I've told breaks 'entirely' time. talk damaging headlines/articles like push onto average American?

Agreed. I've seen friends &amp; family react headlines like -- March/April reacted fear fully believed articles. Now? know like dozen people COVID completely fine. 1 got seriously sick elderly aunt preexisting conditions. thought shown treatment improve mortality rates? know people went drove camped cross country van Thanksgiving avoid airlines visit parents. think you‚Äôre careful enough keep total number people gathered low it‚Äôs fine. basically quarantined van middle national parks two weeks anyway. possible delete paywall message HTML? bypass message covering text since using adblock I‚Äôm holed bedroom couldn‚Äôt get husband let stay home without huge fight. in-laws extended family coming going. masks. 
At least get self isolate uncomfortable bedroom. Yay. many things could do, like things done rest Scandinavia.

We try. forced go current strategy TTI (or alternative 2 mail). Some, many regions went back summer cases low - ambition. big community spread approach fruitful. 

The mail states we'll accept spread exist, Anders replying two would work sweden currently large 'silent' (or, hitherto unknown) spread community. Maybe r/coronavirus, r/usa. can‚Äôt believe would risk it! isolating home 14 days flying make sure test negative! It‚Äôs nice making effort come though.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday delivery coronavirus vaccine would begin next week week after.

Speaking U.S. troops overseas via video link mark Thanksgiving holiday, Trump said vaccine would initially send front-line workers, medical personnel senior citizens. predict americans chuck tantrum months rest world open travel.. except americans. Yeah don‚Äôt understand people think this. roommate wouldn‚Äôt go bf yesterday hang family covid. visit college age kids? don‚Äôt get it. people saying people idiots also idiots. makes lot idiots I'm sorry, condolences. We've reasonable response somehow Alabama fucking lower gov responses. long feds get paid gravy go, wondering naturopaths going start cashing virus. people saying people idiots also idiots. makes lot idiots Yeah could also catch coronavirus scared 12 hour headache. Well half right. enough talk 6 ft enough. Aerosols reach much 6 ft indoors poorly ventilated area. watch disbelief all.Nothing surprises us more. look comment thread above, un-/misinformed people arguing things mean B. Every County least one vaccination center, yet people arguing wil take ages properly informed dont want inform themselves. sub sucks! Except 25% population plan refuse vaccine confirms theory. People pissed West Brunswick Cup day likely races, they've probably BBQ day pissing home couple mates.
I live much closer Flemington really problem around here.
I agree animal welfare issues way. There's lot stories healthcare folks quitting. can't blame them. live tiny city France, first wave hit hard plenty ""strangers"" coming everywhere acting holiday. piss us rural regions hospital beds holidays walking around camera strapped around neck. 

And like strangers anyhow. make reason, not.

 *lights pitchfork* others news, Americans still thinks they're centre world really, happens USA due covid affect rest world. Stop thinking center it. stayed Taipei 2018 10 days. get visa length stay? vote DeSantis neither Broward County. level stupid guy displays everyday, impressive. man wise words. US aiming 9/11 fucking day lmao? updated motto saw another post ‚ÄúLive Free Die.‚Äù Testing took long nobody expected 95 percent effective vaccine. treatments largely waste time well ...moniclonals jazz.

We're close end U.S. Europe. Another 3 months  didn‚Äôt attack person. I‚Äôm defending bad information. called trying claim legitimate information actually false. calling trying spread misinformation ‚Äúpersonal attack‚Äù, sure, guess attacked you. truth cannot give good, well-researched, credible sources disprove information. really embarrassing yourself. Welp, gotta rely 2 Vaccines next months J&amp;J approved. Certainly fact red areas almost hospitals ship cases hospitals nothing this. Covid killed 259 K USA year. Drunk driving kills 15K year USA.  Oh god you‚Äôre back üôÑ I‚Äôm honestly sure concentrate solely Tik Tok Facebook ignore literally everything else. I‚Äôd argue Reddit smidge better 4Chan. allowing subreddits like JailBait FatPeopleHate long did, allowing the_donald thrive much fucking longer able organize create site quarantined. Hell, don‚Äôt even want know shady ass subreddits site.

Tik Tok Facebook act like social media platform, even one. show want see, like here. sell information highest bidder, like here. People seek crazy conspiracy theories, right wing politics, et cetera going see things. Social media platforms responsibility ensure algorithm building show people want see catered interests, also keeping news factual without alternative fact bullshit.

But yeah, fAcE-TOk bAd! I'm working bank EU I'm coming back office anymore like before... get rid table turning offices smart / coworking working place. people come office least 4 days per month shared table. Actually I'm totally fine this. Civilization two meals twenty-four hours away barbarism.  Smokeshow got better! Sinovac (China) basically level those, maybe little behind. J&amp;J, said, probably Gamaleya (Russia) next ones. think cashback airline miles they'll getting! understanding history realizing happens waves terrifying. 

Seeing waves rising watching start crest current time terrifying even moreso. Well wouldn‚Äôt high stopped testing /s People really saw REDPILL university didn‚Äôt immediately discredit it. That's kind think

By time improved tests ready deployment vaccination ended pandemic reduced threat much testing rarely done unless someone hospitalized they're confirming treat 

So they'll competing shrinking market Gotta justify billion dollar stadium answer multifactorial 


Risk interaction product several factors.  


Local prevalence impacts likelihood interaction someone infected. - local numbers spiked 9 cases per day region 200k, time prevalence 1/2 that. 


Viral load person interacting - anticipated generally higher patients interact healthcare setting, lower asymptomatic minimally symptomatic community, ultimately impossible know. 


Nature interaction - includes time, distance separation, type activity involved. grocery store near people brief moments, generally distance etc. Meanwhile restaurant unmasked, longer interactions, shorter distances etc. Things like singing, yelling, cardio exercise etc higher risk well. 


The degree protection provided mask going impacted quality mask (filtration fit), appropriate use (covering nose mouth, safe handling, storage sanitation). ""better"" mask, appropriately fitted (outside HCWs many people n95 fit test identify appropriate maske face shape?), reused excessively, handled inappropriately (cross contaminating inside outside etc) defeats benefit entirely. Even moreso using mask justification prolonged otherwise high risk interactions. lot underlying thought process behind initial reluctance outright recommend masks general use. 


Regarding fabric masks... multiple studies suggesting 2-3 ply tightly woven fabric masks provide near surgical mask level protection. Certainly could used surgical n95 masks hospital misuse sets bad public health example (suggesting dont acknowledge benefits fabric) impact supply. 


While n95 appropriate aerosol generating procedure close range high risk patient (ex. known covid positive respiratory failure), standard care hospital work, certainly brief grocery store interaction. note, physician ER department caught covid despite use surgical masks patient interactions recommendations use fabric outside hospital. 

I wear n95s outside hospital unable distance (a trip remote northern community provide medical care) even though beyond general guidelines, generally reserved intubations resuscitations known possible covid patients. 

 
Ultimately risk exists continuum probabilities. Would safer unlimited supply n95s used one per day? Potentially. may also caught circumstance wearing goggles, removing PPE. unwise place absolute trust single piece PPE, certainly use rationalization high risk behaviours. 


People high risk things good outcomes, people low risk things bad outcomes... common recurring theme medicine, reminder recommendations population level fully describe observations individual. saying high-level employees get bonus matter what? might leave? current system rewards greed hard work. accountability. Scrooge things. headlines seriously fucking clickbait fucking insane. Shame. worst part people read headline too. Good memory I‚Äôm TN. loathe Bill Lee. likely. still thousands Aussie trying back in. still cap international arrivals. comparing Germany, one efficient countries world, rest world. Yes, group's always equal size. maybe 62/5000 placebo group got Covid 38/20000 vaccine group got it. need data truly know.  think might favorite technically correct headline 2020 anyway. Ah, see. So, it‚Äôs latest flavor pseudo-science. Yuck wearing correctly. I‚Äôve lost count many noses see. Yeah, that's argument he's making. He's saying entire concept surveying people intentions meaningless, stupid. Good. rest world. Good It‚Äôll probably take happen though. office/retail leases 5-10 years long basing she‚Äôs liberal on? COVID anything political affiliation? idiots everywhere parties. Look Dakotas. 

Stop politicization nonsense. It‚Äôs stupid makes look dumb. probably lots countries allow enter without quarantine vaccine comes out. Even now, Canadian there‚Äôs number countries I‚Äôm allowed enter without quarantine, vaccine comes show proof vaccinated, countries large tourism industries want tourists back. 

There countries still restrict outright ban tourists I‚Äôm sure lots options go :) Democrats universal healthcare platform. That's least step Republicans. thing 55? 90% africa 55 half full dose immunate whole africa 4.5 dollars person. fluke feature. CDC calling ""unusually low"" season. There's depth numbers That's nonsense. (confirmed) cases re-infection low there's temporary immunity lasted yet cases. informed subject? Depends ridiculous movie assertions are. Likely fine, freedom speech clearly unlimited. billionaires fill bank accounts. see lowest class fall conspiracies, rights taken away well jobs people top profiting suffering. Billionaires hung drawn quartered, well every single person government. wonder long people accept oppression we've experiencing LONG pandemic even thing. We're played fool, they're successfully dividing conquering us, like around world. Fuck republican democrat, conservative vs Labour we're bloody humans we're played fools.

In UK government genuinely given billions friends disguise PPE, millions unemployed taken bloody footballer raise money feed CHILDREN. live CT too, lots houses around big thanksgiving parties cars lined streets. well state it‚Äôs going shit. Even restaurant work doesn‚Äôt follow correct protocols, know people go work even though exposed/sick (as long aren‚Äôt showing symptoms, must go) even don‚Äôt get paid time off. Shady stuff going around here, it‚Äôs going bad winter allow idiots wear masks (keeping well away them), provided sign waiver get little tattoo risk saying forgoing treatment become ill. 
They're traitors deserve die point. healthcare workers deserve take care murderous lemmings. Vaccines take years normal circumstances entire planet petri dish data take long trials gather enough information draw conclusions 

Also lack funding often stalls process. 

Neither issue Oh wow. Wow. idea even say that. must incredibly frustrating statement hear someone. TLDR: US general public starting April, shortages End June  depends state, even county. tons anti-vaxxers positivity could remain double digits right next fall. Remember we're China can't force anyone take vaccine. consolation end next summer many entertainment venues open public, provide proof vaccination phone. Well, unless already insanely wealthy. sucks daily. went Baylor. liberal got there, even time graduated. lame personal attacks trying defend bad information. little turd. Like reddit gross Well hide education either. one occasion joked bad student. delay vaccine another 3 months? look graphs, they‚Äôve sorts flatlined new cases per day, literally many people immunity it‚Äôs slowing spread virus. 10% confirmed positive, true rate probably 30-50%

ND literally herd immunity Seriously, someone wrote ‚Äúbreast milk‚Äù first thing thought Homelander? know like worlds people drank show... lol Well obviously perfect world one would get it. higher case count currently means percentage people adversely effected lower thought, people level immunity shit hits fan winter. Previous epidemics never made Europe. SARS MERS cried wolf guess.

2020 hindsight bitterly ironic adage. failed state looks like. Soldiers, especially medics, corpsmen etc also test public distribute vaccinations addition regular medical aid. units essentially (fifth, sixth, seventh line) front line medical workers times great need. share charges people 90 dollars ibuprofen  Lost good friend üòê offer apparently negativity. also believes chart brain frequency correlate particular mood. It‚Äôs better nothing Correct. long enough timeline, money go Jeff Bezos, spend it. way, economy great shape. Here, sources: God gene? consider 2019 way ""active"" year. lot possibilities die, wanna put way. 2020 people staying inside careful, yet still many deaths. Well, said ‚Äúuneducated‚Äù ‚Äúunintelligent‚Äù. believe least people would much dark increased access accessible, affordable, educational options order general know-how critical thinking skills. dealt with, activism useless U.S. could learn AUS. Vietnam made fake news illegal social media start plandemic well Exactly. It‚Äôs really unless happens *them* personally. It‚Äôs dangerous. Jesus Christ you‚Äôve really got backwards, many Democrats name come Covid? 100 got covid, 38 vaccine group... impossible happened chance? 

if challenging trials, sure way im impressed :/ Amazon really can‚Äôt good peoples eyes they? 2400 Americans died yesterday, friend. CDC says something like 8 missing every one caught, yes hundreds thousands missed. Many asymptomatic many refuse get tested. Lol Clearly not. many people still dying long term effects. yeah COUGH I'm fat buy 2 seats COUGH pain COUGH gain damn hoax remember shithole longer Low-level employees pay price easily replaceable leverage.

As someone whose annual compensation roughly 60/40 base/bonus, annual bonus checks come due would mass revolt entire department would start sending resumes. tested beforehand :/

If 60 degrees take party outside can. That's best hope point. Real life must terrible movie lasts decades watch can't much script pretty attractive next years! downside, course, live North Dakota. think companies outsourcing jobs know anyone home big issue. stopping instead hiring cheaper foreign laborers? authoritarian right wants dumber disconnected population.

The biggest problem see used indiscriminately end-user products without informing possible dangers, manufacturers shield behind studies 'proving' bisphenols concern due little one exposed to. Knowing safe alternatives.

I'd say bullshit argument, leave everyone decide would choose exposed possibly toxic compound, choose exposed all. hard come conclussion uh.

What could irrelevant.



This whole story seems revolve around ignoring deadly pandemic, mysteriously disappeared yet, supposed plandemic hoax, somehow made way crisis actor lame duck 1600 Pennsylvania Ave fly hospital three days receive special treatment 2-3 dozen members White House medical team provide.


Yeah, lets ignore happened pretend people's loved ones cautious.


I guess conspiracy must ""Reasons!""  now. really want get started, play Science Vs. Podcast October 2019 pandemics... guest Dr. Fauci describes near exact metrics Covid worst nightmare. 

I'm surprised seen conspiracies stating knew released yet. blows mind states think changes implemented covid temporary. North Dakota fucked comes post covid world. 

Think this: rest country shifted work home, anti-covid states still workers going offices working home. means rest country, including major multinational firms save millions cancelling leases unused office space shift hoteling model post-covid, North Dacovid anti-corona action states continue businesses waste money offices; automatically makes state less competitive long run. 

The failure adapt new work home model, among cost saving measures, pushing anti-covid rhetoric cripple many areas nightmare over. vaccines stored like -30 degrees something. less. forget pretty low transportation logistics going present serious concerns lot parts world. Astrazeneca one guess stored much higher temps, relatively speaking. think closer 0C two. Yep, masks work, people nuts, do? 

I've saying government going pass manditory mask order, allow store employees ability enforce protect themselves. 

I.e. given something like tazer threatened, need remove someone store. Probably independent delivery contractors. Think get paid deliver date X. entirely sure, anyone Amazon driver? mean, lack data ‚Äúeffective‚Äù vaccine would extremely concerning, don‚Äôt think?

I guarantee Chinese government claim vaccine highly effective provide data back up. Feel free quote this. might true, demonstrating point. opposite incentive? like use metaphor carrot stick, carrot incentive stick punishment. incentive doesn‚Äôt work, receive stick? food thought day thanks. Taiwan didn‚Äôt lockdown. Look succeeded. fair, lot could Nick Saban. Oh damn, right. Completely forgot NFC East complete ass one getting 4 seed matter what.

Just weird year been, they'll probably pull 2010 Seattle 2014 Carolina actually win wild card matchup. indoors? Yes. Oh sure. I'm saying currently seems like atleast stays outskirts part executive branch. American here... many believe they‚Äôre lying numbers things like US everywhere.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Republicans: mean ship people died on? Florida actors parades, rides. Ah depends, odds viral load URT bay way lesser symptomatic vaccinated, you‚Äôd contagious way shorter period time.

Also data asymptomatic (NOT presymptomstic) people inefficient spreaders, various sources now. governor smarter two Dakota governor‚Äôs - South Dakota stone cold idiot idiot office. can‚Äôt tell sarcasm support blm not. üòÜ Yep. come go fever. Breathing issues. Seems subsided now. know COVID maybe chest infection, due lack testing looks like wont finding sure anytime soon.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Unless go hospital fever subsided, doubt see now, actually I'd rather anyway!

Thanks. $500M literally 0.3% net worth (I math).

For normal person net worth around $97k. would like normal person giving away $300, person also living expenses (food, rent, etc.) amounted $0.01 per year.  Well Hiroshima Nagasaki saw much 226,000 die... disinformation might rival Covid alone... It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs one big contiguous system. could totally beyond capacity Milwaukee open beds LA. It‚Äôs like spring could send medical personnel around easily. It‚Äôs hitting everywhere pretty hard right now. Sure, balance this, focusing actions got covid can: 


A) make people things feel safer perhaps - could lead testing, increased number duration ""lower risk"" interactions 
B) make people got covid feel ashamed whether things - might lead resisting contact tracing stigma related reporting 


C) unless contact tracing individual, seems poor use resources go socials like this, bit circlejerk say ""yah done XYZ, thats got it"" 


 
I want assumed people ""must have"" done something bad get covid. Perhaps guy careless, perhaps denier, fixation blaming actions outcome seems problematic. original comment result multiple occassions observing perhaps entirely specific individual. im pretty u cant that, otherwise company would make placebo group 50000 vaccine group 5 patients state noone got covid...

if u post percentage-number u assume groups size. Yeah person sidewalk browsing reddit, failed look left, right, left. sorry I'm sure saying wife's office.

My wife retired Ob/Gyn Surgeon. used manage office. I'm glad we're retired. 

I basic numbers.

- Berlin pop 3.6 million plan 25% vaccinations, 900 thousand people. 
- 900 thousand jabs 90 days is, 10 thousand per day.
- 10 thousand spread 6 centers 1.7 thousand per center per day, working 7 days per week.
- Scale 83 million population Germany? Good luck that.

On top that? manufacturer already actually producing 10 thousand usable vaccines per day, Berlin.

Germany years away vaccinated population, time support neighboring countries. 

Don't get wrong, think that's best interests too. long BER take? one problems today's media conflate rule exception. Imagine Trump would say sky green. Instead simply rebuking (""does look green you??""), media would gather couple talking heads sides political spectrum scientists conclude sky *usually* green, *can* unusual circumstances parts sky may appear green people, technically speaking, Trump's statement *completely* false. people hear is: Trump said truth, guys, talk much. 

Our desire scientific political nuance abused deflate notions truth falsehood mean nothing anymore. Leaders lead. cannot ask someone prepared yourself. care political affiliation is, guy needs ass kicked curb ASAP. Rules plebs, poor, universal. think Dr Henry worried delayed implementing mandatory mask policy. belligerent people don‚Äôt think responsibility protect fellow citizens global pandemic public health crisis. don‚Äôt maths many deaths South Dakota would based NZ numbers. You‚Äôll cry. States control public education via constitution (10th amendment). legally that? Shut Fox News think lot. Social media like putting everyone together room giving everyone megaphone. way get people quiet either feel good feel good stories, saying something completely insane can‚Äôt ignore it. Factor Poe‚Äôs law vile concoction think I'm suggesting wrong, link that? People expecting 50-70 percent effective vaccine thinking like flu. 70 percent effective vaccine, looking fall 2021 spring 2022 end pandemic. 95 percent, looking June July 2021 new normal, masking July 4th unless traveling internationally they‚Äôre terrible. Maybe 7-3 3-7. Cmon. working evidenced Germany. Everything closed work, school, stores cases really going down. people like me? What's motivation? ideological drive? forces manipulating me? redeem myself? Ok gotta ask guys anti mask movement going all?

Like people making vaccines doctors researchers infectious diseases not. find infuriating r/conservatives board attacking South Dakota nurse thing one ""journalist"" immediately verify story entire covid narrative must fake news dismissed. people get sick possibly die take covid seriously take precautions need laid Trump's feet.

Guys, we're human here. We're like different. Truthfully, enterprise run humans going meet problems humans humans think act like humans. Everyone struggling right thing here.

No. People paying attention, watching horror, pity, bewilderment. comments get regular basis break heart. Yeah america definitely put show us last years. Every time turn news it‚Äôs kind chaos bad news going ever find actually got real vaccine? get wrong, I'm rights workers simple might think. Big corporations exactly cash rich, unless we're taking Apple Microsoft. Maybe Alphabet well.

Let's assume average employees makes 3k monthly (shitty wage Disney states, TBH). 32k employees going cost 96 mil per month. Cash. That's billion per year. money supposed come from? 

This furloughs happen. easier temporarily let go employees maybe refuse later compared to... say... selling Pixar Marvel rights stay afloat.

Losing employees temporary downsize human capital easily replaced future. Losing cash cow assets permanently hurts corporations revenue stream going forward. Lol, aren‚Äôt actively going governments advice. Like constantly. many superspreader events w Whitehouse hosted?

Sure guys dumb, still mask time. still ask residents follow guidance CDC health authorities. Sounds like shitty college Good. Give someone else video Boeing

I'm sure vested interest making air travel seem safe.

Lol im boston, get town inner city feel, although downtown super small. youre misinterpreting it. lot ppl younger 80-90 survive covid still require hospitalization. many ppl hospital means hospitals take care really common though? see data backing claim up?

Probably week two Christmas. I'll bet talk shutdowns get louder (at least us cautious ppl) wearing masks, socially distancing, keeping Thanksgiving celebrations small, making important appointments (dentists, doctors, car maintenance) essential errands possibly applesauce hits fan (again) - that‚Äôs NY. actually brings joy know cowboys got absolutely waxed game too.

You catching seeing people street, catching indoors, meaning live far away rural areas, going meeting bars towns others homes. like NYC hang street stoop run people. People thought density major factor spread saw crowded streets, practically nobody getting virus outdoor interactions, density matter. 

A study social habits rural versus suburban versus urban people found urban people far likely socialize outdoors, street, rural suburban people, tend socialize homes establishments. plays huge role transmission. NYC got hit first major travel hub, likely got thousands infected overseas, summer shown inherently vulnerable virus density. youre misinterpreting it. lot ppl younger 80-90 survive covid still require hospitalization. many ppl hospital means hospitals take care swear need sort circuit breaker law event mass epidemic event, power governorship gets transferred highest ranking public health official state regarding decision related pandemic. Trusting asshat politicians make right decision moron's path. Speaking non-American behalf rest world - one really gives shit. you‚Äôre making stuff...Covid 20? think it‚Äôs based counting?

Mask Mandates need highly enforced places spread likely occur. example, Walmart already cops shoplifting anyways. Ticket every person doesn‚Äôt wear mask. Give warnings wear improperly. 

It‚Äôs bit fascist step, seriously.... mandates completely useless area aren‚Äôt enforced. You‚Äôre saying Canada, shares largest border America one (Am Canadian) largest trading partner every country? trying dense purpose you? can‚Äôt even tell satire. least PSU, although covid cases almost exclusively driving PA's increase months ago, almost zero increase hospitalization. want spreading, wonder much interacted vulnerable populations (prior thanksgiving breaks) point seen raised. related point, close control group half-dose initial group. look like control group, determine 90% effective?

It's probably moot point sounds like going redesign extend study. imagine keep producing vaccine interim. Even vaccine ends 60% effective, big deal compared vaccine all. Meanwhile, people moaning racism here. Didn‚Äôt want ban visitors China.

All things must way cheaper obviously effective lockdowns. Yup. Brave new world live in. Stick fuckin' man! truest words I've ever read! true fuckin' patriot! Every new person gets virus opportunity mutate dangerous strains. hit herd immunity flu every year dude. also hit 1918-1919 pandemic places. 

GLOBAL herd immunity different. Plenty pandemics hit herd immunity localized basis fade away decades coming back. rarely *just* herd immunity, combination herd immunity precautions. herd immunity still plays major role. 20% population infected, usually 20% likely get/spread virus, largely outsized effect transmission rates. doubt major effect pandemics, always plays factor. far people watch it.

Brewtech3's last comment you. yet, South Australia active cluster, NSW cases IIRC Acting like absolutely nothing changed. Fascinating. live congested suburban area (DC.Metro) there's plenty room socially distance. yeah, wanted to, could work out. don't, didn't, are.

""It is."" Except us can't vaccine. part people caring anymore. Newsom's fucking dinner party, shit, know there's cases elected officials ignoring rules preach. People see crap figured ""why care"". Hehe, yeah, France strong lockdown, probably lifted soon. get imported cases surrounding countries again. boggles people influenced social media ‚Äòlikes‚Äô.

I mean, grew northeast don‚Äôt think apple picked life. Suddenly Facebook came around every family going apple picking fall, every year go week earlier last everyone else posting pics.

I mean think it, many people dumped fucking bucket ice head Facebook? happened 3 years ago! tell people create websites within minutes days, use template makes look like official website, write fake ""news"" content within hours.  ....this fucked up. Half country vacation can't bothered report covid results, holiday going home. see countries next year saying quarantine restrictions specific countries large majority vaccinated they'll probably require covid vaccine certificate longer quarantine I‚Äôm mistaken, properly worn surgical mask equivalent N65 3,000 dead: Never Forget
300,000 dead: Never Remember Social distancing closed room moot point due air circulation HVAC. virus gets dispersed around - matter far apart people spread.

I started job Monday I'm stuck small room two people new offices built. I'm person 25 people building wears mask. think Floridians enough shit already, apparently so. Winnipeger currently locking surge cases, hope understand need closed border North Dakota. individualism cite also result low vaccination rates time comes, meaning folks long haul. Nope. people sure want us think is. would amount ~1 million deaths, give take. Wonder r/LockdownSkepticsm thinks this. Last I've seen, equating crime humanity.

Regardless, lockdown done properly. backlash lockdown mostly due economic reasons, least somehow protect peoples' wallets lockdown, many it. debate would whether long term effects would worse lockdown vs lockdown, far evidence generally favour (properly done) lockdowns. What‚Äôs case counting anyways? Seems really inconsistent. many pop-ups, flashing ads assorted distractions build website? Great job MSMBC, distracting gave up! best time take precautions seriously March. next best time take precautions seriously right now. told 99% chance plane would land 1% plane would crash, plus five ten percent chance poisoned suffer permanent organ damage, getting board? Nope. sound like good addition. Sigh. remeber days. used .edu email get account Whilst correct, comment insensitive. week two, long time. know guy get kid back school couple months still popping positive tests.

Also, think legal job fire coronavirus. either wait adjust policy match states recommendation. NY like 2 weeks symptoms start feel better. I'm guessing smaller roads rabbit tracks might also cross border.

Most got stopped concrete blocks etc. - anyone trying sneak seemed end news really scary us live around people.

Our Gov (Mr. Personal Responsibility Burgrum) reelection too.

I looking forward fallout next month, month half, so. going bad. Terrible article. based author's false assumption we're missing amount cases Spring Summer, true all. 

"" model's ratio still holds, estimated total would greater 95 million, leaving 71% population uninfected.""

This author's assumption reach imaginary 100 million infections, entirely wrong. testing abysmal Spring, missed many cases. testing improved summer still able keep demand cases soared. 

Our testing improved markedly since summer. can't use ratio spring summer apply official case counts today. Right around 1300 deaths reported today Thanksgiving, 20 states reporting yet (they may not--i know) I'm certainly advocating complacency. get herd immunity, assume obvious. I'm hoping number already infected large. N95s far effective surgical?? point anyone coming store without mask probably spoiling fight. I'm going ask staff deal psychos. boss told job inform 250lb tattooed bikers need leave put mask, I'd tell go fuck himself. Nothing like food Thanksgiving funeral Christmas. Funny, I'd argue Anecdotes (like hers) terrible compared data. wonder could hit 300k circumstance bad written constitution... logically there's way slaveowners could wrong anything /s Yep several places reporting. Id expect time next week we'll see massive spike one days backlog thanksgiving etc dad less conspiratorial, still similar mentality. thinks degrees necessary (his degree business related one works unrelated field) colleges exist business make money mostly unnecessary. logic, thinks college professors 'real' jobs teaching liberal theories work sheltered 'real' world.

It's extremely dangerous mindset. seems think educated someone is, detached reality must there's way job subject complicated, right? could possibly take many years schooling understand something?  One word: Sturgis  looking 9/11 death toll every day pretty soon then. obviously true. point IFR around 0.25% probably close. get accurate number whatever ""government model"" current regime's CDC pushing napkin. 300k deaths, 0.6% IFR, 50 million infections ~3 weeks ago.

The reason many people trust experts many experts want use expertise lie push agendas. HeRd iMmUnItY tried controlling social distancing masks.


At least 70 million people problem simple stuff. also problem contact tracing millions people think ratting comrades want reveal details life like shop restaurants bars go to. Can't let big government private details, even though voted dear leader.


Then cry ""lockdowns"" want kidnap governor's, threaten put Doctors heads pikes, encourage people ""rise up""


We've talking since least April protesters armed assault weapons masks marched streets, stormed state capitols, yelled face law enforcement.



Every warning met ""hoax"" ""plandemic"" claims virus would disappear by, Easter, Spring, Summer, Election day, etc...


Other countries control much easily, millions citizens spikes people covid hundreds, take swift action. states million citizens, whose governor's order Covid-19 positive healthcare workers show work care patients told ""stay home scared"". ... businesses running ski slopes?

The businesses. huge business Germany wants shut countries want open. Follow money. Never shit shitter They're even allowed quarantine. mean, job lot less important I'm working today ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. necessarily care reporting numbers today. already know bad make difference social distanced day day life, I'm saying lots people work holidays. Idiots think wearing mask neck serves purpose idiots think pretty people can't stds Wow. 10% entire state. Incredible Well downside might overestimating immunity like Sweden did. targeting class employment mostly female often people straight.  wiki page backstory term Third World, anyone even highly developed nonaligned European countries considered Third World Cold War Classic Facebook move, hilarious.

On reddit block person announce order improve self-esteem. Treatment? Vaccination? thing. stay home catch virus therefore need treatment. tested positive covid, long takes testing negative?
My friend tested positive covid required get negative test keep job, long wait retesting. symptoms. forget $250 jersey pro shop. get 1/20? perspective. 260,000 deaths, death 1 inch, made line inches. would 4 miles long. That's 72 100 yard football fields end end. boomer take it? Numbers stabilized somewhat. personally think would needed complete strict lockdown November, half assed shit had. also think added measures anything help cause.

It's fucked up, stupid wrong priorities, even though Germany probably least hit larger country west argument here. conservative estimate.  essentially viewing PPE talismans


I saying exact thing months. pretending go motions understand fucking up. like goddamn cargo cults somthing Apparently call shitty GM makes quite unhinged animated. That's new one, possibly touch yet! *Left* ones anti-education. gloves worse using them, bacteria/virus magnets, helps spread vs skin reading Universe Next Door Robert Anton Wilson afternoon said exact thing (about things polycausal.)

It looks like 1 20 gets crippled immediately, would first severe viral disease come bonus illness years. sucks though. grandmother 90s may truly last Thanksgiving whole family couldn‚Äôt together. father brother law ill could kart one too. hate much.

Not Americans dumbasses. Meanwhile us a, we're Thanksgiving..... i'll buy pint! fewer medical staff members would dealing far patients accustomed to. modern medicine though US you?

It‚Äôs fucking infuriating. Theoretically, educate stupid people. people want believe lies true, nothing show change mind. (‚òûÔæü‚àÄÔæü)‚òû Impeccable logic Thank you! helps lot. give hoping best?

Also shit ton plants little outdoor space care wait crazy pass. Sweden: tried reach herd immunity letting everyone get infected. work.

North Dakota: hold beer! downvoted? Positive doesn‚Äôt mean dead. Booming holiday season mobile morgues funeral homes. federal conservative party leader using slogans like ""take back canada""... racist dogwhistle shit ""Canada ain't white enough anymore"" guess. 100k yesterday. That's quite drop. wish mask deniers would spend 1 hour ICU deciding it‚Äôs big plot erode liberties Correlation causation. shows relationship. Economic prosperity one reasons people support locking down. Obviously global recession inevitable pandemic, given 1 positive outlier (China, heavily relied pandemic things like PPE). Local economies/small business saved less restrictive countries. Federal government needs impose penalties or... Fuck dunno, fuck get crazy?

This ramifications trump's early covid response. lack leadership, lack care, seeped state encouraged bonkers belief 

Once people choose belief, hard change it. Reddit isn‚Äôt different, agree different form disinformation. emergency April needed two dozen stitches. moved NE February shutdowns early March. poor husband best research network hospitals. ACA actually protects network ER costs though. found fact home recuperating. Yep Oxford vaccine. Different way conducting trials present additional variables get medical treatment then? Let sick own. strange, watch morbid curiosity inappropriate holier-than-thou attitude. know what's wrong me. We‚Äôre gonna get it. big deal. Wait till hear malaria Africa! got sprayed skunk earlier week everyone keeps telling jacket ruined.

I let hang days, go smell lo behold completely fine. Makes sense too. skunk stank permanent, everywhere would smell like skunk. 

The plague go away, eventually. go extinct? knows. parents live 3 miles away still decided spend time group Skype everyone. spend enough time looking corpses work, dont want chance family member. 

Not Americans brainless idiots. like 70 people...? agree, idea I'm complaining. Wtf Europeans shouldn‚Äôt ones talk. Who‚Äôs watching people die glee?? Corona virus ravaged countries. utter lack control months still do. European countries higher per capita death US! 

Honestly, condescending attitude better needs go. Frankly, countries TALK shit US covid situation Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan etc. (Oxford/AstraZeneca) checking asymptomatic spread. tested everyone, weekly. Pfizer/BioNtech Moderna (only cases w/ reported symptoms). That‚Äôs what‚Äôs frustrating all, amount people seem think world going end don‚Äôt get together thanksgiving? Yeah, sucks - that‚Äôs part responsible adult. Realizing needs done isn‚Äôt always easy. 

And get flood comments always get - completely understand everyone different situation. people elderly parents/loved ones might way out, well could last thanksgiving - took proper precautions quarantine thanksgiving, think that‚Äôs alright. Obviously could still transmit virus (you really never know), least you‚Äôre heavy lifting ensure chances low possible. 

I‚Äôm talking people genera attitude ‚Äúfuck you, can‚Äôt tell do‚Äù idiots going froth mouth asked spend thanksgiving large group people. never said don‚Äôt test flu. don‚Äôt test like COVID. There‚Äôs difference. 

I arguing deaths year USA. know countries actually reported less deaths previous years? Bruh stayed home ate food Travellers like : ""I'm gonna catch covid all"" reality wont die, enough people take seriously. Unless 50% people dying, doubt americans enough brain power compute danger Hmm... Typical republican Well seeing there‚Äôs 40 people total state, that‚Äôs four people. Lol normally 2.6M

this year Oh man. way see coming. ND win! better 70% effective vaccine easily vaccinate everyone 95% effective vaccine difficult produce transport. eliminated virus Australia coronavirus news hear see America it‚Äôs sterilizing immunity (right?), still get spread it, won‚Äôt showing symptoms? Wow, that‚Äôs crazy! 

1 person North Dakota infected? families Europe too, family married into. discussion US last week video chat. Mostly Thanksgiving superspreader event many downvotes lol must Steelers fans international groupings gave placebo also meningitis vaccine could distinguishing covid vaccine placebo group. found rather interesting headline seems pretty inaccurate. ""oppose"" lockdown sense made statement it. said would like see us resort lockdown.

It ""opposes"" lockdown, said want come that. whole thing basically saying lockdowns suck people actually took ""personal responsibility"" seriously regarding impact choices others could get much better place without lockdown.

The article goes spout BS lockdowns worse job loss. know else sucks jobs? uncontrolled pandemic. 

Sinclair media trash. No, none people understand despite enormous landmass extremely concentrated populations around coastal areas capital cities, furthermore, Vietnam island, neither Mongolia.

The patent fact missing opposition party working support Greens rapid rollout Jobkeeper Jobseeker coronavirus supplements ($500 per fortnight, two weeks, yanks), meant people jobs kept could stay home (hence Jobkeeper), people working jobseek also received supplements support meantime.

What helped us succeed support structure sense community. People could stay home safely money lessened workplace pressure. could look children home. rollout 10 extra mental health Medicare supported psychologist appointments top initial 10 receive referral. 

Melbourne wider Victoria incredible job, country island, competent leadership, socialist policies, people giving shit other.

If proof pudding us getting control first time, Melbourne did. think must really hard policymakers America realise geography, government support citizens. Hey, bud I'm actually immunologist (PhD) work BSL-3 studying viruses mice . fitted N95 masks using special airflow machine. certain amount particles allowed come fail easy N95 masks secure form fitting. fail provide special respirator. BSL-3 BSL-4 required human viruses. guess tell guy internet said bandana face sufficient.

I'm even bothered brother. sad state things. actually think consensus mask wearing covid scientific community hoodwinked. I've thinking thing happened. bad science used support bad policies. think comes psychology game theory. Politicians doctors choose option covers ass. That's it. Also, there's archetype person afraid want something it, anything, even help makes things worse.

Anyway, randomized controlled studies meta analysis concluding masks stop spread viruses. scientific consensus decades. Read don't. care. already fucked:

(2009) ‚ÄúUse surgical face masks reduce incidence common cold among health care workers Japan: randomized controlled trial,‚Äù American Journal Infection Control, Volume 37, Issue 5, 417 ‚Äì 419. health-care workers (HCW) significantly likely experience headaches.

Also relatively low death rate doesn‚Äôt mean much it‚Äôs spreading like wildfire. 1% people dying rare cancer eh. 1% people whole dying short span time bit serious. overload medical systems need care reason, may get access life saving care, thought scare you. thats ridiculous. least couple months clear. notion even getting covid you‚Äôre still risk dumb. Maybe 3 months I‚Äôd start getting concerned even unlikely. hospital diagnoses COVID-19 without testing it? Big true. many times tell you, thats broom Grandma! executed worst criminals. petty ones got sent over. Maybe. There's obviously less reporting done weekends, assume true tomorrow. Minimum Viable Product? Actually nah. lockdown couple months Australia zero cases back living pretty normally. Watching America handle virus like watching movie, it‚Äôs disturbing wonder percentage CA.. 20% nurses Filipino 

&amp;#x200B;

A Fifth California's Nurses Filipino. Burden Coronavirus Pandemic Fast  US constitution date now. really needs updated reflect society now. exactly type immunity hoping for. Nice gives fuck following rules. motherfucker example live life order alive need see dumbass politicians show live we‚Äôre screwed anyway. I‚Äôm listening experts common sense. pandemic officially announced, partner already quarantined together ordering everything need online delivery. Listen news outside United state- ie bubble. Yes! IMO wayyyy better getting actual flu. one year forgot get flu shot, flu bad thought wouldn‚Äôt make night. saying countries borders piss weak can't enforced? Work, schools stores remaining open still allows lot movement people. Looks like they're implementing restrictions try push things Christmas. Yes do. least Malaysia. Saying Fauci healthcare US concerned huge traveling Thanksgiving Black Friday Hey everyone got Gates here. lived Europe whole life (until 2 months ago) idea average European knows. lunch home. Went visit local park wore masks. Doctoring data get 62% efficiency vaccines getting 90% would pretty bad. totally new vaccine they've done experiment see side effects are! guess relates mechanism, mRNA vaccine induces body produce antigen ends body resulting systemic reaction flu shot vaccine contains antigen immune systems exposure initially localised site systemic uptake slow might get mopped immune response already begun. 

I optimistic side effects initially, released full results yet press result says ""grade 3"" (whatever means) side effects fatigue 3.8% headache 2% second dose. 

I think refer immune response instead side effects haha. Vaccines coming soon right ? I'm sorry, please stay extra cautious. Sad, incredibly sad. live largest city liberal pocket work blue collar job. company uses masks social distancing requirements quite frankly believe happening. 
It feels like I‚Äôm getting gaslit bring up. It‚Äôs absolutely like living bizzaro world. North Dakota 75 times important New Zealand, looking reference. Yes Lime Dude, that‚Äôs exactly thought. Well already around months trial participants, know waiting months available general public tell anything new unless suffer rare disease take equally rare prescription drug, case maybe waiting bad idea otherwise healthy. bet guess ‚Äúhalf‚Äú.‚Ä¶ Pfff whatever. Enjoy terrible American media. I'll take BBC Jazeera. Tell vaccines deactivate mind controling microchips Look previous year. one jail talking police manner see fit. 

Free speech that. sure it. share charges people 90 dollars ibuprofen would call Fargo Bismark densly populated places.... big difference Sydney really image macro Oh forgot that, didn‚Äôt realize guy still mayor. Argentina shows neither Equating two things irresponsible. Semantics something dismissed sake it. Meanings clarity important. People need able understand science functions order trust it. Saying significant empirical support truth misleading, plain incorrect. like playing ""lies wack-a-mole"". Good thing snake oil peddlers making money, right? barely villages cant really call cities definitely days wonder much take, honestly colleagues lot heart. Despite shit they've seen lack help get, whatever can. get this, hope get long needed r&amp;r. Theres thing herd immunity. /s True developed countries aside US.

Plus many less developed countries... would still invite math.

We're looking years. still.domt wear mask . virus already keep wearing mask . I've sick food poisoning . severity virus joke. Keep watching commy tv.just live life way use e joy thing communist shut yet . Tell I'm supposed change it. I'll wait. job take care patients. well trying save money can. Changing drug costs would lawmaking decisions. go school that. option leave industry, leaving patients lurch. World black white. I'm going guilted bringing someone back life cpr going capital hill drug costs. much me, especially covid general dumb fuckery left us overworked overwhelmed. true, honestly, difficult. key reducing human interaction policy levers correctly set virus reduce exponentially. Victoria 700 new cases per day peak got single figures reasonably quickly (a couple months) tail dragged bit get zero. reason caseload 1,500 plus reduced around amount time. clever enough start it, spread it.

The ""natural health"" types online worst spreading disinformation trivial verify academic pedigree..

Ok, I‚Äôll take that. caught me, one second tell colleagues they're gonna need cover shift Saturday. want notify CPSO take registration I? 


Anything said convinced I'm doctor indication lack understanding profession indication qualifications. I'll try give benefit doubt assume successful troll, perhaps live jurisdiction dramatically different guidelines compared us despite working multiple hospitals Southern Ontario, outside AGMPs n95s permitted typical use due supply chain issues. North Dakota worst Governor US. That‚Äôs saying lot. Jesus people vote out. guys gotta calm bare assed farting. Especially now. son got pulled couple years ago driving 65 40. [went cop saying dad mayor he'll cop fired. Also called cop homophobic slur along lots profanity.

Best part even pulled Denver. got ticket father condemned behavior. kid 22 young young. Regardless know much father blame son's action.

I also think shitty acted cursing cop carry jail time, especially 2.5+ years it'd take currently jail. Funny people beleive source though Yep, people commonly use term ‚Äúpoor‚Äù nations that‚Äôs term actually means. case, it‚Äôs outdated since Cold War ended ages ago. Good thing family lives within driving distance wonderful thanksgiving also get go hunting Saturday nice we‚Äôll distanced (but I‚Äôm seriousness please wear mask also less 10 people thanksgiving family members philly area stayed home) I‚Äôm spreading misinformation never said nurses charging people. Don‚Äôt put words mouth even fact slaveowners, there's also billion us technology even little comparable Supposedly evolution created us way. Half giving, half taking yeah, except elections forget mention fucking obsession microchips morons? Can't least come plausible conspiracy theory? Man, Die Hard 3 lot complex thought. gonna fucked, people think hoax going continue ruin everyone else give fuck anyone themselves. valve usually street little metal cover. That's supposed work. state gets equal senators. 

States join union otherwise No. I'm living minimum wage right kept way since worked minimum wage job.

You free ignore advice. I'm making talk even read. I've saying choices make you. Cry want, nurses still ones charging patients spreading misinformation ignorance way said vaccine ever released fast human history. mRNA vaccine ever approved human use (outside trials course) prior November 2020. 

Again. uncharted territory. reason vaccines take decades release normally. reason safety. Meanwhile US continues sulk hit itself. many credit cards decade now. ever held balance. banks paid thousands last ten years playing CC games.  ""Fuck got mine"" like entire platform half countries politicians, half population eats up, makes sense. Jeez even live big city many people sure can. Amazon Chewy carry it. company's website let's look local boutique retailers. Feline Natural subsidiary brand K9Natural. ""where buy"" link ""where buy"" link recommend buying cans locally larger orders online ensure cat eat stick it, cats cats that. :) It‚Äôs safe ask Sounds like case Multiple Oregon Failure. least 10% official deaths based certificates people diagnosed COVID-19 tested. 

Where read this? FHM's stats page says positive test result required count covid death. amazing. hope everyone celebrating exactly want to. can't thank Victorians enough Queensland. kept us loved ones safe appreciate much. looking dark here. see hospitals capacity around world, amazing 4 weeks 0 cases proof lockdown works. Intra-family infection rate quite bit lower people imagine, 10%-20% non-spouse, 30% spouses. See Table 3 Chances good infected. sad story. happens failed leadership. buying AstraZeneca, plan producing vaccines.

Also, 13 million people \~70 million population need buy lots more. Trump goes jail. can, always pay rent credit card. Get cash back points towards something pay card next payment period. reason transaction fees get slapped trying pay bills credit card. live Melbourne. times extremely challenging locked long were, confirm absolutely worth limited restrictions. Best all, fear virus eradicated (although still residual paranoia, know irrational). Lol fuck dumbass parents then. I‚Äôm way sympathy dumbass right-wing fascist conspiracy idiots. fucking died world would immediately better place.  else going spend dirty bribe money. real adults world. bunch asshole kids running around adult bodies. people might aware outcome elections. Nothing specific that. Certainly looking disbelief Americans traveling Thanksgiving, care? Dodging STD's personal World War 2 college. Oh fuck.

This makes much sense now. Still long way, 37 days later Well I'm happy that's minor inconvenience you. Many people fortunate. arguments insane many based political phrases. People routinely interject Biden destroy country considered heroes heroes military. consider sort hero someone loves community direct people social media page public first image article written community work referring hero. picture includes working alongside combat medics upmost respect for.

So move personal attacks go hobbies [powerlifting] even family members.
It emotional group ironically love using phrase ""facts care feelings."" Thank please take care, colleagues. hope half strength courage guys have. would quit long time ago.. Sweden pretty well demonstrated herd immunity ain't gonna help here. Nice Wtf? Covid-21? want ask already know actually even want know. Godammit. There's difference religion, playing real time ~8100 deaths. Possibly more, deaths lagging. idiot brother knows complete breakdown bronchitis 3 weeks January night every night hacking lungs up, still get swabbed get share meal me. inability connect experiences wanting risk getting sick boggles mind. exactly Nobody gives fuck happening America. Well strict lockdown principle, clear thought infections coming wrong based numbers going down. transparency, MSNBC leftist propaganda news equivalent Fox News right wing nut jobs. dunno, try ***really hard*** maybe could get 120% infected! Especially people tacitly approve situation saying ""nothing done"" like... You.

To real, fault employees restaurant. fault owner, thinks s/he pulling heroic fuck continuing put employees risk. someone wfh, find reprehensible people asked risk health cater largely people like *you*? obtain defense mechanism? Mine broken nation isn‚Äôt static ideology, changing paradigm social demands desires reflecting progressive outlook good-natured citizens. That‚Äôs people come here.

You naming three failed nation experiments using guise communism doesn‚Äôt make American idea dogma. It‚Äôs literally 9 months vaccine another 3. People asked sacrifice less history. Life go on. 

During World War II, people proud sacrifice things greater good. happened us? Mass-consumerism bread circuses (ahem season NFL tickets) might hold clue. Purchased, thank detailed recommendation actually looking something read. God gene? Wow that‚Äôs something haven‚Äôt heard about. Two important pieces data potentially come this:

1. overall death rate. know can't 0.12%, percentage residents already died, include deaths likely come current active cases.

2. threshold herd immunity. know cases caught, fact 1 3 may reasonable estimate terms detection rate. case, know threshold must still many new cases although peak ~2 weeks ago. 

The herd immunity threshold still somewhat open question experts point threshold 60-80% HI achieved, assumes a) nobody hereditarily immune virus persons equally genetically susceptible b) previous recent infection pathogens, common cold, encompasses 4 less pathogenic coronaviruses confer cross-immunity whatsoever. either assumption false, HI threshold would lower. live place option everything closed Wait deep fakes become main stream. Deaths hard predict. don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre wrong terms numbers I‚Äôm sure timing. really feeling rise fall surge. thanksgiving expect another sharp rise cases evident 2-3 weeks deaths still lag another several weeks behind that. It‚Äôs slo-mo disaster. little doubt we‚Äôll get crazy high numbers maybe soon January. Guess we‚Äôll see. Victorian here! endured 120 days strict lockdown, - envy world!

We bound together get rid virus. life normal. tolerate whinging ""muh free dumbs"" ""muh economy."" small fringe minority people actually cared ""free dumbs"" arrested - right white extremests arrested devices confiscated posting protest event Facebook.

This virus deadly serious. wicked virus, discriminate. virus kills 4% infected people Australia. happy live country take things seriously.

Us Australians look places like US laugh. many people whinging ""muh freedumbs"" ""muh economy."" look gotten you, nearly 300,000 people died, bodies stacking street, hospitals overflowing patients, ect. ect. ""free dumbs"" important literally killing destroying society!

The virus come back ready it. South Australia, small outbreak - immediately locked down, hash lockdown exterminate deadly, serious virus. People even fined $2,000 going outside walk dog! happy it, know deadly, wicked virus. come end, virus free, envy world. found sister positive again, third time. March, summer, this..

huh...no..... world fact tired USA problems. Stop pretending center world. people still deny deathbed, literally It‚Äôs good fewer people flying, flying equate ‚Äúdoing needs done.‚Äù 
Many didn‚Äôt fly still expanded ‚Äúbubble‚Äù gathered today. ‚ÄúThe watches dread disbelief‚Äù

From experience, many people dont even care covid situation US anymore Black socks sandles, chain wallet cutoff shorts. republican death cult. 
If Democrats said *‚ÄùDon‚Äôt wear masks‚Äù*, they‚Äôd wearing one name FREEDUM!‚Ñ¢Ô∏è No, see joke one. made think autistic people often refuse unable take things way besides literally. insisted op referring Americans seemed like overly literal interpretation exchange. people care, that's problem. resorts state (WA) reducing number lift tickets allow every day. Lines lot shorter, chair single people groups already together.

Also, skis almost 6ft long. don‚Äôt think could line within 6ft skier front behind me, even wanted to! We‚Äôve marketed well years easy target. going shortage unparalleled trauma unprecedented crisis.

As primarily scientists welcomed idea forum including discussion economic, social, (relevant) political impacts outbreak. welcome devolving tabloid-level coverage daily, local trauma. Even said incidents verifiable. entire comment chain what‚Äôs wrong COVID-19 response. We‚Äôve taken individual risk management given responsibility governments. public doesn‚Äôt know, meant know estimated fatality IFR numbers. I, guy .02% fatality rate, ask grandmother grandfather 5.4% fatality rate thoughts virus are, person contact, **Fully informed** decide 80 don‚Äôt care, like lady: willing take risks holiday meetup individuals say ‚Äúwell may last one anyway‚Äù say no?

Now know you‚Äôre going say, well could infect someone else. yes that‚Äôs true, however it‚Äôs person take appropriate precautions themselves. way ethically spamming death rates everywhere. ‚ÄúCollectivist‚Äù risk management stop. Every risk take cause third party harm society. SAR teams rescue lots adventurists per year, yet don‚Äôt restrict that. Motorcycles dangerous cars, don‚Äôt ban them. don‚Äôt ban extreme sports. 

Now get hospital argument. merit. However stopped sole justification restrictions. seen much talk cases last couple months. discussions medical staff checking it. Hospitals aren‚Äôt designed much excess capacity. 80-90% honestly don‚Äôt feel nervous spring know context. 

*This link IMHE modeling hospitals. redditors inform least FL numbers off, get updated. It‚Äôs model however don‚Äôt want people thinking it‚Äôs exact. Yet it‚Äôs 90% almost country. realize modeling isn‚Äôt end all, it‚Äôs dare provide facts instead pile onto fear mongering. 

I flew Tuesday airports empty I‚Äôve seen since August. Boo hoo. worldwide public health concern hundreds thousands people dying becoming infected daily. long get want, cares anyone else, right?

These unprecedented times; deal it. lucky, Thanksgiving next year. can't said everyone COVID killed. empathy. roommate (who already caught COVID-19 gave almost month ago) went family's Thanksgiving. I'm quarantining hoping fuckin catch shit second time. agree comment makes wonder dying car likely dying Covid? ‚ÄúOutside magic capabilities anything reduce spread.‚Äù

Sure does.  watching disbelief, know nothing Americans. individual level sure US didn‚Äôt happen hit highest levels travel week millions people emergencies necessitating essential air travel; least reasonable won‚Äôt getting while. flu vaccine landed hospital twice. I‚Äôve told probably avoid getting again. Covid vaccine months, I‚Äôll talk doctor it. I‚Äôm really nervous it. entire west. Freedom used anything want ticket. Ironic minority wanting ‚Äúfree‚Äù costing majority freedom. get frustration. feel too. recognize reality buying says it‚Äôs going effect people like does. That‚Äôs able believe it. it‚Äôs convenient lie. Honestly, it‚Äôs temptation weren‚Äôt compelling, wouldn‚Äôt feel need reassure someone pretty obvious right thing. take dont know anyone whos gotten twice yet? Must mild you‚Äôre at. Give little time. Zoom gatherings played Uno Chess kids, problem. 

That said drive 1700 miles across country three weeks ago take care mom who'd smashed car needed movement assistance adjustment less mobility. Still, 900 miles (each leg) CRV three gas stops way plus one hotel one hotel back. hotel stops bothered lot can't 24 hours straight driving stopped. masked every stop doused sanitizer monitored temp twice per day. crash made drive fine think helped. T-day though? Nah, enjoyed chess cards kids! one cares ‚Äúrest world‚Äù thinks, aren‚Äôt impress rest world. softies move Italy wherever else living scared leave Americans still believe freedom .. America .. land free. Almost everyone know covid perfectly OK. Don‚Äôt see family holidays, ok, don‚Äôt expect everyone else stay inside next stash toilet paper canned foods like there‚Äôs fucking monster outside. It‚Äôs crazy country soon ran people back bone. bet guys shave arms too. ""the world"" seemed ignore diwali fine made worse paid trolls - I'm terrified even though family right thing, still might end catching spikes come. Never heard Plato's Cave - interesting reading it. metaphor heard, similar, looking world straw.

The thing many people know social media much cable news benefits dividing people, natural do. people like it. liken food industry producing unhealthy food, people like. Maybe could enlighten thought process someone tells constituents one thing exact opposite.

It‚Äôs accident, isn‚Äôt silly mistake. actively acknowledging virus reaction complete bullshit. aren‚Äôt scared, we? Stop defending people. It‚Äôs political theatre people charge. Y'all qaeda's version memorize hadiths. Ah yes Europe. place everyone traveled summer, recklessly spreading virus. Remember that? remember. seen US protesters shitshow people covid Definitely, mess right now. leadership, ‚Äòpresident‚Äô locked room tweeting conspiracy theories virus takes country. Many people thought possible think pandemic fake, masks implanted chips. Turkeys eating turkey. there‚Äôs balance strike.

There‚Äôs difference someone going interacting everyone going visit elderly family vs someone sheltering, careful got negative test working home 2 weeks. 

The lack nuance astonishing. Human beings social creatures. Balance compromises need met. Group 1 example problem, group 2. side political spectrum believe virus wants everything opened time acts like public schools dens iniquity self respecting home school kids send charter schools. sudden they're importance schools healthy development children keeping public schools crime. province Alberta? used come friends tell ICU beds full. sorry guys -take care. Thanksgiving spike enough quickly fence Christmas took part good sized Thanksgiving gatherings likely attend large gatherings again. Early January likely grim. Truly sad highest numbers 80x reported.

Judging covid19-projections.com linked thread, 25% NYC infected (which lines antibody results). site puts ND 30% total infected right still climbing things like subways really completely obliterate us.

I've keeping several studies honestly, really. sure help subways elevators small share sustained indoor person-to-person interaction hours accumulated day. Going work/class/drink/shop/party that's something non new yorkers much. 90% obliterated us testing masks, like mention. also spreading North Dakota 

I mean, trying say ND dense pretty much admitting much useful measure. describing basic human behavior gathering socializing root cause. Ackshually


1 day...you keep pie hole shut one day... But...he‚Äôs already contracted recovered covid. Many studies cultural beliefs attitudes completely disagree. Hoftstede's cultural dimensions Australia similar country America terms multiple different cultural metrics (Individualism, Power Distance, Indulgence, Uncertainty Avoidance, Masculinity, Long Term Planning). UK also similar metrics except Long Term Planning. I'm Canada, number friends know who're planning gather families upcoming Christmas holidays insane - US-only phenomena. 

The thing find interesting (well, concerning) friends otherwise reasonable diligent COVID precautions distancing far. There's really weird, endemic mindset people Christmas different gather families. 

When ask virtually, get defensive responses typically fall three categories:

* ""We're keeping small year!"" (Except still getting together least one two households live with... multiply across millions people rationale poor one public health perspective).
* ""We're gonna take LOT precautions like getting tested going week beforehand!"" (While better nothing, there's countless articles far bulletproof. reality still going gathering people, indoors, without masks, eating drinking 4+ hours. also bluntly question well precautions applied practice, especially across - - millions people).
* ""My family SO, SAD see us in-person!"" (I mean... yeah. get that, but... deadly global pandemic means tradeoffs made, including ones leave us feeling good).

I'm projecting we're also going huge boom deaths/cases weeks following Christmas, I'm seeing much commitment public health precautions either going holiday season. Actually dead flu vaccine side effects got shot got years ago. flu even cold remember decade never got shot. did, man felt like flu. time. next years. Ironically can‚Äôt watch new movies America starts putting cuz guys kinda suck making movies. Italy still far worse idiots. Many states fantastic European countries. sure, America bad, third world lololol Damn I‚Äôm glad live part US people give shit Covid guys even produce except Lord Rings films? Yeah, Here's news article. good. Fuck assholes. Extremely concentrated populations? Victoria ranks towards bottom half density states US countries Europe. Mongolia lowest density country world stop one. Australia also able stop interstate travel. applaud Australia ask yourself, countries able control virus common? Islands, isolation, border control. 

Vietnam outlier. source? TIL China island. 10% 8 months seems like decent start. No? someone please educate recent article conservatives talking titled ""A closer look U.S. deaths due COVID-19"".

It removed JHU, apparently shows excess death increase america 2020..."" hailing silver bullet COVID? I'm loop want know wrong? don‚Äôt know single friend, family member acquaintance social media staying home today.

That's shame. Hopefully ya'll get COVID and/or die. Cheers. red Friday Outbreaks self limiting events. subside Nobody family traveled.

I can't imagine part family travel. Knowing know scientifically, REALLY big burden skip one in-person Thanksgiving, something like Zoom meeting instead? 

I can't understand somebody would put lives lives families danger, name celebrating non-religious annual tradition. turn tables got reference. Sir, Wendy‚Äôs. people need held accountable stuff point. major reason pandemic seen, [HIPAA privacy forbids release ""any information health status, provision health care... linked specific individual. interpreted rather broadly includes part patient's medical record payment history"".

So video contains anything identified specific patient, illegal release, fairly severe penalties. probably possible document conditions ICU without picking anything identifiable (including face) would take carefully planned camera work.

Add strong reluctance hospital allow non-medical (and potentially contagious) people wander around busy ICU getting way busy staff, know official documentaries.

About thing likely come stealth video shot medical staff own. busy work tired off-duty, amateur video editors best. Whole world minus asia new zealand  many disgusting men sub. Giving ""love"" award. Ya'll wonder women you. 30 years old still virigin. Wear mask scared question anything! good little sheep saved. fuck many European countries worse per capita. fuck reddit rag US ignore europe, India, South America, middle east, Mexico. shitty shittier. I'm sitting pub covid free Melbourne right beers. 

Lock brutal, we're enjoying fruits labour lol? real? Cowboys worst team league...I simple can‚Äôt ü§£ number people kills fraction people seriously damages. It‚Äôs much worse virus first thought fatality statistics would believe. hope subsides, seeing even wear masks Texas doubts. herd immunity

Makes sense. cows people state. Tell tourists places like New Hampshire caused covid spread NY first place. Excuses. Likewise! Nice talking you. Easier ask forgiveness permission Infected Americans lying crossing country get Alaska instead infecting communities actually came tourist. economic impact border control numbers insane shut protect ourselves. looming possible refugee crisis many feel could happen things USA keep getting worse. top head. Haha people thought Korea better shame lol that? sick head? take don‚Äôt live Korea. It‚Äôs 99.99% Korean natives spreading lmao don‚Äôt know left all. Well CDC admits 375k Americans died respiratory illness far year (pneumonia, influenza confirmed covid). 7k positive influenza. That's obviously counting deaths still processed (and I'm sure theres one hell backlog).

Source: excess deaths strokes, pulmonary embolisms heart attacks, mention deaths despair massive backlog could easily put us higher end range. 


TLDR: CDC apparently agrees estimate, can't say outright. Who? layover Houston Yes though much depends state. Additionally, people cities maine nebraska (omaha) disproportionately higher impact divy separately. yes, correct. stupid. Nope people partying without masks like there‚Äôs tomorrow. They‚Äôre lucky they‚Äôre island essentially. stand previous comment, i'm sure ones come they're quotes me. China well known tendency inflate GDP. ghost cities come from. They're able manipulate economy level mantain 'shovel ready' jobs millions. hard substantial portion billion person population poverty level.

Wait, prefer media/social media controlled instead free open? Aye aye partner believe Phase 3 data vaccines scheduled release December Anything endless scroll huge problem. facebook tiktok.

Any playform endless scroll segmenting leveraging activity selling advertisers peddling content specifically targeted get engaged, retained, emotionally invested schooling you? SMART. Lol. High five! virus found America's soft underbelly damn shame. survival rate? backlogged data go Thanksgiving gonna go tomorrow we'll probably top 225k. 

gonna steer clear sub days lol country in?  Wouldn‚Äôt want perfect 10-0 ruined would we........ can‚Äôt expect population cower fear ever, nothing help them. People losing everything this, savings, jobs, businesses, loved ones. come time pandemic burn out, think there. 

Where suggest cowering fear?


Wearing masks social distancing cowering fear. 

Refusal wear masks socially distance conspiracy theory cowering fear. Especially ones scared government ones supporting current President, current Senate, majority Judiciary.


Other countries managed save lives, arent suffering lockdowns area, one. suffering one chunk population refuses wear masks socially distance. refuse go certain businesses may get asked wear mask socially distance. there's another group believes masks social distancing, refuse go places people wearing masks social distancing.


We seeing cases rise people cracking, half population refuses wear masks socially distance unless forced . Australia island country 1/12 American population ability close state borders. Fuck yeah!!!!!! shitty shitty four months work clients partners worldwide. That‚Äôs exactly disbelief, sadness bit fear. Settle mate Vaccines Brazil caught politics. pending regulatory approval longer scientifically relevant. anticipating delay (December) UK EU approvals 2x full dose regimen. data still good case 62% efficacy meets approval thresholds. half-dose/full-dose regimen delayed hopefully get solid data soon. It‚Äôs capable endemism thanks immutable spike protein. virus headed oblivion. backed inescapable evolutionary corner. would destined disappear eventually even without vaccines. infects people faster they‚Äôre born, immutable spike protein means can‚Äôt dodge immunity. AstraZenaca. finished, actually score 90% maybe we'll let sit winners table. path China assert dominance globally. controlling spread COVID news externally, free say whatever want to. That....that's iceberg works. Australia would like word you. Back 1984 Freshman college. difference opinion neighbor evoulution.

Whyyyyy question. Great Depression 2: Electric Boogaloo. Agreed. countries multiple vaccine deals (especially US). risk foreseen managed. plenty options available months time (for Americans). Imagine unseen force decided SHOOT 2000 plus people day USA.

Just think that.

It's horrifying.

Imagine reaction CRY 

We would make damn sure stopped RIGHT NOW.

BUT... fight wearing damn mask.

Come people, WAKE UP.

Please  Costco trip special occasion parts world. Imagine thinking mask mandate infringes civil liberties, spreading communicable disease doesn‚Äôt infringe person‚Äôs.

Your right wear mask ends infection spreading another person. truly feel healthcare nurses doctors overloaded new patients coming weeks. could avoided. computer updates saving break school. Video driver update went fine. Audio driver update went fine. Bios update bricked motherboard RMA that. back laptop okay.

Turkey smells great. almost time consume smok'd flesh. countries 5 times smaller US. Taiwan it, South Korea Japan talked except efficient testing. Japan cases going constantly actually delayed measures preventing spread beginning. currently live South Korea reason we've well masks contact tracing. However, government implemented new level system favor keeping economy open. People droves lax policies cases going high third wave compared before. I've never heard phrasing life. referring maintaining social distancing, frequent hand washing/santizing, wearing mask. safety protocols ""played"" doing. 

Not insinuate physical mental health issues financial/job loss affected others--because serious issues well. I've lost job, family hospitalized, known personally someone disease killed. apologize came insensitive realities. inconvenience spoke of. satire lol I'm seriously confused comment. know sarcasm involved, people actually believe China's official numbers spring outbreak?

I would still wear masks public transport think that's big risk. Even covid used get sick much winter catching public transport. got back shopping centre. Usual-day-busy. counted 2 wearing masks. nose out, pretty good up. anti maskers rather noisy shouting facebook void. want see grunt paying 40% marginal tax rate... would thrilled made enough money that. rant week, government refuses help us economically, you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs bs,  come that. actually learned here. wiped natives, help diseases novel them. Hey merge South Dakota reduce numbers ... safer drive? 2 weeks today, right? Father law hardcore Trump guy, yeah, amount schadenfreude unleashed got positive test would demoralizing, he‚Äôd rather tough doubt he‚Äôll ranting he‚Äôs part get heed immunity like Sweden talking metropolitan wellington? case yes. talking wellington region would argue appropriate comparison measure density city like 1.5 - 1.8 times Single quotation marks sometimes used:

Why writer want distanced word elimination? another effort discredit elimination model? 

Congratulations successful elimination! Patience. Keep health time comes whole thing seem like blip. China? North Dakota Covid? woke one morning stuffy nose think much it, later day got congestion/post nasal drip- symptom came incredibly quick. got tested positive Nov. 3 still congestion/can't smell anything. 

I live Red River Valley, liberal rest state, everyone seems wear mask public now. city tons free testing events, got tested could show wait all. However, know many frats college attend throw parties get tested even symptoms, entire frat would quarantine someone tested positive. Damn that's long way in-laws. even. far beyond caring. soon pandemic ends socially reverting back normal behavior ‚Äúmy friend‚Äôs cousin positive test died car accident‚Äù üôÑ health insurance, higher salary, maybe tenure much better financial outlook retirement. I'm sure almost Amazon front-line worker would happy switch places you. believe shits coming Boeing agree 100%
The problem likely difficult find physicians scientists willing due time constraints, possibly money, that's public willing listen.

I'm reminded used teach Bio courses NON science majors. always job openings due variety factors:
1. filled students interested science fulfill graduation requirements
2. courses paid least amount compared biology course 
3. classes shorter duration meaning teach wanted max pay
4. offered little additional training marketability. like teaching lab skills could translate biotech industry
5. unrelated instructors field study/concentration.

The reasons taught courses beyond obvious job openings 1st degree social sciences goal share ideas science made fall love it. Well wrong, going literally near impossible completely eradicate disease like this. ever goal, even mass vaccination. even mathemagicians. Exactly. public health issue- discourse centered around harm reduction, absolutism. think lot people reddit using opportunity shame others feel better without knowing others going through. Maybe nice household quarantine skipping family gathering easy decision. Or, maybe live completely alone anxious depressed mess last several months. fucking shame people trying best horrible situation. i've new hampshire times since started state taking seriously. 

i'll never look ""live free die"" way again. Probably like whooping cough. still exists random outbreaks life goes on. Exactly, people wear masks believe virus real minority, people sub like argue strawman feel like they're smart everyone else dumb. truth unless belong vulnerable group hard take seriously, specially livehood mental health shattered Oxford vaccine turned Skaven, yes yes zoom meal nuclear family friend lives block came beer back porch. problem posts like guilty act criticizing. case, came subreddit criticize Denver mayor traveling see family, thing doing.

It's insane forego getting appropriate healthcare want embarrass Dear Leader. Every time ridiculous hyperbolic messaging manifest anything, people going give less shit. 7,000,000 tho. Compare figure let‚Äôs say number people attended Sturgis. 

And 7,000,000 figure spread across airports throughout America. 

We won‚Äôt feel impact travel another 2 weeks Christmas hit followed New Year. 

It‚Äôs going get exponentially worse. 

[Entire civilizations wiped I‚Äôm sure people thinking. 

Presumably, people want celebrate future Thanksgivings loved ones well. easily find articles countries. read bbc guardian? Well would less thing people actually doctors scientists told do. Like wear mask nose out, that's wearing mask. go inside restaurant eat, governor says can, keeping spread alive. could done pandemic months ago leaders actually guided science instead politics. low numbers ND, try harder. live TN, happens population state indoctrinated voting specific political party without giving second thought. friend gone 3-4 times since reopening. Disney enforced mask mandate taken steps keep people safe possible. Notice haven‚Äôt super spreader event Disney World. comment reminded laugh loud previous comment. that's worst thing i've heard week. find definition city changes depending jurisdiction. Across border Manitoba call places 9000 people ‚Äúcities‚Äù otherwise Winnipeg would one. ND isn‚Äôt much better calling Minot, Dickinson, even Devil‚Äôs Lake cities. Meanwhile Cali city 100k more. live Washington county (two here) I‚Äôm furious, exactly fire county commissioners? people bully public health workers liability us, polite society. Also Alabama. depressing. Nope, contact tracing isolation infected case, mass lockdown can't isolated quarantine contact tracing fast enough, means keep testing regularly playing safe. 

It's rocket science, china showed way already locking whole cities provinces one case tests whole cities basically cheaper effective letting spread kill people businesses due one trust go out? wrong. December going brutal. winter horrible. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs bad isolating. absolutely this. projections never came fruition Acton's tenure, leading harsh criticism

So stupid. things criticize public health officials for... i've treating brexit. things us dumpster fire someone else's shitshow nice distraction. family North Dakota, including grandma grew Mandan Depression WWII. talked today mentioned back everyone knew happily rationed sake neighbor couldn‚Äôt understand different.

My sister nephews live NoDak three gotten COVID. Despite fact meticulous wear N95s send WA. sister says people ‚Äújust really don‚Äôt give fuck anymore‚Äù state basically followers certain website.

(Have edit repost many times.) People get Covid mostly workers. 20% world Covid. It‚Äôs highly contagious disease. wasn‚Äôt contagious wouldn‚Äôt dangerous. No, police don‚Äôt really well-defined jobs. enforce law, choose to. helps along 4 roommates. families pretty disappointed thought necessary since we're ""essential workers"". Rather mom live next one Think freedom has! america huge economy happens states affects rest world.

also read international news time. don't? Sad thing even get joke. Yep. deaths covid - add +20% excess deaths. expert study showed lack infection things. argue that's incorrect, consistent people trusting experts. right now. total 1/5th world Covid. Don‚Äôt take word it; it‚Äôs world health organization.  no, take facts draw logical conclusion. away people two weeks really shrinks window virus problem. learned helplessness real motherfucker. New York March reason stopped? news orgs get bored? least people NYC still take seriously, nobody forgets morgue trucks hurry counts international flights?  thought cases going Europe reaction lockdowns.. unfortunate news. hoocooodanode. Feel free read prior posts. bring clarity. ""Lawmakers fail pass"" = Mitch McConnell blocks sabotage America. Youre missing point. China back normal, us shambles. part getting through? want talk numbers, even Chinese cases higher report rampant outbreak, daily life sure hell affected. government cant coverup millions people getting sick mass death. Fox news would case, not. fine. isolated, kept small. what's wrong that? shit! glad let people kill tens thousands weeks denial. Lockdowns needed places control. punish people done right thing along? Places done poorly absolutely locked down. returned home parents. nice dinner 10 direct family members well. Sorry, Covid stopping us, small town almost zero cases Thank much thorough comprehensive response. makes good sense hope able maintain control case load. don‚Äôt even need full lockdowns

We needed president actively make situation worse lol. Look, knows won‚Äôt national conformity lockdown. flat many people simply refuse. he‚Äôs trying pragmatic, sell ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt need lockdown people wear masks, socially distance, use good hygiene habits‚Äù. vaccine realistic knows get people refocus fundamentals disease control things come around. countries arnt spreading drones really sounds like get quite right first time ""use bandana make mask"". mean wrong. God's Will‚Ñ¢ all. much pro-lockdown crowd listening scientists, like they've telling everyone else months moved July. Shame never happened. Well done controlling pandemic!  That‚Äôs true. ‚Äúthe option‚Äù meant thing prevent mass death. already road vehicle without brakes though... 


And honestly US big diverse nationwide lockdown make sense. Yes everywhere cases increase, everywhere immediate danger completely overwhelming healthcare systems... Support support happen. Eventually spiral point poking head window enough get splattered wall national guard. No, least worms edible, pretty sure guys drinking glue snorting paint... 

Not particular fascinating train wreck. People thought killer AI would mean robot armies like Terminator, sexy femme fatale like System Shock 2, computers banal that.

It's giving people want, right ask it. Yeah hit capacity, I'm many places have, CFR going jump. Finally someone isn‚Äôt sugar coating like fools try rationalize virus spread become hero don‚Äôt know Yep.

This massive bump Thanksgiving leading high level.

Fortunately we‚Äôll likely turning corner, lead people justifying going ‚Äúeven unskippable‚Äù Christmas gatherings. people catch Christmas start contagious New Year‚Äôs Day.

The middle January going terrifying. get it. point people can‚Äôt reconcile feelings football socialization smart thing century pandemic they‚Äôre idiots.

I saw said aren‚Äôt going, ok. intentionally dismissive explanation idiots would dare gather pandemic game.

Let it‚Äôs cool clear cut it. idiots really value feels get watching football person. much don‚Äôt care kill it. It‚Äôs classic yolo, ragrets syndrome. sociopaths Canada . talking USA strict forced lockdown way people comply.

You people touch reality. people pay bills? 

This government never cared poor people. even give poor kids free food school. going give people enough money stay home lockdown. knew first stimulus passed. make monthly thing, knew going end help. fuck sub live ? Stay constant fear sheep cucks. us living lives again. Fuck üò¢ B-b-b-b-but it‚Äôs 98% survival rate!!!! people freaking out!!! 

Obvious /s like can't get hammered six pm. i've bars later ten pandemic reasonable amount drinks, stuck person two went with, wandered around maskless acted like dumbass. I‚Äôm actually really curious see real life experiment turns out. Australia got close elimination June outbreak hotel quarrantine spread large gatherings turned second wave second largest city (Melbourne). wave peaked 700 cases day Melbourne (and state Victoria broadly) recorded 28 days 0 cases.

Furthermore independent judicial inquiry hotel quarrantine put forward series recommendations ensure outbreak reoccur, government committed acting upon.

Welcome world evidenced based approaches dealing COVID. Fuck yeah. **Back beers** haul severe cases

Which ""pretty common""... thought second coming Christ around least tits. Nowdays dumbs. tits. way enforce it. could I'd it, police depts going to. Police way much autonomy sign (amongst many bloody signs) need sweeping police reform. Hey don‚Äôt want Grandma getting Covid everyone hates u.s need something . hate u.s intervening fast enough. intervening . ive seen experienced first hand european american citizen . original comment referring fact lot states reporting numbers today, tomorrow's jump look much worse. expected busiest travel day year.

If course highest number since February. 

Unfortunately air travel seems 38% know much international travel even possible. 

I'm sure many people flying decided drive instead. 


Too many people traveling. Another aspect drives culture. Many churches roots USA protesting getting imported well. Many Canadians protesting masks shutdowns using American language. Lots references individual rights freedoms usually part public discourse Canada, least vocally. 

The cultural overlap quite significant even specific laws same, mentality drives given similar voice here. Couple million? mean 5% Canada's population sociopaths? places mask mandates worked well (I‚Äôm looking you, East Coast) others, well... mask mandates haven‚Äôt existed (until recently places others)... may become option

It never going happen. government going give enough support people stay home. leaves people actually something structurally unable right thing, go blame college kids indoor thanksgiving really paid people stay fuck home. instead bailed cruise lines shake shack. world snoozing time.  We're Covid Level Midnight right now. Where‚Äôs lie though? thread full people sneering anyone likes watching football person. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs greatest leap make. narrow pathway around lights walk. Multiple times, wait side let large groups people pass by, could continue walk. Seems ones it. Finally took detour less crowded part made way home. get Amazon gift cards? /s Sounds like Gov Ducey AZ Everyone opposed nationwide lockdown. However, people continue acting like idiots, may become option silver lining (according airline data) 7 million people traveled, last year 17 million did.

That‚Äôs 59% drop.

Over half Americans needs done. Though I‚Äôll agree far many not.  Averaging 1,100 cases day! Yaaay! one deluding thinking covid gone forever. all, initial bad outbreak result infected people returning overseas. However, controlling single double digit increases far, far easier 700 day outbreak height.

Standard practice outbreak test quarantine close contacts, also close contacts close contacts. Try hundreds dag LMFAOO

And people put much stock bozo says fucking serious. i'd rather go work one nobody there. city's health department gives free months. also drug stores pharmacies retail stores charge various prices: Yikes Watch documentary brainwashong dad, pretty much lays out. laws stuff slowly stripped away Roger Ailes subsequent cronies starting way back Richard Nixon. epidemic right know recover.

IRL? Look (thankfully soon ex) president. 50% stupid, 50% malice, utterly convinced he's genius. time someone expertise solve big issues speaks up, fires and/or runs smear campaign them.

We'd fucking lucky end Idiocracy's future. amount fluctuation going change minds people. someone still ignorant virus 8 months later, there's hope them. They're intentionally denying reality, threatens us. November 17th anniversary Velvet Revolution, non-violent protest led fall communism Czechoslovakia 1989. Slovakia, candles used symbol non-violence protests communist regime. November 17th usually celebrated countries, Czech Republic Slovakia, including presidents, prime ministers etc, usually large gatherings on. year obviously different citizens asked stay home. mostly did. 


What see group literal nazis, literal communists (as in, people protesting against) bunch gullible idiots, led politician opposition party never seen celebrate this, even prime minister, even said back ""didn't notice it"". Needless say, whole country baffled. blows mind pandemic completely forgotten election. Lockdowns need tailored they're needed, lot negative effects society. However federal government still encourage people follow lockdowns, curfews. Certainly federal government encouraging view ignored. guys kick out? Isn‚Äôt ‚Äúburning out‚Äù herd immunity? disaster wipe whole civilization world doesn‚Äôt watch dread lmao. deep concern normal people living there, yes, sounds like important thing every country see how‚Äôs US doing. saying sure? Thanks contributing. Many US states size European countries it‚Äôs weird comparison. Every expert I've heard speak topic said secondary infections rare extremely unlikely serious. Thank you, makes lot sense. I‚Äôm EMT don‚Äôt get much in-hospital care, good perspective Maybe lot people want kill elderly parents relatives Thank too. remember feeling young, even without pandemic. There's lot fear missing out, fear once-in-a-lifetime opportunity pass ready it. pandemic must make intense. general think bit illusion. keep living roughly directions want to, things shake one way another time make-or-break situations few. There's usually many ways things go. Maybe miss socializing year, everyone comes next year meet someone then. Things take unexpected turns, never way seems mind. Yeah stayed home cat. 

Thanksgiving never really big deal family pretty easy decision. 

Even important holiday us, it‚Äôs worth it. I‚Äôll see months (hopefully). exactly pass pandemic? test. hope right, healtcare system collapses least simply resources treat even people anymore, death rate could skyrocket.  set records fuel sales week

Stop comparing two. Idk who‚Äôs downvoting ya sounds like good idea Living someone higher risk serious complications virus made accutely aware much people througly suck. really brought absolute worst heartbreaking say least.

Thanks part, might obvious us also taking seriously staying isolated. better yet, pay people stay home. Many people pushing reopening trying material needs met. government paid people stay home, like many wealthy nations did, would much better right now. Shut better cousins bashing.

This bullshit. post this? read post? lack understanding? Plus test results snap shot 4-5 days prior test date plus whatever reporting time was

Oh, yea, read post. Re-read try again.

Hint: quarantined 2 weeks. know Pfizer agreement EU supply hundreds millions doses vaccine approved right? I'm assuming trust US agencies, EU set approving Pfizer's vaccine soon well. add that, even multiple healthcare professionals communicate safe effective vaccine, would still trust it? understand concern hesitancy, complete distrust unhealthy  sure you‚Äôre getting you‚Äôre data, cases still rising. highest number new cases yet week ago.

 Yes covid serious filling hospitals.
No need spread misinformation interesting see fall super power real time. speaking Covid here. Would interesting know Romans end Roman empire said aware well going on. hearts.

Damn, man. families. ""Facts stubborn things."" - John Adams think, since ""president"" got virus quite sure recovered soon after, thought he's going change heart combat virus like people received karma. wrong. bought extra oxen family planned thanksgiving get together weeks ago. family told attending since things getting worse, live LA. laughed said it'll ok. Yesterday, uncle aunt tested positive virus. would went party, would infected whole family news talking about, ""this virus real, take serious"". party got cancelled thankfully.  Ebola also CFR 90%... 86% Covid cases asymptomatic.


So course lot spread covid people wont even know Covid 90% people Ebola die. people downvoting comment?

Because insane. guy said quarentined 2 weeks, got test, dinner people same.

That safe reasonably expect anything be, everyone took level caution, pandemic.

Complaining people took steps insanity, level ignorance situation find annoying. I'm relieved see common-sense post calling OP this. cautious. travelled see households. 

If swapping air people Thanksgiving immediate household, officials begged people do, part problem rather solution. Full stop. hard people grasp? Seriously? Disbelief? point Americans *not* gathering events would disbelief. 

I‚Äôm reminded George stupid average person is, realize half stupider that.

I‚Äôve come realize 50% live US. sad thing is, double lung transplant, bought time. think read somewhere life expectancy surgery like 10 years. still probably die way young. :( ‚ÄúTested positive‚Äù means 20% infection?

Proportionally many conspiracies made forgotten daily basis? utterly dwarfed. number true positives *tiny* compared number false positives.

You remember conspiracy theories category include wild conjectures people legitimately mentally ill indoctrinated extremism. 

It big issue people get preemptively mad conspiracies they're even proven true. attack others verbally/physically basis conjectures.

It's worth it. emotional, statistically unfounded, unreliable.

From famous analysis people drawn towards conspiracy ""First, conspiracy theories claim explain institutional analysis cannot. appear make sense world otherwise confusing.
* Second, appealingly simple way, dividing world sharply forces light, forces darkness. trace evil back single source, conspirators agents.
* Third, conspiracy theories often presented special, secret knowledge unknown unappreciated others. conspiracy theorists, masses brainwashed herd, conspiracy theorists know congratulate penetrating plotters' deceptions."" believe Taco Bell litmus test healthy someone‚Äôs gut flora is. 

Seems lot people terrible diets Taco Bell simply exacerbates it. Trump blame everything. snows winter Trump fault. heretics insane would argue otherwise. Rules thee. waiving right hospital care catch it? Outside spreading virus, vacation people Oregon enough eat behind bills Americans, feel love read *""it stop spread""* able test fast trials. 

It's also quite difficult test for, even like Astra Zeneca trial measure low virus levels nose throat, that's guarantee spread.

Most likely vaccine 90% efficacy also substantially prevent spread, opinion. Wow cool well substantiated things saying mentality that's problem. [article talking many people mindset negative test = green light socialize households Thanksgiving, problematic scale.

The pleas public health officials ""don't visit outside immediate household"". ""take deem super duper precautions travel go hang two households!""

This mentality ""well, WE'RE safe, took precautions, won' happen US!"" multiplied tens millions people exactly kind mentality that's going facilitate explosion cases. largest nurses‚Äô union nation revealed 31.5% 213 registered nurses died COVID-19 complications Filipino -- make 4% registered nurses U.S. People say things like ‚Äúthey counting flu respiratory illness Covid‚Äù I‚Äôve never provided evidence this, fact I‚Äôve seen accounts healthcare providers say opposite (that it‚Äôs likely underreported Covid). link evidence support claim? hospital sister-in-law works sent staff box water bottle, chocolates, thank card branded shit Thank working hard. went work right nursing school straight ended COVID-19 floor. said many quit burnout health issues nice gesture, nice retention bonus check. ‚ÄúLive free die.‚Äù mean liquor agents yes, correct.

This isn‚Äôt first incident we‚Äôve seen leader enacting restrictions breaking them.

Yeah, rest world ***really gives single shit*** god awful Hollywood blockbusters like Rambo VII: Dude Rocky Covered Blood Jungle, fucking whatever cup diarrhea Farrell shits pimply ass next.

But us even go outside celebrate. Good God, amount chauvinism homophobia (the ‚Äúarm shaving‚Äù comment) one single post. Good sir, regret inform rest world contend us Americans, matter much like pretend we‚Äôre planet own. It‚Äôs kind similar people take necessary precautions contain spread viral disease little treatments contend choices people throw caution wind apparently every good Christmas involves putting grandma immunocompromised cousin six feet under. 

I say someone long line military servicemen. Freedom free; pay cost personal accountability actions rather wanna paint red, white, blue bullshit not. Americans wanna show even deserve freedom cherish much, fucking act like you‚Äôre actually accountable results actions, like actual freedom entails. Americans got damn moon, learned split atom, today we‚Äôre debating merits wearing mask control virus defenses against. 

It‚Äôs shit like makes ashamed American. Stop thinking we‚Äôre great we‚Äôve killed people leaderships‚Äô incompetence recklessness, it‚Äôs embarrassment disgrace everything country founded upon. Freedom, ‚Äúfreedumb,‚Äù okay? Good. mean, PA, gyms arent requiring mask lifting. means disease vector responsible half. nice started forgetting him. think people saying 'elimination' still suspicion case two there. cases test waste water virus fragments turning one two places. we've met criteria elimination (two incubation cycles cases). gone, gone? recovered patients still shedding?  call places ""health club""  Witness Me! Ratlickers America 2020. Ok. tell what‚Äôs false article please.   It‚Äôs doubtful they‚Äôll change course point, largely worst probably behind them. Oh no! disagree, even Japan, saw insane amounts mask use even pandemic hit hard pandemic right now, hospitals Harvard virologist:

If asked likely stop epidemic ‚Äî vaccine community‚Äî would pick community 100/100 times. silver bullets here; begins ends us, relationships, sacrifices, concern other. Everything else tool.

Seeing videos Italy paupers graves dug prisoners NYC scared shit me. high school negligent, truly hope find way stay safe. That's incredibly irresponsible them. know. thought come terms it, recent news Canada behind really set back.

I've spent year alone, 200 square foot apartment, lost dream job opportunity, seen family friends trying responsible safe.

I'm sorry comment came selfish. want things safe again. mean,working sick people exactly job. sound storage peelewho refuse wear masks go huge gatherings treat them, ok it. appropriate PPE safety. canines come spooks get first. can't aft line They're surprised usage tray sick people. I'd also wager many afford fly. every American catches covid, even 99% survival rate still expect 2 million+ deaths.

And every American *lucky* enough catch it, every country world close borders us.

You need shut wear mask. Definitely. think lot Asian countries similar results overlooked. Americans anti-science anti-intellectual brainwashed ""civil liberties"" wish even simple this, example US's unchecked narcissism doomed us all.

The people who'd wrong things truly GET they, personally, die COVID. Even family members die, they're utter sociopaths child s.o. could die arms they'd be...numb. THEM, doesnt matter. even they're ventilator stroke luck survive, they'll think ""See? nothing. it, got better. widdle cold."" 

And worst part people going ones save triage, since ones comorbidities risk they'll say ""it's better saving morons it"", Darwin opposite it'll kill people care right thing.

...it's getting closer closer ""yeah, person get vaccine refuses wear mask, people wearing mask kill law view self-defense""- really getting ""anyone still wearing mask, ESPECIALLY know COVID, school shooter.""  Lol. experience, people horrible accessing priority perceived threats. Everyone‚Äôs doubling thanksgiving blow Christmas. Going sad one likely. Send news stories how.many people died direct traces back super spreader events weddings. actually one stories gave strength make decision attend TG year. gives us right feel like one exception? straight hubris selfishness. I'm honestly really sad parents family willing hurtful guilt us way. chance saying it...this actually least stressful Thanksgiving several years! Spent making pizza watching movies bf dog. mean Rome fell due violent war resulted capture Rome hated enemies I‚Äôm pretty sure definitely knew going on.

Also we‚Äôre seeing fall super power meaningful way. America continue richest country largest military power lifetimes. much return bipolar/multipolar power scheme world stage. 

Part decline America observable metrics we‚Äôre fine. It‚Äôs ‚Äúintangibles‚Äù poorly. probably aware it, care. Same. Melbourne cup day lost support lot Victorians could see ending next 15 years Jacobsen vs Boston

Hmm? ***Jacobson v. Massachusetts***, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), [United States Supreme case Court upheld authority states enforce [compulsory laws. Court's decision articulated view individual liberty absolute subject [police state. know told case, either totally misunderstood saying, lying you. really hate comparison fall Roman empire...

The fall Roman empire took hundreds years. People realize Caesar died almost 400 years Rome fell. Even Rome height, still looking 200-300 years fell. even then, half Roman empire lasted major another 600+ years.

If following pattern, America fall another 200 years split two half American empire lasting another 400 so. Truck stop Iowa. Give Geez many people know work close calls. go outdoor gathering keep small- family friends. 100% time co-worker told gathering like followed days later work, quarantining exposure. common themes wearing masks (it‚Äôs family, fine!) eating near eachother. 

Honestly, fuck that. stay home. Social gatherings wait year else won‚Äôt anyone left gather with. That‚Äôs crazy. take back liquor license, ban owners ever applying new one. Although concerns mRNA vaccines still, (mainly related long-term risk autoimmune disease), actually much ""cleaner"" traditional vaccines. 

You get injected actual virus, need grow virus eggs potentially harmful adjuvants needed etc.

If works hope mRNA vaccines going revolutionise medicine, including cancer treatment.üôÇ

Check Mecram YouTube detailed, (but easy understand) information Covid19 Montana one better looking states bit. I'd prefer Melbourne Cup day think they‚Äôre race see get herd immunity vaccine. Considering many untested asymmetric positives must mass distribution vaccine still number months away might make it. wonder many die consequence learn anything. Yup. locked hard Winter/early spring. Numbers peaked midwinter driven way way end first month spring. last month spring glorious zeroes. 


Worth noting Aus well truly control/eliminated Winter. state second wave due quarantine fuck allowed spread wee bit long locked down. thought that's I5 originally built for? Maybe I'm wrong though statements mutually exclusive.  football loved sport across america helps people athletes free mind stress what's going atm pfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffft. understand oxford covid vaccine alot scrutiny. top scientists think testing hold front kind regulatory board. 

Apparently up, facing alot questions. Idk article mention that... You‚Äôre idiot. texas new hampshire south.

i spent ample time both. overwhelming consensus among scientists come Wuhan lab. accident, workers would infected would easy trace. Accidents happened previous outbreaks, contained pretty easily. SARsCov2 escaped Wuhan lab lab workers got sick, would relatively easy contain spread. Nah, that‚Äôs long way family. Listing examples countries contained virus isn‚Äôt shifting goalposts. pointing idiotic statements like ‚Äúbut they‚Äôre island!‚Äù rarely hear MSM informing people it.

Its frustrating! Vitamin easy cheap supplement, could literally save life. **Especially** black brown. 

No one assume vitamin deficiency. got blood test last year make sure missing nutrients, really surprised minor deficiency. I'm vigilant healthy diet, I'm trail runner living Southern California.

There's small percentage people could die it. whole world shut this.  demonstrable say say ways implying would change? Try almost 50%. According google USA 263K according CDC you‚Äôre 114K deaths average counting. Bruh, life sad got charity tax write responding you. Eat another piece pie. That's rough. right thing. Good luck! 60%, specific. Meaning 40% ignoring Covid regulations precautions. Interesting, wonder I‚Äôve heard 40% ü§î "" even McDonalds looked busy ""

Holy fucking shit Fair, time believing people best interests mind somone completely different tax bracket, lifestyles would different well financial interests. I've use toaster therefore say ok. Countries like US UK couldn‚Äôt close borders Thailand can? hope kids grateful towards that!! Happy Thanksgiving! Yes, that's entirely American thing. solved it.

So anyway admit find kinds articles mumbo-jumbo.

I guess question go come contact someone else COVID, fully recovered, would still able possibly give me, even though probably get sick again? went girlfriend's tonight bunch friends dont know Thanksgiving making nervous since know people asthma. Come terms fact long time. none us control this. specific group people hang with. since pandemic started. small Thanksgiving us. 7 total kept space regardless mean gave Wuhan 3 days advanced notice everyone could get ahead travel ban.  using exact reasoning anti-maskers.

 depressed I've since July. want lose another year life. know how.i keep living like this. One thing note clinical trials often take long normal vaccine development partly takes long time reach statistically significant number people infected test groups.

Since one intentionally infected trial wait long periods time enough people get naturally infected test efficacy etc. pandemic happens much faster many people get infected.

The extra 5-10 years better nothing, same, wish could stay home wear masks prevent long, slow deaths like one. fucking perfect bud. It‚Äôa pretty easy, don‚Äôt dumb cunt. pisses fuck off. first year spent Thanksgiving without family. parents live Mexico sis moved earlier year Texas. I‚Äôm alone California closest family living Tucson. really REALLY wanted go Texas spend holiday myself. I‚Äôve really bummed day, knew smart thing stay home.

That's *total number passengers* logged TSA.

It's increase prior weeks much, October/November 5-6m range.

I also think really comparable single massive superspreader event like Sturgis. Funny one said BLM protests Biden win/Trump loss celebrations. household stayed made KBBQ home. dont understand people cant stay put.. Thanksgiving another Thursday name attached. Traveling gathering pandemic seems selfish AF  virus weak people say, worst case scenario stay inside couple years. virus bad people say, worst case, could end dead coulda lot others. 

I'm happy sacrifice time, I've got many years ahead me. I'd rather bored cautious inside 1% life even slightly elevated risk becoming ill spreading it.

Thank you. You‚Äôre great job, really appreciate lot. even comment shit like this? know full well that's article about.  pandemic over. Covid19 endemic, like influenza. 99.5% survival rate, that's good. otherwise healthy, nothing fear. Stop bedwetter. I've worked giving vaccines early talk certainly sound like need greater emphasis placed potential effects need important point emphasize public. definitely crucial communicate honestly order gain widespread acceptance. 

The ""deal it"" attitude comes frustration general vaccine skepticism. Common childhood vaccines safe significant side-effects rare overall benefit society clear. matter much research communication put still significant number people push back disinformation. issue work well diseases prevent uncommon see concern individual level apparent significant risk all, people possess skills property evaluate information themselves. 

As articles rightly discuss (this third I've seen week study even published) likely different conversation disease common immune reactions much pronounced. Concern skepticism case reasonable reasons general public's nervousness mostly anti-vax false misleading information pushed years. 

I would speculate right downside quick development cycle titrated dose maximum efficacy trade-off noticeable immune reaction. Pfizer vaccine seems significant medical intervention required 20,000 vaccine arm. need read Moderna results time government confirmed order Pfizer Moderna likely one initial priority group.

I'm sure. Survival dumbest mean bit logic youre working covid patients day every day youre likely going wind getting it. wearing ppe definitely bug chasing point tho I'm pretty sure health care workers get tested weekly. 

At least that's schedule health care workers retirement homes. nurses. grocery store workers? Gas station attendants? Landscapers? Teachers? essential workers?? Different comparable country here. relative worked janitor care home 1st wave, living someone symptoms, several residents confirmed cases. tell staff that, relative allowed take time without symptomatic. also tests widely available, sick relative get test either. quit, there's every chance asymptomatically passed one way other. relative still alive, half care home ground now.

Okay Hogan also public health expert means. really don‚Äôt much time tbh population clearly stopped caring governments real problems trying control thing I'm even sure getting at. posted old article longer relevant, therefore quite misleading. read article... two half weeks ago. first totally true infuriating. Idk areas talking I‚Äôm tested weekly protocol ( more) months now. general population seem cars anyway: socializing apparently reason live USA Yeah...that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening here.  too! Got flu jab thinking, pretty soon covid one!  It‚Äôs hard us even find someone test us timely manner we‚Äôve exposed. days. even we‚Äôre positive, want us work unless we‚Äôre sick manage it. We‚Äôre exhausted. We‚Äôve going nonstop year, last fall early winter icu super busy adult rsv plus flu. many colleagues injured work. patients sick. intubated sedated, also paralyzed prone onto belly every day. unit 3 back injuries one bad shoulder injury. realized we‚Äôre disposable cogs system. We‚Äôre putting health, safety, sanity line don‚Äôt give af. Short staffing every day. Short staffing puts patients licensure risk. beg pick work 16. Daily. 

We get lot lip service, fuck that. We‚Äôre heros. We‚Äôre professional thing we‚Äôve always done, used get break. used lulls census. used able go work laugh decompress together. 

It‚Äôs 9 months later STILL don‚Äôt enough ppe. We‚Äôre still reusing n95s despite studies showing efficacy declines greatly two days. wonder we‚Äôre getting sick. depressing. honestly waiting suicides start doctors nurses. 9 months overwhelming traumatic stressful work. People remotely ok. Cool. Speech protected USA long inciting immediate violence shouting something cause panic crowd.  choose distribute tests. Give ""us"" credit 1. good 2. powerless. seem like American solution American problem get saying, really matter millions tests done nurses. one nurses going untested need them, that's problem (although would nice get exact number can't get tested(.

The numbers athletes demonstrates testing capacity there. understand ‚Äúmuh freedum‚Äù angle, aren‚Äôt scared becoming sick? think it‚Äôs real, it‚Äôs harmless? 1C last night I‚Äôve got close friendships I‚Äôd hate leave. I‚Äôd rather work help create America want leave right now. said missed point comment, jfc. (Twice!)

Why fearmongering testing impossible task? one near literally drive up, wait car, get test, results mailed. portrayal monumental event might discourage people going. 

Bottom line (and point you‚Äôre going miss again): 

Tests available. NFL players getting tested many times prevent nurses tested Watching sports, then, longer represents escape reality Sandoval. Instead, says, it‚Äôs signal nation prioritizes

That would employer prioritizes. Spending money nurses employees general seen cost center seek reduce means can. clog like champion! actually two right now, it‚Äôs insanity. type have? 11 years good run! They‚Äôre pretty archaic scheme medical devices. freaking Bluetooth pacemaker Medtronic monitored thing nightstand can‚Äôt figure valve doesn‚Äôt clog. hope replacement lasts least long one you‚Äôve got üôÉ  Yep wife nurse ER treating positive patients almost year now. hospital set employee testing program, make appointment due short supply, wait list 60 days point.

Her options either pay pocket get tested admit ER get tested. bullshit. Alabama Mississippi don‚Äôt know pity didn‚Äôt think useful first still kinda dontü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

But guess I‚Äôm going wear least it‚Äôs respect life people around me. It‚Äôs hard ask wear one. It‚Äôs wild mfers still try fit wearing one even now. clearly understand.

I want help understand.

Good day Spoken like anti-maskers insane narcissists insane sociopaths. That's whole problem. There's many people, especially America, truly believe everyone else simple bother people think hoax go ER demand bed saying ""WOE ME, GOT COVID"", likely demanding use ventilator even sniffle fever 98.7. unlimited paid sick leav

yeah got sick im gonna take next 4 years off. Ah, *that‚Äôs why* there‚Äôs much shilling 62% effective vaccine. Vaccine nationalism. Coronavirus killed 250,000 Americans point. wearing masks started number would far less. great chance reduce number deaths next great pandemic could happen moment. require masks limit gathering people household future coronavirus could never even close amount damage.

Also think lives could save preventing flu/cold deaths. really hard keep damn piece cloth face save 50,000 lives flu every year. makes sense I've seen great number Filipino nurses working long term care facilities nursing homes. Supposedly even facilities make vaccines put money Sturgis I'd throw money go fund put face billboard saying ""asks citizens stay protect family.. flys away thanksgiving"" She‚Äôs far me. Tennesseans absolutely give fuck. distance wear mask. can‚Äôt help exposed day work idiots. yes know I‚Äôm lucky really don‚Äôt think economic mental health sacrifices isolation last like 3 years worth it. Obviously currently necessary meant lack knowing end date miserable it‚Äôs exacerbating OCD along working exposed environment I‚Äôm non stop anxious depressed. last article read states everyone wants vaccinated able September 2021 worth. 

Edit: information Canada. asshole. Zero reason believe population density anything it. MN Dakotas, dense urban areas significantly lower per capita infections, hospitalizations, deaths fucking men. Keep saying polidiots realize Biden going kind scum. Always 29. Slightly overweight avid runner/exerciser resting HR around 50. comorbidities. Kansas. Local decision. County even opt mask mandate. Ask multi-billion dollar insurance companies they're paying anyone jackshit. healthcare system designed handle event like provider, patient payer side. designed purely individual use specific circumstances, fee schedules outdated. reason athletes get special treatment bosses throwing money everyone trying keep industry collapsing one worst written series paragraphs long time.

Good news though. rights freedoms doing? /s think huge factor outdoors huge ventilation virus less likely spread warmer temperatures vs cold dry temperatures people gathering indoors less ventilation. Also feel like less people fatigued social distancing vs now. couple months atp, September people it. tbh worst time get lazy sadly Congrats country isn‚Äôt completely assbackwards. I‚Äôm sure Danes issues, I‚Äôd rather ours. Imagine stressed, depressed, scared, resources except street with. remember last good meal, sleep deprived businesses, cops assholes think funny wake move along every night. 

It takes hell lot energy motivation walk one city another, let alone hundreds/thousands miles move warmer climate. Luckily, free market automatically adjust provide whole bunch brand new doctors nurses meet additional demand. 

Of course, they'll arrive 10 years late, way. hold tight.  local state governments limit flights travel past weeks, think they'll able shut cities states?

It really helping big names past month flaunting restrictions proposed. Covid Christmas. Might get little confusing Johnson Johnson vaccine eventually comes out.

""Hey gotten Johnson?""

""I got two Johnsons, actually"" ""south"" living in? USA.

Dude. conservative america hates women conservativism exists maintain current status quo go back time name 'tradition'. know, times life good white men shit women minorities.

The south incredibly conservative. I'll let follow logic there. It‚Äôs losing profit nurses it‚Äôs medical care since people treating COVID likely contract it.  Looks like point flew fucking head mile. life. make best choices right now, since we‚Äôre survival thing. Good luck personal journey. That¬¥s nice I¬¥ve saying decade, ready ICT way implement it. course ICT¬¥ers downmodded ridiculed me.

It seems pandemic makes people wiser now. last 10 years predicted roughly two years advance things come - did. warned cyber-bullying, sexual predation, 'facebook murder', ICT-controlled sex toys, name it.

I discussed tech sites place. People wanna know see attack science technology, technology gadgets use addicted to.

I've defended human right privacy long. I've argued till saw blue face since time backed off. People damn dumb even understand dangers involved.  jail 

S/ Actually everyone scared go hiding homes, de facto lockdown, matter says. get lebron money also simp China Ah, you‚Äôre *that* patient. 33k tests nationally Japan nearly record-high new cases. Say want fact many deaths, testing capacity absolute shit getting much better, 10 months pandemic. love majority populace can‚Äôt stand little hardship ones quick call someone snowflake complain real hardship. 

I glad get back United State America instead United States Hypocrisy. including political parties generalization. Wait, what? thought testing free atm due federal mandate? gotten tested 4 times paid $0 Virginia Maryland. cannot die covid already dead thoughts you: 

1. get back ""normal"" day. long find vaccine (I sincerely get it.. number deaths mind blowing) hit herd immunity. 
2. scenario survival. facing devastating virus. People disappearing quickly. (This like lung cancer smoking take 20+ years kill someone.. people gone 2 weeks)
3. 20 years old, ""having fun"" college classes historically, nationally, globally unbelievably fortunate thing have. (Only 47% Americans achieve 2 year better degree 34) 20 year olds world working pretty hard make ends meet, they're trying gain experience despite higher level Like people really think accept living like rest youth one person doesn‚Äôt die 2022??

This ""1 death"" .. large disaster daily, getting worse.

Your dumbass got said wrong AGAIN. Holy shit. Dude come on. can‚Äôt dumb

And thoughts last bit? nurses employer provide tests needed. 

That ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NFL.

Like absolutely nothing NFL. 

Which article trash. Stop getting news Washington post lmao whats stopping nurses going get test? Weird keep changing story. wonder many people expressing outrage will, next available election, still vote free-market capitalists vote all. simply political issue. long societies set way prioritizes profit everything else, cannot prevented happening. really understand issue here. I'm highschool student gotten tested 5 times throughout pandemic. That's good point, especially since football federally funded. live, super easy get tested even medical worker. every state family friends in. Never encountered difficulties tested could there. absolutely right wrong, significantly huge increase cases nationally mid November.

I remember people watching huge spike Spring Break, July 4th, Labor day. spike, nothing like right now. wanted relay thoughts that. Altering thinking would good thing Canada dropped ball vaccine contracts. Sorry, federal government dropped ball. 

They super late signing vaccine contracts, months countries already so. don‚Äôt vaccine production capabilities, wait other.m countries produce vaccines, vaccinate populations, produce more, send us.

I think federal government said day expect 6M vaccines March. 3M people vaccinated. Less 10% population. 

Our PM made statement today saying, ‚Äúit‚Äôs start, it‚Äôs finish‚Äù. damn well hope Canada isn‚Äôt going slowly vaccinating 3 Million Canadians every 3 months vaccines slowly rolling in. takes 3 months secure 6M doses, better damn well ready receive vaccinate rest us 3 months follow ..... 

I don‚Äôt want sitting October, told avoid family thanksgiving again, US football stadiums packed. better plan get jabs arms rates never seen before, order play catch up. I'm sure agree everyone supports meritocracy. Im highschool student I've tested 5 times. state yall live lol Tears Covid Heaven?  old lady works medical field covid patients. go Rite Aid get tested. hospital give shit. 1) there‚Äôs housekeeper, y‚Äôall damn important keeping people healthy hospitals

2) starting get little upset there‚Äôs random testing wife, she‚Äôs one docs county even coworkers taken CoVID19 hasn‚Äôt sent get test hospital admin. research works...

That's certainly research works, drug approval works US. 

The FDA say, ""oh wow, published X journal, guess approve market now"" Similar complaint (to say least) me, restaurant industry. close dining rooms Minnesota corporate us store management get zoom call talk us details closing back up, corporate head rooms home. Telling us need put tables back pre-covid set ""looks nice"" dumb shit. Like okay, let's increase amount surfaces random people touch.

Then CEO sends ""I'm thankful for..."" email saying he's thankful ""QA team facing brunt unprecedented times..."" I'm like wait, us workers ya know, actually running stores facing least 200 people day? guys probably holed cozy houses. GTFO here. mention stalling drug trials way long. pandemic, drug companies cut corners, odds cut corners lead significant deaths vaccine incredibly low odds saving thousands earlier vaccine incredibly high. dude trying make money lol. I‚Äôd argue opposite. athlete offer society? One million not, lowliest Walmart shelf stocker cashier much important job day day living.

You don‚Äôt think it, society would fall apart days grocery stores stop thing. Could say athlete sport? I'd agree job employer could force work holiday, gig work either people think extra incentives worth it, genuinely need money. Otherwise working day. That's per capita means lol could said teachers. think biggest issue never signed sacrifice lives all. =/ needs take ass CVS get free test. I‚Äôm earth u waiting government job it. yes, currently severe issue, think blowing things way proportion say cause collapse United States. Vaccines done produced, end next year.  

To give perspective, United States 330 million people living it. 12 million confirmed cases covid observed, 260,000 confirmed deaths. That's 2% fatality rate, assume bad taking account unobserved asymptomatic spread. Plague Justinian lasted 8 years killed fifth people living Constantinople. black death killed 30 60 percent people living Europe.

So yes, covid pandemic mismanaged political leadership (mostly federal level) economic fallout devastating many, yes, medical system danger collapsing (you could argue private medical industry collapsing good thing gets us kind single payer system faster). However, let's drive crazy anxiety right now. getting worse light end tunnel. Continue social distancing eating masks worry much it.  proven density measurable effect pandemic outcomes. I.e. compare SF NYC South Dakota Vermont. dime, quarantine, employers fire fulfilling duties veiled excuse. 

This outside realm possibilities shitty things ~~ah, yes, capitalism, ensuring get paid peoples misery.~~ ER, I'm scientist, even though I've dedicated life advancement man, get paid work? testing good idea, mandate it??

**/s** (I swear!)

^(I hate easy anticipate batshit crazy retorts almost reasonable course action policy might result in.) National Retail Federation CEO Matthew Shay Friday said lobbying group forecast record high holiday spending year

What kind forecast ended spitting garbage, Mr. Shay? straight-line linear extrapolation previous years? Record unemployment, reduced operating hours, outright closures areas, forecast highest revenue yet? one trusts lobby groups complain about...anything. 

Give break. Sports bring billions dollars partially spread public, team staff stadium employees local businesses.

I wonder tests supplied healthcare workers free companies? make new team put Pence charge? take communication responsibility away cdc bear responsibly so.


There's many others lot people.

Usually relative financial political importance. 

Politicians athletes high that. Citations Needed podcast whole episode news articles giving advice mental health, big reason mental health bad people need secure housing, food, money, basics fear losing them.

It sucks media feels ok giving us advice cope government's failure give citizens secure healthy place live, pointing there's huge solution this, GIVE PEOPLE MONEY ? retail business. 

It's madness. Send help. 

I'm going fucking get sick selfish company today, fucking know it. could stand mirror practice stance expression delight. know, time comes.

Just pray don¬¥t miss. would take years reach herd immunity naturally. would different nurses posters comments lie? varies tremendously throughout US. what?! Cant true. Limping along always works. 

Like want change oil car sounds like much work right let go right? extra 10k miles without changing fine. even know reduced life sometime road anyways. mean ‚Äúallowed‚Äù? live LA get free testing here. Results 4-5 days. New Jersey reported numbers hospitalizationd apparently went hard believe. I'm meaning come way. apologies.

I like sports. Specifically basketball. also know basketball ceased exist whatever, I'd find something else enjoy, enjoy things still around.

Again, I'm definitely saying get rid sports.  Glorious China!

If talk it, goes away, duh. still mind control. say? point vaccine able reworked whatever new mutation occurs. I‚Äôm pretty sure always grift Clapton. Y‚Äôall thought y‚Äôall important huh üòÇ. Money rules everything know country that's legal even America. tell employee get tested virus let alone widespreading pandemic virus. People drastically estimate ability resist allure false happiness promised via advertising ‚Äî case child marketing, leverages know psychology manufacture lifelong brand loyalty  final arbiter FDA, international counterparts.  Journal shmournal, regulators making decisions.  

The peer reviewed journals highly rated.  See Lancet MMR causes Autism among fiascos.  Also see ""replication crisis"".   

Some find opinion offputting.  truth. Would made feel better got quarantined abandoned shack? state experiencing deaths ever before, correlating huge spike cases hospitalizations. happening, right now. hospital hovering near capacity now, depending admissions discharges. that. hospital work for, get ordered hospital get tested, done free cost. opt get tested own, pay it. want spend to. [A picture federal government Yeah, we've met outside, Dad's house 7 minutes insisted thanksgiving food exchange, extended indoor activities? Absolutely not. Dear nurses, test positive get 2 weeks leave without pay... love, corporate hospital management. irony end it, way teeth mouth ever actually jaw, can't shit them! wife nurse figures getting tested pointless, test valid next point contact anyone anything. 
So showing symptoms, get tested going dealing patients anyway? Nuance language non-maskers understand. üôÑ way get way allows recourse. always verbal, closed door meeting. One one. They've know get around that.

Have considered surreptitiously recording conversations 2-party consent state. want talk problems I'm talk. Genuinely telling healthy good mean people whether online person politics. Licking doorknobs illegal planets Spent thanksgiving social distancing blast. Little demonic gremlins filters.
 
Most importantly long hours cooking turkey.

If get thanksgiving ‚Äúcyberly ‚Äú handle chrismas easily Asking people deal could turkey friends selfish, whilst trying protect ones vulnerable virus Daily COVID-19 Data Get Weird: 

""First, Thanksgiving Day perhaps early Wednesday, three metrics flatten drop, probably several days. **This decrease make look like things getting better** national level. Then, week following holiday, test, case, death numbers spike, look like confirmation Thanksgiving causing outbreaks worsen. **But neither expected movements data necessarily mean anything state pandemic itself.""** 

 Good article worth read. two weeks, right hospitals capacity. I'm surgeon, refuse patient transfer last night needed emergency surgery staff care her. hope able find another hospital could. support recounts anywhere Trump wants one want reinforce yes, LOST. Ridiculous Thank asking! first days rough; tired head killing me. it‚Äôs bad cough sore throat. still get suddenly tired fall asleep without even meaning to, think I‚Äôm up. quarantining protect vulnerable. :) literally can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs like healthcare worker, mid major D1 coach, don‚Äôt want us get tested either. got covid almost month ago get tested CVS. Sports medicine legitimately mad got tested. 

I feel bad god feel worse them. Nobody cares people care us. I‚Äôm empty compassion point. Another red helicopter flew hospital behind home morning. almost never used see used. 

People deliberately defying expert advice‚Äîand conspiracy/hoax types either‚Äîthat could save lives completely selfish refuse take responsibility themselves.

There zero support real appreciation people right thing despite hardship trying save people. care innocent people getting harmed them. wish way prioritize people make people choosing part sign waiver puts back line triage. It‚Äôs messed thinking I‚Äôm done. muscle aches cramping? cramp night calf like 4 morning woke yelling pain. I've never cramp bad life. work RN care covid patients intermittently. symptoms ever still hurts 3 days later. Nah mean general. Like 2023 settled... would still stay move? always wonder threshold immigration is. Sure obvious ones war, persecution, environmental catastrophes like earthquake hurricanes. 

But take nurse OPs article. Presumably qualification high demand (certainly Canada nurses always demand) yes there‚Äôs inconvenience emotional trauma leaving home...... she‚Äôs gotta think there‚Äôs somewhere better her??? Asking people comply stupid mandates you‚Äôre afraid selfish. shoe fits, know put want see one teachers next. 10 grand per 8 shifts DFW Never underestimate degree humans think low odds = zero.

Plus there's weird psychological effect risk taking. feel risk forced you, 1 10,000 chances death serious injury limit people start refusing/being uncomfortable. taking yourself, like 1 100. People drive drunk get mad throw small rock head, likely hurt badly? world hurt, half populace cannot stand even tiny bit hardship.

Please, overlook conservative leaders country allowed virus spread let people die inaction indifference. sound like Grinch. That's selfish thing I've seen day. Take good look article cus talking directly people like start getting tested July. Im sorry actual politician, degree political science etc, cast vote left arguing opinion like rest us?

Honest question. curious. derisive.  They‚Äôre actually cable news many cable satellite tv systems.

Sean Spicer show tells anything.

Everyone spend little time watching better understand side insanity. protested inequality social justice took over. Ever wonder happened occupy wall Street? elite used race divide us. Occupy start revolution fizzled. Yes. It‚Äôs different ballgame national leadership denial actively encouraging people ignore BASIC precautions. America right now. News bad it‚Äôs really bad here. 8 months people still treat covid like magic space virus 0 characteristics shared anything else? herd immunity long-term strategy viable varying levels immunity population still lower transmission level. dont see explanation india bangladesh basically letting rip seeing peaks agree ""find middle ground"" kind fight. objectively wrong, destructive, backwards, downright medieval. change minds? top down, need restructure everything, going happen.

I blame looking elsewhere. trouble is, US falls, worry we're interconnected rest world fucked, too.

To say nothing climate change... see good day also put in? also it! sucks! thought heart attack! college time luckily tuition covered medical expenses too, thought sure going major issues. doctor said costochondritis like huh? really much me, like ""oh give rx zit forehead."" hahahahaha. minimum, running another trial would take several months, could providing badly needed jabs..

Awaiting developments.. theory there's multitude benefits social credit/tracking, trust bastards immediately abuse shit SOL?

Edit: shit outta luck!! Ty lmao 

Problem live basically people public without mask cops. Yeah, like everywhere Fed government national policy services like almost every first world country.

My point LA nurses complaining here, it‚Äôs hard understand bitter tested employers tests readily available specifically here. anywhere else country might understand complaints more. lighten buttercup. go make white privledged husband sandwich  Nobody quoting numbers end day Monday earliest. Cases dropping substantially. Looks like might end weathering storm. mRNA scary powerful. matter time someone tries use technology crazy evil intentions.  case vaccines, approval group needs understand works well enough verify something nefarious.

But time, number White drug prisoner admissions increased 671 (from 2464 1986 3135 1999), number African American drug prisoner admissions increased 4,837 admissions (from 1352 6189).

As such, increase African American admissions prisons drug offenses 7 times greater increase admissions White drug offenders. African American admissions drug offenses represented 81% growth state‚Äôs use prison drug offenses 1986 whatever mistakes made land jail past helps find work they‚Äôre set free.

I think getting sorts certifications/certificates work. Besides fact none data even reported released past week, Moderna‚Äôs Pfizer‚Äôs trials included far people (6X people). Even sent test kits every participant, trials run completely differently countries data practically useless. 

Redditors regurgitating useless irrelevant point effort discredit far credible results firms. Title seems context. said lockdown necessary *if* everyone followed basic principles. Since happening, lockdown probably necessary.  willing rural. US, rural area teachers paid minimum wage. Bugger off. That‚Äôs interesting, remember beginning initial lockdown March/April, state govt posted detailed info specific businesses categorized essential non-essential. worked food distribution company (at time), employer actually gave us documents stating worked essential business case stopped. Granted, state-wide initiative I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs difficult enforce city municipality. you‚Äôre healthcare somehow magically excluded asymptomatic carrier. Nice. mad...calm lol.

I could care less choose do.

You're one saying people say ""fuck it"" whatever want see leader (who probably despise anyway) following ""their own"" rules. 

And I'm saying, that's exactly problem rules thee rules me. bother blaming leaders ""leading example"" people dumb enough objectively stupid things purpose see leader it?

I guess free thinking rational rugged individualist bootstrappers claim look Newsom's personal actions determining factor do. That's exactly examples ""idiotic"" -- seriously...if Newsom said ""don't smoke crack"" lit pipe daily briefing, would too? Let go get covid...who cares?

Also lol achieving enlightenment by...thinking caring others relates behavior? knew would easy?! said good day! get training quickly. Hospitals fighting staff available every state hit. Can't even bring country countries hit. Anyone else watch Kevin Hart's new special, might speaking 'hyperbole' admits doctor literally come house EARLY give wife test buying n95 masks well.

$$$$$$ solves lot problems.  sounds like wild, paranoid politically driven overgeneralization - all? - health officials. would every single health official suddenly want say ""whatever left wants say""? strike utterly implausible? seems pretty busy Walmart. work grocery bad general merchandise side seems kinda crowded. One thing I‚Äôm really hoping see - Canadian - steady drop cases/deaths/hospitalizations steady return normal vaccine gets administered 5 10 percent English/US population coming months. Even don‚Äôt get vaccines March/April (Thanks Trudeau...) look countries see glimpse future motivating. So, hard move iceland? seem like bright folks. sort people need set? Many states fortunately treating covid compensable Workers' Comp deemed Occupational illness/disease. Although need provide proof/make reasonable case contracted covid course employment. Healthcare workers definitely eligible Workers' Comp contract covid employees non-healthcare settings may difficult time. Hopefully Workers' rights prevail corporate profit I'm holding breathe. placebo different vaccine. However, believe side effects mild. think people take covid serious mostly aware it.

I'd question this. personal anecdote, many friends take pandemic seriously (and nurses) know thing Vitamin told send research. Even then, many really budged nutrition &amp; intake Vitamin D. ¬•2.09 million = US$21000. clarifying choices make, options access to. CaNt HaCk CaUsE iM FuCkInG lOsEr aSs oNlInE dUlLs pAiN Yeah dude, complete opposite loved workout gym. Obviously couldnt happen anymore. cases got low, brother let use practically abandoned apartment gym awesome. Started feeling better. state one worst country cant anymore. sucks. click link? specialists. can't hire exist. says takes 2 years extra training. folks, Chinese propaganda working America. go ahead move homie. even sure would share newsmax story n=1 anecdote next up: ‚Äúkilling potential murderers order prevent murder‚Äù. Btw. don‚Äôt think thet even actual covid tests, It‚Äôs cough-you die think people care? I‚Äôm starting think don‚Äôt care. future, please keep mind: edited titles, case tracker posts. Leaving there's much point removing day-old thread. That‚Äôs hospitals fault. cousin weekly tests. do. 

I wear mask wash hands even give fuck anymore get sick. I'll everything power make anyone else sick. Mind ask state in?

The comment literally says ""In Texas"" husband Respiratory Therapist working Covid ICU. He‚Äôs exposed coworkers twice hospital won‚Äôt test him. It‚Äôs beyond infuriating he‚Äôs tested least weekly. Yeah St. Louis Mercy hospital (where works) that‚Äôs told go. made effort point another direction contacted. sickening world say shit complain about, CA except surgical masks left wanting PPE. reuse gowns N95's anymore, there's always visors available, one complains take three times much cavicide us start shift. Tests literally free, go make appointment drive-thru testing center get tested. see problem say, say?? We're world hurt 1% people willing slightly fewer zeros completely digital bank account. anti-maskers profitable obscenely wealthy. Case point. easy cheap supplement, could literally save life.    black brown.

I agree (being Filipino supplemented Vitamin almost 2 decades). BUT, imo think general population regardless class education know much, when, to/or food, doses, etc. like nutrition general.  also believe masks work.


It seems based viewers like idea not. dream worse... would pulling teeth hard possible reason decided stop... Clapton prick long time. Van turned unfunny Danny Devito decade ago. guess don‚Äôt want find out.

The new ""Don't Ask, Tell"". nurses hospital workers question. going yeahhe vaccine rolls weeks? not? talking Sweden? Makes wonder went evicted. Speaking personal experience, terrible place pneumonia. Thin air elevation brutal. regret palpable.  Americans like Depends fabrics yes. wear surgical N95 help last longer. IIRC doubling surgical cotton surgical helpful.  hospital won‚Äôt test us unless walk er symptoms patient. Every hospital city way. can‚Äôt speak nursing homes, good one what‚Äôs right. amount times covid unit admitted half care home employee working asymptomatic ie jaw dropping. What's difference baby bag cocaine? fall mouth. fall mouth accidentally crunch teeth. know US #11 deaths per capita around world, right? Tests confirm. Pretend every body infected. Wear mask gloves too. Sanitize hands touching anything. touch face. Change clothes. Registered Nurse wife, see covid patients daily neither us ever infected 7 months. nurses know right trying go either travel nurse CCT nurse. Travel nurse makes bank CCT nurse makes much floor, possibly more, deal one patient time, get perks EMS (time base, partners literally kill you, BBQ's) without rest downsides like run like dog disrespect hospital staff. effortlessly prove. 

Lol, doing? Look whole story made me, merely made suggestion even presented absolute. I'm sorry personal issue this, thought possible trouble miscommunication rather asshole ""zombie imposter"" called him. mean offense seem taking personally strange way, hate autistic wonder life doesn‚Äôt act way want to?

Well, suppose could better, considering look post history, see repeatedly talking labor issues (the important issue me), unilaterally claim I'm lying supporting worker rights. undercover therapist, need one. would never claim issues areas, look yourself. Americans sort set global tone, though, whereas Brits anymore. sun set British Empire ago. get cool black soot face every fresh hit  admit I‚Äôve said ‚Äòfuck it‚Äô started dating. I‚Äôm gonna tell someone like, ‚Äúoh hey I‚Äôll see ya next year‚Äù happening Pretty much seen civil unrest increase since pandemic started it‚Äôs quite clear continue Hahah. ate enough get buzz, know shroom buzzed nauseous full blown rapid heart rate panic attack, still clear mind hallucinating. actually good thing. 

Government mandated medication kind super iffy one issues ""slippery slope"" argument hyperbolic. Additionally, think pretty clear politicizing vaccines even result pushback lower compliance. People hesitant get vaccinated would much likely go ahead thought idea might help job prospects, rather Joe Biden made it. point, mandating vaccines would simply pour gasoline already massive fire conspiratorial fear that's raging across country. one common nightmares already lol right thing time given information had. quick decision needed made dont play video games board games. enjoy shooting ammo hard find getting pricey I'm ny last thousand rounds  enjoy going bars etc often consider ""entertainment"" ""hobby"" I'm sure there's something else enjoyable fall back football far favorite. curve flattened...and unflattened, requires maintenance. like tear ACL get surgery repair go physical therapy afterwards, surgeon's fault can't run anymore. people understand adequately implement advice mean explained; everything people's behaviors credentials health officials trying undermine.

Also, lest forget non-compliance direct result business political community putting intense pressure health officials sign re-opening plans always dangerous. bars restaurants gyms whining ""we complied guidelines!"" despite fact people like Fauci clear since day 1 guarantee safety, even guidelines, types environments. ‚Äúfront-line‚Äù worker? saying Sandoval works bagging groceries Publix? said significant side effects, severe. read article they‚Äôre listed. Myalgia (being miserable one everyone I‚Äôve spoken to), headache, fever, nausea, fatigue... one person described ‚Äúthe worst hangover ever‚Äù...  2here Canada? I'm confused paying test thing. 2here would even go pay test. went drive testing Saskatchewan. refererral needed, pay anything. ReSpEcT TrOoPs 

Also, can‚Äôt possibly inconvenienced little bit save American lives well-being. nation morons. unironically shout nothing could done family mad bc called aunt plague rat posted FB Live video &amp; cousin church maskless singing 35 people....I refused apologize &amp; aunt called mom bitching.  He's Hungarian tell comment history. right wing Hungarian that. dunno dread entertainment point. like giving idiot loaded gun, matter time shoots somehow again. Ya can't fix stupid. initial lockdown delayed couple days could attend hillsong event iirc... RemindMe! 8 days don‚Äôt like everything party. example guns banned. like support illegal migration builds wall. also like liberal SJW. don‚Äôt like message people vote someone woman.

It like Trump favourite, seems least bad. That‚Äôs true brush us government works relation states rights going miss fox OAN becomes popular. moved US Australia early 2019 2nd Thanksgiving away home.

My brother seems one family back home taking seriously. Mom Step-Dad can... recently diagnosed kidney failure Covid would something survives. found brother driving force behind Mom dinner. flat said would attend did. cancelled plans.

I spoke Mom video chat yesterday got caught everything. Step-Sister, newborn baby oldest daughter tested positive. Apparently dance class considered ""non-essential"".

Meanwhile Australia good shape get togethers. I'm Thanksgiving dinner Aussie friends weekend. They're excited take part American holiday they've never celebrated I'm thrilled able share it.

My wife taken heat posting social media. lot American family friends say things like ""rubbing faces"". work got numbers dramatically. Nothing stopping same. ""MUH FREEDUMBS"" important wearing mask staying home. 2 damn months wife sat home, leaving house groceries. earned return city markets... parks full smiling faces... bike rides... sit restaurants. Instead mad us able return life mad country failing badly.

My sympathies Americans trying best stop shit, undermined selfish assholes can't think anyone themselves. Yes, I'm pretty sure does. 

Also, real cool downvotes guy saying lying. Real supportive guys. numbers disagree you.2nd highest number cases state. even post here? waste energy? thing won‚Äôt go away everyone gets vaccinated. waste time energy? McGowan radio says he'd SA, shut things fast contain.

It's really worst way deal things tbh, still puts us far far better position first wave, seeing testing still limited back then. contained one. virus doesn‚Äôt really care think feel anything. Fairness isn‚Äôt real thing exists real world. people‚Äôs invisible thoughts opinions oppressing you. sucks don‚Äôt get wanted days us actually closed businesses lost huge amounts money year didn‚Äôt want carry guilt made people sick. anything random person help all? feel awful everytime see someone flaunting rules people really suffer results fault own. 

The mix cuts hospital things continually get worse boggles mind. 

Thank hard work. medical professionals there. people taking seriously appreciate do. wild trip like that. Dallas San Diego Lake Tahoe 3 days Sequoia 4 days San Diego Dallas. 

My drive 24 hours straight (including stops) Dallas San Diego. highly recommend getting hotel *not* 24 hours straight. wonderful thing. anti-mask conspiracy bullshit.

So willing cheer total control people done governments Orban Hungary GOP US well, drop democracy transition total dictatorship time someone agree power?

Not sure I'd appreciate total control media social media Trump administration.  Yes, I've done several times. Worth it. Came write exact thing. Fauci never said opposed lock down. whole conversation basically people follow guidelines would come lock down. Hang there, dude... sucks, know. Correction.. world watching morbid fascination popcorn, dread. Since March, Saudi Arabia halted pilgrimage Mecca Americans got eat turkey year. hurry, hug coast large stretches. indeed nice drive. Europe done much better US, get lot less flack obvious deceit mismanagement there.

But one European country even attempted contain virus, unlike ANZ many Asian countries, shows sadly. Rather disappointed that, would liked better. Many even openly adopted ""let spread, kill many"" much better.

They chance summer cancel really sucks, seeing UK France pulling similar numbers Vic. Oh well, least vaccines work... Stupid stupid 213 number quoted article. 31.5% applies Researchers largest nurses‚Äô union nation revealed 31.5% 213 registered nurses died COVID-19 complications Filipino -- make 4% registered nurses U.S. would significantly longer month two lockdowns. Yes incubation period average 14 days still grocery stores open etc. still transmission. said fully agree sentiment comment. America, happens 4chan goes politically mainstream. Good job. quality sub falling every day. account business travel? positive energy u ur pops Thats 52k away right now. would pace total 340k month now. wonder high low is. smoke weed play video games. It‚Äôs big deal. sound like someone hasn‚Äôt much hardship life. Us Australians look places like US laugh.
Speak yourself. find horrifying I'm afraid friends US Europe.  German ... f*** Freedomcountry‚Ñ¢ ?! D: New Zealand definitely also inspired Vietnam including magnificent Yikes... family situation am
Struggling lot. close relative likely positive (didn‚Äôt get test results yet) chose attend small thanksgiving dinner anyway high risk family members. masks course. trying judge feel there‚Äôs significant chance one 4 people dead Christmas.  did. saw knew actually matter. using deflect can't refute fact major issues articles posted (issues already called out). lied claim, claim things information on. Deflect want every time everyone reading sees pathetic stance since literally cannot defend it. expect sheer logistical challenge testing regularly

Pardon me, countries / while, bad excuse? America 3 superspreader events back back back time first vaccine dose offered anybody. Massive failure around. 

And yes, people gathering en masse Thanksgiving, Christmas New Year. sentient human understands gatherings would inevitable. Already seen one. I‚Äôm negative disorders. seems fluke. equipment existing viral vaccines actually stuff guys applauded Obama set teams place. Return reality stop using alternative facts lies   give covid tests yes work paid get tested.

And (union) insurance test 90$. say insurance pay 100% arnt. Sounds like pay worth risk... nation prioritizes sports way college prioritizes paying coaches faculty.

Surprise surprise, confederacy fucknuts. didnt compare them? simply stated fact make point finished statement optimism. Cause could take long time No, removed entire thread they've banned said you. still needed remove comments well. going life assuming everyone else background character, hero prevail story without scratch. Main Character can't possibly fail die because... story would end!

It's mix selfishness overconfidence. Kentucky, really seen Walgreens cvs. I‚Äôve seen rite aids NY Maine vaccine provides **resistance** certain amount time, there's telling exactly long resistance last, still going windows time susceptible COVID. Vaccines perfect solution.

You need lay hopium think realistically plan accordingly, based fantasy. wear mesh jogging mask can't breathe otherwise. spring, steps taken flatten curve. 

Now need flatten curve much greater, politically polarized environment, second ""lock down"" would tacit admission failure entire country's efforts fight pandemic. 

But failing flatten curve see hundreds thousands die vaccine widely available. also works well! üôÇ hospital work 2 weeks Covid pay workplace exposure. community acquired, use EIL get like 50+ hours every year limit much have. normal hospitals area they're competing other.

Some hospitals suck, them. Right talking voice coming out, running fast going nowhere, public place naked, falling jumping awake hit ground...


What common ones? people would claim they're crisis actors. They're hopeless. Wow, run math. interesting I'm going say worse thought. would sane approach, yes. thanks. Newsom prince California ruling families. Chosen governor. family wealthy powerful families California connected back decades. helped get richer powerful. One emergency COVID Pandemic programs rules state documented high risk household member makes eligible unemployment. every case infection caused failure isolate obvious symptoms refusal wear mask would result charge reckless endangerment, someone died result refusal work common good get charged negligent homicide. Collectivly need enact zero tolerance policy. enough cops? Round unemployed people train them. happy stand around yell people paycheck. enough nurses? Employ people assistants take strain trained medical personnel still have. we're it, get fucking stimulus people afford put everyone around danger need eat get evicted. know, fits picture have. R 1.5, seen breakdowns like 1/3 work, 1/3 schools, public housing dense facilities, 1/3 partying dining.

However, closing work result process breakdown, many essentials becoming unavailable matter months, weeks. many warehouses today, unfortunately.

But businesses often enough. example, still experts want invite meeting, come house something easily done pictures tape measure. vaccinated sheriff. suddenly confused capitalism works?

If talking professional athletes, extremely high paid people. Even college athletes lot money behind sports. got kidding. rest world drowning vaccines time FDA pulls thumb ass. interjected thread clearly considered witty response suggest would end discussion make anyone argue look like idiot.

If that's true explain true nature leaving comment also question worthy asking anyone make point they're wrong.  test staff every 14 days. We‚Äôve talking switching weekly. need better employer. bring son's death, disgusting human need serious mental help. Seriously, fuck wrong you? Sorry uncle. Contract workers never gotten PTO. healthcare PTO. laws requiring PTO state.  Adjust population density. Yes, increases effectiveness filtration also protects inner one moisture. Same! vaccine don‚Äôt worry getting people sick feel like crap day two, opposed getting actual flu. ""Thank hero.""


That's get, money, safety, PPE, extra benefits, ""Thanks hero."" Thats it. medical care worker would 100% quit. Fuck assholes killing driving medical workers crazy, hope die home alone take bed someone actually tried help everyone. need fucking memorial every single person died working. Everyone goes ""well they're jusy X worker."" Yeah, well would never work minimum wage help assholes like live longer thank every day sacrifices committing need live. never courage have. Don‚Äôt forget pig-headed Secretary State, really haven‚Äôt done anything help contain Coronavirus ""We cannot possibly continue current rates exponential growth community,"" doctor said. ""It‚Äôs sustainable. believe we‚Äôre looking 10 days wiggle room nowhere go we‚Äôre looking sorts crazy scenarios there‚Äôs patients lined hallway.""

10 days also likely bump Thanksgiving holiday. poor doctors nurses going need PTSD counseling over. result public holiday US. possible cases reducing, know late next week.  Well course would address audience way would understand. Oddly, I‚Äôm curious would think response would even one hostility superiority. Nothing I‚Äôve written could construed way unless one wants construed way. 

Dear Non-masker, I‚Äôm curious would say surgeon/doctor wearing mask operating room. would concerned. think? concerned? need condescend African people insult US.  Wait til see happens break leg. One snap it‚Äôs glue factory. tell put pasture room that.. SOCIAL EXPERIMENT (GONE WRONG) üò±üò±üò±  I‚Äôm Saskatchewan approach ‚Äúslow down‚Äù, Moe refuses sort lock approach. case numbers climbing significantly. genuine paper provides us information Corona virus came from? places don‚Äôt tests? Every time I‚Äôve needed test went got tested day, covered insurance. He's right wing? Nice. I‚Äôll send room intubations wink colleagues. I‚Äôm survivalist jungle. I‚Äôll use anything disposal. block you. obnoxious attitude entirely unprovoked. poor, can't protect infection keep jobs time

The poor? like middle class poor... McConnell still calling shots. Still dark days ahead. clapping praising do? r/COVID19 sub good stuff... im sure wander sub anymore tbh

also looked it, say sub created may 3rd 2013!?! mind sharing state live in? state decision, local, national? would funny Health Canada ended approving vaccine FDA. Fauci much boss telling half country opposite. either respect listen advice experts don't. Watching minorities throw child‚Äôs toy around tv helped me. Stay safe comrade. You‚Äôre right, need individually stay safe, regardless given work. Yes possible. symptoms, symptoms, simple symptom think nothing like fatigue, symptoms. way know getting test. case numbers dropped pretty drastically places lockdowns correctly, though -- central power, water, etc like America does. could lot less bad now. I‚Äôm always curious this...why always nurses speaking out? something profession structured make easier so? 

I‚Äôve asked heard answer. I‚Äôm always struck it‚Äôs always nurses. doctors, EMT‚Äôs, respiratory therapists supplemental hospital staff going thing speaking out?  Every school shooter America 1 thing common, ssri's. bet Somalia force Pre teens throats. certainty. 

The irresponsible part populace thanksgiving families, including pressuring members family otherwise taking precautions. families lucky enough exposed yesterday another month catch people bring back home Christmas going New Years Eve parties.  going about? roommate still needs get tested, haven‚Äôt partying. I‚Äôm essential worker. Calm yourself. Thanks part problem! Intentionally disingenuous title social services (temp housing, addiction help, etc.) offered outreach team, acceptance rate less 20%. They're spending money studying that, counting massive amount money they've spent problem past decade. Meanwhile numbers rise every year. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Remindme! 18 days people living still problem tests? I‚Äôve tested like 5 times make appointment local CVS next day get results back like 2 days matter roll another vaccine? Holy crap obese

Hah, yeah, hope make true someday C: lizard brains wired interests gravitate towards athletes models movie stars visceral entertainment provide. that‚Äôs what‚Äôs always going make money ‚Äî value person provides society never aligned amount money generate someone else.

Football players generate lots revenue, nurses don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs football players tested often nurses. aren‚Äôt capable creating society values teachers athletes. really rather nothing let 100% people die let bunch people learn fly try save them?

You need work reading comprehension.

**Medical students medical residents literally people ""learning fly"" speak. enough them.**

Yes, would rather wear mask stay home. Yes, would rather MANY PEOPLE POSSIBLE wear mask stay fuck home containment virus.

Because wearing mask staying home VASTLY PREFERABLE suggestion hiring untrained people learn inject sedatives, intubate, monitor people rest medical staff died.

Yes. prefer greatly. There's nothing done. can't convince person believes post stranger glorified message board news. Nurses overpaid. 

And opinion, soldier *does* get complain going war, see unjust. Vaccinating everyone 70 almost completely eliminate deaths significantly reduce hospitalizations, think we'll start experience normalcy that. one dying getting hospitalized, start treat COVID like flu. would doctors.

 According recent study Johns Hopkins, 250,000 people United States die every year medical mistakes, making third leading cause of¬†death¬†after heart disease cancer  Importance nothing profitability though that‚Äôs issue. say ""at least covid"" starve death Australian who‚Äôs lock self isolated big thing US isn‚Äôt getting this: it‚Äôs don‚Äôt physically distance/wear mask/isolate - it‚Äôs long. longer distance use masks longer you‚Äôll isolate locked later.

The big thing missed still aren‚Äôt big need simply suck roll masks standard - we‚Äôre wearing PPE day jobs (steel cap boots, high vis vests, sandwich making gloves) weekends (eye protection whipper snipping shoes mowing) use masks too? They‚Äôre PPE, weird apparatus. Lets normalise masks appropriate sometimes circumstances dictate. You‚Äôre American heroes now. Doesn‚Äôt thanks sustain you?  optics mass gatherings terrible though. likely caused lot people stop caring safety measures. us == China. chose share Sinovac Canada, even tho Canada worked China. trend noticed US, everyone sharing usual holiday family pictures without extended family pictured. still got together meal (I know Atleast five families this) dodged social media scrutiny pic. small rock? would need know? cursed Ohio happen.

SHES WITCH, BURN HER. worry. Went super small thanksgiving gf's family. wore masks eat near family. fine maskless eating around eachother, behind backs (after left) talked rude eat. We're trying protect 80 year old grandmother 60+ parents/aunts/uncles. Figure would better going. can‚Äôt relate much slightly. I‚Äôm working diagnostic lab we‚Äôve slammed past month. Nothing like supervisor also telling us last week don‚Äôt get holiday pay working thanksgiving upcoming Christmas love beautocratic overlords Real Man^TM . manly man ever lived. boss! Germany wants loosen restrictions Christmas... $122 million high end per plane. $1.5 trillion projected 55 year life plane. So... gotten lot better. mask mandate place now. matter state there's always going % lower educated folks want follow simple social courtesy wearing mask. Personally that's see it. people afraid labeled sheep. (Eye roll). get political strange seems lean right tend believe crazy tin foil hat conspiracy left created. (Again major eye roll).

My work takening extremely serious, we've wearing masks since March &amp; daily temperature scans second walk door.  definition insanity thing again, ""expecting different results. "" - Albert Einstein 

&amp;#x200B;

yet time sane insane actions. China much club ""eliminators"" comes strategy, test whole cities make sure takes eliminate trade every thing. course china huge, population wise geographically one two cases cause concern long china keeps doing. Overall chinese back normal lives major economy growth year, can't without part eliminator club heh need foreign actors anymore. We've taken reins ourselves. Looks like they're still grading US curve. !Remindme 2 weeks Make everyone living south get punch crotch returned large degree normality recent weeks, mass sporting events even iconic Sydney Opera House reopening.  
 
And returning lockdowns coming weeks. They've found virus sewage:  
So no, gone, despite arresting people wearing masks shutting everything much possible it'll back shortly 22 days without active case means asymptomatic carriers walking around. Hey rest world. don‚Äôt fuck stop acting like don‚Äôt pay shit, family holidays too.

The fucking hypocrisy ‚ÄúAmericans bad‚Äù hive mind actually retarded Daily death count 2400 climbing. fuck em. know risks.  doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs autism. could say black white nothing thinking. exclusive autistic individuals, effortlessly prove. 

You little clue autistic people. wonder life doesn‚Äôt act way want to? 

And claim care workers rights. You‚Äôre probably type person scream loudly need change time comes cower dark like child, afraid stand father. 

The hatred inside always subvert ideals claim hold fit in. Anecdotally, 87yo grandma swears beer cigarettes keep young.  I‚Äôm guy internet.

But really good buddy mine military pay medical school, result paying back time military doctors summer got deployed FEMA rural hospital. 

They short everything.

Except patients.

And every day Groundhog Day bulk patients CoVID19 simply believe CoVID19, even two positive tests admitted.

This happening.

My wife, practices completely different field medicine opposite side country plenty patients CoVID19 positive refuse believe it, really gets giving much care people.

I haven‚Äôt talked either people death beds, that‚Äôs honestly question ask someone dealing much, really listen want talk comes work know they‚Äôve seen awful things (similarities exist talking military law enforcement, don‚Äôt pry hard stuff). post ultimate wokeness  fox news said, makes stay farther away people, go ""fuck it, let's go get close people think want kiss them"" 

But I'm complete idiot, I'm scared little snowflake left house months/a year...and germaphobe boot. 2,300 died past 24 hours EMT, go lot nursing homes CA, area seems something like 70-80% nurses filipino. nursing homes absolutely decimated COVID, many much half residents tested positive. funding staffing take many precautions hospital covid units probably worst places work catching COVID. Really? world? find hard believe much world even gives fuck holidays virus spread seeing we‚Äôre travel banned nearly. Seems bit sensationalized. comment getting downvoted ? Sunk cost fallacy!!! Even everyone country got covid, would wipe civilization. death rate low. Well. I‚Äôve Alive since 94 never paid attention MSN Let‚Äôs clear. America nation Covid deaths. entire world responsible this. Especially C-H-I-N-A! Seems like someone abusing AutoModerator seeing also gifted... Disbelief? all, know expect, point. can't understand mental gymnastics takes wholeheartedly believe nebulous ""somebody"" actual public health officials epidemiologists. learned lot places still store Black Friday sales too. We‚Äôre idiots. !RedditSilver Better get extended magazine Automoderator gets triggered weird stuff sometimes, mods usually reinstate posts evaluate it. Might take hours though.  building 6 centres calling quits. effective safe format distribution determined, opening centres becomes far easier. Want understand ""Little know"" get joke.

But really hard imagine. Every Christmas movie someone traveling far in-laws.  


In immediate family though wife's furthest relative (aunt) travels solo, husband goes wherever family . (Not year though, one traveled except FIL forrest hunt) Masks mandatory even zero cases exactly everyone should‚Äôve whole time. don‚Äôt understand it‚Äôs hard western countries. seemed like Europe soon cases went everything went back normal way soon. knew going backfire saw people going back bars like nothing ever happened. Sure enough countries Europe pretty much back square one.

As sad parents‚Äô thanksgiving get together good example people US handling this. sort understand risk they‚Äôre still stupid shit like refuse deal inconveniences. thanksgiving sit together eat turkey even means potentially ruining trip see first grandchild. We‚Äôre together, I‚Äôm changing habits. We‚Äôll fine. Everyone else quarantine though. say! Meanwhile I, 2500 miles away tucked wilderness Western Maine, spent holiday Wife eating traditional dinner enjoying solitude watched video video family back home best try kill Grandma. Nobody wore masks, everyone packed living room. almost like places said covid real traditional holiday like nothing wrong. im watching waiting numbers go hoping dont get phone call saying somebody got sick. Yall stay safe please wear mask! able believe misinformation fact, like cult, stopped caring people. We‚Äôve passed since April.

And people really don‚Äôt give shit. barely see masks, distance, saw fuckton traveling. Despite hospital calling texting people saying ‚Äústay home. max capacity.‚Äù

I Covid family others told ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad! Plus since it, can‚Äôt get again. come thanksgiving‚Äù. canceled holidays easter point (frankly wife happy hell holidays us wish pandemic would end). 
Anyway people thinking like that, care hold people bought cult shit accountability people say don‚Äôt care. natural selection point fucking christ can't help people point, see america ever recover it. Imagine long term side effects lingering infected.....greatest nation world ass It‚Äôs certainly possible, get people test positive temporarily don‚Äôt actually live (like college students migrant workers) count towards rona cases population. don‚Äôt know tell then. first two times, two regular tests blood test confirm. time, she‚Äôs rapid test come back positive, she‚Äôs waiting results non-rapid test. hope it‚Äôs false positive, believe me. goddamn, guys sure lack empathy compassion. people insufferable. view punishment. you‚Äôre punished cases, guys really think promotes testing

Systems thinking, like Pandemics span many years. Anyone thinks US near end going shocked.

Other countries getting hand (or already have). hope spread US rest world. *daily statistics summary* @atealin post? remember saw next thing know, gone *politics*? hell happened? Seems Automoderator like today's notes reason, wait mods reinstate post. Sorry folks! Americans fucking weird? always thought bravado media thing guys actually retarded. say there's evidence real guy, even is, scientific medical community overwhelmingly disagrees him.

There plenty quacks high places, pay attention scientific consensus.

You're obviously anti-science conspiracy contrarian I'm perfectly comfortable ignoring nonsense, I'm going post debunking links deter others getting sucked it. neighbor huge family gathering too. Knew coming, I'm friends adult children Facebook. kids, kids, step-kids, spouses, partners assorted family members 30-40 people. Whole family covid-hoax anti-mask too. state current guidelines 10 people. great analogy According 68% Fauci right worry. many people traveled earlier week. holiday going largest super-spreader. First I'm sorry you. pandemic ultimate test lot things. huge test relationships, also huge test commitments former, destructive ways life. 

This virus bringing modern societies knees tip ice berg terms events linked ecological collapse processes. better learn humbly accept writings walls woe us. Locking province != Locking country.

So gross people eat something smells fucking bad produced. mistake, nothing political post, please reinstate it! Vietnam too.  country say ""For parents, interest precious capital"".
I'm sure age would also take world see grandkids.

I totally agree concerns 100% legit, time gramps pov understandable too.

Recent studies medical errors estimated errors may account many 251,000 deaths annually United States (U.S)., making medical errors third leading cause death.


So, doctors kill many covid 1 year. Got it. Even case long term side effects, couple extra weeks catch them. 

Because tend rare, long term side effects discovered vaccination widespread. Fines =! Executions.
But know already. Shouldn‚Äôt give vaccine first twice likely die?

In mind depends vaccine effective. 

If vaccine reduces transmission target vectors spreading around community. 

If best protects infection target susceptible virus. would obviously include elderly minorities disproportionately risk significant harm.

I would fan fast tracking deniers adter 50+ crowd protected,

Then also fan giving people swift kick grown well. Nearly every hospital volunteer program right people run lab tests man front desk. covid nursing skill set requires years.

You can't teach starry-eyed kid intubation 1 easy lesson. No, showing easy lie. Technically guy basing 2 experiences. nurse story, mother law. saying authoritarian regime‚Äôs representative lied? Inconceivable! world (not US!) 61 million. math generous US predictions. 

The 1918 herd immunity theory 70%. Measles Polio wanted world 95%. 

With Covid numerous studies showing people DONT maintain antibodies it‚Äôs possible get reinfected Covid it. 

Worst case scenarios, hit herd, immunity WAY higher general math based world wide totals far.  Don‚Äôt forget heroin brandy phase Absolutely, posted realized sheer logistical challenge identifying administering vaccine people. 

We've focused asking people right things mentally jarring consider best target population vaccine people wrong ones. figured I'd suggest discussion anyway. understand approach, honestly see anyone rewarding people bother bare minimum. literally said experience. doesn‚Äôt seem scary me. even deterrent people getting tested. even getting tested (as recounted I‚Äôve tested several times varying experiences). seems like you‚Äôre saying account meant discourage people getting tested I‚Äôm making seem scary hard (?). 

My point health care workers employers facilitate employers testing , opposed simply relying self tests (which scheduled taken persona time, results aren‚Äôt communicatedto employer.). Self-scheduled tests varying level availability result -timeliness. something dispute? trying come arguing argue? 

I didn‚Äôt write article guess you‚Äôre saying journalist liar ? feel Ike you‚Äôre emotional this. 

Healthcare workers tested employers results shared w employers known covid+ healthcare worker doesn‚Äôt expose patients.  That‚Äôs crazy, scary position. 

I don‚Äôt really care NFL does. want test employees cool. tests = knowledge. empathize Healthcare workers constantly exposed work hospitals tests told can‚Äôt one hospital tests. would frustrating. That‚Äôs all. hate easy anticipate batshit crazy retorts almost reasonable course action policy might result in.

I become master last 4+ years. anticipate responses make them. point, could pretend online wanted long get tie waterboard time. think masks tyranny least make reality them. keep hearing reports African Americans dying twice rate general population. 

Shouldn‚Äôt give vaccine first twice likely die? white folk gotta wait turn.

It‚Äôs right thing do. Imma gonna wait hold breath. Thank you. October 3rd LONG way away. I'm giving May latest entire world reaches ""fuck it"" levels. Social distancing easy people can't it. Bad bot. would quantify this? way prove this. Someone really wants virus might claim never wear mask included group. Like meme floating around back March... need employ work club bouncers enforce type stuff ha.. actually though tax revenue. Florida needs sales tax revenue, short sighted ""right"" answer deo everything necessary keep revenue coming in. Lmao really know third world country you? think look up. 
Why angry? Can't stand laughed at? whole world rn, laughing guys üòÇ well sad anything people dying droves care. part that's funny boasting country third world country handling virus better lol. Also trying boast grossly inaccurate hilarious. 
I actually care less state richer not, also inaccurate. country wealthy, wealth distributed well due corruption stuff like damage done economy due political issues. 
Actually economy crashed would affect many countries, including lol. 
You really understand third world country you? There's also many third world countries clue one I'm lol. intellectual assume same. Classic American, extremely stupid. 
Consuming media? barely check sub. even care loved ones country/ I'm sociopath like you. 
And richest country still much homeless, people starving know adapt hard life, can't get pandemic control, willingly choose infect sociopathic disregard lives. racial bias also one worst world. 
Not mention, people like profilic stupidity. unintelligence makes sick. Unfortunately, mask-averse individuals likely also refuse vaccination. English translation story? One more, British Isles includes main islands (Great Britain Ireland) smaller islands around them. 

The capital cities government controls local laws, relevant current times lockdown regulations devolved administration:

Edinburg capital Scotland. 
Cardiff capital Wales. 
Belfast capital Northern Ireland. live near Seattle. state 211 number supposed put people contact places help. Sadly, places tend turn away unless single mother children usually battered women get help first. homeless family, 6 us, 4 months. self sufficient enough get us it. without lot effort, begging. husband working full time job. kids school. living tent. wait list getting home 3 plus years out. arent enough resources. went facebook groups begged someone allow us set tent backyard. Luckily us, someone did. also write letters every single place applied live in. begged chance lived town house 4 years now, never late payment. Granted, isnt easy most. there's long term/protracted side effects voters Florida still supporting DeSantis? people demanding DeSantis resign?  Yep, FDA almost always follows whatever VRBPAC decides, guess keeping options open case something comes up, dont want set false hope people. Unfortunately, local lockdowns really enforced, even least somewhat enforced, nothing prevents people going outside city county limits neighboring area locked down, coming back home exposed people. policy common US hospitals, hard figure why. Say high risk exposure asymptomatic. negative covid test mean safe? No, asymptomatic individuals likely get false negative show later positive test.

But positive? means could've exposed 2-3 months ago, could recently exposed, could false positive. long positive window, becomes poor test deciding someone go back work. current inpatient numbers, hospital could collapse keeping 'positive' workers home. sharing experience keeping everyone else thanksgiving can‚Äôt wait things settle til fun person free told tested. want get tested accord, $105. Court's scientifically illiterate decision cost lives

Conservative judges ignorantly cited examples like buying bikes liquor, wondered state New York allows activities forbidding religious gatherings.

This either intentional lying stupidity. Buying bike liquor require gathering hour hundred people close proximity, singing reciting prayers. remember lifespans 2 years higher 30 years ago due development healthcare safety.

COVID stole 2 years us, since living lockdown isn‚Äôt really living.

So essentially entire living population life expectancy person 1990s. Back atcha buddy cant afford , get rid economy bounces back quicker offsetting investment wage support That's science works. treat next 50 people admitted ICU new drug compare survival rate data going garbage.  Hospitals overwhelmed would really drive deaths though. DeSantis hire conspiracy blogger ? wtf font size.... could possibly seen coming‚ÄΩ /s [Funny, Germany age group numbers going #1 total deaths, #11 per capita....

When look per capita...#1 Andorra (76 deaths), #2 Montenegro (474 deaths) , #3 Luxembourg (300 deaths)...

#12 United States (270,773 deaths)....

Come on..... Slower, case, necessarily mean better. hypothetically take weeks approve EUA recommended expert panel would tragic. try every day American. find ironic rest world wants leave shithole move grand ol U.S. A.

I dont live US lived life summer. went parties chalets bars open. luck ran caught covid girlfriend. Isolated 14 days. Fever 2 nights. fine. Yea gonna miss 1.5 years life 2 week cold b need renormalize resigning shame politicians. Seems person recent memory Al Franken.

Ironically, bar floor point, act might marked one ethical Senators recent times. That's basically ended doing. Zoom call family watch Macy's parade tv together like every year, kitchen zoom call family later day everyone prepping food homes, playing Among Us friends scattered across country chatting Discord night. bit strange *there's bloody pandemic*!

Sorry clue called thick felt like leaf blower going nose. recovered enough go home I'm still 1-2L oxygen. I've got ivy league educated aunt works hospital DNP brink capacity still claiming flu, colleagues wrong problem. Also telling everyone listen hospital gets $13k government every person list covid big scam. wild listening passionately defy common sense someone position, education. agree Trump awful. bring governor Texas Illinois NY? higher death rates per 100,000. hear term run with. Like whole freaken 4 years Agree, barely making attempt moment. Sure they've introduced lock places barely enforced. think health authorities sitting around congratulating themselves? maintaining vigilance, ongoing wastewater testing pinpoint potential outbreaks, area concern identified, increase tesing.

If outbreak occur happened Adelaide, call short lockdown, halting infections giving time track, test, isolate. 

Our international borders opening back months. want cross border two choices, show proof vaccine quarantine two weeks expense, apply citizens vistors. Vaccines free charge strongly encouraged. people Australia too. Europe heaps conspiracy theorists too. Thankfully overwhelming majority Australians right thing. Find something Wait thought UK government put orders Pfizer moderna vaccines well? note: hospitalized infected individual puts dozens healthcare providers risk. 

Why can't take helmets ride donorcycles instead? living North Dakota days huge uptick motorcycles highway. can‚Äôt tell sure many North Dakotans attended fair bit likely brought back. God dammit. mom mentioned Newsmax day didn‚Äôt know didn‚Äôt think anything it. 

I suspicious since said didn‚Äôt watch Fox anymore. Cakeday Hahahaha source that? No, 2015 film 'The Revenant' understand. Russia reports 27,543 new coronavirus cases, biggest one-day increase record, 496 new deaths  Saying someone‚Äôs IQ 96 good burn unless there's walls counties, matter. There's free spread plague-riddled anti-maskers responsible places. stupid Australian comment you. even Australian? CAPITALISM.

Libertarianism. bet 400k daily cases New Year. mean trying herd immunity, means, 'flatten curve' without destroying economy. Subtle difference, there. yet insisted national lockdown. scary whole country 20,000 tests day 2500 new cases ""yet"" scary? Convenience drug...when went US, told parents would essentially ceasing social media messaging, contact anyone would international calls paper mail, could focus work. course work, seemed forgotten exactly limitations went US study 30 years before...Now they're glued phones time convenience everything seems. Hell yeah it‚Äôs embarrassment. screw up? think right. Seems like many Americans need see get bad take seriously. Hey man stayed home. thanksgiving live with. cousins dads side always thought wasn‚Äôt serious still went bars social gatherings caught Covid week thanksgiving trying get us together. I‚Äôm really curious people stop looking like common flu. think there‚Äôs truth things, end day Australian values unique thing. They‚Äôre much product geographical practical reality life rock ideas people call place home. Australian values don‚Äôt come UK, America, Asia anywhere else. Australian values come Australia. second populated county state, numbers high start pandemic. 

Unfortunately asshole governor,who gone way restrict mitigation measures Broward imposed, hurt us. flattened DeSantis made county restrictions impossible executive orders, opened clubs bars. live? rest country shitter, would quick point Broward County's numbers. He‚Äôs president almost 4 years sooooo.....yeah I‚Äôd say Cartel violence murders like top two concerns Mexicans.

COVID another layer pain.  husband work home. coworkers. said, boss insists go office because, ""why lose rent money?"". 

I think comes bottom line appreciate take like sub.

We never going stop human behavior. Interacting others literally product thousands years evolution. Now, get wrong, I'm careful stupid things also totally understand people seeing other. Especially point pandemic. 9 months... can't tell people see support system year plus. tactic never going work. Messaging beginning wreck. Couple articles saying ""We May NEVER Get Back Normal!"" ""People Vaccinated 2022!!!!"" see people reached ""fuck it"" stage. 

I also get annoyed someone posts something along lines ""I'm sad can't see family"" someone sub comes back ""imagine sad family dies"". invalidates person's feelings makes feel guilty wanting interact people. Socialization part human behavior HARD. Thanksgiving family HARD. Losing job HARD. I'm tired people sub acting like easy time. sucks. went fishing day myself. called mom got home.

It good Thanksgiving.  Christmas, New Years... Good thinking North Dakota spent covid relief money fracking... lol ...and done us lately? Well...it safer. isolate get tested Thanksgiving, safe way travel (covid-wise) drive. attitude Sounds like kind place still asks ‚Äúhave travelled contact anyone travelled China past two weeks‚Äù, covid questionnaire, thousands cases community. Dont't think world watches disbelief. hysteric world watches disbelief. thought getting downvoted they're wanting uncle die who, far tell, done nothing wrong except ill truly worried may family friends Japan. 

With huge elderly population already stretched (though excellent) medical system large surge would devastating. Thankfully, Times Square closed public year, much like parade yesterday. But, I'm sure plenty people packed bars restaurants house parties, drinking alcohol rarely wearing masks social distancing. Thanksgiving is... giving thanks? text lmao ... Christmas time jumping Europe. Mate science magic. make shit test safe couple months. feel like name this. Probably ¬´¬†Black Christmas¬†¬ª something along lines... Hope work lol. won't. literally take people dying doorstep. website shows us hospital capacity different states? January 2021 going interesting. expected many people would still pretend thanksgiving\christmas normal. Yeah. met maternal grandfather...three times? basically stranger ever know rather know him. 

One cousins moved across country school grew moved away. moved close am, technically closest family. know family members, all. knew adult, knew child. *still* hardly know better random coworker.

People less open genuine discussion steadfast beliefs opinions. grateful countries Australia New Zealand showing us possible much better US Europe. 

Honestly jump conclusion quickly, Australia(which includes Melbourne) NZ fairly low populations easy achieve elimination right measures place. hate pessimist US Europe(US especially) large populations scale elimination much tougher(this say impossible means easy task), right measures place definitely mitigate whatever happening there, Europe least seem taking first step addressing issues(re-introducing lockdowns), America issues ie)lack universal health care, hell even testing believe comes cost, surely there's something really rotten core American politics country highest GDP world can't even provide basic universal healthcare citizens. Im angry human race. People need learn adapt. Species learn adapt ones survive. Clearly human race cannot get together stay fuck away wear damn mask. Truly fucking hard. think people away family jobs? military family havent near family years, get christmas them, Thanksgiving, damn expensive fly family. freaken survived years without seeing family, difficult miss thanksgiving christmas yes sucks, feelings valid, seeing neighbors able see grandkids important me, neighbor going colon cancer see kids again. Please love human race proactive stay home, wash hands, wear mask. peoples lives, mention nurses doctors dropping like flies (skilled nurses doctors need), want go home end lf day too.

Sorry rant upsets much Ah Washington post reports behalf world. 

A lofty title. hyperbolic all. Blood clots actually common people COVID. Think again. Let‚Äôs face it. Americans fucking stupid. seen plenty liberals streets protesting celebrating. fucking stupid deserve live shit we‚Äôve created long time. Scientists bail us help us return normal lives, however, we‚Äôll continue stupid selfish now. Hm. plan specifically lists network hospital costs. Maybe that‚Äôs planned surgeries such? I‚Äôd hope emergencies wouldn‚Äôt bound in/out network but...you know...America. told health care workers speak publicly COVID-19 crisis actors. Man, would nice get sweet, sweet nepotism I've heard much about. Okay. laughing you, dead americans. never said did. initial point outbreak, places catching 10 5% cases whereas we're closer one three perhaps better lot places. see positivity rates Upper Midwest, they're getting numbers pretty similar New York example beginning, assume they're likely missing many cases

What's tricky though convert numbers like North Dakota seeing right now. 30% population already gotten covid-19 numbers drop precipitously come back up. guess we'll find pretty soon whether numbers New York go back totally possible acquired virus recently enough one symptoms still capable spreading it. would take one person. I'm hoping safe. kiwi lived Taiwan wasent surprised nailed covid response quickly well.

Taiwan fantastic country well worth visiting plague over. Keep sticking fingers ears shouting isn‚Äôt happening.

I‚Äôm kind sad friends family, listen talk much don‚Äôt care happens math.  I‚Äôve exact issues Mom foot care nurse Ontario Canada. two old age homes numerous client homes. 

She gets tested every 2 2.5 weeks. 

She never trouble scheduling test. It‚Äôs like zombie movie relatives replaced pod people. WoNT cOmE ONE US? forget obesity! Instead trying Miss Information, tried Miss Universe someone else instead. 


\*misinformation 4 fresh ones 4th quarter drive home. near Alabama? Edibles day every day bong rip breaks between, realize might work everyone... Yeah, that's me. Whenever Powerball whatever starts hitting ""record"" heights go ahead drop $5 toward it.

Then sit write I'd got kind money. dreams varied I've aged, step 1 always ""hire lawyer"" step 2 always ""hire accountant."" I'm hitting bong. Thanks thanks.

I think I'll ever able hit piece someone else ever again. forever changed early Wuhan videos J&amp;J rolls single dose vaccine Q1  Yes, won‚Äôt major crisis. still polio Afganistan Pakistan. think they're trying get trust someone right things (social distance, mask, isolation) still get infected even everything right. trust shit [Doctors say CDC warn people side effects Covid vaccine shots won‚Äôt ‚Äòa walk proves work, people going toughen up,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúThe first dose big deal. second dose definitely put day sure. ... ***You need take day second dose.***‚Äù 

Good idea. start. right. parade horror show, thanksgiving rife fines arrests appplicable, thanksgiving goddamn weird sucked - imagine family going hard work make full setting, eating it, youre eating alone (weird). Yeah imagine getting worse....

But then, Ive never actually seen Thanksgiving Christmas New Years get twisted, definition dark. understand it. don‚Äôt care. even Africans call USA shithole, guess. Well yeah applies literally everything, minimizing A. amount risks take B. amount people involved. kidding.

Hey - wanted share grandpa something similar - taught forage fir mushrooms, plants eat find clean water. fun weekend activity walk woods him, felt like simply saw woods - like secret set glasses revealing things couldn‚Äôt see.

It wasn‚Äôt much later learned spent time hiding armies mountains child, foraging food, child Poland. never said teaching foraging skills, left figure later. 

I wonder grandma same, let figure - speak experiences? Thanks catch, correct it. think many sick Thanksgiving Christmas, NYE bust (as be). Please provide source shows 30 million died due mitigation efforts isn‚Äôt right wing conspiracy blog. Same. think want believe fake society isn‚Äôt fragile. Imagine higher death rate.  Covfefe Foundation. look map daily covid deaths see spike right now. can‚Äôt see that, don‚Äôt know tell you. Doctors getting better treating disease people surviving minute ICU fills town goes window. Low population bullshit. island argument actually true though. huge advantage; sufficient contain outbreak (as UK shows) necessary either (as non-island countries show). still advantage, probably single biggest advantage Australia given European country. Australia. Ya know? Good solution! Nah care go enjoy family time america, need Come on, mean. Hundreds thousands Taiwanese people (and handful foreigners) re-entered Taiwan, safely, since March, following exact quarantine process parents follow. government-run, there's loopholes outs. 99-90% survival rate, long lasting effects still havent able observe yet. ya know, cares facts, lets spread narrative alligns political views. 

I checked pants, shit there, dont worry. idk super easy stay contact family day age. cousin birthday party zoom. easy do, fun, didnt worry designated drivers. Idk get idea cut family.

I'm sorry whole thing reduced amount times week family blow other. small clot would unlikely cause problems significant enough even detected right away, let alone require immediate treatment ok whatever Im done arguing. Someone family OAN visiting. anchor said tearing Robert E Lee statues travesty ""Robert E. Lee American hero"" immediately blocked channel. No, SARS literally disapeared. SARS-COV infected human since 2004. lived see single case SARS. Scientists already going ship SARS vaccine China, Canada, Singapore (the countries impacted SARS), literally dissapeared aether. Look up, I'm making up, bizarre sounds. denying spread existence isn‚Äôt?? Boy, need think again. foolish. live NH. tourists. Massholes wear masks. locals.  says guy 3rd world shithole could purchased half American citizens lmao. get youre obsessed us we‚Äôre center world lots people that... obsessing us ain‚Äôt gonna change fact country many others fucking coronavirus bad... I'm glad reported this, sadly disappointed mention possible reasons offer analysis. learned phone call sister yesterday everyone extended family another state west ""living life"" ""that bad"" lived.

Over half family it. mean.... extended family 100+ people city alone. us diaspora bigger cities east taking seriously far we've kept safe. thought insulated Montana.

Nope. virus lives breath, wherever two people interacted even minute without mask, travel. getting offended different opinion?

Different opinions don‚Äôt bother me, regurgitated propaganda does, covers 99.9% ‚Äúopinions‚Äù hear right. want families survive, they‚Äôre trying stop spread deadly pandemic virus. Idk ""disbelief"" chief. People say stuff like this, obviously don‚Äôt get impact. Like, forget deaths right? Let‚Äôs herd immunity! Derp derp derp!

Do know many people work? know would economy? think it‚Äôs bad now. Indiana estimated 29% space left ICU‚Äôs. people touch....do understand hospitals limited number rooms? Car accidents, old folk, heart disease, obesity problems (seeing we‚Äôre fattest people planet), understand start deciding treat not? No, think ‚Äú.6 percent death rate durdurdur‚Äù yeah, that‚Äôs globe. It‚Äôs closer 3 percent America. Seriously. It‚Äôs baffling people, internet, little deep education science health answers hahaha. John Hopkins thinks somewhere 20 percent Americans infected. 30 percent today...the consequences would be....I don‚Äôt even word; abysmal. brain? sweating typing this, intensely shitty they‚Äôre millions people thoughts COVID like yours. Go flow, grow up, stop saying stupid shit dude. word bigger you. Jesus. really putting Sweden example non additional deaths 2020? trolling? wish dad like that. buys it. wish could shut airports public transportation slow masses. thinking I'm paying space either way, better jam workers forcibly get money's worth.

Hit nail head. miss living Taiwan. 

Can go fried plum chicken squid stick. refuse test nurses? That‚Äôs insane. Nothing concerned however, clots form inside vessels without obvious injury dissolve haematology.org

You meant hematology.org. quote continues ""These situations dangerous require accurate diagnosis appropriate treatment."". dissolve, acute situation needs treated immediately. quote mean hang years. 

A quote taken context typo added URL bit harder check? Man, know game is, faking health info whatever reason fucked up. God *hate* costochondritis. Inflicted upon totally accident exercising miserable days it. curiosity common Filipinos dark-skinned people? 

I'm real doctor, doctor, etc - pretty much everyone benefit least little bit vitamin supplementation. gets worse darker skin, and/or live northern climate, and/or spend ton time outside lots skin exposed. Especially studies coming protective effect covid. Europe definitely are. That's problem, rules vary state, makes piecemeal.

We need national response ""Just two weeks guys!""

""Shit sorry actually gotta wait vaccine :/""

""Oh shit bad actually vaccine cut ahah"" state mask mandate. Maricopa County one tho.

OP - assume live/work Tempe, report Tempe's 311 service 480-350-8311 AZDHS directly. That‚Äôs shitty hospital administrators you. care profits else. point island easily control borders. Yes countries islands also control borders effectively. Austria Luxembourg can't. get logic, fuck money even coming from? Considering who's supposed power next couple months? 


Yeah, WAY much ask, way, way, way much ask. That's always bring bong days. Well communist government similar China enforced sort draconian lockdowns , forced surveillance , restrictions, mask wearing etc China.

If need proof google image show entire streets empty disinfecting trucks spraying disinfectant everywhere. Empty airports railways. find youtube even.

Like 2020 internet cameras everywhere. think governments lie shit pretend things happen fudge numbers want ? one impunity US. Yes definition is.. would family friends destroy livelihood country virus 99+ percent survival rate? Stop paranoid. changed coronavirus vaccine work. vaccine got rid SARS? Lol Imagine living life like that. bunch virtue signaling bullshit Yes. looks like normal commuter traffic days me. drove LA yesterday pick take go park dinner basically traffic. want vaccine too! actually fantasize getting jab(s). stupid.  I‚Äôm US, work pretty closely guy lives Calgary. Wednesday meeting, told us cases rising Alberta they‚Äôve implemented stringent lockdown requirements. ‚ÄúBut,‚Äù told me, ‚Äúeven recent spike, we‚Äôre far better folks Florida.‚Äù

I stayed home Thanksgiving. me, boyfriend, pets. company issues weekly update number cases within company, along offices people work whether they‚Äôd office recently. They‚Äôve low (under 10 new cases week company 1,000 employees). curious see numbers look like heading Christmas season. see need bring medieval town stockades back shit like this. week stocks half ton rotten food do. cultural issue getting darker skin. Visit Philippines. wait, either pay rent either way pay workers home. neither scenario lose money. 

Oh God, thinking I'm paying space either way, better jam workers forcibly get money's worth.

What fuck wrong people. Everyone hasn‚Äôt staying home months now. lot working class back work. Except bartenders servers got laid again. Traffic still isn‚Äôt pre pandemic levels it‚Äôs steadily increasing since May June. dinner party dinner party $400 per plate restaurant super rich time Californians struggling pay bills starving. tacky. STILL go jobs, peoples homes, Texas, never wear masks. It‚Äôs if, I‚Äôm help, I‚Äôm dirty, wear mask protect them, truly don‚Äôt care me, worker. hate here. shitty article, bet 99.999% world give shit, got problems. No, normal realize US one sources 2% rate right? countries higher rate? JHU, btw cause thats source gave refuting claim. Lol Really? rest world shit deal right now? Washington Post absolute garbage. Yes, US way ambitious. difference attitude two leaders vaccination campaign quite PSVR low end PCVR Lenovo Explorer many workers use personal pto get sick. huge disincentive stay home mild symptoms. least 40% refusing masks coming inside anyways, nightmare tbh.

Are allowed say anything un-masked fools? state mask mandate? There's simple answer: healthcare conglomerates cannot afford find out.

Nurses already short supply. I've heard $7000/week offers. Yet still dropping droves. healthcare system collapse remaining nurses required isolate 14 days positive tests. 

We world hurt, half populace cannot stand even tiny bit hardship. sadly, ones suffer. take hospital beds first, next three weeks, right thing stayed home finally catch it, SOL. RemindMe! 20 days could've come. pay $6k see kid? pandemic stops? people pay athletes care athletes (because bring money) people pay nurses nurses. right thing Tegnell literally Hitler! üçÑ curious, tried get tested outside hospital? work primary care, get tested though go somewhere outside organization. like conflict interest. PAYWALL!!!!!! \*Here come Covid cases, come Covid cases,

Right everyone's lanes! 
If visiting family,

Expect lot pain!\* 


... 


(that's I've got, sorry) Speaking American, true. Yeah exactly. I'm anti vax stretch im going cautious wait see side effects take it. Extremely rushed vaccine people rushing take people want sign hope. 

I get it, luxury able wait. know people worked vaccine. literally uses technology Oxford targets protein spike. even better Oxford one since uses two different Adenoviruses vectors two doses order avoid developing immunity vectors themselves. Something Oxford failed think apparently.

20000 people phase 3 testing far go 40000 + military see here. think missed point. I'm camped basement tin foil hat thinking *everything* lie conspiracy.

A conspiracy simply group planning to/trying to/or, case confirmed conspiracies, actually succeeding executing plan without ""outsiders"" knowledge.

This could simple corporation trying cut corners product without customers knowing, thus increasing profit margins.

These conspiracy theories speaking spread ""mentally ill"" people extreme side things, stuff like flat earth aliens area 51. I'm talking that, I'm talking real stuff, stuff *actually* affects day-to-day lives.

You may personally choose ignore it, go day blissfully unaware, part would like too. around us whether like not.

I personally, like maintain critical eye, like idea ""holding feet fire"" say. Cant wait people use inconsequential thing write apocalyptic headlines ok tritip better brisket gtfo!! ever austin Texas brisket? tritip like fucking glorified flank steak Yup sure FYI. world clue thanksgiving is. Thanks this. family made work. 

It‚Äôs depressing see many people say ‚Äú#covidthanksgiving‚Äù social media posts thanksgiving extended family looks like every year! didn‚Äôt covid thanksgiving, that‚Äôs thanksgiving! inevitable. don‚Äôt think want picture cause I‚Äôm gonna ugly crying whole time. That's actually really impressive. also factor people traveling safely staying away large gatherings people already COVID. lawyer please explain can‚Äôt start class action lawsuit endangering health? Ok go ahead stop people driving cars alot people died them. even better, solve obesity, alot Americans died too, cure heart disease it. People die, get it. That‚Äôs true. it‚Äôs even data reported. many people Reddit spreading rumour? building simple SEIR model would nice Python exercise (and building complex one would massive undertaking..). Still hard time processing fact literally millions people selfish, idiotic reckless take thing seriously. hope get super mild case endure least enough discomfort they'll think twice ever careless again, bad enough recover. amount tests Florida done ü§ô work college testing students (not symptomatic ones) week plans test even students twice week spring. plan run something like 6000 tests per week...and that‚Äôs one small college. seem misconception feigning shock someone attempting prove negative somehow makes point valid. 

I telling zero studies making clear, evidence supported link ‚Äòlong haul‚Äô form cfs secondary Covid infection. people think that‚Äôs case unable prove it. 

I‚Äôll happy link studies you‚Äôve claimed already read. ‚Äúgotta get mine‚Äù

yeah....i see winter probably turning dumpster fire. 

You thank good old fashioned American greed this. Two years according head researcher/professor SUNY working one vaccines announced. interview November issue Atlantic Magazine. Dude, lost faith half humanity. I'm healthcare worker professional connections hospitals country. parents nurses, wife nurse prac, sister nurse, cousins nurses. work varying hospitals different states. Every healthcare worker know struggling. Longer hours, staff dropping like flies. sister works rural hospital filled covid, stopped days due coworkers getting covid. 

Yet, see people every day saying hospitals empty. ignore refusal mask. ignore claim virus flu. ignore claims statistics treatments whatever. absolutely ignorant reality, fell deep hole fake news conspiracy theories think every healthcare worker America lying state they're in, wrong, mentally ill need see therapist. think special kind cunt Yeah guess every single person know life complete idiot. Logic.  kind setup virtual reality? watching CNBC- business channel- morning Pfizer announced vaccine results.

 interview high-profile well-known private Equity investor, he's one richest men America, revealed fact secretly part Pfizer vaccine trial!

 mean, coincidence! work theater several packed showtimes yesterday ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è They'll deny it. ""It's COVID, people gonna die anyhow."" One neighbors THIRTY cars yard &amp; street. Unbelievable... Yea athletes money slave pinatas rich white owners. Gotta make sure money makers tip top shape. Kirkland gummy multivitamin I'm 5 years old, 5,000 IU Vitamin D, that's now. Try eat lots veggies. I'd like play devil's advocate state ICU RN tested, many colleagues. cannot state difference hospital encourages testing not. 

On another note, personally know anti-mask nurses. work COVID patients. believe getting virus inevitable thus masks enforced.  order get herd immunity makes sense everyone gets infected short period time like course 4-6 months. 

At least 80% population needs become infected herd immunity.  

That‚Äôs 8,000,000 infected cases, infected 20% require hospitalization, that‚Äôs 2,000,000 people need hospitalized, 6 month event.  



Sweden 22,000 hospital beds.  hospital overwhelmed quickly, every person needs hospitalized turned away **will die**.  someone needs hospital getting oxygen, intravenous fluids, drugs round clock care sent home, zero chance survival.  

2,000,000 need hospital, 300,000 get admitted rest 1,700,000 die.   Giving Sweden case fatality rate 17%.

The mistake everyone makes thinking Case Fatality Rate (CFR) fixed, it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs dependent care provided.  Italy crisis spring regions CFR almost 10%, hospitals weren‚Äôt overwhelmed.  

Once hospitals get overwhelmed, CFR skyrocket, entire families get get sick die together.  

What outlined Homeland Security, military governments plan pandemics. things allowed progress hospitals overwhelmed get ugly, really, really, ugly. fair, I‚Äôm Florida family members throughout northeast Puerto Rico they‚Äôre still gathering thanksgiving. Thanks! Saved time! Stop appealing assertion dude. Humans become pretty powerful. We've eradicated two diseases nearly eradicated 12. present information repeat thesis, acting never kicked ass intellectually. Humanity invincable, neither nature.  silly me... assumed got tested end every shift come next positive. changed numbers 99+ percent survival rate. that's low end actual number. 

Heres sources. I'm fucking tard doesnt back words actual facts. 1990s, young guy protested seat belts, nanny state, etc. died car accident. want say 18.

Ah, snopes article! Wait till start getting vaccines first. Talk cheap. Money rules. Wait see. Can‚Äôt bad. Republicans say nothing worry none Democratic leadership follows guidelines I'm disagreeing that, specifcally said another comment ""Obviously best option)"". point *better* option. Obviously staying house 24/7 avoiding human contact best option, feasable, especially without govt relief (talking broadly thanksgiving).  Solid question. think agree Donald Buster. Ah, old ‚Äúlet‚Äôs trick people‚Äù technique ‚Äî always goes well. outsider, watching Americans selfish inconsiderate towards fellowmen, I‚Äôm sure anymore feel sadness disgust. Oxford vaccine news chilled right out. ¬£3 shot, need liquid nitrogen, millions doses already made trust science.

Combine mass fast lateral flow testing done Liverpool, highest case rate, see light end tunnel.

I'm going hibernate mum gets vaccinated. Yeah, COVID like wearing seatbelt, getting ejected vehicle pinballing every car ten car radius. Imagine caring anything Umm, reinstated comment, entire post removed? please talk colleagues? take hug! comment satire. Cheers. maybe world sick tired caring silly foolishness comes USA. people going punch face good deal TV they're 6 feet apart? piled bodybags street beginning. ask honest question?

Does thought don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre talking aren‚Äôt qualified claim science wrong Covid scientists actually know ever cross mind?

And does, wtf tell push away double believing you‚Äôre smartest man world? Jesus, hope holding again. True, particulars. appears risk catastrophic event lowered based whatever science beliefs charged scientists held. contrary opinion warning opposite, majority consensus. unfortunate time majority opinion wrong. reverse happens, warned tragic event likely nothing happened, would mocked ridiculed. little read, negligence interpretation based wording. certainly would better mentioning probabilistic terms. could family Texas. husband tested positive recently. would home state (military) would every Sunday see family. always do. Sundays family day. eat, play board games, starting like 10 morning till 7 night. know early this. knew happening, would there. Certainly caught early this, would burying father. scares me. story pops head week now. close home part stay safe supporting local businesses? everyone ‚Äòselfish‚Äô we‚Äôd hell lot better society, you‚Äôre great Unfortunately not. Adoption agencies strict rules. access car (for vet trips) large enough apartment, fenced backyard (if want dog).

Living city's downtown area, grad student budget, meet criteria haha. depends.. i'd willing look past person administering shots using ""half vial"".. that's ""misunderstanding"" - someone read.. 

&amp;#x200B;

but WTF less active ingredient..?

the problem manufacturing.. 

how get people's arms ***BEFORE*** realized.. shots weaker designed be, containing much less ingredient meant give person immunity. American hard read. I'm really happy Australia, makes hate idiots country especially ones charge. saw boyfriend/the people lives with/ like usually do. question is, constantly fear mongering stories masks social distancing never end even vaccines, expect people do? Like people haven‚Äôt seen family year experts keep claiming won‚Äôt end anyways. yes think gathering thanksgiving lots old relatives dumb hell. What's vitamin regiment? I'm working Psych Facility periodic community spread. take Quercetin, D3, K, C, E, Magnesium, Pepcid AC, Baby Aspirin, Multivitamin Ensure daily. wear N95 level 3 surgical mask covering it. let us wear eye protection ""it scare patients"" wear non prescription glasses protect eyes. wipe items wash clothes soon get home, go straight shower. missing anything mitigation protocols? online arguments people March didn‚Äôt think could afford lock *for couple weeks*. People constantly trade short term pleasure long term gain. people STILL protest meaningful measures mitigate virus. locked hard quick beginning, may stood chance preventing thing really taking hold. would saved lives, would bought time understand complications young healthy people ‚Äî instead subjecting entire generation potential long term chronic health problems; something one likes talk about, it‚Äôs ever deaths. say DeSantis done good things. I'd go far aside shit pandemic handling quite bit better Rick Scott. F guy! Leaders lead example. I‚Äôve following growth trends since March pinpoint states, metros, cities going experience sharp rises cases weeks. I‚Äôve explained entire process several times threads - copy handy paste.

Long story short: put... Covid tests Covid testing google trends. follow track (on paper) states daily, well cities/metros I‚Äôm interested following. One day provides little real insight. (Like looked tried make decisions based areas today last 7 days. wouldn‚Äôt know states moving last weeks day see states get control.) track weeks watch states move charts get good idea cases explode. quite moving parts account level 2 spread, level 2 searching testing (sometimes overlay search: Covid symptoms, less volume, used confirm areas large spike cases 3-4 weeks out. Otherwise, level 1, it‚Äôs couple weeks out.

However ballgame become tougher spread happening everywhere multiple areas pop time last month plus. example, ensure northeast blowing search volume... upstate NY, ME, VT, NH, MA...

But confidence Hawaii, mainly Honolulu, NYC, NJ see boom cases, much higher seeing weeks, less. Hawaii last state US labeled ‚Äúout control spread‚Äù. Sadly, last.

I‚Äôve studying stuff good 5+ hours day since early January. Hell, Jan - April many days logged good 12-18 hours in. read every report released scientists, yet peer reviewed, get idea may coming pike far news months ahead time and/or stay ahead curve like finally hitting media long-term effects Covid whether someone gets sick asymptomatic. read peer reviewed well. It‚Äôs talked researched months, yet people learning long haulers life-long incurable things happen some. POTS one. example staying ahead info curve helpful - knew avoid costs, especially kiddos. 

The gov media done one hell job keeping people confused. masses really knew dealing with, don‚Äôt know would happen society. craziest thing all: one wear mask, wash hands, stay away people outside home right now. Pretty simple, see, whole heck lot people even that. choice: become self-educated allow media, social media, friends, etc. sources education. see well that‚Äôs working US population.

I play safer almost anyone know. stopped ‚Äúselling‚Äù friends family. Gave up, honestly. least feel comfortable knowing could starting Jan them. sucks getting ‚Äúyou right‚Äù texts. last thing wanted seek right. :(  actually look rank Healthcare education, etc. would know.

Unless rather pretend true is. Class inequality existed pandemic. known that. lot grossly obvious areas now. Wow. mother cna must get tested month.  mRNA vaccines may potentially cause cancer autoimmune disorders later life. people worried get AZD1222 vaccine. Either mRNA new way approach vaccines, new era like getting space, could next cigarettes healthy type deal. made judge decides telling lies -- authority? one leftists! 

No one decides telling lies, objective thing. Take guy also commented, talked autoimmunity concerned long term effects vaccine. real concern rebuttals argument opened mind. decided go full Jesus claim I'm radical fool? (God forbid Jewish Muslim). hope troll ever want imagine someone stupid. 

You're right freedom speech voice anything want say. likewise, first amendment right call it. I'm willing listen opinion, accompanied facts. Maybe want civil conversation next time, go calling conspiracy theories Anthony Fauci Bill Gates. us who've things properly boat yourself, awful truth 'feeling normal' necessary survive live life.  
You ask willing potentially kill another person attempt feeling normal again. tough, long wait there's good reason hold long possible.  
I know words encouragement random internet stranger like help, I'll give much can.  
Seriously, chatting online helps, answer comment. can't hurt, it? Transmission probability varies lot cases. ""NOOOOOO CAN'T GO SEE FAMILY STAY INDOORS NEVER SEE ANYONE NOOOOOOO"" worker probably peak much handle working minimum wage dealing fucks like daily, tbis would set top shoes TBF, Hawaii allowing tourism meet criteria enter. test negative within 72 hours flight. Plenty people taking advantage opportunity visit Hawaii. 

I agree optics don‚Äôt look good.  start writing jokes below.

This one got crying. (Tears joy) :P I'm curious, people locked home since March, get lucky vaccine never produced, would stayed locked away forever? think said isn‚Äôt crude? RemindMe! 18 days mean vaccines? bad thing? admit know sarcasm tag... I'm hoping now, honestly. state city mandate live enforcement. sucks environment understand let say anything. signs ""please wear mask"" store doors work either. No, not. reacting though. Dear god people get America hate. countless articles horrible many European countries going covid. Per Capita horrible get zero hate. wear mask indoors around people apparently mask mandates Europe ton stopping thing. Chill out. lot issue fucked system healthcare is, many hospitals really low funds, taking care patients instead elective surgeries good business model. egregious Mitch blocked anything funding hospitals. Would meant could properly pay people hazard... We'll see lot hospitals issuesv years come, especially serving underinsured populations. yesterday trump gave press conference PAC opposed president tweeted image suggested president wearing adult diapers Twitter account created Diaper hashtag. internet seeing ran cyber bullied president hard diaper trending. Trump saw got mad called ending protections modern social media possesses. Probably spreads like wildfire die. Spreading virus. family friends go get covid test feeling well around someone it, got clubbing get results quarantine. point sure. articles need science based absolutely chime opinions merits Oh wish family best. hope scare. 
You want get it. hurts much breathe. 


Yeah supposedly 5 people passed. would half close family. four main (my mom, dad, brother me. husband two kids. brother wife.) family, father, me, SIL, high risk. would worst off. Made cry hard. virus ~14 day incubation period. won‚Äôt see spike yesterday caused till everybody‚Äôs getting ready Christmas. saying die? That‚Äôs crude. west spent last 100 years proclaiming democracies best form government. 

And here's China, booming economy, effective management pandemic started within country, focus improving nation. Meanwhile, western world trying shoot foot. 

The perceived superiority western system may last long. matter much better I/we think is, change fact completely screwed nations much better. saving grace nation's like South Korea handled well also democracies; decency wear masks distance. That's easy step take 2 3 months; nearly back normal. I'd worried cancer/autoimmune disorders later life mRNA approach. anti vax valid scientific skepticism mRNA gene therapy vaccines considering brand new Oh sorry, know meant everything said accurate LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL understand point. keep faith. likely 2 approved weeks! week study showing antibodies decline quickly. Next week another shows stay steady 12 months. known cats contract coronavirus there's articles testing positive symptoms. Afaik can't self replicate cats back humans, barring crazy mutation course. 

My cat died arms covid, collapsed breathe. three large gatherings. 

It wonderful holiday. Great seeing everyone. 

All losers seethe. read article?

‚ÄúResearchers University Pittsburgh discovered kind mutation hadn‚Äôt seen coronaviruses raises fresh concerns evolution vaccine resistance.

In search mutations, researchers mostly focused flips one genetic letter another ‚Äî kind mutation known substitution. Paul Duprex colleagues discovered viruses mutating chronically infected patient changing differently: losing sets genetic letters.

Typically, mutation deletes genetic letter catastrophic virus. cells read genetic letters three time choose new building block add growing protein. deletion one genetic letter entirely scramble instructions viral protein, cannot form functional shape.
But Dr. Duprex colleagues found coronaviruses patient could lose genetic letters yet stay viable. secret: viruses lost genetic letters sets three. Instead destroying genetic recipe viral protein, mutations snipped one amino acids.
As much Dr. Duprex despises pandemic, finds hard admire elegance mutations. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cool, it‚Äôs brilliant,‚Äù said.

Having found deletion mutations viruses one person, Dr. Duprex colleagues wondered common were.
Searching public databases coronavirus genomes, discovered deletions surprisingly widespread. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs happening independently different parts world,‚Äù Dr. Duprex said.
All deletions, turns out, arise one region, spike protein. Dr. Duprex colleagues found deletions spike gene didn‚Äôt prevent coronavirus infecting cells.
Dr. Duprex colleagues posted study online Nov. 19. yet published peer-reviewed journal. researchers infecting animals deletion-mutant viruses better understand risk may pose vaccines.

‚ÄúWell, paper nothing reduce anxiety!‚Äù Dr. Read said email. ‚ÄúThis early data strongly suggesting virus potential escape human immunity.‚Äù
But Drs. Read Kennedy argue viral evolution won‚Äôt necessarily doom vaccines. Vaccine makers need stay aware it, devise new vaccines necessary.
And numerous varieties vaccines development. first two approaching approval United States use significant chunk viral RNA train immune system. vaccines development use whole virus. different vaccines deliver virus part different ways, could prompt different immune response.‚Äù change ‚ÄúLive free die‚Äù stepdad tested positive today. lost sense taste Tuesday took it. live mom, long time smokers don‚Äôt best immune systems.

We‚Äôre society built around debt on-demand consumption pretty much everything. Hell, don‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs like ‚Äúseasonal fruits vegetables.‚Äù

This loose analogy, can‚Äôt expect someone never run marathon even begrudgingly run 10k without kicking screaming. haven‚Äôt lived life they‚Äôre regularly tested, can‚Äôt expect first pass go well all‚Äîdespite best efforts.

Imo, solidifies fact aren‚Äôt ready (for lot things). generations us learn weren‚Äôt prepared for. take individuals prepare later generations. It‚Äôs existential triage. That's strategy.

Herd immunity, point virus, akin saying ""I anything God protect me"" Man types Lol every post thinks others grow up. ""we'll home Christmas"" never tire beating south unwanted pregnancy happens. ""We went bareback twice get knocked must fine!"" think point wired article journalistic integrity, topic COVID topic day. say happen, nurse poor example base story on. digging indicates one person died COVID hospital. Maybe seen others elsewhere, direct experience seem good sampling story deniers.

I believe happen, going bring national news story fully vetted prevent proven false unlikely. Otherwise reinforcing denier's beliefs making easier convince others fence. Maryland, could called ""snitch line"" sick yesterday stayed home. Don‚Äôt worry, kids never going back school. child leave home she‚Äôs 80.

You might get come end fine, might come side dead permanently damaged. careful, *not* want catch this.

Humans wide variety viewpoints things, makes life fascinating. 3 brown, 1 blue video animated models that's helpful explaining dad started watching week ago, he's gone ""Trump voter"" full-out right wing nuts.  Brainwashing propaganda. obesity, alot Americans died too, cure heart disease it.

Obesity heart disease don‚Äôt affect people around you. go ahead stop people driving cars alot people died them.

We traffic laws reckless driving dangerous people around you

Wear mask social distance also dangerous people around Look, I'm really sorry one tell seems need hear it:  


Both daughter idiots go trip. 3 weeks waiting needed working brain set eyes.  


Why planning trip year option? nurses short supply, may forced work positive COVID-19. test forced work anyway?  dont state wide mandate city work mandate, dont enforce it. I'm allowed say anything anyone wearing masks they're afraid people get violent us, clean sanitize ass off. not. made up. breaking news, water fact still wet.

They're going skip baby showers weddings poker nights football parties quilting circles, they're going stop going church favorite pub, they're certainly going forgo Thanksgiving.

People take things seriously public seem think friends family count, even they're visiting town. in-laws invited 12 person dinner later weekend state aunt visiting. occur tell ""no, visit year"" family.

I know people refuse buy masks wear store employee chases provides it. know lot bored tired people ""just want get with"" they're taking precautions all.

I work home leave groceries, depressing outside options limited day.

I could get used this.... heaven forbid tape wall bottle water nurse station. I'm sorry test positive going anywhere especially working medical field. stay home awhile lose income? Guess what, millions people lost jobs beginning still work deemed safe. Fucking suck what's right fellow employees, patients community. 2x 4x stable influenza (depending measure mutation rate per whole genome mutation rate per base pair). spreading pretty naive population, everyone vaccinated caught it, start see evolutionary pressure towards mutations favor immune escape.

okay, so, going sound like I'm taking personally want stress I'm trying paint picture folks might experiencing.

I'm 26, live folks, barely afford gas go work, took second job title responsibilities greatly expand work prospects, poor college/university willing trade debt meager opportunities (not college/university useful - bad internet online classes mix well, imagine).

I mean, everyone I've come across *does care* think care bigger pictures opposed smaller fragments. younger folks think virtue age confidence, live for. older folks done they're entire 40+ year lifespan reduced they've read history books. everyone else worried *we* think we'll look population - y'know, exactly something *truly* care recent memory? government Hollywood care stuff. imagine average peoples really care much **debt** **bills**.

I've *begging* another stimulus check hit bank lol. pride liberal ideology good-Lord-in-Heaven, could use another $1200 keep panicking every time buy gas, little bit, hourly checks come start, y'know, getting finances back order.

I'm likely naive bit optimistic, think lot people continuing negative impact can, want to, raised think so. maybe people backs wall one - we're forced continue.

this ""new normal"" breaking ways find difficult actually give shit anything aside deteriorating mental health lol. can't justify it, can't reason it, can't anything - hope make enough money go back work, able confidently put resume try move up.

Look, couple months we‚Äôre going administration actually prioritize stuff everyone. fuck corporate America. showed true colors this. don‚Äôt give fuck us. ended long nutshell, hope helps explain like is.

Maternal side family Pentecostal. I'm talking snake kissing, rolling around aisle speaking tongues Pentacostal, area rural backwards remember child seeing KKK meetings church parking lot. That's environment grew in, physically abusive alcoholic father barefoot-and-pregnant doormat mother. remember kid aunt (she mom's twin btw) one always wanted ""escape"". highly intelligent, always seeking educational opportunities well adulthood (she still takes college courses self-professed career student). Mensa member, Toastmasters club, etc. Rebelled happy homemaker women expected family.

Now I'm even armchair psychologist also has, always see described, strong narcissistic tendencies. talk hours upon hours herself, extremely dominant sisters, micromanaged children hating her, unbelievably manipulative, never wrong fault anything, always controls everything conversation thermostat life decisions anyone can't escape her. Always victim, always martyr, always boss control too.

Four failed marriages years personal level started spiraling control yet continued excel studies career. son, cousin close 2 weeks apart (she pressured mom getting pregnant time could give birth time, whole story) diagnosed rare cancer early 30's. sent completely deep end fought wife control medical treatment wishes. declined control success medical treatments, I'm talking literal success making work, turned back Pentacostal faith. literally tried sign hospital deathbed hospice care take tent revival faith healer, 100% convinced God would cure him. died literally screaming wife across body. tried take custody grandson away wife, filing petitions ground. flatly denied lost access child. 

At point decided Pentacostal church's fault somehow came conclusion following wrong church. became devout Catholic within months. downward spiral conspiracy theories coupled genuine belief knows anyone, full stop.

I guess tl:dr version extremely intelligent person shitty upbringing suffers untreated mental health problems, good job hiding true self necessary (like employment academic settings). example social media interacts academics professionals go much beyond Praise Jesus Trump 2020 closed environment family real crazy comes out. avoid much possible. read article absolutely imagining dropping trow duecing open hand like god damn shit vending machine. Yeah, tourists insane here. lot locals better though, regarding travelling. 

My girlfriend's sister *and* father spent vacations Florida within last months quarantine coming back. sister works COVID testing site too!

""You careful, either gonna get won't,"" always says.  family got together thanksgiving got argument support gathering everyone made like crazy person. 9 people total, two babies, 2-65s, 1-90, five different ‚Äúbubbles‚Äù coming together. Texans: standing edge roof rain dripping down. ""I'm going stand awning like I'm scared little rain."" NBER found protests impact. small percentage population protesting offset much larger proportion people stayed home avoid them. Germans stupid shit Christmas Guy work caught week half. He's better he's 100%. call someone asked got he's like ""Thats thing, know. go anywhere...except take 15 year old son football practice."" Someone asked, ""and son get it?"" ""No, got too.""

...now, I'm Bobby Goren, got hunch. think that's fair comparison. Since influenza mutates quickly like novel virus (to bodies) time. 

We could probably eliminate specific strains flu tried cost/benefit there.

These slower mutating viruses like SARS-CoV-2 much likely appear immune systems time. ‚ÄúMisinformation‚Äù ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù you‚Äôre cute. don‚Äôt consider proper precautions ending things involving living. Feel free live bunker eating canned tomatoes. I‚Äôm not. That‚Äôs probably young, healthy ophthalmologist first discovered CoVID Wuhan died. epicenter, inundated virus.  Ah see point. think feel bad case. Protect best without stressing system, got it, use it. Like southwest, tell put mask first, decide kid like best. think that's thing ppl realize difficult patients severity, quickly crash, understaffed unsafe.

Doesn't stop people bitching need name brand soda omg food eat.

Sigh. can't imagine people leaving bedside nursing. pretty sure everywhere. beyond fucked. believe false dichotomy either economy virus mitigation? world isn‚Äôt black white; vision shouldn‚Äôt either. 

What think it‚Äôs going cost society significant percentages people long term effects? happens big chunk population newly disabled, knows long? complete total failure mitigate things led us infections deaths country? (At least far know... suspect data manipulation rampant globally).

Our economy fucked right now. 40 million people lost jobs beginning, haven‚Äôt able find new jobs, included. we‚Äôd leadership, could like Australia. may isolated US benefit massive island, success due sacrifice early game. wouldn‚Äôt surprised Australia takes economic role US used since aren‚Äôt riddled death, disease, disability.

Edit: social distancing working home class issues. Consider fortunate can; aren‚Äôt norm. Disadvantaged classes don‚Äôt even option, deserve protection much anyone else. street also packed people waiting get coronavirus test care. DeSantis still ways go strategy mass murder....cough...herd immunity...cough...is complete. Yes, city everything could. first days first found infections state crucial. Unfortunately, Cuomo deBlasio told people anything afraid go life normal first infections reported. numbers infected dead stem unmatched population density New York City fueled spread. trying politicize this, apologize lot trolls do. places country I'd want live atm. pointed many studies blame pandemic partying dining.

In spring, limited data transmission environments, quite sure household, school work transmissions much important, especially German Webasto case analysis. sure look like anymore. US thing. problem Europe. Athletes paid milions essential workers minimal wage. boat. Since son died used things like travel, visits, etc. motivate me. gone now. never thought would lose travel! 
I read, go work, occasionally beer spices unravel. Hopefully end sometime soon.
Yes sucks. Hang there. Getting takeout curbside delivery ""going out."" expect people stay room eight months living another planet. Working emergency room, old co worker mine going nursing school University. wife says me, ""Hes tired getting tested every week, bet tired getting tested!""

My response- ""I havent tested once."" 

Tbh testing seems false sense security. White house daily tests still spread like wildfire, even football teams showing handful positives even anything, though worried basically professional athletes, outside exposing less healthy people. Sounds like ‚Äúblack sheep‚Äù family. Good you. one inherited logical thinking genes. Don‚Äôt let dopes let think otherwise. Keep distance moment on, question say do, probably best interest (or yours!). might feel sad, happy going get sick insidious disease. hands full bundle joy anyway! Ah. can‚Äôt trust numbers. Bolsonaro however take emu bite vaccine. that's probably grandma died rehab. r/im14andthisisdeep I‚Äôm assuming she‚Äôs either trolling brain tumor. Lol aren‚Äôt Local sheriffs wont enforce anyways (nationwide lockdown), means matter. cant send military everywhere enforce lockdown, police biggest ignorers covid restriction (party law order lmao). would :national lockdown, effectively, small percentage national population.  really think high time regulatory bodies start suggesting use something like 3Ms 6800s. P100/HEPA filters last months. Ok based information, let rephrase. ‚ÄúYou 97% survival rate‚Äù, still sounds pretty good Yeah interestingly, unanimous. one two people give correct answer, subject too.

So try remember someone group might disagree waiting someone else speak up. agree understand acute side effects, would picked trials. However, lot ""long hauler"" issues dont seem crop 3-6 months infection. trials going 3-4 months large scale, I'm sure would see yet.


My understanding cause long haulers symptoms this: well understood yet leading theories people mild symptoms virus, virus itself, rather immune system active learning fight virus cause issues. 


My question this: long hauler issues indeed caused immune response vaccine invokes similar immune response someone recovered virus, could small number vaccine recipients experience long hauler symptoms? vaccine work fundamentally different way would invoke different immune response would someone overcame virus itself? miss days...  **Holocene extinction**, otherwise referred **sixth mass extinction** **Anthropocene extinction**, ongoing [extinction present (with recent time sometimes called result [human

Emphasize. conversation around Thanksgiving probability exacerbating current outbreak sorts travel. it'd nice highlight positive trends we're seeing thankful too. example, relatives Illinois concerned them, I'm thankful appears caseload hospitalizations plateaued. 

I know likely hold given holidays, good sign steps taking seems appropriate impact likely continue impact bulge Thanksgiving works way through. 

I guess I'm looking optimistic signs maintain semblance sanity. dangerous air travel? dad (who flys quite bit) keeps telling ""all data shows air travel relatively safe"" can't find much back counter it... honestly feels like it'd super unsafe. would imagine he's smart enough see on-the-way-out administration continue people USA (to provide assistance citizens wait hypothetical lockdown) trying get people everything else avoid *having* another lockdown. 

Even *if* Biden's administration manages work something help US citizens (highly unlikely considering amount delaying obstruction tactics on-the-way-out administration, who've going way help average citizen *damnedest* slip shit helps huge businesses millionaires/billionaires since day one pandemic) still come waaaaaaaay late far many people. 


The orange idiot way *extremely successful* scorched earth policy exit strategy. Sucks rest country, he's shown time reaaaaaaaaaaaaaally give fuck anyone else harms actions, words, choices.. :( What? fuck said anything magic? proof cops selectively enforce law feel like took virology teaching vaccine coronavirus changes quickly. think government asking deliberately infect family global epidemic disease government coming life telling do?

Really? Exactly - we've heard story nurses across country yet Wired wants us believe PR person hospital. made long ass drive southeast yesterday. roads exceptionally dead. Way less people normal Thanksgiving parts. I'm stating coding discrepancy. even want know testing.  ""We would rather selfish care fellow countrymen lives families"" 

THAT ridiculous thing ever heard. projection strong one^^^ Look bright side, least country taking care work you. start forcast 1 million americans would die Covid, things done stopped these, simple thing like wearing mask would stop lot people dying, help people 3rd world country would worrying really no. highest GDP growth rate SE Asia , transformed major cities closer HK Taiwan Vietnam knew Nixon's time.

It basically underwent transformation similar Korea. though. Every percentage point people take pandemic seriously huge impact spread. It‚Äôs culture, Australians western culture Australian would know link Fox News article? people Well, curious (ex) Pfizer execs taking pot shots competitor's vaccine happen cost 5 times less... experience, people willing take risk around family close friends think get it.

I people work super strict since March even hear cancelling Thanksgiving. completely thought risk worth it.

I debated dinner parents ultimately decided to. Reddit populated self-righteous, socially maladjusted neckbeards whose parents paying lifestyles anyway. isolating pandemic afterward. mean 28.2% would become reinfected? Reread post again. Maybe understand. Fox News spouting social distancing work People believe that. 

Can anyone tell people believe hear like without skeptical - questioning poking around?

I believe thing read look myself. 

I read news like everyone, read something like **""The President says RAT POISON actually good you!**

And reaction ""Why would say something like that? can't true!""

**Or ""The Pope reveals position - recycling!""**

And reaction ""Why would care, place weight comments anyone else's? cares position is? He's wife. would anyone give shit says?""

Or scientist claims cancer cured - anything hear news. **""Mark Harmon likes Cheetos Arrow Shirts!""** Good That's nice. buy shirt likes them.

My overarching question people sit back take without questioning it? 

B.B. King exactly right sang ""[Nobody loves mother. could jivin' 

Be fucking skeptical look things yourself. true mortality rate approaching flu. many people getting COVID due high transmission rate deaths higher. flu vaccine. Hey, thanks man, I'll try. girlfriend stayed home instead going parents. sister's family coming across state. added pleasure Thanksgiving week another sister's niece's birthday. video call everyone mad besides mom nieces nephew (all 7) sister even talk me. guess deserve, since ""no worse flu"" I'm overreacting +500% change daily new cases state. I'm sure American literally close nobody that. ones arent actually useful need work. simple it. get rid covid restrictions businesses, open schools (like CDC says), open businesses full capacity. Also, side note, Cuomo needs stop targeting jews like little Hitler is. Good thing neighbors across street annual Thanksgiving festivities 50 family members came nobody wore mask. interesting see anybody disappears family coming months. probably 

But cause shitty immune system cause me. entire thread hilarious - every poster replying responds pissed sentence.

Watch we'll overshoot estimate like always do. Anyone denies virus‚Äôs virulence needs speak health care professionals. people risking health caring others, dealing pandemic - day in, day out.

My 62 year old cousin hospital floor converted COVID unit. Worked/works 12 hour night shifts (which never lasts 12 hrs), given inadequate PPE, contracted COVID.
4 months later, still shortness breath extreme fatigue. Yet Dr. Cleared go back work 3 months.

Her sister, hand, changed lifestyle one bit.

Masks work pretty well though, Japans numbers nowhere near western countries I‚Äôve heard several people (one ‚Äúreal‚Äù person others online / TV interviews. feel like there‚Äôs reliance masks stay protected. 

I live part big city everyone wears masks. grocery store packed. People near others worried since masks on. 

Obviously improves odds, clearly foolproof.

Yes sub purely anxiety driven. try stay away it, posts like Absolutely - I‚Äôve fortunate experience 3 different systems living abroad many years 

Japan - Nationalized Health care

1. dosage maybe low. Vit go 4-5000 IU per day without problem. Fat people need even more. Zinc picolante 20% elemental, could taken 200 mg picolante daily without problems. Quercetin think 500 mg twice day. 

2. may outlier somehow. Something (food, drug) could interacted protocol. 

3. initial load way bigger average. Like spending hours car infected person similar situation.

But also said different procedural environment Canada breath fresh air coming single-payer facility private/corporate one. 

I would love purely independent quantitative/qualitative comparison systems. think, people could put entrenched politics aside, could probably learn lot good bad elements other's systems. Maybe enough either country make wholesale shift one philosophy another, enough modify healthcare systems make better overall. Im sorry. get spit 10% number fact. Real life accounts worth nothing. Literally nothing. case study warrants studying. I've read accounts chilling. HOWEVER, 200k cases USA alone. getting trickles maybe 15-25 verified long haul reports maybe week. 

Secondly, mixing numbers across age groups making blanket statements proof. Thats ridiculous

Im sorry, believe pseudoscience. believe Covid19, masks deathrate. however yet believer long hauling ""Americans always try right thing they've tried everything else.""

\-- Winston Churchill well good thing like supreme court priorities straight....fuckers. Yep. Covid low k factor means mostly spreads super spreading events. infectious infectious. One person got 15 members family sick. far know 1 person caused Whitehouse cases. opinion puts R0 someone infectious high higher measles. Covid spreads like bomb blast opposed slow fire like flu.

The avg R0 3-6, effect social behavior, low k factor, etc.

I mean look epidemiological studies restraunt outbreaks, reports family gatherings, pretty obvious R0 sky high. Thankfully window narrow. December going brutal. Looking 50k 70k deaths. November might play 40k so. next two weeks, US roll 1 death per 1000 territory.  look [remaining life expectancy assume COVID kills people early proportionally across ages (a good assumption know COVID mortality scales similarly all-cause mortality), years life lost (with equal prevalence across ages) indeed people 80s 70s. 60s 50s far behind. number deaths achievable ""ignoring problem"" really get manageable numbers (by 2019 standards 9/11 every day year would considered unthinkable) get age 35.

On flip side, might mortality half spring, long keep hospital burden manageable. Everything Mississippi Alabama pay far national average. 

National companies know offer lower wages raises people areas. becoming popular practice. companies large remote teams notorious practice.

BUT, live rural midwest. It‚Äôs unusual households 3 generations living together. average age people kids like 17, end 10+ people home. I‚Äôm one team doesn‚Äôt kids, one coworkers 26 5. That‚Äôs we‚Äôre dealing with, that‚Äôs normal here. 

Most don‚Äôt really believe pandemic, gonna get nasty next week get back work. think watch much TV understand little place world. It‚Äôs almost there‚Äôs miles difference different types punishment, summary execution one worst types Yeah clearly  Anyone able throw light Pfizer Moderna swabbing participants showed symptoms? know many cases asymptomatic, increase potential missed cases therefore inaccurate efficacy data? Slightly confused factor consider: AstraZeneca-Oxford measured results different way two major competitors. Moderna Pfizer/BioNTech trials captured Covid-19 infections trial pool advanced far enough produce symptoms, AstraZeneca trials conducted weekly swab tests among participants, allowing detect much less severe cases ‚Äî including potential asymptomatic infections ‚Äî among volunteers. differences make trickier draw apples-to-apples comparisons efficacy different vaccines. much good point actually lot capacity hospitals many countries single payer. 

Not saying system perfect even good incentivize extra. sweet, thank understand nuance dead, saying fucking public bipartisan isn‚Äôt thing saying they‚Äôre equal. aren‚Äôt, they‚Äôre shitty. I'm healthcare field weeks ago around someone ended testing positive. soon found informed employer told go work since we're short staffed get tested. believe . rejected respirator card medical reasons, give COVID patients anyway, general population floors, they've run room COVID units. They're ordered RN assignment only, I'm usually RN floor. say ""Just grab N95!"" supposed fit tested REASON. 0 protection COVID rooms. die job fucking hate first place, I'll haunt every motherfucker hospital's administration. packing leaving everyone everything know *really* sucks. hard imagine unless experienced it. moved cross-country decade ago, felt like good experience, huge bummer close friends family nearby. eventually got job opportunities allowed us move back close friends family much happier.

I also remember people saying Canada actually pretty difficult place emigrate unless career high demand. trained healthcare worker might qualify, many others wouldn't. Canada (and including many French-speaking parts Canada) emigrating means learning new language, mention new culture, new finance system, etc. huge undertaking. mistake think valued Ball Throwers broken, disgusting country. Well, thanks anyway! majority hospitals make insane profits, need aid. wife's hospital going make $7billion revenue year instead $12billion, yet laying people complaining staff poorly financially ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è suck, sorry hear that. doctor pain? would hope could least tell what's wrong, although heard lot people long-term symptoms get told something like ""you anxiety,"" sent home. Hoping case too. Let's forget Elon Musk got four tests matter 24 hours ... Get back work, prole. don‚Äôt want hear ‚Äòunion‚Äô shit, either, unions sign devil/homosexuality/atheism/Islam/liberalism/communism/socialism/nazis/etc. clearly comment made good faith stimulate productive discussion; obviously intended raise drama.

This place that. policy disagreements, feel free discuss others -- encourage productive policy discussions! making comments obviously trying rile people up, next offense ban. nothing stage study (preliminary). don‚Äôt tout ethically challenged conclusions like that, especially lay public doesn‚Äôt know difference.

Thankfully criticism scientific community making way popular press AZ isn‚Äôt going get away it. 

You‚Äôve fallen image particular vaccine effort populist. reality conduct AZ horrific. intentional deception lay public, obvious reaching 90% PR victory compared mRNA vaccines, selective release critical information. know AZ holding closed door meetings investors try explain results? That‚Äôs critical details leaked from. separate image AZ vaccine somehow philanthropic ethical. It‚Äôs absolutely not. behavior horrible. add another anecdote, mother nurse Sweden. tested two three times since March. test nurses one confirmed positive, test individually unless someone displaying clear symptoms. Mother sore throat weeks back tested considered specific enough.

It varies place place, clearly lot nurses get tested way less be. mother fortunate county's healthcare profit driven, least they've able slow enough work enough overtime follow safety protocols. Smoked weed?? Slight understatement maybe Us üôÉ Could China onto something social credit system? Refusal wear mask could lower person's ""healthcare"" credit refuse priority access healthcare services. agree points, $2/hr seems unfair. Body removal jobs dont typically pay best, pay better that, lives paid govt, non-working inmates, feeling remaining (maybe $13/hr least) doesnt go towards working inmates way. Seems job, deserve fair pay, incarcerated not, $2/hr job doesnt seen fair. 

Sort reminds vice article read NK sending workers countries keeping close watch pocketing wage. Cant remember article ended up, considered slave labor not, truly got wages not.  heaven forbid call twice 3 month period. get written up. It‚Äôs ass backwards. 2 weeks

 RemindMe! 4 weeks Check Australia compared U.S. Agreed. Good countries like Australia New Zealand, really feel like number Asian countries getting praise deserve. Americans something america, so? important tiny world sound like fun person around. I'm really sure mentioned Reddit yeah hope goes well you. (I really know comment is, cool that's I'm saying) ""What's that? Cut taxes wealthy again?"" Local testing 250$. everyone afford that. third world shithole that's 100% better lol. third world shithole also actual leader, police shooting citizens, racial injustice. Hm else? Oh also believe virus real wear masks. 
Also know I'm lmao. 
And sorry bud center world, loudest.
Also triggered? ü§£ government handles teaching driving licenses too. stop teachers teamsters striking necessary. problem messaging. I‚Äôve said since beginning. 100 different messages coming 100 different points view. Even Fauci flip flops much mitigation strategies. understand lot powers influencing exactly get disobedience. I‚Äôve said million times telling people interact indefinitely realistic it‚Äôs strategy. hurricane tornado approaching town, would hope public officials do? Downplay say it‚Äôs worth panicking about, GTFO? Single payer healthcare system everybody.

Testing Australia completely free accessible. less 90 active cases, major cities &lt;10. know good textbook subject? going overboard buying Christmas presents kids .. overcompensating shitty year. online. time I've gone store besides grocery shopping local independent toy store, online platform rough want still open over. really hate today retail workers, especially states mask mandate. I‚Äôm nurse called DOH told I‚Äôm health care worker fit next day. Earlier pandemic, tested day called. True! I‚Äôm posting first time possible discussion December 10th defining day. media OWS blasting 11th nearly confirmed DAY waiting for, first news MIGHT well late December January. It‚Äôs shown matter ‚Äúessential‚Äù someone is, thankful everyone claims be, difference regular folk forced work though nothing changed pandemic money worry clear. 

As nurse we‚Äôre still told limit often use gloves treating patients, daily meeting remind us appropriate time use gloves time hand hygiene limiting touching face paramount well being. We‚Äôve told we‚Äôre getting annual raise despite hospital maintaining business revenue stream surgeries. 

Likewise non hospital essential workers minimally paid grocery store employees choice work risk health stimulus bills limit need stagnate die senate thanks administration claims worship working class actively seeking hinder them. I'm sorry loss. really depends. regularly went Austria, usually taking small private accommodations ""rural houses"" typically rent handful rooms - pretty amusing typically cheapest, offering, opinion, much nicer environment hotel ever could. disadvantage really tend far slopes, know, car available, that's get (as public transport Czech Republic Austria pitiful). Usually, provide small kitchen cook, do. place meet people queues lifts lifts themselves. queues organized, mostly enough room, never enough will, lifts - chairlifts open fine, even block bubbles use exist. Closed aerial tramways worse, would probably avoid those, plenty good areas that. money. sports teams private companies massive universities paying tests. capitalism issue priority issue.

It's also priorities. people fantasy football subreddit arguing essentially nfl playing football important health public, players/ pandemic. 

This people actually believe. entertainment bigger priority public health.

Absolutely infuriating ignorant. I‚Äôm ignoring issue.. telling you‚Äôre downvoted live North Carolina governor specifically said 2 weeks. don‚Äôt know guy lives I‚Äôm 90% sure general consensus country back March 2 weeks flatten curve. That's insane almost hard belief. roommate nurse gets tested twice week. what? like football. replaced with? Americans, general, idea patient make sacrifices greater good. 180¬∞ different World War II. Everyone pull together get brutal five years war, food fuel shortages everywhere people dying millions. world exponentially complex people act like victims instead seizing day challenge overcoming obstacles arise. There's going lot pain ahead... Sick pay vacation time come PTO bucket (paid time off). test positive, stay home use time would otherwise use vacation.  NY anyone get test anytime want immediately. often small wait it‚Äôs day place, payment required, absolutely free. elderly, symptoms, frontline worker skip line entirely seen right away. don‚Äôt expect get upvotes doesn‚Äôt contribute outrage approved Reddit political narratives, think it‚Äôs important share. sister pharmacist around someone tested positive started feeling shortness breath. called hospital's employee Covid line.

She deals administrative side pharmacy. Earlier year able job 100% remotely. possible infection? ""No, need tested. come job.""

She go local testing site operated university get test done. got test results, started fever lost sense taste. suggest get tested work home.

It's ridiculous. virus mutates vaccine won‚Äôt work, would y‚Äôall quarantine another year another vaccine out? hypothetical question..I know unlikely humor I've got two relatives nurses western NY they've basically told matter even test positive would still expected work..... Same. get exposed constantly random pt pops positive symptoms we‚Äôre like ‚ÄúUhhhh please get tested?‚Äù They‚Äôre like ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see... develop symptoms.‚Äù Feels bad. It‚Äôs even worse family member exposed. told employer may exposed outside work told would quarantine 14 days without pay. incentivizing us lie exposure work symptoms. Maybe Christians believe faith strong enough, prove God devoted going church, protect getting virus dying it. 


The reality Christians delusional pick choose want believe, ignoring world around harm inflict so. Good right thing. Hopefully us NSW people help bring bit tourism trade back without COVID go along it. 

Also like phone capitalised Weezy No, I‚Äôm suggesting get COVID, develop antibodies (t-cells may weaken/diminish), fight COVID, antibodies fade several months, T-cells return normal (now ability fight COVID effectively), reexposed COVID antibodies, t-cells pick fight.

The research linked regarding someone presently fighting COVID. original article, entire post, fading antibodies months getting COVID. article doesn‚Äôt apply this. really.... hospitals getting first access vaccine regardless region's positivity case count. even rationed front-line nurses/doctors first, direct contact covid patients. may make sense roll vaccine general public hardest-hit areas first, may create free rider paradox, residents ignore safety precautions they're first line anyway. disincentive heed covid mitigation measures. Yes can. nut like NFL resource would diverted towards health care workers. NFL/Teams spending money lose tv revenue. low cost $30,000-60,000/year per inmate American tax payer! friend thought getting tested time lol I‚Äôm like noooo havnt once. work covid unit girlfriend CNA doesn‚Äôt work specifically COVID patients. gets tested week. Strange person tested regularly That's kind odd thing assume. sure would paying leagues. NFL spending millions covid tests.   dont know state in. clearly 2 weeks Michigan Yeah I'm mistaking guy asked question to. assumed one answering. Instead guy even seem understand we're talking about. least reply makes sense now. Lol losers literally America-Lite whether want not. know much? month 2 fine, it‚Äôs could pose issue big development. Obviously scientists thought long hard this. wife nurse tested 3 times. time wanted one, gotten one. wife asked test? yeah left individual districts here(MA) well. Gov pushing schools person January. Yup, policies US ass backwards, especially healthcare workers. really care catches comes work since fully protected. care enough staff maximize many patients given time Didn‚Äôt say shouldn‚Äôt tested weekly. Simply stating comparison misleading. Completely agree nurses health care workers neglected madness. absolutely get tested accord, anything like job, come back positive prove infected work. can't, stay home two weeks dime, hoping PTO cover since get paid enough comfortable savings. Fun fact: even prove infected work, fight third party make disability claim receive money. takes two months receive successful.

He proven years doesn‚Äôt;t give fuck last three groups. noted China treat like war make top national priority, 76 days. 300 000 deaths treated like war. Yeah, precautions sound better most. definitely get people want keep Christmas alive. think systemic level, choices made multiplied at-scale problematic. isn‚Äôt point yes that‚Äôs also true.  get tested employer (a hospital) refuses facilitate staff tested. Havent seen heard read anything contrary. strange. feel like much sacrifice me. I'm social anyways.  wish people government would work setting better example. ""Top Level"" stuff unforgivable.  wish proper preparation occured (rampup PPE manufacturing got hit) personal level, someone wants something want do, feel like absent proper top-down led approach, they're making personal choice, adding many personal choices moving R number little.  people I'm really angry people leadership (gov church, basically) encouraging people make bad choices. 2 major parties Aus, moderate left moderate right. federal/prime minister right, victorian state premier left (Victorians known lefties australia). basically aligned murdochs right wing party choice brutally smeared media, notably major papers. 
Unlike US cable news however papers subject fact checking regulations wasnt brutal would there, made loopholes opinion pieces etc.
Standard stuff, destroying peoples livelihood destroying economy little flu, pretty much republican narrative US, drafted guy.
Now 28 days cases normal life returned sans corona people still complaining he's done 'irreparable damage' economy. 
There nuance thats jist it.

Fun fact- petition royal comission effect murdoch media australian politics backed recent ex prime ministers major parties. Fuck murdoch basically, I'm sure sentiment USA relate thing teachers schools. I‚Äôm school nurse get tested cvs. course wait 3-5 days results. school districts don‚Äôt want us out. went school nursing caught covid can‚Äôt stay feet day anymore btw. literally gave everything fight first wave never ended look fuckery. Everything sacrificed literally nothing. 

Ok that‚Äôs cynical. took good care patients.... I‚Äôm surprised guess idea hospitals truly run. nurses could infect others wasn‚Äôt something thought hospitals would do.  okay! hot take!

Yes, hot take Sanders cares working class Biden. hot take! Well, we'll find final efficacy trial data released. highly doubt they've chosen vaccinate population vaccine work. would become obvious soon effective. terrifying! Thank goodness GI issues got go ER. hope symptoms ease feel better soon. Walmart greeter killed it. Several customers stores assaulted speaking fellow shoppers. 

It's question ""allowed"", question ""am willing risk hospitalization it?"". sounds like fortunate went hospital did. got second chance life. waste it. 
All best wishes recovery. That's it, folks. 2020 wrap. Well throwing ball vital medical care. country cannot run without sports. Medicine luxury one right! might die

Covid No, many theories actively pushed Trump us equipment maker Shimadzu Corp. said Friday started selling automated COVID-19 test device priced much lower similar products sold Kyoto-based firm expects ¬•2.09 million price tag make new AutoAmp polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test device affordable small hospitals quarantine offices. Similar machines sold around ¬•4 million, according device, 30 centimeters wide 66 cm high, process four specimens time, said. Shimadzu set annual sales target 3,000 said aiming expand coming years areas diagnostics products support new drug development. Unfortunately, 20 states report 10 partial reports. number 130000+ new cases/1300 deaths bit scary taking account. Im lost words.

How people living like that?
Do fear driving car? Except hospitals already laying people due major losses year (at least mine is), likely can‚Äôt afford give every COVID+ employee PTO. hospitals need government aid cant speak Switzerland - working industry living ski town Colorado tell that:

1. Ski schools allowed right now
2. \# passes per day limited queuing lifts socially distanced masked
3. Rentals allow couple people opening might cost-effective.

This also wrong. sold individual passes (vs. season passes) year previous year - resulting making money pass sales previous years. know mention work ski industry involved software manages pass sales lift kiosks. Yeah what‚Äôs gonna happen everything opens vaccine? Can‚Äôt stay shut rest eternity bad fall would be, cannot help wonder would happen country following occur next weeks:

* Nurses hospitals went strike

* refused go back work hospital administration tested them, better pay benefits

* lobbied reforms promises politicians fix capitalistic private insurance ran american health system, nurses, patients drs alike

It would horrible, would definitely make statement. Broncos practice? FDA Director state could matter ‚Äúdays‚Äù overwhelming vaccine timeline reported OWS media (for US) blasting articles basically stating December 11-12 DAY waiting for. 

This comment shows signs COULD potentially well December early January EUA approved FDA Pfizer/BioNTech, let alone Moderna‚Äôs haven‚Äôt submitted today (11-27-20).

I remain hopeful maybe pessimist‚Äôs timeline helps taper expectations slowly moving towards ‚Äúmarketing science‚Äù vaccines, far confusing even pulse 24/7 news. numbers looking? Healthcare worker here. work exclusively elderly. tested since pandemic started. Many places ban alcohol outright SEVERELY limiting purchases. 

When become puritans? nurse COVID much larger impact/potential cause harm football player COVID. tests would better spent nurses, often take PTO get tested outside employer. great discussion vaccine approval process JAMA interview. think it‚Äôs difficult comprehend mass amounts data working evaluate vaccines.[vaccine update Sports reward properly functioning society.

We one right now. process tests lab. wear PPE around immune compromised MS patients work case. honestly, artists use position worsen pandemic endanger public large, really hope contract covid see effects really are. get dismiss it, that's fine. keep live life. staking positions wind killing thousands fans (and others secondary spread) amoral. Well definitely big problem. Looks like science bail us soon. Even fuck-ups. soon enough lot people though. solace, even whole population follow rules, much different. Look Europe order reasonable thing need someone else first? Got it.

If Newsom says ""don't smoke crack"" smokes crack guess smoke crack too.

So smooth.  university sent email encouraging students staff travel holidays dinner people household only.... tune first hockey game season Jan 2. Athletes profitable, hospital workers aren't.

There's World Series Oncology, Super Bowl Trauma Unit, Formula 1 Ambulance race Monte Carlo.

If athletes play tickets sold, commercials watched, investors get paycheck.

Hospital staff told ""Good Luck"" sent rooms. Who? We‚Äôre expendable I've predicted times sub despite Fauci expecting Q2/Q3 return normal, despite expected March/April vaccine general public, 100% later those. September 2021 think Reddit fear (and sometimes nursed grievance) real issue.

Be careful ideas continually reinforce. affect think. Thank god work home took necessary precautions able enjoy Thanksgiving... influence still? care. all. End. The. Lockdown. they‚Äôre shutting alcohol purchases. anything, places expanded alcohol purchase laws allow bars/restaurants sell go alcohol sales. signal nation prioritizes

Not true imo. signal respective industries willing regarding pandemic maximize profits. Healthcare industries make ignoring nurses' needs. NFL makes catering players' health. 

It's failing Healthcare industry privatized. suppose call fault nation's priorities, though seem statement contextualized. rlftf... weird. Early on, thing bad, also ton fear unknown. lysoling food containers heard could survive surfaces days! 3-5% fatality rates considered reasonable estimate.

I think current behavior combination exhaustion, also realistic picture actual risks. Definitely society we'd better people took aggressive containment measures get control, clearly, happening.

Then game theory perspective young healthy person choice becomes: waste year prime life cowering home, pandemic still rage enough fellow citizens going mess anyway, or, take basic precautions (masks, hand sanitizer, distance) accept risk getting sick, 99+% chance recover fine. Nah disagree, sports effectively exist average people, specifically average people, caring way much focusing much attention sports. stopped watching American football happy implications supporting industry. _average_ person give huge fuck sports continually generate insane amounts engagement via TV, Twitter, etc., sports would nowhere near lucrative.

There lots areas saying true. Sports celebrities it. Sports celebrities specifically sitting fact average person assigns things excessive value, actively defends value. Try imply top athlete pretty much social forum see much vitriol get. Holy shit kind country this!?!?!? Wild. Canada test anyone anytime. Free testing pharmacies public health. Strong recommendations testing hospital staff there‚Äôs even hint suspected case. Routine surveillance testing hospitals overun covid patients put rest? think COVID vacs tested,

The testing rushed.

Why normally take years release drug vaccine?

Pharmaceutical companies make money.

If could release something one year instead 5, think they'd drugs?

Why lengthy trials first place think government hoping best?

Yes, pretty much.

Other drugs vaccines went normal rigorous trial process ended dangerous specific people, completely withdrawn market.

Thalidomide classical example one. 

The dengue vaccine much recent, retarded.

It's vaccine dengue fever dangerous children never dengue fever before, given people already dengue.

Let repeat you: vaccine, supposed protect get disease, dangerous given someone never disease (and therefore would need vaccine) given safely someone already disease vaccine supposed protect against.

About 600 children Philippines suspected died due vaccine, 100k vaccinated (and 800k total kids). words killed 0.6% kids dengue before, compared disease kills ""less 1%"" proper medical care provided.

And that's vaccine development 20 convinced vaccine uses completely new revolutionary method (mRNA) rushed testing 100% safe? lower efficacy estimate vaccine 62% meets FDA's target

The target 50%, roughly flu vax Leaders need lead example. thought too! know someone works local VA hospital, even patient facing position he's tested every 10 days so. covid doesnt get us free health care birth death.. give america

i done every thing god forsaken country profit. capitalism fucking kills That‚Äôs still available. Again, article tries imply aren‚Äôt enough tests ones given athletes. blatantly false *gestures EVERYTHING*

We leadership federal level since start this. that, even, disbanded pandemic response teams scientists places like China predict, track prevent this. I'm nurse. tested all. I've never covid test. test nurses, nurse could covid positive. Gotta keep numbers low, test less less positive results wife RN work COVID patients tested since March, IIRC June/July. Doctors, techs, PAs, etc wonder thing? 

odd facility tests employees, twice week. administrator cheap AF testing us, affordable. know hell wrong hospitals care facilities. pretty much part reason stay there, also even get people tested. much fucked, hospital staff isolate covid spike, people would probably begin die frequently lack staff. Right know covid ward essentially entire staff exposed, get time develop serious symptoms. Hate speech protected first amendment USA. Mostly hate speech subjective causes physical harm. said would take 2 weeks everyone followed guidelines, like 50% people time symptoms you‚Äôve already spread it. You‚Äôd think hospital would understand that.  It‚Äôs unheard people‚Äôs employers may healthcare providers, though. CPMC owned Sutter Sutter one major healthcare groups state; urgent cares testing covid early. testing them, charging $330 Sutter appointment fee. Anyone needs test get one. don‚Äôt let anyone take 0 symptoms though. tent cities hear generally warm-weather areas like California, though always small encampments place suppose. told wear hospital provided masks, it‚Äôs everywhere want protect better go see patients. I‚Äôve looked masks online sure buy. brand reusable N95? people bound say: they‚Äôve application week already don‚Äôt approve deny it?


In medical school went lecture retired pharmaceutical executive. said computers would load clinical trial data onto multiple tractor trailers sent FDA approval. I‚Äôm sure FDA sifting data, method, information they‚Äôve received making decision approve not. one saying COVID isn‚Äôt bad one rush anymore already has. 


I‚Äôm sure production vaccine establishment supply chain already underway approval process adequately going majorly delay rollout. boss it, gave almost everyone branch shutdown. Yea, corporations also got permanent reduction tax rate, think too. It‚Äôs balance. #GeneralStrike

Enough. North Central Ohio here, took 6 half hours line 125$ pocket get tested last weekend. cant afford get tested every week, lose 2 weeks work quarantining every time we're exposed fuckwit refuses wear mask.   ‚ÄúCops good violate Fourth Amendment people don‚Äôt like agree with.‚Äù everyone follows rules, not. explains it, criticized system account give someone lots money they're athlete. Yay rolled genetic dice well fuck care much?

People certainly used argument justify it.

Humanity understand actual value world suffer. wait athletes wealthy people getting access vaccinations healthcare workers. That's next. start. Watch vaccine allotment screwed firmly toward connected wealthy domestically horrific degree internationally. don‚Äôt get say point comment lmao cmon now. 

This article tries imply tests given athletes instead nurses.

That case, said. One employer providing another providing 0 availability happening throughout Europe, especially UK No, spoke themselves.  odd, whatever...the outcome AZN even testing, arguably good everyone involved. criticisms sound, another trial ""accidentally"" give 2300 people wrong dose sounds like good idea. biggest issue get vax.. come work let people opt breath gems me..

thats fair me. even 2 months 4 months road.. dont want unvax'd people near me. wait vote again? Fuck that's depressing. guess varies hospital. Mine university hospital, lots public-funded patients, lot services run red money made elsewhere. Shutting day surgery 2 months put us deep hole. far I‚Äôve heard non-clinical layoffs, research definitely suffered Sport luxury. Give essential jobs test first. Well, guess I'm done two athletes sports replaceable, wouldn‚Äôt millions fans ad companies pouring millions dollars them...let‚Äôs real remember 

The government allows shit happens year round. don‚Äôt know much handling Afghanistan Syria. do?

And lol declarations pays things. Mexico pays wall like China pays tariffs. weeks meeting?! What?? Oh yeah, here. I'm terrified. Truly. Yeah cost living Aus takes twice many kangaroo bucks. you? work day day out. You‚Äôll need keep working part job description. lot literally work health emergencies. Get together. culture, said theatres, music, fantasy books, comedy shows etc. real ""use"" culture people enjoy laws paid time off? point telling people flatten curve never going happen? People like blame rising cases non-compliance ‚ÄúQualified health officials‚Äù constantly tell us inconsistent information, ones fault. wife exception norm, lucky found place that‚Äôll her. liability repercussions bosses choose endanger employees without reason

I surprised lawsuits, workers never able afford even try sue boss (or ones killed loved ones). people afford justice ones least likely forced dangerous conditions. hard avoid liability.

Those types situations develop externally, alawys something control. Congrats, would person reported government neighbor Jews living attic too. Leave people fuck alone. They‚Äôre criminal prohibitively expensive makes available people. Athletes access free rapid testing do. isn‚Äôt problem capitalism, problem shitty people know start testing employees bunch test positive work don‚Äôt want that. prefer profit safety liability men women don't?

The image impropriety comes interacting female students. may true strictest mechanical sense rules same, simply far easier male teacher ousted due accusation woman.

You're basically mercy female student like you, mind ruin life something. Rarity. Many orgs testing. You‚Äôre left get tested yourself. Even ‚Äúliberal‚Äù California. People suffering due staffing problems. fear answer ask question people US paying sports testing...the companies footing bill. meaningless sentiment. Everyone know kept things small intimate. parents went aunt's house dinner 7 people. girlfriend stayed spent day together. coworkers kept intimate among family members.

The idea people flying cross country - country way among worst world Covid-19 - insanity me. point US needs nuking mention fact people (in experience) dont clean bowls thoroughly often enough. year ago hit friends giant bong, could immediately tell going get sick it. clean pieces every days. saves bud, gets higher, mainly isnt disgusting. Ill never understand dirty bowls. actually sarcasm. didnt get mentioned, sorry hear it. flows second bullet point. taking precautions obviously better precautions, problem public health perspective millions people using justification getting together face-to-face households. specific problems ""we're gonna take lot precautions though!"" argument:

* Definition adherence self-isolation beforehand: *everyone* planning get together applied strict, literalist 14-day interpretation self-isolation, it'd probably fine. protection afforded approach strong weakest link. eight people planning get together, takes one apply liberal interpretation term ""self-isolating"" endanger rest. I've seen first-hand people say they're ""isolating"", still going groceries pick-ups. also problem people substituting subjective ""good enough"" criteria precautions vs. actual fact-based public health advice. Example: post, say isolating 8 days. incubation range COVID 14 days, 8. here's perfect example someone making criteria constitutes ""meh, took precautions"" line reality take 14 days exposure show symptoms.
* Testing - I'm going ignore whole ""wasting resources peace mind testing"" focus efficacy. bad measure, also hardly airtight... tests provide snapshot precise moment time, subject false positives incubation phase. Treating carte blanche socialize dangerous. many doing.

The issue comes getting together, everyone applies ""no single raindrop believes responsible flood"" fallacy gatherings. tens millions people applying exact justification, vast number *actually* taking necessary precautions reduce spread risk reasonable level, we're going end public health disaster early January. de facto quote everyone thinks intelligent really are. Almost 74 million people proved recognize hypocrisy clue they've scammed. always weak. think grandmas choosing nice butterball turkey available? No. chose *couldn't* choose otherwise. thanksgiving feast waiting caved said ""okaaay want turkey now!"".

In pandemic expecting nothing strength stop people. Especially pathetic governmental response. There's high risk patients could safe assume would need antibodies early matter much here's Thanksgiving gathering reason

I got together dad two weeks self quarantine &amp; negative test two days before.

My mom died April year want alone.

I brought laptop &amp; cooked food, sat ate &amp; zoom called relatives feel alone.

He still broke end night. still misses mom. miss too. We've mourning isolation.

I'm going let spend Christmas alone either. I'll whatever takes get sick. He's going alone. Sorry, clarified type birth control meant. women know estrogen based pills, bad generalization part. think jury's still methods increase risk, yes, likely much estrogen-basrd. difference States unified response, guidelines protocols virus, shitshow.

What nurses saying vaccine going available soon them? Still wanting full virus instead vaccination? Whaaaaat. make wear masks remind pull periodically. I've also put maintenance long dare, DAMN miss teeth cleaned! Black Friday Lives Matter ! I‚Äôm watching Hard Knocks could tell amount resources NFL teams had, PPE, cleaning products, tests, tracking technology.. love football, could‚Äôve done without season year Thats great, kudos guys responsible go humans minks cats cats get humans. thing jumps species like crazy. Someone made really intriguing point it‚Äôs people don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs current generation 18-45 year olds lived prosperous, peaceful, comfortable time human history. 

Hence, can‚Äôt fathom type global catastrophe respond accordingly. doesn‚Äôt become real people someone immediate circle dies. highly intelligent still ignore COVID precautions. moron still follow them. There's correlation. much normalcy itself, meant ""normally safe"", go public space worried catch spread. I'm looking excuse throw caution wind risk someone's life. I'm fully willing able comply restrictions, isolation definitely taken toll me, mentally. I'll definitely one still wear mask I've vaccinated, extra precaution.


I appreciate kind words concern, thank you. Yep. said front expecting unified large Phase III full age representation vulnerable groups overrepresented.

That‚Äôs truth right there, I‚Äôd say even sub Reddit, we‚Äôre superspreaders still gathered together. think may little premature here. definitely one watch. P3 RCT results set come next month so. Europeans impose complete travel ban?

Why mortified us, numbers control well? team performance

Thats part one cares about. one even talking new years parties. Huge number tests completed that's good. haven‚Äôt gotten cold sick entire year since wearing mask everywhere since April. Knock wood.....

*Fist bump* Okok guys going long one. course are.

Even among people cautious, MANY educated people talk simplify thing 100% chances: someone household gets it, work close contact, consider inevitable. gotten xyz, must risk thought was. vaccine either works doesn't, masks either work don't, transmission somehow 100%.

It's maddening. know got college (they did!). shades grey. stuff comes percentages 0 100. Hell, people play DND regular. understand % risks! self isolate 14 days go drive them?

Given case numbers think he'll feel data support necessary start increasing restrictions. Well, hope otherwise may end digging deeper hole necessary. Meanwhile I‚Äôm one house didn‚Äôt take 2 hour trip stepdads parents house thanksgiving. haven‚Äôt left house since did, I‚Äôll avoiding next weeks (I usually anyway though, I‚Äôm usually night shift sleep schedule even though quit July) dissuade generation nursing healthcare. like Europe watched America disbelief summer getting hit extremely hard virus? obesity heart disease contagious? One friends uncle likely last soldier killed WW2

At least yugoslavia 

The surrender getting negotiated go effect midnight found shot standing guard night Well nation hasn't. Honestly scientists, academics, leaders, doctors popular. kind American thing make people famous famous. 9.5% American COVID-19 deaths Tuesday came Missouri (189 1,989 deaths per CDC). Please help change that. They're breeding faster anyone else there! hope next generation grow tell parents fuck off. Happy hear proud country. Nothing wrong that. different approaches dealing virus useful future pandemics. Yeah that‚Äôs I‚Äôm choosing look it. heartbreaking everything either/or days room reasonable discussion, even people love. guess can‚Äôt reason someone point view didn‚Äôt reason into. One thousands reasons universal healthcare answer healthcare.

It's unfortunate people suffer die prove we've already known. coping mechanism people make fun America. !RemindMe 15 days blow last April Thank you. That's everyone doing: stay safe demand others follow lead. love redditors. It‚Äôs like family. Yeah. possibly pull inaccuracy? Seems can't tell real argument garbage talk. bad. also laughing Americans... Might hard... Nurse paramedic here:
I worked pandemic exposed daily patients COVID (while PPE) never tested.
I denied test work close contact doctor tested positive. 
I worry every day bring virus back home wife kids. crazy even missteps US made, countries like Italy, Spain, UK seen deaths per capita!! curious Google trends would show [‚Äúcovid It‚Äôs definitely spiking!! ü•∂ Idk worse, Americans inability wait disaster, politicians actually something climate change Classic capitalism. 

First all, worth much, consumers highest paying ones win bid.

Also seen capital earn profit, test positive, can't work, hurts profits stability economy.

It makes every sense current system, people even ask? (No, think right) really really hope so. surprised Ford handled early on, seemed throw caution wind. 
(I know makes decisions).
There's murmurings schools/universities closed half January, hope non essential businesses close least limited capacity. world watches dread disbelief

Oh no, I'm weird mix facepalming laughing Americans. dread *or* disbelief. I'm beyond that.

Same school shootings. I'd say ""American school schootings"", ""American"" already implied.

**I'm beyond shocked America.** I've starting move ignoring idiots now. Much better mental health. assure firsthand knowledge absolutely need things lol tortured son death *so sinners could get away sins still go heaven,* less. It‚Äôs part checks balances great nation.

Truthfully assumption kinds medical workers tested frequently Best (meaning: widest) experiment ever! 

Let's watch numbers next 10 days. people become weak one Thanksgiving done video call much sacrifice make?

The counter argument is: people become weak threat virus mortality 0.1% (under age 60) makes put lives hold 1.5 years? meant severe disease think knew that. zero hospitalisations Oxford/AZ trial. None vaccines completely block infection. I'm respiratory therapist, work non-profit hospital organization. facility test us, even exposure. friend nurse private nursing home, tested twice week (rapid tests). manager said cannot afford test staff; did, probably least half would positive, quarantine. can't afford here. crazy. talking workforce.

Educate please virus isn‚Äôt it‚Äôs really early say didn‚Äôt work. 5K day? 50k/day worldwide? headlines of, 'more young people dying disease'. excuse. one would say, okay old people die since live lives. one would comment sick people would die year anyway even without covid. Where‚Äôs evidence ‚Äúmost‚Äù people gather Christmas bashed people gathering Diwali? Seems like you‚Äôre making narrative believe want believe Dang. big guy watching someone gathering (or else awesome luck).The car breaking actually good thing. dad ok? Ask rose garden massacre attendees whole thing utterly perplexed.

Why trouble convincing people accept basic geomotry object permanence?!

If put barrier A-C, follows traversing B least difficult. simple geomotry.

If take place mile C, traversing B going take longer difficult 1"" away......

Remove virus equation people arguing fundamental properties reality.

You argue effectiveness... seem angle they've chosen. Maybe use time find quarterback one's pro-lockdown anti-science douchebags going force can't bothered decent fellow human beings. trips visit earlier month, cancel course Taiwan toward top list sure true.  Everyone howling health care workers flyover It‚Äôs almost sociopathic insist looking percentages instead number deaths. disease 99.99% survival rate, .01% meant three million people died....who gives fuck low percentage is?

But seriously give politicians ideas! I've enough reading Fauci every day. 

Here, I'll come next days posts:

""Fauci says something must done coronavirus"" 


""Fauci says he's worries antivaxxers"" I'm boat. live small island beginning numbers low, like single digit, city council allowed short term rentals open summer started northeners came escape lockdowns. numbers skyrocketed stayed comparatively high since Holy cow Oooof. dumb must suck lol.

I'm thinking might like I'm normally depressed person I'm rough time dealing it. hard. 

And I'm like yourself, safe I'll wearing mask outside long time, even vaccines getting distributed among populace.

Also, try help way can, I'm thankful mind! seems like kind words wishes support help short supply days, thanks letting try can. Again, quite online instead person, can't get together help online, do?

Same Italy EU countries temporarily closed intra-regional borders. think I'd sustainable keep, say, Melbourne isolated rest country?

Also, Australia's internal geography favourable contain spread, populated areas highly separated other, outbreak occurs one city easy focus effort certainly strict lockdown, ever intended eradicate it

Of course never intended to. That's something countries Australia afford hope for. one Europe ever deluded think would sustainable strategy them. hoped new outbreaks could contained massive testing case Korea - proven completely wrong that's another story.

Italy's intent, countries' intent, avoid millions deaths complete collapse health care system. afford plan. we‚Äôre fucked. even expose all? air filters car better open windows house! 

And roads drive don‚Äôt people thousands yards. ""The world"" lmfao Thank you! smaller gathering family. happy see them.  That‚Äôs first six months, next 5-6 months death toll less average expected... averaging less last year! 

Yea, actually clicked misleading link title read details.

I totally use example. can‚Äôt suppress doesn‚Äôt fit narrative. Monkey fight! üí©üêí roommate Rad Tech, Covid. They‚Äôre telling even get tested. guess don‚Äôt want find out. Same. MI well stocked ventilators, since early ventilation standard care anymore, run out. ventilator see tv. requires nurse therapist trained run it, even trained one style brand mean automatically know use all. extremely critical patients require manual overrides vent changes medication literally minute. One one care critical many areas anymore. access better, higher priority healthcare do. we‚Äôre paying it. went Winchester waited blow look happened. important lesson yet understand let alone care about. Stunned everyday America headed we're stupid realize it. Sorry, totally mean try hard!

Let try take away stats words make sure people understand :) 

The basic idea less people infect, less people get infected! 10% infection, 10% less people infect, would expect rates would 10% lower virus entering 'fresh' population. That's easiest thing probably everyone agree on.

In reality, know every positive case gets diagnosed (people looked best guesses around 1 2 undiagnosed cases every diagnosed case), probably 20-30% population it. means cases probably 20-30% less would expect virus entering 'fresh' population.

The factor people get infected (because already infected previously) can't give someone else, adds another layer lessening rate infection. Thus, 20-30% reduction rates ND probably conservation. actually epidemiology math, probably like 40-60% reduction rate spread virus combination people already infected giving others. less jargon-y helpful? also drive Around 2000 miles week I‚Äôm freaking it‚Äôs like planned move six months ago things getting better things gotten way worse move refuse feel bad I‚Äôm gonna live street don‚Äôt drive across country everybody‚Äôs upset really wish instead angry upset taught stuff better

your post gave lot peace mind I‚Äôm going think try touch doorhandles stuff. need mean take granted..

They well compensated plentiful. Can't speak US Ontario nurses make 6 figures, HS teachers start 90k major metros. 

And 450,000 educated immigrants year largest educated workforce (63% bachelors) world one goes 10 apply Unofficial US motto: price freedom misery death.

Usually ""your"" foreign countries, time Americans, including families cases. find hard believe. without doubt option get tested... maybe youll stand line want get tested can. 

Sounds like dont want get tested youve avoiding long. used check laugh. go watch minutes prepare stupidity coming way. feel like crying late. people lost. Boring! I'd say money usually motivational force... ""good"" people motivated job serving community instead pay?

An example would teaching, pay trash teachers know (anecdotal) pretty good people.

The populace politically adept sure, Trump office. shortened Bakersfield Merced Central Valley, hope eventually expand back original LA SF path. sure many people actually benefit least reaches San Francisco. can‚Äôt see commuter train currently. America care Americans. roommate Rad Tech, Covid. They‚Äôre telling even get tested. guess don‚Äôt want find out. none misogynistic going removed? sub full neckbeards. fighting weird crusade than, almost one subreddit pretending America handled COVID well.

Instead attacking everything American making derogatory comments like ""do learn math science read political tweets"", highlights ignorance. Downvoting moving . symptoms? Actually, people get this, end ICU 100% supplemental O2 without breaking 70% blood O2 (i.e. dead within day) still react disbelief asked would sign DNR, covid fake. So, Greg Cochran put it, accept ""until velvet hits face."" envisioned functioning educated electorate.

You're claiming founding fathers developed system depended educated electorate entrusted right vote people country time functioning public education system relied mostly parents churches educate Go back unemployed polisci major philosopher, care fancy yourself

Upper management F500 company, guess claim totalitarianism curb elements speech reckless point speech protected grounds much damage clearly doing.

The devil details variability nuance speech can't effectively curtailed governments without dismantling right free speech altogether. People state things factually incorrect, debate, conjecture, make innuendo, theorize propose ideas engine progress free society. Let's forget scientists told us masks effective research demonstrated otherwise.

Your utilitarian attitude rights freedoms people scary. justify suppressing right free speech pandemic, justify suppressing time want. can't close Pandora's box opened. bread butter totalitarian states make flimsy arguments excuses suppress opposition examples eliminating right share thoughts ideas deem ""dangerous"" littered throughout history books. case eventually become less dangerous. wait wait wait, care people me? always knew australians different ‚Äúgreat healthcare‚Äù people government access even remotely close you‚Äôre lying think are.

We wanted thanksgiving, cancelled last week isn‚Äôt safe. met park took walk wearing masks, 6 feet apart. gave family pie baked everyone ate homes.

Absolutely blaming people getting home We‚Äôre already point area positive tested nurses still report work. test moot point. makes hard know percent population infected tests can't relied on

As practicing mathematician, assure you, ways get numbers. Eventually, know exactly many people affected. nearly 100,000 people currently hospitalized Covid-19. big deal?? get fucked!!! It‚Äôs fact. look metrics get better idea can‚Äôt ignore it. go keep spreading it? grocery store workers too? thought typing oxymoron....  Hmm. Okay, let‚Äôs talk then! 

What calling someone disregards downplays flu symptoms, clotting, made think needed called out? AMERICA!  FUUUUCK YAAA! Hey sounds exactly like job  long protocol partner ICU nurse covid change masks leaving room infected pt.

Now keep mask going room room room 12 hours Yeah, bullshit part funded Proposition expectation would run LA SF.

Everybody clap hands one minute. wife nurse prolonged exposure someone tested positive. really symptoms hospital still told come in. called supervisors different managers told come in. get written up.. 6 hours 12 someone different found sent home. 1 5 similar got sent home day. Yeah, seems like messaging really weird. love people think arguments epitome logic reason say things like ‚Äúshow parents another 7mo old baby similar ethnicity won‚Äôt know difference.‚Äù lack humanity empathy argument like galling.

I hope parents make testing/quarantine requirements able spend amazing months getting know grandchild‚Äîand course spending time too.

We survivors, figure :) travel nursing won‚Äôt get tested reason. would loose much money could lose contracts.

good know he's taking hippocratic oath seriously :/ Personally, voted it, I‚Äôm disappointed outcome. I‚Äôve number countries either go high speed train vs plane. prefer train.

Beyond lack security checks, bag X-rays, whatever version TSA is. also advantage able show 5 minutes train leaves still get it. Also find least countries, planes drop outside town, trains usually either take city centers and/or place transfer local train lines, usually both. It‚Äôs also generally easier get ticket train change train going take, compared airlines.

Compared budget airlines though, countries, plane usually cheaper 2x flight time faster (but usually 1.5x slower factor airport security). Compared non-budget airlines though, trains half cost. US population 72% smaller 1918 Stayed home getting work corn dogs thanksgiving dinner. Found brother, wife, baby went parents thanksgiving, although mom worries covid, polite tell leave. I'm totally pissed that! No, I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm idiot homeschool child year it‚Äôs really hard big deal. state requirements home schooling frighteningly low. Also I‚Äôm keeping kid basement whatever brain spinning thin air, there‚Äôs reason justify wanting offspring get virus you.

And frankly it‚Äôs real weird wrote convince internet stranger infect child. Maybe I‚Äôm one needs convincing here. Bonkers. course fair provide own? Plus able pay left behind. they'd lost less walkouts sadly sickness death too. 

It's disgusting healthcare workers left fend many places Lol, ok, contradicts exponential growth infections work sure 1,000 American billionaires hold wealth 160 million Americans guy says there‚Äôs money hope everything goes ok . Congratulations baby well Exactly! heard Federal funding going run covid testing people start charged around $115.00 (approx). Somehow millionaire athletes get tested constant basis ie weekly game. baseball basketball football. Yet players still come virus cannot follow simple rules precautions. teams paying along. would allow federally covered tests used general public. know millions tests talking tests could better used sports figures. believe that‚Äôs exactly parent comment conveying. fight wear mask??? Half time think *you're* 'undereducated' one. cannot count number times I've seen COVID denier demanding someone else ""*Do research!!*"" That's every student university, even household positive personally tested negative. However, considered La Quinta really nice hotel room Isn‚Äôt point statement something true covid flu? 

This incorrect statement. could statement downplaying flu? 

That entire point statement make something dangerous covid flu. soon restrictions lifted go back up. like *science* something... lol quote April? Considering said shit like ""This fucking lie"" assumed talking statements actually relevant. pretty clearly stated fact. promising vaccines arrived quicker thought, virus behaved differently many predicted. make false prediction lie. Bizarre. I‚Äôm ‚Äúessential worker‚Äù major university get many COVID tests want, whenever want. 

Kinda thought would healthcare workers. think you‚Äôve read something throwawayunknown55‚Äôs comment implied. point getting tested unless symptoms. also putting risk infected people tested testing procedure. Although probably minimal risk. exposed virus positive person, probably take 72 hrs symptoms. However exact time long takes. heard people taking full day get tested others can't get tested places require referral others walk in. Total chaos. much unknown. many times "" experts"" changed story HAHAHA Coming someone left home without mask 8 months I'm pretty sure wrong  Meanwhile local sport teams testing players staff every day. 

What sports teams tested April/May? No, don‚Äôt. media watches disbelief people woken insanity. Eyeballing it, rate infection roughly +0.5% day current rates. It‚Äôll probably change time, hopefully slowing down. rate increasing two weeks ago they‚Äôd reach 70% two months. poor die, left watch games? really 21 day quarantine. expected self quarantine additional week. new arrivals going 2 weeks ignoring CDC warning self quarantine another week assholes. hope sense keep parents hotel additional week. pretty cool willing, mine willing give 3 weeks see me. Also parents dumb people like parties I'm sort glad want come. mean ‚Äúthe nurses fine‚Äù? It‚Äôs magically delicious .... QFT usually people money actually quarantine. usually office jobs work home. frontline workers stores, hospitals restaurants ones cannot quarantine. ""quarantining mooches"" exactly?

They still complaining social media accounts saying 'wont forget' did. NYC also probably got hit v hard early people cars, rely public transit. Considering subways jammed touching five people rush hour enclosed subway car surprising fast able spread there. Canadians care. biggest trading partner, border ""closed"", open essential travel including Americans ""driving alaska"" somehow takes multiple weeks roundabout indirect route includes tourist destinations.

We look Americans (and dumb Canadians) disbelief longer takes get control longer going take lift restrictions and/or open border. There's rumors veterinarians called help areas am. Though TBH I'd comfortable getting stitches IV meds vet psychiatrist. means nurses infecting patients already sick don‚Äôt covid. Shows little care hospitals staff patients Doesn‚Äôt seem like lot. must giant. Hmm could ride end rental see happens happy employees could force back probably lose small portion second another option becomes available..

I guess I'll take option two pay train someone new lose money productivity. Yep, athletes bring money. ended UK via Switzerland Canada. Wtf that?? CMS/OSHA violation. They're exposing entire hospital staff patients. People think apply they're positive family is. sad. OK... clever. Hard ICU. *MUST GETTING WEAKER, OPEN BACK UP!* America worse. even get second stimulus check. Possibly one best, though take fastest route, mostly miss sea.

I5 doesn‚Äôt look like anything. can't hair went salon. need appointment - one person time allowed place stylist wears mask. Seems lot safer many open businesses.
I likely wait vaccine go since local area experiencing large number new cases. Well, considering still hundred thousands range, people said ‚Äúnah‚Äù meeting maskless country celebrate holiday eating close proximity required...

I‚Äôm gonna say ‚Äúno.‚Äù opinion, absolutely fine visit family IF:

- drive visit them, rather taking public transport
- people involved (the people travelling people visited) self-isolated home (not leaving house reason, even food shopping) minimum 10 days beforehand, shown symptoms time.

This October travel 200 miles family member's funeral, stayed grandparents house. husband, grandparents self isolated 2 weeks drove down, could sure nobody virus. could safely act 1 household duration stay, distance/wear masks around anyone household. 

However going need 100% CERTAIN trust family (and yourself) self isolate beforehand cheat all. don‚Äôt see one made comment downplaying disregarding flu symptoms. foolish folks compare covid favorably ‚Äújust flu‚Äù that. flu serious medical problem. Covid even worse. [Vox: US many Filipino Actual covid science: evidence supporting connection inoculation ‚Äúsize‚Äù severity. fact, evidence points connection completely made r/coronavirus talking point. Leaders lead, good leaders lead example. Also true, mexico leader People common sense travel year, partly blame CDC slow reaction tell everyone travel. know blame passed way top failed leadership, CDC telling people since least Halloween travel holidays. no, instead waited *the week Thanksgiving* say travel. waited everyone already bought tickets, made plans, say anything it.

I mean let's say American public *did* pay attention CDC say.... think Airline Companies going refund everyone year had?? Hell no! another example ""Too little, late"" seems theme year... *Cough* Stimulus Money?! *Cough* whatever worth canceled trip back home. bummed since live far away get see people around time year justify it. Felt like path hurricane refusing evacuate. Oh definitely, she‚Äôs going local urgent care get tested today. honest question. experts, I'd love know two mRNA vaccines work. know there's ton pressure make sure everyone gets vaccine (with good reason), I'm anti-vaxer way. Yeah kinda. money making possible matter much somebody wants something. We're taking completely unrelated decision makers choosing sports nurses. separate entities would act differently money reversed. makes sense! nurses removed patient care. ha no, that's sounds like hound mix decides sass Seriously? CT scan ultrasound??? I'd agree, almost, fact grandpa one urged Soviet Union support invaded S. Korea, led one brutal wars modern history killed 3.5 mil people sides including civilians. That‚Äôs lack. comment made (take grain salt, surprise me) post days ago hospitals Colorado asking hospitals St. Louis area room take patients... course someone needs evicted certainly uphold law ""....sorry, job"". Possibly - considering many would travel car visit close relatives. Despite living street; mother, godmother sisters staying homes year. greet back yards. Obviously basketball player. get paid 3 year contract entire Walmart‚Äôs worth employees would earn lifetimes.

/s obviously, need change perspectives society. Science: like magic real! I'm interested see data pans half dose / full dose jab works out. get 90% real winner. Cheap, easy transport already full production

¬£3 ¬£50 seems lot different. Stonking good news Anti-mask nurses exist. I'm utterly dumbfounded. may opposite sides discussion time believe expect posts buried ""daily discussion"" thread, rest sub full US-centric posts thanksgiving...

Seriously - one extremely well researched balanced post per day somehow overwhelming sub? 

This insane. entire effort 70+ age group immune compromised. that‚Äôs longer factor, needs end. 

The shutting entire society kids .003%(IFR) (you verify number CDC link 2 comments up) simply sustainable. There‚Äôs always going people category. People die.

You‚Äôre actually harming 8 year olds development far keeping isolated, kids don‚Äôt learn well develop online schooling. feel

Literally hundreds hundreds covid chambers flying one time get article. 

Here LA sign within 24 hours get free test, get results back within 24 hours (they're drive-through testing centers). So, yes, unfortunate employers testing, anyone LA get testing, without symptoms. wife children tested several times (their school required like Eric **CRAPTON**, right?! üòù

::cries guitar::  Thank detailed personal explanation makes lot sense. aunt sounds like relative hell hope mother affected much.

I've thinking scary many people harboring craziness them, certain environment established triggers, welcomes, fosters hidden thoughts, come deep end wreck havoc society. generate billions dollars 0.1%? Fuck then. mean, that's valid. folks paramedics, used part local volunteer EMS department variance driver taking Basic EMT class. operate pandemic but, y'know, I've heard stories stuff.

yeah, agree well. stay home. text call FaceTime/Zoom/fucking Discord? loved ones often. help set up, teach use software, stay home unless work physical location need shop groceries. go socially-distanced walk (if that's thing?), pick new hobby, **where fucking mask holy shit rocket science medical science works**.

my brothers supposed coming Christmas. believe they've worked home pandemic really got started, worked privately personal at-work offices rest staff stayed home.

I dunno, hope sink much result bullshit lol. also means employer could easily pay many stories last weeks players testing positive called ""bubbles""? They've canceled postponed games Pros College literally can't control shit bubble. really cared safety health athletes staff would cancel season hey like said ""nothing stops money train "" virus become endemic, infectious least 50% spread due asymptomatic people, long large reservoirs unvaccinated people developing world (or US!) keep coming back requiring yearly re-vaccination campaigns likely localized lockdowns. Reading posts unbelievable. wife RN Canada gets tested potential exposure. probably tested 12 times since March. I‚Äôm sorry stress y‚Äôall must feeling. end world tho. 2009 swine flu virus bubonic plague still lot tamer less lethal much lower, manageable/treatable levels due medicines. Even corona, annual seasonal influenza, still around (hence flu vaccines need modified annually).

It's possible several countries regionally eliminate corona (like Australia New Zealand, maybe even Taiwan). Remind me! 18 days teachers. cone contact 100s people day FL forced schools open person. Covid known cause heart attacks. rule caught it?  Times Square NYC? never crowded together people standing room concerts.

If tried circles 5 ft apart, household 5 10 percent capacity. Survival richest first mRNA vaccines EVER approved. Like new medical technology, ride going bumpy yet see impact scale. 43,000 participants Pfizer sounds like lot, half got vaccine. 21,500 data points still lot, US alone hundreds millions vaccinate. 21,500 can‚Äôt reliably extrapolated billions people needing vaccine. expect things mostly good, I‚Äôm worrier nature. current concern develop immune response / allergy protein. vaccinated people‚Äôs cells continuously pumping protein like... forever now... happens system becomes sensitized begins attack protein? it‚Äôs expressed every cell body... happens then? wonder, anything Australia going summer season? US Europe looked fine summer months too. drive past mall every day pick daughter daycare. parking lot packed week. It‚Äôs complete insanity...

Stay home stay safe right now, people! Decades union busting... definitely making mandatory staff. I'll send get clock too. China provide 500 doses keep North Korea happy. Kim get 30 doses. Profitable Well...shit, ain't right. Somehow Costco nearly perfect compliance. done.  get sick become superspreader location? Isn‚Äôt worse? wanted high school science teacher went nursing instead. suck different reasons least nursing earning potential makes suck. Depending location (like I'm example) nursing pay also sucks willing job hop move around, single person, really well yourself. Baseless assertion. Well government job subsidise live without 14 days thems fuckers pay us gotta loose rent food new shoes coat winter need stable stress debts needs. Right? best part entirely backwards. keeps people home track productivity time. finds productive working home guess what? Cancel lease cut costs business! sucker employees pay desks, chairs, office space, electricity, internet, water, maintenance, etc. transferred huge load costs onto employees, thank it! Dude we've legit crazy comments threads past couple days. Really makes scared people living. Cause intern deadline finish picked number. boss asked math checks out, never replied. Boss read. Still posted. #NoRegrets Especially since positive test required cases miss work, lack tests incentiveize people going sick. I'm day 8 sickness, day 5 waiting test results HR breathing neck everyday dont know do. We‚Äôve already baked doubling anyone vaccinated. means anything, sore throat weeks. Turns allergies whole time (my ex mention taking claritin every day last year mentioning much better feeling lol know put 2+2 together).

I've also given panic attack thinking bad allergies covid symptoms. Never one before, read article saying thinking much cause panic attacks. yet we‚Äôll still powerful richer you? Enjoy continued irrelevance world Australia fine covid. getting tired told facetime zoom blah blah fucking option us There's going shortage doctors, nurses, medical technicians this.

My mom ultrasound technician least half friends medical field 60 decided retire early look jobs even though planning work 5 10 years COVID. dare rich person risk health prove vaccine safe! Oh, come on, guys. fantastic musicians, really? patient. another year so, bad memory - hopefully. America also country battling covid right now, many European countries experiencing huge surges case numbers. Well said Dr. Hello fellow Kiwi! Oh, home instead stuck here...

I miss science logic, learn country's education, appreciate NZ one. know pisses off? Film workers get tested often production afford (almost every 3 days) called essential workers. saving lives, PPE tests put right hands. people selfish arseholes know lucky even trained nurse tending hospital bed hyperbolic damages cause. going double deaths. vast majority vulnerable population vaccinated within 3 months. turn back can

Hey, long get persecution complex cares Fauci actually said means, right? least get Libs, whatever means. Participation trophies around! comes healthcare period, it‚Äôs nation haves nots. nation gigantic scam, anyone pride fucking moron. Fuck US insurance companies fuck politicians enable them. country fucking farce. ICU falls category. Lotta coworkers taking things seriously work getting sick. work appropriate PPE things taken seriously. saying anyone gets work I‚Äôd say majority getting outside work coworkers rather patients. also free coved testing questions asked weather symptoms. symptoms even don‚Äôt test positive don‚Äôt want working. Overall I‚Äôve impressed hospitals response, perfect nothing is. 62% effective per study Lancet. 70% combined half doses. 
Half doses alone 90% effective relatively small size sample healthy patients Texans deal testing football teams, *and* Joe Rogan's podcast thought read Astra Zenecas vaccine 70% effective? You‚Äôre right can‚Äôt stop leaving. stop returning. Public health hospital incentives aligned all.

I guess people okay that. Okay, psych nurse agree you. I'm constantly helping kind day day I'm work helpful kind me. Like I'm afraid socialize possible spreading due work, I'm still lonely. hard I'm looking answer. taking account emotional burnout either Paid sick leave *and* publicly funded health care. US Numbers low days thanksgiving. testing reporting come again. probably don‚Äôt get paid enough. One occupations gets contract career hundreds thousands millions dollars annually.

&amp;#x200B;

It really comes thing again: rich die poor die. What? would perception anything wrong this? let borrow car cleaned after, everyone that. Agreed. 2009 swine flu virus bubonic plague still lot tamer less lethal much lower, manageable/treatable levels due medicines. Even corona, annual seasonal influenza, still around. combined results came averaging two trials. One half/full dose trial (which turned accident) full/full dose trial. former came 62% efficacy latter 90% (although questions now). So, would either get one other, average two. Good luck. 

Just know symptoms CDC says get emergency warning signs* COVID-19. someone showing signs, seek emergency medical care pain pressure wake stay lips face

*This list possible symptoms. Please call medical provider symptoms severe concerning 911 call ahead local emergency facility: Notify operator seeking care someone may COVID-19.[CDC guess voted someone Biden primaries. Damn.  coworker came warning exposed told work anyway. Test came back positive next day urgent care. around night go get test want tested.
I work large hospital. It‚Äôs sad. title sounds like Onion headline. Chimp? vaccine derived Chimp adenovirus. Thanks chimps. Cuz fat high risk

But credit apologize publicly failing nation something months ago part article stands ‚ÄúWe free harm people vulnerable.‚Äù people harmed pandemic be, degree, unavoidable, plead people careful around holidays. I‚Äôm elementary school teacher, wish badly things could go back normal, virtual teaching isn‚Äôt working, continue travel large family gatherings, even kids returning school educational experiences desperately need. I'm moving goal posts quarantine perfect unless absolutely sat inside outside contact two weeks. Even OP answered ""basically"" feel like 100% isolation everyone involved, else would said ""exactly."" problem one individual, millions people view way. View cautious cannot happened them. thing never going get control everyone believes exception rule. think part point hopelessness. instance two roommates work. one roommate works hospital, roommate works construction, get work remotely. friend works construction can‚Äôt easily wear mask. Florida mask gets soaked sweat covered saw dust. can‚Äôt really avoid time don‚Äôt anywhere else go (no family). interact. next door neighbor works bunch people too. occasionally hang point it‚Äôs longer matter WHEN. know thinking ‚Äúoh problem every one stopped go away‚Äù true. unless two roommates stay home won‚Äôt work. Even could would give one roommate hotel self isolate since works hospital. 


There‚Äôs literally many people infected think lost chance get control. would highly recommend get tested covid again. I‚Äôve looking PSVR, looks like really great setup too. 7000/week could easily get test done concerns. Time get new job. hurts, boss clearly isn‚Äôt smart enough value existence, probably isn‚Äôt smart enough lead company anywhere decent either doesn‚Äôt believe science logic.

My condolences. covid19 China's fault? came China. Im pointing specific chinese person, virus came covered severity way long, would require effective government organize, that.  No. Russia using human adenovirus population already exposed to. 
Oxford using chimpanzee adenovirus population exposed to. 
Whats point using adenovirus body already recognizes it. lol sorry loss &amp; say lightly. well enjoy platters &amp; beer!!! healthcare workers short supply. organization half employees working home, save front line workers. organization employees less 150 people, departments see daily due services; one person COVID, could wipe entire frontline staff. never required testing, I'm honestly surprised. afford lose 3+ departments see consumers face face. America entertainment important morals. America work place tests - take one reason they‚Äôre situation right European traveling. ED RN NYC here. hospital didn‚Äôt test employees back March/April due supply concerns. May offered testing employee health, get tested rather easily multiple testing sites ED. still testing staff regularly, testing available take upon yourself. Symptom monitoring done every shift temperature checkpoints setup. Although alone mean nothing. 

It discouraging athletes tested high rate working high risk environments, hospitals know without workforce regularly tested. Ignorance bliss. bothers get results almost instantly miss days work waiting find I‚Äôm even positive not. Whose pockets hurt worse missing work? Gonna say it‚Äôs NFL player manage money better. I‚Äôm teacher fifth year sadly described experience well. I‚Äôm constantly looking ways out. actively push kids towards career teaching, really leech soul I‚Äôm sure situation could improve, even teacher pay increased, wouldn‚Äôt fix core problems families gather large numbers, people lining outside stores immediatley cram it. Capitalism wins I'd rather run McDonald's make 100k. agree think one reasons Australia NZ got hold pandemic. theory closer relationships greater exposure Asian cultures therefore comfortable trying emulate success suppressing virus. top headline ""2/3 Americans support recount"" right bat know fake fuck. live San Diego heard like 3 people mention that, fat wannabe rednecks go desert drink beer shoot guns every weekend. we're conservative city would think would hear often case. would seem provide ppe also test pos covid expected still come work

I agree. What's got anything though? joined different conversation experiecne questionned got defensive. I'm saying decisions easy criticism nurse clearly putting income higher priority health patients (as stated SO). guy shut fuck already? every word mouth needs reported jfc... sounds really unhealthy. go outside.  Eric Clapton Death Metal now, what? get up, get out, catch virus, diiiiieeee ‚ô™‚ô´ Easy. National athletes contribute large scale betting gambling. need take care live stock! /s

Nurses make rich money. wrong. hitler similarities last year government asshole mayor's governors closed buisiness. pandemic over, every official enacted enforced lockdown face trial. End lockdown baby!!!!! whinge? seems like it. I‚Äôm nurse manager family practice clinic, covid testing. staff member much runny nose test send home wait 5-7 days results. breaking people‚Äôs banks hurting staffing. 

I always wonder sports getting results back quickly. assume they‚Äôre using unreliable method rapid testing. Unreliable, not, seems working them. already gone time got hospital. called us bus told us sick.  nurses don‚Äôt get tested unless they‚Äôre showing symptoms. thing wife nurse working covid patients. criticizing someone work. Food thing. Like said, participating shit show. provided testing given that. proper ppe, given either. lot others ""shoulds"" happening. test negative? husband's care coordinator (hubby cancer) commented off-handedly positive Covid antibodies. thing could identify possible infection diarrhea day.

He pointed also could bad burrito. illness chameleon. ~~parts of~~ America. Yeah figured case went back Wednesday. wearing full PPE dealing covid patients?  understand problem probably get cough checked out. wearing full PPE entire time? Damn mean everything wide open, figured we‚Äôd control /s Yup, wife doc charge hospital said exact thing. find can‚Äôt work. can‚Äôt handle people out. testing symptoms. 

Sadly isn‚Äôt really option. staffed. Luckily least proper PPE everyone wear whole time hospital. didn‚Äôt go got dx‚Äôd SEPSIS? Look folks! simple. Right single effective measure slowing spread COVID-19 wearing mask. protects others. protects yourself. So:

* Wear mask
* Maintain physical distance
* Wash hands regularly
* Avoid gathering folks already sheltering place with.

If things, spike drop hospitals (and vital doctors nurses) get overwhelmed.

If US things, spike continue exponential growth refrigerator trucks outside hospitals hold death (like El Paso TX right now), ration hospital care (like many Midwest states currently). Kaiser tests us weekly: thought standard. complete bullshit someone needs stand front line workers COVID face every damned day. sick corporate abuse workers. work grocery store, wife nurse. got sick. got test immediately. basically like pulling teeth give test, even though symptoms, breathing issues. compared individual experience one nurse. ...My mother law 

You true?

I work Canada less nurses per capita USA. 

Nurses get tested every week more. 
This really political. Conservite provinces, liberal provinces etc testing nurses similar rate. Lol wut No, I'm seeing Facebook, proudly took title. might live state.... wife home healthcare worker deals sorts people every day. Never word company covid test her, either protect clients. time US JOKE. hospitalized last year whole month nov- needed surgery, took dec recovery. whole time updating work, full time before. said worry focus health. sent letters confirming hospital time surgery , fired day agreed come back.  expecting hospitalization numbers area stop increasing, too, hospitals full. sure people look graph think improvement. Interesting. Sorry hear wish good health safety. 

Good luck Man, would great time unionize. can‚Äôt even imagine choosing hill die on. it‚Äôs fresh reminder racist rant back day. reason many died early tried unified response got treatment protocol wrong. Early ventilation killed saved. Oops. 

The US unified response like entirety Europe one. Europe didn‚Äôt. even close. 

Stop virtue signaling person grandma gone visited grandparents. 

Whenever see parents grandparents time I've gotten COVID test beforehand. 

It's responsibility safe high risk groups wear mask outside gatherings well.

I however stop living life. Nurses already short supply. I've heard $7000/week offers.

Uhhh what.

My along lot nurses laid here.

Do basis statement nurses short supply? least heart hospital they're trying get rid hire more. Hey sounds exactly like last job Yeah, think countries shit heads. There's always going good portion population good thoughtful people. 

For people rules, regulations coming people leadership positions.

Unfortunately States comes leadership exactly sending best.

I number really good American friends honestly feel sorry them. People always going principles align elected leaders last years definitely special case. really surprised though? everything, ever, worked. money connections massive advantage others. Neural network trained managerial AI ? Seems like good way scam VC Please provide proof paying ie article? heard 170+ gameplay hours still counting (not even finishing story mind you) accordng dev well may last winter. That‚Äôs interesting - started half doses didn‚Äôt enough vaccine, notify anyone change protocol? doesn‚Äôt sound like committed half doses manufacturing failed. rish best luck  Two people driving caused outbreak NZ everyone else locked nah thats Whole Lotta Red Wonder is... Maybe certain political party wielding deaths like political cudgel? Pretty much felt. 1st shot bitchin' headache 2nd shot achy, fatigued, body chills. gone around 28 hours initial shot. lot COVID denying wrestlers Chris Jericho number one dissapointment. Depends school district general agree, teachers underpaid. Around average salary close double still think low. completely different issues. Yes provide federal money test nurses. NFL college athletic departments paying tests.

If nurses want tested blaming they're administrators funding. athletes. want get sick

Just find doorknob lick

Covid showed case numbers. They're increasing rapidly. says sports leagues way profitable healthcare system, there's extra dollars available regular universal testing. way school systems. There's precious dollars available implement widescale testing. wrong.but certainly people decent admin happy job gives plenty time off. Also hard avoid liability. something aware Similar 911 responders, wonder there'll shortage emergency workers future become pattern expected indispensable heroes make sacrifices people chips them, discarded forgotten. says employer, California Pacific Medical Center, refuses provide testing medical staff even possible exposure

Do Americans free easily accessible testing? get tested even drug stores. 

I work mostly remotely I've still tested 3 times per employer request. surprised healthcare never tested, also need permission employer? Why? money, don't... surprising whole basis economic philosophy. Ouch!! Take upvote get That's said least could change PTO policy, can't even would mean everyone would saving PTO. perfect world, would test everyone weekly something, pay test positive stay home without use time off. well /r/standupshots, lot's stuff that's unfunny.

Never tested. coworkers already, still out. time can't work symptoms. 

The EMS system crazy busy, 12 hour shifts + breaks = burnout Texas 

We things backwards limited testing based county in. frustrating couldn‚Äôt get time sick unless positive covid test (because essential industry) couldn‚Äôt get damn covid test! SF able send nurses NYC AZ, NM (Navajo Nation) back April May.

They deserve hell Thank much ypur response! appreciate taking time link information knowledge. Stay safe! Yeah. I'm Kansas City. I'm sure I'll remember come back set remind bot week might know lol sit indoors someone contagious high rate transmission.

Plus add chances everyone table. Maybe hundred million people set camp 50% way party complete inability see differences, catering them. 

One side came plan went far could given makeup Senate, would gone them. spent decade slicing dicing state federal levels literally court RIGHT arguing whole thing scrapped replaced nothing. 

But no, sIdEs. So...ready American tourists now, or. ...? Herd immunity without vaccine means millions people people dead. Oh man... feel much like regard anti-intellectualism phenomenon although academically successful are. I‚Äôve struggling get first semester grad school business analytics - always feel like I‚Äôm dumbest student class. then, class day, interact individuals life don‚Äôt take basic precautions Covid don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôll infect them. like I‚Äôm trying understand concepts unbelievably complex grad program simultaneously trying convince people reality real. It‚Äôs surreal experience. fuckin sad. United States people going hungry. 
We (the working class) need reclaim government &amp; country. 
Fuck corporations. Dan Andrews premier Victoria, donut days started days 0 cases people celebrated eating donuts (as look like 'zero'!), double donut 0 cases, 0 deaths, recently TRIPPLE donut days 0 cases, 0 deaths, 0 active cases! really make sense say one particular region eliminated covid. long exists world, come back. rbf 30 days since thr last unknown community transmission NSW, almost 3 weeks since communuty transmission. active cases state hotel quarentine returned travellers (like rest country except SA). TLDR: 50. Saved click. focus complete prohibitive policies we're situation. Get ready watch backfire even further. kidding??? ""urgent"" reason travel ""borne heart"" visit daughter got new job?! 

Please. contrition, violation one commandments leaders day: 

""thou shall get found out"" ridiculous. can't shut country provide relief. inital check small business money great. country clearly needs second one. getting us, unfortunately. Freedom fault. many people think standing something they‚Äôve never really stood anything lives. gap fill. Lions didn‚Äôt fans game money, thinking administering shots? aren't. One idiotic move one Dem make daily idiotic moves every Rep. make false equivalence. surrounded assholes **AS MUCH COOLING** agree organized protest stopped, correct? Lol, calling something ""science"" make so. person asking advice. Implying factor needs considered anti-scientific misinformation pretends multitude advisories disseminated scientists experts exist. trash advice encourages people spread disease ""feel"" ok. Wierd ""fuck feelings"" crowd suddenly wants everyone indulge **their** feelings spite expert recommendations. 

Look, simple fact advice predictions wrong beginning. wrong virtually everything. gotten better, sure, tell us virus would go away soon 10%-20% population got infected. fair, COVID deaths many Asian countries relatively low regardless policy. interesting actually. comment dumb. Get brain, stooge. [You could show coworker banks consistently seen 60 percent increase demand compared time last year, continue require food resources provide people need,"" organization said news release days Thanksgiving. 

Sure, Democrats Corporate types, Trump's response COVID (no mask mandate early on, bailout money going top) caused many millions people lose jobs. Americans save cash, months later everyone broke. # avoid breathing stop spreading coronavirus Right, South American‚Äôs, Canadians, Europeans, Africans, Mexicans, Indians, Russians, Filipinos, Arabs etc. 

If idea easy everyone would it. mixing socialism (the system) public services called socialist-like (although that's bad description). Socialism means social control economy. means centralization way form. fairy tale workers taking companies deciding what's feasible reality. Even companies like Mondragon CEOs presidents. 

Who received profits USPS generated? think workers. That's socialism profit motive. People forced expected work profit profit collective. socialist system, perfectly fine post service running huge losses politically expedient. branch economy pick up. happened country privatized post service.

But guess that's said ""can profit motive"". think making profit necessary whole point making. Profit necessary. Without profit business perish sooner later. suspect soon say.

Several people follow twitter agree data provided far opaque making interpretation hard. like Akiko Iwasaki retweeted links article. least level concern among well informed.

Other reports repeating questions much softer tone, like  tidbit article company plans ask regulators whether modify trial include efficacious dosing regimen, Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca‚Äôs vice-president biopharmaceuticals research, said press briefing. 2300 people died yesterday, that's playing catch-up 2-3 weeks ago seeing 80-90k cases/day. we're double that, probably expect daily number dead double sometime soon too, everyone traveling holidays, fuck knows what's going happen christmas. think stopping pandemic exaggeration masks definitely help control local spread.

For country 100 million population, 1k cases day considered good. US 3 times population ~200 times cases. in: subreddits want people community causing disruptions. Story 11. rainy day fund country seems pretty exceptional. Savings rate abysmal No, it‚Äôs similar AZ‚Äôs vaccine. this, boil clogs walk sure they're clean need cancer WH. Great comment. especially liked America Public Education channels every state. households least phone pad. equipment access Internet - yet used reach Twitter, Facebook Snapchat - use access totality human knowledge...to learn, text nextdoor neighbor to, who's dating must face facts. people living Dark Ages world science enlightenment passes by.

Can quote discussions elsewhere Reddit? attribution course thats case we'll 200 300 months need vaccine  went free Covid testing site like mobile set brought place place thank God North Dakota they're reason state number one positivity rate. Jesus could 1/3 population. spite protests, anger would seem indicate u/ethanrhanielle exactly right. highly doubt it, expect able apply EUA February. sucks done. cant type ignorance life.

I tell one two best friends since elementary school, went college together, roommates one point, basically spent every weekend together, don‚Äôt talk all.

It‚Äôs incredibly sad sad times try move past it.

Just put lot time energy something doesn‚Äôt mean keep it, especially it‚Äôs negative impact life.

Edit- word work backwards. 0.12% state dead COVID-19. consensus opinion actual fatality rate countries decent health care 0.6%
1.2/6 = 20% Consider upward ramp infection fatalities trail infection month, 30% ballpark. elaborate, people vaccine trials walking around vaccinated since July. used to. Google ""Australian ballot."" please combine Dakotas one state thereby reduce senator count 4 2 ? sure Sinovac one people china currently go get vaccinated want recommending risk people do. 


They also selling vaccine brazil. Well, know that, county, dry county. *Arlington. Different city, different county. yes, Fuck Cowboys! response confirms lockdowns justified outbreak.

What missing fast virus spreads. IFR negligible one person infected, coronavirus rapidly infects people, even summer (albeit much). That's death count dwarfs number flu deaths, despite restrictions masks. scotus made ok pastors infect entire churches. friend‚Äôs mother law North Dakota believes priest covid hoax. She‚Äôs 70‚Äôs awesome health, Native American little money still tithes. absolutely horrifies me. Pretty much everyone said vaccine free usage administration. feel good points said many times, economy everyone dead. Look people first. Worry money second. it‚Äôs perfectly fine expert knowledge even cursory knowledge various subjects long you‚Äôre willing accept expert advice understand verify said advice sources type logic that? NY locked day WA 3 days CA. NY implemented travel restrictions. CA WA didn't. else could possibly done limit transmission? CA WA benefited travel restrictions China. NY get benefit travel restrictions Europe (which vast majority cases US stem from). indicates virus spreading NY known spreading due lack testing falls CDC guidelines. NY flat harder hit CA. politics clouding mind. it‚Äôs huge increase genuinely understand people think motive mass conspiracy is. MiL says ""compliance, want compliant"". Like mean ya fucking snapperhead? 

 mean, people already ""compliant"" pay taxes obey laws. guess I'm already compliant? really living Idiocracy. Who'da thunk movie foretelling future? I'm pretty sure Swedish economy suffered spring-summer despite locking then, enough people voluntarily locked economy died anyway. Maybe J&amp;J report results Monday since they're next line Astrazeneca. still single? going give grandchildren? work.... Since lot people still going office. time one outside home, saying 10hours less, would need 3 surgical masks change time? this? guidelines citizens. Leaders issue exempt. /s think next winter considerably better.

I hope so. wish people would take winter sleep well stay healthy!

You too, we're working hard it. considerable percentage, expecting bigger number (ND 760,000 people apparently) ....when talking going clubs?

I go work, go grocery store, go doctor's office...? season insane! I‚Äôm waiting redemption arc, never know writers. friend respected epidemiologist, travelled today visit wife's parents. Reddit real life. 70,000* 364 died November mean, american website, populated least popularity possibly majority US-based users

so, uh, seems kinda weird attack people posting articles written america, americans, american newspaper lol high get records history books? Well - look current president‚Äôs resume.... Zinc- lowers viral replication rate
Vitamin C- necessary immune cells oxidized activity 
Vitamin D- actually wide ranging steroid hormone correlated lower rates respiratory infection types people normal blood levels
Quercetin- helps force zinc cells. Bad math, 70,000 infected 364 people died november would still trust Japanese public health officials response covid. 

Granted, Japan completely different context United States.  American exceptionalism finest. world doesn‚Äôt care America nearly much think family North Dakota, including grandma grew Mandan Depression WWII. talked today mentioned back everyone knew happily rationed sake neighbor couldn‚Äôt understand different.

She shook head said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt talk politics though, r/kjimbro, I‚Äôm glad page you‚Äôre healthy.‚Äù Vice President also epidemiologist, certainly helps setting smart policy pandemic. Yeah, I've keep cautious get vaccine, since know tons people getting COVID despite super-careful, I'm going hole home fastidiously disinfect everything unless want to. Ah interesting, protein modeling says spike protein virus good affinity human cells but, viral protein tricks enzyme outside cells primes spike protein allow inside cells.  now. 

Also, mRNA approved animal vaccines. quite same, technology isn‚Äôt new media making be. partially able get vaccine trials quickly.  requires vaccine stops transmission rather symptoms. beautiful social world back then. looked, right, much hottest temperature, surprised me. imagination map onto reality case. it. everything supposed to, wash hands, wipe food bring house, wore mask (properly mouth nose!) work home. Sanitized everything owned, shopped to. 

I still got damn disease. live Fargo, one biggest cities state. Good luck there, rough time think tomorrow‚Äôs going bad, wait 14 days. get worse. Indeed. find hilarious people getting upset exact math area circle. people scientifically literate wouldn‚Äôt get hung trivialities like this. Dumbledore dies North Dakota fucking idiot Yea know, recently watched State Origin Blacks vs Pumas barely saw mask, far cry life New York City. got fam, based I'm I'm here... what's going wrong blue areas? different approach? No, people actually friends belittle people reason. Tell people died. Nearly everyone unscathed. fucking plague. Reinfection LIKELY actually Coronavirus. never gain full immunity Coronavirus flus. may NEED vaccines achieve adequate herd immunity. research reinfection (this takes time) mean can't make reasonable assumptions based similar viruses. similar counterpart sustained immunity viral load high infection severe. means weaker responses lower viral load never achieve 2 year immunity often end partial. Reinfections hard prove active spikes, going contributing factor especially long term. 

Acting like achieve herd immunity without vaccines naivety laymen paying attention science community. American politician people haven‚Äôt caught breaking rules

Impossible, one base requirements politician America endless hypocrisy. man covid like 3 times now. bother... What's sudden surge quality stuff Wired past couple days?  find actually case lot truther websites.

A typical headline something like this:

*Respected Doctor says something TOTALLY insane: absolute truth:*

Then read article, random person nowheresville said something sounds sort like people want hear, framed everyone else insane one guy absolutely right reasons.

Don't get wrong - sites absolutely too, seems super prevalent ones. Great. became kid eats worms recess estimated 2.2 million people NYC alone, 24% city, got virus May. large majority get tested, case count ended much lower reality. lessen it. also practice safe practices. New York clamped fairly hard back April May resulting large decrease. governor male. Doug Bergem. Right?! reddit moment lmao think inspired us? :) Absurd headline. Chardonnay ""The Spanish Princess"" series me. lazy math circle instead squared 6 ft called day. Hmm. wonder unscathed be. 

I think mixed messaging problematic. Wow!! partisan mouthpiece huh? actually watching care.

It tragedy witness. sucks idea anyone would go parks places large number cases. Even covid believers can‚Äôt keep story straight. honestly people need forget shit, especially good silencing nightmares too, everyone though think they'll cover weekend? West especially. honestly feels like Americans getting dumber dumber every year. 1.4 million people living Hawaii. call front line workers, give vaccine 2 3 weeks 'ready' see happens. island. zombies, good. /s mean, sound pants-on-head reckless, problem whole society full people taking ""a little risk"", straight ignoring precautions accumulates infection wave. numbers thing. things level precautions 6 months ago versus riskier, viral prevalence increases risk every minor interaction every person meeting up. numbers. So, hope things go ok you, every gathering going rolling dice, odds worse right now. People also fib lot safe they're being, awkward confront family that. Good luck! Yes, 28 days zero new cases never done before. course there's chance could come back tend act pretty quickly outbreaks. Plus amazing contact tracing helps alot. Churning awesome financially literate organized, possible financially illiterate fucking up. confirm $11 beer Titans home games. asked another poster this. 
They think 8-10 times many people infected reported adjusting death rate factor 10.

Is possible? idea see data backing I'll go data see. Dan Andrews would lot tougher time closing businesses JobKeeper exist. Lol physical therapy clinic... Says lot profession. bros yell winning let's gooooo  God I'd give anything able go bar hopping see live music everyone covid moral failing.

But do. Thats rather optimistic way science regarding country. Even reasonable people hesitant want wait see happens. 
People buy new iPhone release people wait firist update fix launch date bugs.  agree something done. Nevertheless, people react death perceived loss security different ways. OP reaching it, told may effort find justification anymore. Illuminati 5G Tower Transmissions, imagine. Actual cases likely almost THIS. Oh sure, keep mind article [edit: sorry article]. vast majority infections recent months. immunity lasts say.. months year whatever.. that's pretty bad sign herd immunity side. cases worse 2nd infections also raise concern.

It may feel likes long time now.. really reinfections really show up.. metaphorical blink eye.

But agree, overall rate seems first glance pretty promising. Yeah hard get accurate estimate many people started testing much.

When outbreak tore workplace Feb-March state single digit covid cases. time sick early March county showing 1 2 cases per day. surprised closer 50 mil, going get much worse next months though. 

Everyone know sick denied testing. way we'd get accurate idea massive amounts antibody testing random huge scale. who's going that? government? Lol It‚Äôs nice see refreshing dose nuance acknowledges sides issue. Thank this. Call local credit union. Ask rates transfer there. time they'll give deal opening new account even something like that. 

Right able refinance 5%....max. Yeah. But, know family's situation, parents means keep children home unfortunately 'leaders' nothing ensure changes. people scroll dont click articles, worldwide Well starting dinner 11 sounds bit overkill wasn‚Äôt Republicans passed bill. houses needed agree sign president. parties blame. fucked us. watching fall empire..... good please God Gene? /s stowing personal attacks explain. I'm downvoted? lockdown cause harm economy everyday American people livelihood? condoning actions, Saudi Arabia threatened Iraq invading Kuwait 90s, Bin Laden offered take militia defend Saudi Arabia, basically CIA paid build do.

The US like ""nah fuck we've got bunch new hardware need test out"" told fuck off.  mean, probably few. lower fatality rate good. Long term implications COVID infection not. Yeah think person even understands science works either. Anyone knows ""well-supported"" ""true"" thing. Experimental results support hypotheses, confirm them. definitely true, however people get sucked fake news can‚Äôt read green eggs ham never mind written journalism complex topics. Maybe stooping level informational content practical solution?  countries currently suffering massive daily new case numbers ones struggling economies? places poor outlooks future too? heard saying short term pain long term gain? contained virus keeping low case numbers go back pretty much normal. couple week ago state biggest crowd sporting event since pandemic... Something world dream moment. That's possible safely thanks new community transmission coronavirus months. Places massive outbreaks going ongoing negative flow effects economies long pandemic continues... there's getting back normal world. Places like Victoria however get back close normal place get dealing pandemic. Im sure future sporting events like Australian open help bolster economy. Something many parts world can't. sounds like little bitter, fraud stuff Yeah seriously, PM pretty useless cunt times crisis. Wishful thinking cuckoo heard Biden going inaugurated Whitehouse. telling people come. Let crow. Real men worry size!  shit symbolism. Imo comments like way avoid self reflection economic costs coronavirus restrictions causing, fact economic pain concentrated amongst poorest. much easier redditors supported measures make snidey comments companies involved, rather show empathy lost jobs. Mind you, announced 90% efficacy via press conference, peer review article. knew silver bullet pharma announcing science via news outlets respected channels. Another red flag noticed too, Pfizer ceo selling shares company announcement. I'm surprised Noone talking more. omg, hate living USA LOL. I'm glad though y'all got paid stay home people approve lockdown, generally!!! wut? want then? dumb aggresive picks towards china? necessarily true, either. 

Fauci many others stated February March Covid may 10 times deadly flu. IHME, others, estimate IFR Spring .9% (some projections even state tad bit higher factor deaths counted). projections closely line claim. 

After initial spring surge, treatment methods improved, cut hospital mortality rates almost half cases. Many models projections place IFR summer around .45%. change IFR ""isn't high initially thought."" Rather, better methods tools treat covid, preserves life drives IFR.

In many skeptic circles, comments frequently state, ""the 3.4% fatality rate entirely wrong! nowhere near that!"" (Even Joe Rogan made claim). Tedros simply stating CFR time. Several states CFR higher 3.4% even today. think president telling people travel Thanksgiving. 100% aware make pandemic blow up. wants fuck country thinks fucked over.  think alright mate. Pay mind.

Don't think there's small distance paying someone get vaccinated taking part medical trial?

In discount app thing, data sharing app disclosed (as basically almost app does)?

I'd argue things one want do, due incentive - principle behind original idea. Happy Thanksgiving! Stay safe! people counties upset, they're going let commissioners keep jobs. Breastmilk-Newborn-Industrial Complex taken *Science Magazine* like twitter fb feel safer living LA county popoulation many times Dakotas combined, along significantly higher population density? screwed much? wish could work father law sucks. offense Americans, kind always were...

We tell want get invaded. Victorian, I‚Äôm curious know facts they‚Äôre basing on. program dependent well. example, medical schools tend accept online courses (at least pre-covid). CA WA also didn‚Äôt send covid positive patients back nursing homes. You‚Äôre close. Republicans Congress care giving businesses money stock market. Stock market fine fuck everyone else. would've taken care right beginning stuck shitty situation.  That's bait credit card companies put sharp fishhook. possible fish nibble carefully bait get free dinner (see r/churning), needing pay rent credit card get caught, skinned gutted. Earning 1% back cash miles nothing compared 20% interest paying. Oh yes! serious note, really want try win lottery, always play state lottery, rather national one. better odds! :) Yersinia Pestia haunted around Eurasia 1000 years. large portion recorded history. like millions illegal votes. US shambles multiple reasons, racial/socio-economic civil unrest, election polarization, repurcussions lockdowns global pandemic. matter feelings chinas lockdowns could end course action adventageous economically cost life, even preferred chosen path. However, idea actual hit china took cost life economically, that's reason they're poor example. reason Iran excluded studies this, never capacity test report fatalities. US bit ass country it‚Äôs saying Europe done stellar job managing this. Obviously vaccines provide much needed tools well new administration actually mead nation. doubt much disbelief.I feel world come expect kind thing now. Aptly enough, exact way feel Trump. Virtually nothing surprises me. Here‚Äôs good article COVID Tracking Project data reporting thrown actually anticipate reporting disrupted least several days expired 2021. He's 55 undergo open heart surgery due Covid-19. There's whole lot information world know countries even thought school. countries news cover countries news. I'm pretty sure everyone know Thanksgiving is. Idk think everyone lives bubble Kk cool. I'll back months see try rationalize another 260k people ""falling ladders"" explaination reasonable there's pandemic killing people. I'd use open-ended scale. always get worse.

Like half population dead, half starving... still get worse. Actually, obese nurses died. confirm find america handling virus extremely disturbing agree, really need add federal government exploited last century's goodwill constantly fighting pointless wars US corporations buy minerals market prices. party establishments insitutional media - even major university departments - largely support system.

Lie use people long enough, rally them. denying young people medical care? article apparently about? Hopefully German people inclined get vaccine. Last read, 50% Americans plan get vaccinated. How? cough? going laugh loud, please wear mask. Getting real sick neighbors huge, loud disruptive gatherings every holiday throughout pandemic. Tonight might night put foot report city. parents tried guilt n wife going family Thanksgiving dinner. Worse yet, childhood friend getting married 2 weeks older brother family flying west visit us (in FL) attend. wedding outdoors. told mom today regrettably attending sure super spreader event. 

Now family shaming killjoy alarmist. brother called today try persuade attend... saying many times, quote: ""Do right thing"". 

Sorry I'm done trying please family. try take PANDEMIC seriously get ostracized so...for Fuchs sake, weddings. hear hear saying there's chance... Oh no! Anyway...  Well wait decent time side waiting people pass. listening people talk. also less subtle giveaway. library next park. library parking spots reserved people pick reserved books. knew spots free parking since library closed. parking lot almost full, spots free. Regular people park would know ok park there. shit Indeed Thats laugh hard at. People think hoax... entire world playing joke like hoax claiming people think. entire world conspiring America. America needs stop acting victim everything. world revolve around us everyone get you. Shouldn‚Äôt flared Good News? Thanks posting this. I'm J&amp;J trial December, interesting read!  Many unused. Last read, half Americans don‚Äôt plan get vaccination. lot convicts sent Australia racially targeted Irish Scottish people, meagre crimes 'steal bread' 'loiter', accusations criminality used persecute them. That's 'ran space' gaols Britain violently colonise another country genocide local population.

Unless making joke, course, case apologise hope everybody appreciates little bit history. color scale serious color purple? four color scale California does. know, like Star Trek, Picard order ‚ÄúPurple Alert‚Äù everybody knows that‚Äôs even serious Red Alert. Fortunately we‚Äôll likely turning corner, unfortunately lead people justifying going ‚Äúeven unskippable‚Äù Christmas gatherings. people catch Christmas start contagious around New Year‚Äôs.

It's good time introverted ;-)

But seriousness, hate hearing carnage. northern half country cold. NJ? don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs #1 per capita people's logic anway? 

Something failing they're providing something covered insurance? that's case every doctor hospital ghost town. need regional border controls. I'm serious. many places country capable getting zero. Whether Michael Mina's daily rapid at-home testing, lockdowns places practical like NYC San Fran, increased testing smart distancing conforms actual spread rate area.

Then, assholes wear masks refuse test desire control - can't allowed keep reseeding responsible places.

I way favor national lockdown. necessary, probably helpful, harmful. places able get handle places won't. There's gotta movement controls. Infectious disease war literally two times ever this. saying can't travel, leaving red zone, test quarantine maybe even mandatory phone app short period time.

Do know sensibly? law, freaking law. legislators, rules, protect society whose behavior harms others.

No lockdowns, better testing goal zero covid. absolutely, yes, control movement regions many parts US even make effort.

And hell like secede. mind. continue quarantine travel, blame international politics rather federal government. suppose generates stronger immune response aren't. people harsh reactions flu shots, laid day getting mine year. Make something you. Thousands people colours died noting many insurance plans cover network entered via emergency room legitimate reason. Mine go ER. Cambodia, Singapore believe Thailand well. ...or funeralsüò¢ Boy, sure lot positives coming North Dakota days! live Ski town myself. It‚Äôs skiing problem. naturally socially distanced masked. It‚Äôs bars restaurants social events ski town spread happens. Keep slopes open. Close bars restaurants. Problem solved. Fair enough. would gone with, ""Are mind? Even *don't* COVID, something want catch it."" really nono film hospital. Id fired heartbeat someone saw filming patients info Sadly, succinct yet correct comment. Highest case loads *so far*. hunch peak early jan mid feb. never know, maybe rise bad due thanksgiving mass lockdowns happen would push cases next months. would longer 6 weeks would sure like see go away.

Like, right now. ended hospital twice due side effects flu shot. one time that, bad shape home days. years got shot ended flu later seasons. Never years didn‚Äôt get shot. recommended get one again. 

I‚Äôm scared death get Covid one, hearing side effects. I‚Äôm worried would even worse me. still unhappy went coughed faces spit mouths.

Then, got sick end hospital, ask finally happy. Countries similar America shitty shittier. Culturally, kind of. Geographically, no, way.  And? one likes smoldering fire smokes forever. guarantee none anti-maskers uttered word freedoms Bush shat Patriot Act. 

But masks much them. people full shit. People fooled think state safe we‚Äôre scarcely populated indeed still risk. political leaders playing dumb card too. infuriating Didn‚Äôt Europe spend summer traveling spreading covid continent? 
Kindly quiet mind ya business. wear KN95 wasting those. Damn bro-- original scorchingly cruel. know fucking burn em. probably cos US handled covid fucking retarded It‚Äôs controversial due hyperbole regarding entire civilizations wiped  NZ, 20% many people.

Okay, many Hobbits ALSO live NZ? Yeah information coming China correct selling Brazil.  


Chinese upset sold Brazil much cheaper Chinese public, that's wholesale works. saw this. wonder people stopped caring. One possibility people drove, people still travelling instead acting responsibly. course guess, real proof case numbers next weeks. Stay home, wash hands, stay apart, wear mask, take vaccine etc etc. 

Some countries great. Others, much. people obese (or alcoholic preventable COPD) ones dying most. happened personal accountability? 

Why news organization promoted health fitness? eating well? It‚Äôs like nice equal slice population dying. It‚Äôs fat people unhealthy people. drive sucks. Shasta nice, otherwise it‚Äôs valley boring. take 101 you‚Äôd like pretty also take 40 hours. F that! That‚Äôs bought pie lol. Well, Cornish hen doesn‚Äôt exactly roast long, time sides.

I hope great worth it! Canada. rest world, Canada seeing COVID-19 deaths women men dying COVID take care themselves. Men likely obese less likely see doctor regularly. Men dying COVID behavior. nothing sex. U Early randomized antibody testing NYC showed 20-30% people city it. likely day two NYC alone saw 150k new cases. Literally disbanded team could managed fight us. Ridiculous.  love turkey gravy make drippings. It‚Äôs one fav things. Stuffing sausage close second. adjusting population America far worst respect covid-19. .



Right? doesn‚Äôt make sense. explain plague eventually going away? Nice True. flown, assuming TSA still see confirm identity, times unmasked airport might encounter public place driving. honestly can't imagine either. many door handles, gas pumps, public bathrooms random accidents drive many checkpoints, airports, layovers, masking/unmasking involved flying. point. 

If you‚Äôve convinced reality different *at point*, stopped giving fuck people long ago. 

The places advertising truly false reality face caring others long ago - frankly, folks still watching didn‚Äôt seem notice. UK Northern Ireland coworkers spend plenty time laughing us. spent lot time paying attention happens f-ups global reach. ""God Gene"" plz. side world. Thx. course, nursing women leave house often non-nursing women. low spouses? Assuming sleep bed share respiratory droplets? Exactly, refuse anything Amazon, shop Walmart either.

China‚Äôs domestic air traffic already recovered, happen people feel comfortable flying travel restrictions lifted. thats one piece evidence points towards stronger recovery us, dont is. true, could think get out? people stupid selfish. Black Friday going always year. one talking interacting household members holiday season. COVID killed Christmas; everyone else. LMAO okay bro?

-a New Zealander unfortunately sad truth. one wants COVID go away per se. want stop mass killing people disrupting lives Started cooking 11:30?? Damn, gf got 9 start cooking Original alive fine. Canadians also targeted Russian propaganda bots, Facebook comments local news. language similar. think it‚Äôs time tell said ‚Äúrookie numbers‚Äù meant joke.  great, terrible. Also, die inside imagining disgusting mask must end day. gross.

Hello fellow human. seem distress. 

Take multiple masks. Change masks day. Wash wearing again. Michigan used longer report Sundays. remember, matter bad Thanksgiving get together numbers end being....just wait New Years. Immediately start 2021, getting 2 reporting backlogs hitting time, well Christmas surge hitting New Years. fully anticipate hard reset brain point. Airplane transmission low - taking account security checkpoints, bagge claim, terminals, getting on/off, etc. airport much higher risk. follow advice ask anyone works hospital? Ontario Canada restaurant refused close indoor dinning even though Toronto lockdown.

After 3 days refusing obey authorities arrested owner changed locks building. think it‚Äôs time tell said ‚Äúrookie numbers‚Äù meant joke. ski grew Switzerland kid. tell people lining get lifts they‚Äôre going keep two metre safe distance? I‚Äôve never got orderly lined lift entire life. It‚Äôs laughable would suggest would happen.
Also restaurants cafes mountains they‚Äôve going facilities correctly spaced chairs tables safe spaces lines bathroom? people won‚Äôt crowd anywhere?
Plus ski schools going able proved correct environment prevents spread? 
I get you‚Äôre desperate economy fail.
I get year unbelievably hard everyone know travel definitely spreads virus way around this.

Yes, high, many places struggle even manpower accurately &amp; regularly report? Even more: number people dying *anything* increase significantly direct result - none people included ""official"" death stats.

The true total somewhat visible retrospect months even years later. Excess deaths closer measure, that's still based death certificates issued actually get sent quickly. mean... yes. also US, fortunate work home. needs seen economic relief legislation money gets put people's hands instead corporations.

-Still fully staffed, sent workers home. 

That quick google search. show evidence work home anywhere near scale states attempted. 

And though business centres may small, they're still staffed. 

Do disingenuous accusations ignorance. Lmao could said point history.  That's great hear. Vitamin deficiency easy solve; discussed everyone. Unfortunately, rarely hear MSM informing people it.

There evidence towards zinc beneficial COVID also, though many studies supporting it. slow news day suppose Lol. 

Really want ski hills open travel shut mountains season I've felt years. 

Eventually anger millions felt.

It's matter *time*. American, I'm grateful countries Australia New Zealand showing us possible much better US Europe. Asian countries getting shit together I'm sure would ton people making excuses approaches work Asia working Western countries based hand-waving Asian culture. hair getting grayer day wrinkles around eyes mouth weren‚Äôt last year.

Edit sp Fuck. Off. know unless you‚Äôre tested regularly? many asymptomatic cases. Stay safe recover well homie. 80% covid-19 patients recover significant amount recover hospital. Given broad therapeutic methods used covid patients, can't draw conclusions without blind three arm studies. morons talking HydroChloroquine. implying form insider trading? secret Pfizer vaccine trial.  like sports can't understand people like mean right dismiss silly. Makes come condescending. America approx 1 million tests day.....this seem major issue Correct.
Moderna vaccine = 95% effective 
Oxford vaccine = 70% effective animals equal, *some* animals equal others. America known something, known people finding every excuse book drink gather people.

But holidays...I guess thing left hope everyone minimized social interactions wore masks. aren‚Äôt ‚Äúspent‚Äù athletes. would thing limited number tests.

I think one two people (sorry, two hundred thousand) people died since Simple: According market logic, nurses disposable labor. Athletes entertainers unique, also make money owners nurses do. lot people believe mental health good methodology would like cancer studies compare standard care. read study, think did. obtain high level evidence without another group compare with? get high level evidence, doctors hesitate use drugs insurance companies see benefits offering coverage it. already though... Nurses doctors quitting load people like can't fathom staying home 2 months. figured others. Essential businesses shut 2-3 months, keep Amazon open make everyone online shopping. Small businesses worth saving, sorry sorry. honest...yeah. gets crazy reasonably involve in, gotta gotta do. Hopefully people get scared consider coming back clean tail end pandemic, whenever get there. Anyone stays exhausted badly need backup then. Loll hahah society functioned fine terrible medical care 99% history. Wed fine. We‚Äôd get people train knowledge we‚Äôve accumulated, they‚Äôd replaced within 5-10 years, right back normal. 

Cute hypothetical though. I‚Äôve literally never needed doctor/nurse life, vast majority people could easily go without medical care 5+ years. Would people need suffer? course. it‚Äôs respected profession gets paid healthy salary. hand, entertainers gone would affect 99% people. 

Is entertainers severe medical care need surgery something? course not. reason they‚Äôre important (and get paid more) breadth coverage, impact interaction.

The messaging changed least six months. Wear mask. Practice physical distancing. Avoid congregating groups. Wash hands frequently.

The examples provided influence actions slightest, usually referenced people looking excuse avoid them. makes sense, trying breastfeed always advised continue even sick (with cold) baby could get antibodies. fellow nurse Australia, feel pain read conditions forced work.
Lots love downunder. Keep safe cool dodge question, confirming know origin? Wait guys good enough credit get credit card? mean, don‚Äôt personally watch NHK, TV, get jist conversations coworkers (on daily basis) covering numbers America, reports numbers are, also predictions trends continue. Discussion speculation aspects American culture leading massive spikes common. order cover this, news also explain things like, ‚ÄúWhat Thanksgiving anyway?‚Äù them‚Äî apparently, Obon common comparison, New Years second.

It‚Äôs also politically related local discussions government wants promote travel tourism within Japan, stupid is, look‚Äî here‚Äôs huge picture happens people start traveling see families crowded rooms pandemic! it‚Äôs quite topical. worked COVID hospital today I'm EXHAUSTED. numbers even bad yet. burnt know wall pain coming. slow creeping dread huge wave coming towards us there's nothing do. like...3 people then? Saying ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know‚Äù isn‚Äôt sufficient man. I‚Äôm sorry.

Australia looks like better place friend got covid second time. Herd immunity isn‚Äôt happening ""I like uppity women telling do""

/s Case reporting whacky least days directly following holiday. Economy death, apparently. Yikes. social distancing, local mask mandates, isolating infected vulnerable. act like economies around world haven‚Äôt negatively affected lockdowns dumb. just? sure small percentage Americans continue wear mask rest life, majority can't wait stop wearing it. seeing wanting wear second longer necessary won‚Äôt see true results fir 5-6 weeks. Lag level 2 spread really move needle.

Side note: Hawaii, New Jersey, NYC set big spikes positivist cases approx 7-10 days. true. reaches point deaths piling quickly, major freak really don‚Äôt see way around rigid shutdowns (actually enforced) stop numbers.

I agree one month may worth it.  Unfortunately coming year now. Sorry bearer bad news :( spent 19 years schools, graduating top, people saw speak way ones next skid row downtown Los Angeles, speaking forth street corners. yes, reason lot dad worked high rise nearby; wandered around lot, fearlessly. like BS midlevel counselor halfway house. Better try get appointment. Dude, says ""herd immunity cant happen natural infection"" covid, overall. literally took entire college class virology, unless want go professor textbooks read, know tell you. Herd immunity gotten nearly every pandemic history. solution virus, myth. 

Once again, hit herd immunity *every single year* flu. Around 12-25% population infected, flu cases decline time. Even places flu vaccinations incredibly rare, still happens. I‚Äôm North Dakota I‚Äôve lucky enough get it. coworkers still go bars work. Many people still attending weddings local sporting events. don‚Äôt wear masks properly work cases. shop food week go straight home. I‚Äôm trying get hard nephew leukemia don‚Äôt want possible way catch COVID. people think it‚Äôs still flu. Trump loves growth industry... lot circumstances line us detect reinfection knows many we're missing. is, we're great picking first infections many parts world, never mind possible second. suggesting public refuse vaccine high number? mutate? Step two - Don‚Äôt mind third ear grows top head. I'm sorry going üíî hope pain stress ease soon. profession? tell covididiot they‚Äôll respond 10,000 people died diagnosed COVID. ‚ÄúThey COVID diabetes killed them‚Äù. 

Its madness. deep cult way get say that? think that? bit stricter, like march-april recommendations avoid travel even. nothing completely new? NZ get vaccinated quickly enough, yes, they'll open up, there's question quickly vaccinated. one tell someone local? sure thing, jump line behind many thousands Aussie citizens abroad slowly returned home tourists considered haha

It rumoured possible jump queue afford first class flights. need spare $20k+ flight well. kinda cute tho Yeah uh, knew Apri/May. God hate fucktards country. No, safe, fuck can‚Äôt stay home harder Probably one said anything mask less folks Safeway. :/ Thank Trump that. thought Victoria Canada thought how? makes sense. Haha ya that‚Äôs crazy. NFC East disaster. noticed too. came information misinformation, fall love. say so. See 6 months. reason is? unhappy cake day you. Everyone rugged individualist need oxygen nasal cannula country maybe second strictest mask regulations world (required everywhere possible), I've observed two things:

1. Many people wear cloth masks, less effective.
2. People take they're family friends.

I think masks alone stop pandemic. key word article *consistently*, there's way force people wear masks visit cousin. know, friends seas absolutely mind blown. keep up. like train wreck can't look away from. train filled friends... Really high testing rates, positivity rates absolutely bonkers. saw get 19/20% pos rate day. Apparently, [get meeting, hear committee say whether vaccine approved EUA? Anthony Lynn good losing close football games. number -5 Bills tricky. I'm taking straight steering clear spread. WTF talking about? US number one hotspot COVID infections while. large number Americans travel countries vice versa. case figured yet virus spreads one person another. course people countries worried. mention vast number people countries friends relatives living US. fuck observed countries learned them?

Yeah. Initial guidance wear masks save P2 masks healthcare workers, came said ""we wrong, everyone required wear masks, cloth ok"". matter opinion telling blatant place trust Dr. Fauci simply he's got big brain, likewise doctor professional.

You trust experience expertise subject do. Jesus fucking deaths virus exaggerated

Just stop dude. point know there's way constructive conversation.

Got bowl popcorn waiting see kind crazy things we‚Äôll next.

You‚Äôve actually provided nothing conversation opinion pretty shit I‚Äôm honest you! companies aren‚Äôt telling employees enforce mask policies. [Thousands mink culled COVID fears rise mass grave , half dog stayed home, cooked cornish hens rice dressing. went 4 walks....lol  heard sister living life. \*shrugs\*  I'm guess feeling like big deal. sad it.   siblings lving lives. I'm part that. say catch it, hope find moral core infect others. politicians give lot lip service serious actions demonstrably show really believe they're saying. 

Also there's Pelosi getting hair done, apparently setup. Yeah, lured salon, mask violently ripped face, forcibly held hair. webpage exist Haha, gold. Sadly yes. Look comments section twitter post Victoria health department find people claiming 'Dictator Dan' (as lovingly call state premier) enforcing masks Sinister Mind Control Reasons, because...I dunno, reasons. Even conservative politicians jumped on. movement always small much impact lockdown. File obvious. McConnell care anything. Except bigoted shoving judges judicial system. want pay penny help people. except plans house. Pelosi, either naive dumb. McConnell accept plans. to, unfortunately, accept less expensive less useful stimulus plans. give people help. news see anti maskers antivaxxers. Nuking orbit wouldn‚Äôt work well. necessarily. think opposite: Oxford much good pr. They've honestly great pr game. Paying attention, however, think signs bit issues. think sounds jarring lot concerns getting noise early on.

And, yes, dosing error trial big deal deserves criticism. 3000 people small group, either. Fwiw, North Dakota actually exist. Porque los dos? honestly makes worse. Oh yea, tons jobs. Tons dead people too. could possibly go wrong? Largely new humanity... always news never easy creat distribute. Herd immunity something get natural infections. Otherwise small pox, tb, polio, pertussis, etc would fallen victim herd immunity long vaccines invented. Eventually, things ok That's terrible thing. folks cistern trip town weekend .. like .. say, grocery shopping. active denial even die disease. 

Freedom free, freedumb deadly OW balls! really though? Like beyond meme? net worth listed 2.5B. think fun watching winner host playoff game ICU. You‚Äôll surrounded fans again! Circles nest perfectly. Squares do. Hexagons would accurate. wasted exercise. part stay safe. There's nothing else do. that's one part equation. COVID super contagious, even small percentage get die, fact many get still pumps death numbers way up. problem soon send people to. 1-2 weeks Thanksgiving (today), situation going dire. easily looking 4k deaths day. nobody actually talks colour codes. Ideally, people would required register advance come shortly appointment. would limited number persons line, spaced six feet apart. Also, daily number vaccine doses unlimited, hours pharmacy open, set limit number patients. poor people can't lobby congress like every special interest country can. 

Look money someone raise even run Senate Congress. many things unattainable poor people. Right I'm college. worked hard get scholarships. Next year unpaid internship. Without internship, chances getting hired graduation low. can't afford work free. Moving world becoming almost impossible. makes concerned think clothing choice impact health. guess everyone middle country retarded. two provided indication hiding problems. AZ reads like someone trying justify inferior product. enough data throw mistake, get full dose vaccine approved, competition much better data unlikely approved. fluke worth study, enough data worth talking yet. 

The press release said starting new study different dosage seems working better. know single person gathering outside household. anecdotal evidence. must depend know? virus may closer dropping endemic disease, likely immune suppressed people exposed vaccinated. widespread is, along reasons, likely still circulate level. pandemic phase over. three extended family members MDs multiple elderly family members . fucking morons reason going away. praying God one gets sick. 47% North Dakota infected. That‚Äôs big deal. It‚Äôll awesome watch host playoff game ICU bed. ...or care people. empathy usually check arbitrary political border surrounded story breaks heart. Hire people work specialists. works professions. option let people die see harm least trying.

I'm sure training rolling many humanly possible. issue likely one sitting monitoring single patient, react rapidly changing medical conditions. person call specialist, two people call simultaneously one patients die. 
It's simple that.

I understand frustration many people used infinitely instantly scalable network/IT cloud solutions recognizing lead times ramping medical capacity. problem solved machines. 

The effective solution dramatically reduce number cases, way dramatically reduce number cases everyone wear mask, eliminate unnecessary social interactions, limit shopping bare grocery essentials. Nothing else reduce deaths short term. shitshow. spent small fraction time spends practicing religion going therapy, she'd much better off. Twitter gave temp ban calling one chucklefucks.

The next weeks going interesting bad way. Don‚Äôt blame Republican Party, Biden won‚Äôt even support universal healthcare. It‚Äôs ridiculous. patients, perhaps simply canceling course chemotherapy? Or, equally appalling case pediatric surgery, cancelling time-sensitive surgeries correct conditions become permanent missed critical surgical window?

How decided literally everyone else sacrifice COVID? Really feels like make less profit infect patients covid accident, employees start dropping. America sucks. Meanwhile UK could approve sometime next week. Wtf holding FDA? high mighty mate part problem. guidance clearly travel. People like violates long find good enough reason wonder virus still spreading  get everyone this. First all, pilot program see type thing works not. Italy's U.S travel restrictions still place. flights first still essential workers people would otherwise still able travel two countries without program. like sudden bumpkin hop flight Rome little sight seeing. yes see eliminate quarantine requirements eventually reopen travel everyone possible people travel non-essential reasons. see that's terrible thing. people friends families countries, mention Italy others heavily reliant income foreign tourism. think time started trying find ways make international travel safe possibility. Gotta arm tazers conservatives would switch dirty lightbulb/lightbulbs case. technology blur faces protect identities. People taking cell phone vids, hospitals asking film crews respectable news agencies come document what's going ...and teachers, grocery store workers, delivery drivers, first responders, construction workers, production line workers... federal government slow. Hey, downvoted stating want safety rushed vaccine? never long term studied that.

Can someone give cogent opinion? think structure health care way, US, health care corporations make money hire nurses. many discussed since start. countries manage pandemic, inevitably walk one two doors first: shortage staff shortage beds. Countries like Poland ran beds. Countries like run staff.

The way manage pandemic. hard fast way respiratory pandemic effective combination testing, tracing, isolation, masking. hard slow way horrifying body count leading herd immunity lack hosts mass vaccinations. doors walk through. I‚Äôve found NYT doesn‚Äôt work browser work Apollo app use Reddit app. Much better official one  fact like 2 paragraph story find mind boggling. needs sent every cell phone St Louis metro area local tv repeatedly played. PA got statewide alert hospitals filling wear masks social distance. Get text message like ‚ÄúALERT - Hospitals St Louis metro CAPACITY. Patients illnesses diverted hours away.

Please protect yourself, neighbors, family members: wear masks, social distance, stay home possible‚Äù see people finally take seriously imo, generations raised boomers thereafter like this. Boomers entitled grew period sustained rapid economic growth opportunity. prior generations faced hardships. sounds ageist, I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm trying be. Agreed True. People often talk current measures various degrees lockdowns return normal life majority population vaccinated, intermediate reduction restrictions number hospitalizations deaths drops important fatigue continues increase. state, highest districts like 40k starting tiny raises. personally planning teaching abroad. Que ACDC Money Talks. Today I'm thankful majority company's communication goes email. course can, get spat, punched on. retailer seriously sucks right last week, staffing firms offering 8.3-8.7k/week contract work ND, including accommodations.

For who're willing make switch transplant Covid ground zero, possible, ultimately decided worth risk us personally irrespective numbers. said, wish made half weekly amount entire month, 2 rounds pay cuts 1 round furloughs now, knows we'll chopping block.

Ouch. condolences. liability fall employer. work-related injury anyone working public. Healthcare otherwise, especially since general population (in US) like 50/50 adherence masking. I'm totally serious, whether insurance companies pay benefits irrelevant matter. Someone held responsible. 

I know I'm screaming void (not really either), awful situation everyone backed - especially PTO situation. hospital pushing tests either, exposure even ED. 

I feel like finally reached level pure disgust, see Bernie Sanders screaming time.  doctor I've placed comment adjacent mentions immune response bit. 5 August 1976, Eric Clapton provoked uproar lingering controversy spoke increasing immigration concert Birmingham. Visibly intoxicated, Clapton voiced support controversial [Rivers Blood] speech , announced stage Britain danger becoming ‚Äúblack colony‚Äù. Among things, Clapton said ‚ÄúKeep Britain white!‚Äù time National Front (NF) slogan. Oh totally agree‚Äîthis pretty egregious behavior Publix. Unfortunately though, bad behavior relates primarily duty breach components negligence claim. Stories like really highlight US/English common law system becoming outdated areas like workplace negligence. Bit Pandora's Box  Sadly case all.

Source: physician regular contact suspected known positive patients also forget switch accounts lol. dexamethasone, seemingly made manic.

Supposedly asked hydroxychloroquine give lol. dig attitude. parents, grandparents, siblings left watching distant family longer get together since older relatives passed know important family making effort get actual day safely still make sure importance meaning holiday celebrated safe time awesome Yeah point. get things can't come grinding hault especially since like heat cold months. (But refuse buy Amazon thats whole nother soap box) think there's got middle gray area numbers raging high. People hospitals ready quit wondering much can't take this. Personally, think paid whatever minimum wage state is, they're looking make fighting constituents. think anyone paid 150k+ going want pass legislature eventually cause lose money.

I also think hold public office, either surrender assets, (you live wage above) finances open book, go store buy water, kept record anyone look up. think help keep honest anyone suddenly living outside means would easy notice question. might disagree either invasion privacy ect think many people go politics make money help people, maybe would less people holding public office, know almost sure they're become rich.

That said, think incentivize ""good"" people office? seem good idea work removing potential sources corruption good provided solutions asking mine. Please point misinformation post cite evidence. think difference opinion Yeah opening expected, guess even Taoiseach enough making plenty money medical field. goes CEOs , corporate executives management. make 30 hour CEO makes 10,000 hour company billion dollar entity spend money upper salaries threatens us pay cuts. Don‚Äôt get twisted. ceo isn‚Äôt 300x am. Doctors already said vaccines create immune response may cause mild COVID symptoms normally go away 1-2 days. impossible get symptoms people know possible okay. people verify employer/school received COVID vaccine? vaccine return normalcy, feel illegitimate request employees/students vaccinated. way validate individual received vaccine? Gotta love USA. That's really admirable, I've wondered times. Good luck guess Yeah blame conservatives it‚Äôs nation wide 50 states. Even liberal left wing areas effected. touched hands glass haha

It‚Äôs temporary. Sad would long term health problems covid. Shutup Hell I‚Äôm pediatrician working hospital expected come work mask test positive covid asymptomatic. girlfriend work different hospitals large Canadian city. feel safe work environments, weird? testing new staff though patients. That‚Äôs be, beyond unfortunately hospital staff going go work unless sick. That‚Äôs sadly, hospitals can‚Äôt afford put staff quarantine 7-14 days. Anyways, economy collapses health care work that‚Äôs left slim pickings. also relatives one minute sound serious careful days later driving car mask less another family member outside house exposed daily. ü§îü§îü§î another family member come mealü§îü§î thinks ok awhile‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ÅâÔ∏è Whoever's playing round Plague Inc great time random mutations. initial policy you‚Äôre positive asymptomatic come work, you‚Äôre negative obviously work, symptoms even negative, stay home. 

Which like 5 employees sick. One asymptomatic Covid Mary. Ugh. actually answer question. recordable prove caught work, which, everywhere, one staying home, kids school, on, actually hard pin directly work. still cases count towards recordable. year next year, recordables due Covid caveat likely hard pin down. Unless hospital negligent, probably repercussions.

I'm civil engineer oversees teams field need know OSHA, father vice president human resources hospital. asked question weeks ago curious working out. They've recordables, really hard pin right now. testing program staff. Covid-19 testing FREE!

They sign test like rest us get one cost.  perfectly healthy 19/yo daughter difficulty breathing one night, thought severe panic attack anxiety disorder. boyfriend took ER determined blood clots lungs. ran blood test told ""virus unknown origin"". 

That October 2019, since I've wondered COVID around US longer we've officially known about.  hearing friend‚Äôs mom vaccines way two weeks hospital Texas, debating front line healthcare workers deserve first receive vaccinations. seeing article... foolish think reasonable. Also, daycare first open kids Frontline workers. things! Ah, yeah makes sense. thinking steroid inhaler like people use asthma. Definitely good idea self medicate antibiotic! Hopefully whatever issue resolve soon get back normal life. numbers still benign, pos rate pretty bad

Well get worse winter long.

It's good world imploded yet, means they'll better off. worst yet come. respons hostility superiority.

I wear masks, advocate trying dwindle things one question back people corners conduct conversation civil person. I‚Äôm US people literally killed working trying enforce state mandated rules. security guard dollar store shot back head telling someone wear mask. panic attacks times shake enforce rule work. entirety ND bar. comparing flu coronavirus coronavirus subreddit?  bring Governor Texas he's unfortunately *my* governor.

I may said before, problem lock one area, another right next it. People leave lockdown area go open area, we're stupid hate told things.

San Antonio closed tourist spots, Corpus Christi opened theirs, leading people driving hours ""just see beach"", despite everyone /r/corpus telling people stay home.

What governor president do? encourage people start travelling gathering.

As case death rates, think agree high everywhere. US. Almost every state failings local state level make shitshow.

But **worst** rates? Mostly Midwest (Montana, North South Dakota, Wyoming, Utah, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, New Mexico new case rates 100 per 100,000)

Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio likely getting bump two reasons.

1. Close proximity extreme hot zones (El Paso, TX, geographically tied New Mexico rest Texas, similar record surge)

2. Election lead massive crowd gatherings late October early November, especially key states like Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan. Even Biden's rallies perfect, tried separate people encouraged masks. Trump gathered many people could close together possible, told people bother masks.

Unfortunately, Election happening year, hell high water, going see latest surge. one state problem... Hawaii. Why? idiots California can't get car drive there. go in.  Matches closely election results. You‚Äôre welcome didnt think safe would give large amount soldiers? Bless take...

Everyone needs realize media‚Äôs job report news. job drive eyeballs traffic sell ad space. 

Both sides sensationalized COVID extreme. left, need lock states down, cancel Holiday time family, leave house unless critical. 

On right, 99.6% survivability, vast majority 70 health conditions, pissed rights tested. (Masks, lock downs, social distancing, etc...)

This article small look that. One persons tweets patients dying still denial... yet dig deeper patients died hospital person works coworkers experience. 

I‚Äôm saying lied, I‚Äôm saying media &amp; politicians, sides, significantly enhance story omit pieces information benefit themselves. 

‚ÄúLittle effort made assess scope problem Doering memorably described.‚Äù ...and wondering one strict counties US large amount cases.

The average person *only* person making decisions. average person *says* ""Oh yes, questioned value HCW athletes, course, I'm bad person!"" mean actually do. athlete actor dies, makes national news automatically people never met grieve weeks even months. nurse dies, 99.999% time makes local obituary go that.

It's getting discouraging goal posts shifted many times, know listen anymore accurate timelines, etc. anyone insight decision would come weeks after? Also, flu appears clotting secondary risk caused immobilization factors including underlying health issues. Covid appears primary cause clotting infected individuals. Simple answer, no.

There quite difference immune response invoked infection vaccination, well invoked. 

If anything like reason possible would probably caught initial safety trials, then, definitely phase III. disagree you, think people lose sight fact LOT teachers, lot kids.

FL pays professions pathetically.

Would like live parts FL, doesn‚Äôt pay nearly enough. find easy. Lose 90 year old. life. If, like someone said, cancer gives young woman 50% chance survival, worth miserable years medical teams scientific medical knowledge wrings, wet towel, years someone.

Economically: last year someone's life elderly costs much previous 5 years. 

Some elderly younger 90 beg allowed die. Die beg let go. seen all, tired, society deny death. rather suffer, kept alive situations beyond empathy. 

Let old people die! humane. Anyone infected Covid second thoughts. going get bad.

In dream world idiots believe hoax wearing masks inconvenient could placed registry show could punted right door.

Allow fantasies. one shows wearing mask people smiling, yet watches faces fall show Medicaid card. True, look data, higher covid rates heavily populated towns cities. Sure, it‚Äôs hard, still it‚Äôs 2020. That's actually excellent way put it. ""Everyone's hero story life"" that. 

Usually plays people thinking Good objectively would fall Neutral category. would also take true many people think ""Because I'm hero, plot armor (or divine protection) keep safe""

*But quarter-million Americans who've died pandemic?*

""Too bad them. **this me** we're talking -- there's way could die thing wind another faceless statistic like them""

Was wrong mislead public order get PPE urgent personnels? Yes, could worded statement better.

The psychological warfare time major root cause this. guess yes. multiple excuses, sick leave US, people debts, asshole bosses...

NONE applies free day. Whatever happens consequence Thanksgiving solidly solely responsibility general population. Meanwhile, essential workers rolling eyes world clutching pearls. I‚Äôve worked entire pandemic. Wear mask, wash hands, etc. pretty great. intentionally left lovely Mrs. kids seem grumpy. great Thanksgiving family whole taking pandemic seriously. rest life without doubt continue wear mask teach kids thing becomes normal us flu season. still need get flu shot though. mean like 25% sure zombie mink based headline. seem right think would super surprised.

Yeah need go hospital know that‚Äôs people. goal business resiliency instead endless growth? Perhaps what‚Äôs considered ‚Äústandard‚Äù comes business actually society fucked up? would appear one Nordic country bad central Europe. don‚Äôt think so

Sadly COVID-19 measures mostly suggestions here. real leverage state businesses alcohol permits.  Video games help, lol. Lovell Hmm hard tell means though since many people trying get tests right taking flight meeting people Thanksgiving would watch trends today going forward see actual impact infections. worry herpes before? Covid contagious I‚Äôm afraid getting obese risk. Doesnt just! I'm still waiting Malaysian food take west become ""trendy"" much hate that, get without needing fly back There's place US control. Well won't, *I* hit bong.

Wait what. number times I've tell family / friends:

Gotta get job Wackdonalds man. Stop trying coin phrase ""streets ahead."" Active cases coming down, well done Msia! Yeah I'd watch another million die thousands small businesses could come back getting decimated government international companies. dont realize weve really lost, you? hundred thousand people dead nothing damage lockdowns caused. Scary headline get clicks Sucks suck  May?  lie PPE. We're reusing N95s wearing washable gowns. used disposable 1 time use N95 masks disposable gowns.

Wait America get wants countries refuse us. see true American colors Two weeks restrictions surprise dad tells every time leave house put mask. soon neighbor, carpenter, guy comes house measure shit, ok wear mask full blown conversations them. brother fiancee drove Florida visit family, drove states. got tested beforehand came negative, still feel incredibly unnecessary risk. Meanwhile little household three made tiny turkey great time, knowing we're putting anyone risk. Nature always wins.  Oh fucking god that's I've talking whole damn time, think makes economy go? Fairy dust faith? care people, money grubbing companies.

Money grubbing companies? mean many thousands livelihoods small businesses got fuckig DECIMATED wont comeback paranoid fears? continuing shit reason biggest wealth transfer to, guess who? MONEY GRUBBING COMPANIES! BILLIONAIRES! weak die, that's reality, empathy wont change that. dont give shit people, care yourself. dont care many people end lives go hungry lose everything they've ever worked this, busy virtue signaling ""i CaRe pEoPlE"". least I'm fucking honest dont care people die let rest us live. Pathetic. really need stop eating politics burrito go live life. That's quotes. HUNDRED THOUSAND dying go Walmart Chucky Cheeses without mask. üòÇ laughing stock country Good god, want job. Also, risk spreading virus around more? know got them..?

Am teasing, Cornwall protective 'branding' semi regular news item here.

Just one example earlier year: also: cream tea (Cornish Vs Devonshire) see lot articles calling Americans stupid, reckless, forth, true comes handled COVID compared countries. think something going holier-than-thou types don‚Äôt bit empathy understand.

My federal government basically abandoned us. stimulus checks, support, eviction moratorium coming end, vaccines still several months away. new restrictions put place businesses barely survived past several months. support, ‚ÄúClose figure out‚Äù, least state. mutual respect situation government people. shut alter life, help make sure housing food. didn‚Äôt happen. government think people gonna situation? Keep pretending everything okay? No, people gonna rebel. They‚Äôre gonna want clearly people running country (the US) aren‚Äôt coming aid.

As personal anecdote, one great aunts 80. done NOTHING since March- go out, barely food shops, etc. lives alone past months extremely hard her. Aside socially distant visits, hasn‚Äôt seen children six feet away without mask months, let alone given hug. family Thanksgiving literally couldn‚Äôt take isolation anymore wanted everyone one favorite holidays? reckless? Yes. understand? Yes, do. emotional time year hellscape known 2020. hope types got work home without lives altered many ways think emotional damage done population since March elected say? know ton Europeans went traveling internationally last several months. It‚Äôs bit rich act like Americans uniquely bad.

There mass lockdown protests Italy Germany. media doesn‚Äôt cover it. managerial, administration business owner class want employees know cause staffing issue. don‚Äôt think ‚Äúsociety‚Äù problem. average person isn‚Äôt making decisions. It‚Äôs people charge. Aka people money. people prioritizing profits health. average person, asked, would say course healthcare workers tested athletes. It‚Äôs sad truth; Americans focused rather others. (Yes, American, I‚Äôm idiot. I‚Äôve seen covid take lives many point I‚Äôve even depressed usually am

Please. plead us: wear mask, safe don‚Äôt travel. That‚Äôs internet technology for: socializing ‚ÄúThe COVID hospital‚Äù sounds fake fuck It‚Äôs really empathy education. psychological bias action. virus obscure threat that‚Äôs hard understand it‚Äôs affecting personally. People naturally optimism / confirmation bias. believe nothing really bad happen them. something read news, something doesn‚Äôt happen people know. It‚Äôs hard grasp danger it‚Äôs already late. That‚Äôs large swaths country thought fake. It‚Äôs people continuously thought would weeks-months. It‚Äôs continue make mistakes over, including people like Fauci point really aren‚Äôt much help. lost public perception battle virus didn‚Äôt address natural biases. People dying result. sub plenty examples biases action.

That‚Äôs I‚Äôm confident last longer anyone thinks. Look hyped people bunch vaccines literally published data. experienced scientist tell ever make conclusions without seeing full data set. are, setting disappointment major fatalities result misunderstanding public. ‚ÄúExpect worst hope best‚Äù except none first part. American.... 


""That Mexican stole job!"" -- American CEOs hand jobs foreigners willing accept lower pay. it‚Äôs written solely Americans perhaps isn‚Äôt correct sub it. Maybe go /America something. rest us don‚Äôt really care lol That's like unprotected sex someone like trust get pregnant sick. didn‚Äôt say misleading link, said misleading link TITLE. wrote, article itself.

Your reading comprehension terrible. can‚Äôt understand wasting time trying explain data you. vaccinate poorer countries, everywhere. Also manufacturer allowed make profit pandemic considered independent panel. never said hated them, they're general selfish, idiotic, ass holes, that's facts. first paragraph actually supports said, thanks :) visit clients homes job, quite old, sooo often like, ""Oh, take mask off"". 

I always decline politely, want like...""You're really okay that? came public transit, many disgusting people wear masks, even try avoid them."" 

Like seriously? idea tf I've been. I'm safety, order help you, around strangers packed metal tube underground. sent family articles CDC guidelines day Halloween, suggested thanksgiving separate households year, texted siblings individually asked said don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs safe mini thanksgivings home. 

Every response got said either, ‚Äúwe fine outside‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine don‚Äôt come, (sibling) probably bringing whole family (kids back school) mom‚Äôs (immune compromised, heart condition). 

I gave in, said don‚Äôt go don‚Äôt speak up, they‚Äôre going fall back normal thanksgiving easier. went, 4 households backyard, tables spread 10 ft apart, households sitting together. us masked soon meal done, event finished within 2 hours. Even wasn‚Äôt distanced needed be, people didn‚Äôt everything right, mom took much work desperately called others come help early (extended exposure time considerable least 3 us). go perfectly. everyone wore masks whole time, I‚Äôm certain would worse intervened 3 weeks ahead set ground rules. I‚Äôm sure social distancing would adhered attended. secret, none I'm talking ""secret"" studies, evidence. gets swept rug media paid off, already know *that* hope you.

I'll lend ear anything, preconceived idea lengths people go order get proverbial ""top"".

Anyway, real. Peace love. mean, certainly people trust safety others regarding pandemic, but, much like STI prevention, they're people randomly encourage lower caution around (or want raw dog first date). fair game one Heathrow asks clucking coming luggage. I‚Äôm ICU nurse that‚Äôs worked heavily Covid. Although aren‚Äôt page values, etc., yet meet one stupid deny wearing masks. intensivist die area Covid caught October. know real shit nurse denying it, isn‚Äôt living reality aren‚Äôt really working ICU. Maybe read article first passing ""expert"" opinion? Heart disease leading cause death women United States, killing 299,578 women 2017‚Äîor 1 every 5 female deaths. Expendable Nothing changed family, I‚Äôm letting hitler mean stupid governor tell conduct personal life. Invited everyone merrier. quarantine nonsense unAmerican Educate yourself.

Point constitution says limiting public gatherings violation constitutional rights.

I'm sure also cheering cops beating BLM protestors blatant violation constitutional rights, specifically 1st amendment, unlike crying about. say right wing fucks use bullshit argument justify massive loss American life. Sadly , right. course world look disbelief. much turkey one country eat? cells produce antibodies Hi, fellow Mainer! husband live parents, saw family Zoom. one spent Thanksgiving people we‚Äôve living house three years.

Meanwhile, someone know pack elderly mom move sibling‚Äôs kids coming home college Thanksgiving. :/

High five us safety, disparity perception reality continues confuse me. work healthcare believe covid two months ago. Anosmia symptoms. I, thankfully, noticed already break built schedule self quarantined. didnt get tested hospital using 5 different covid tests know issues reagents. would affected behavior didnt want use test. crazy still many issues testing yet entertainment valued frontline workers. say üòí like sports testing provided aggregate number, compared individual experience one nurse. mother law nurse nursing home get tested twice per week. probably tested times NFL quarterbacks. I‚Äôm sure plenty shithole hospital networks around country don‚Äôt give crap nurses, collectively wouldn‚Äôt surprised millions tests conducted nurses whole. Well CDC's estimate actual number cases anywhere 4 8 times higher number confirmed cases, would certainly way getting close herd immunity. numbers beginning fall there, we'll see Thanksgiving causes another surge numbers stay falling That's great, found drug works!

Too bad trial people got placebod died. Bad luck get placebo trial. can't afford anymore. many nurses walking job. half people aren‚Äôt wearing masks, sounds like terrible place be. dad got goes local grocery store. lives it‚Äôs 50/50 people wearing mask all, 50% aren‚Äôt wearing one aren‚Äôt wearing nose. said even workers don‚Äôt wear wear right. month. Yes, new mask/gloves/gown PER ENTRANCE ROOM.
We‚Äôre now. **Please note: questions answered here. Please use thread /r/IAmA.** hope realize ""Not Bee"" offshoot humor based news outlet made people Babylon Bee. Also, clear conservative bias.

So, I'd consider anything post evidence anything.

Going onto content, possible study got posted authorized vetted editorial team Johns Hopkins, that's deleted it. Tell Vietnam lol SARS quite genetic similar SARS CoV 2, much easier contain less transmissible, people caught SARS became [infectious symptoms start making easy spot isolate, sometimes infected sick carry routine, minimizing spread.

However, current virus totally different beast together, longer varied incubation period, spread via [asymptomatic much [more contagious original SARS Making harder contain control.

I think scientist article trying convey since COVID 19 already widespread, unless vaccine whole world (very unlikely), become seasonal disease.

Many past pandemics like 1918 flu, 2009 swine flu cholera ended way. Even today, still get flare ups plague 

The pandemic causing disease manage eradicate world smallpoxs, took decades work resolved. Fourth July, Good. Fuck Florida Technically yes though it‚Äôs clear sick would get Damn boring friends document progress. 

Create set questions evaluate stance certain things ask questions see answers change time. maintain eating, wise person? stupid enough donate pto she?

That's literally giving money back employer, helping another employee. friend coaches cross country small school getting tested weekly, athletes twice weekly. RN SNF tested weekly biweekly since shutdown. We're still waiting bulls roll since everyone still bickering foot bill. FOOH Likely see long time, almost feels like response like 13-year-old boy fumbling bra first time. Beat still get tested though. Fuck guys. nurses sound like bugchasers.  One way I'd look is, $3.7M teachers US. average salary 60K, that's $222B (Billion) dollars spend teacher salaries. 

There 480 players NBA. average salary $7.7M, pay NBA players $3.7B every year. 

Do need teachers? Probably. pay teachers more? think so. think misleading say value teachers less NBA players. Right, apparently whole thing employee going really hard time needing time off. I‚Äôm like, they‚Äôre charge, help without ‚Äúdonations‚Äù employees‚Äô benefits. Made angry her! necessarily. wouldn‚Äôt get once. 

Plus, it‚Äôs missing work. job pay time now, even known contact, test positive. It‚Äôs rampant community, there‚Äôs way tell infected community, work. Workman‚Äôs Comp denied, people forced use PTO. accrue paid time off, like per diem employees, go unpaid. 

An athlete gets check matter what, think that‚Äôs worst this. caused decline two weeks ago? Follow-uo questions: live one lung, PE kill compromises performance one lung? someone dying PE can't remove lung able get ECMO clot resolved? Videos look them, they‚Äôre gaining traction. Seems pretty clear pass laws limit freedom ""the common interest"" based wording symptomatic still working

We've since March. YES!! know why: hospitals tested us, they‚Äôd let us work we‚Äôre positive. can‚Äôt afford lose much staff...

So way, worries. nurses work retarded never allowed become nurses. Even getting inevitable, inoculation size massively reduced wearing mask, inoculation size related illness severity.

Honestly, fucking shameful stupid nurses allowed be. delete cookies. WaPo strong paywall Hope great Thanksgiving! people ND prefer govt hands possible many ways, case got voted many probably still happy it, unfortuntately mean i'd say priority issue capitalism one live life past 10 months? knew extremely fucked Saturday started seeing Instagram stories 15-person ‚ÄúFriendsgivings‚Äù. Bless heart. thank sacrifice saint continue put abuse. life got cut short üôÅ remember around march/april, hospitals forbidding nurses wearing PPE. valid concerns, especially vaccines politicized.

[COVID-19 vaccines poised launch, impact pandemic can‚Äôt run two-year stability study six months ‚Äî that‚Äôs reality situation. talked dad last night. Told brother decided would best meet up. dad said young healthy stop wimps. I'm even healthy, go guess.

Although note dad horrible person brags spending time beach Miami pandemic. lives georgia. Yea man. small country took first place comes infected per capita, weeks ago. Never thought would first place anything doesnt involve snow Yeah, wear mask time, try think everything touch. Gas station pumps, buttons, door handles, etc. stay hotel, pay extra bucks good one feel confident cleaned, ask room occupied night prior. That's 2 Dakotas. Breads Circuses. It‚Äôs Breads Circuses. essential? basketball player, Wal-Mart cashier? 3 months

The rest life

If get covid, really might picture. thing single strand RNA viruses encoding error happen time part chain take brunt death count every illness get tested would let hospital. nurses fine. Right?! government. Thats why. quite frankly, blame sides. remind stastic massive death winter drug Honest question, know isn‚Äôt misinformation? actually think Covid HUGE DEAL information read sources trust, Democracy NOW! Canada. start patient getting nebs (we almost never give nebs... lot wrong infection control perspective) patient later tested positive. told watch symptoms. months later developed symptoms, swabbed negative, back work day (despite still sick). get antibody testing I'm participant research project otherwise I'd pay (I probably pay outside project low case count here). 

I say I'm necessarily upset this. However show a) physician nursing staffing margins razor thin b) decisions testing nothing wellbeing c) often work sick d) get horribly sick COVID expect exactly nothing hospital government financial support. Thank god disability insurance guess. shitty boss. That's American culture nut shell. LA lockdown year case numbers still terrible 'cold' novel.. check southern hemisphere data July. That‚Äôs society defines importance much money makes. Yay capitalism! CyberPunk help. Hopefully lasts winter. Tells priorities belong. circus must go on.  Bc it‚Äôs money folks. Always sadly always will. Capitalism!!! vaccine around corner... ""everyone going get it"" would reasonable answer. 

But is, isn't.

&amp;#x200B;

We literally need hold months order avoid massive massive death destruction fabric society. I‚Äôve never taken vitamins also barely sick years. Regular exercise also wonders. hard pack sandwich? 1 1,200 now. Early next year number 1 600. it‚Äôs over?  can‚Äôt compare event already done event aren‚Äôt even half way yet. Hopefully vaccine stop 1 600 number. doesn‚Äôt even consider happens hospital systems collapse several locations given Thanksgiving, Christmas New Years still go, lot runway deaths next months. /r/insaneparents googled yet find article saying anything work Healthcare WA. We're getting ready vaccine front line workers possibly Dec. think makes fine? results take least day could grt exposed timeframe, fall contagious period positive takes least 3 days exposed show positice, test could come back false negative. 

in words fine. still exposed regardless think youre fine. Honestly even care Covid probably running rampant country? Water wet True! Take test you‚Äôre worried. doesn‚Äôt work stupid spend time family Thanksgiving, ignoring virus 99% survival rate people 80. Yet stupid see fiancee glass door holiday. total freedom act crazy, prevent people living normal lives. ""return monke"" homeless population San Diego getting tested frequently hospital workers well. Wealthy/celebrity? get tests. Poor? Government provides test. Middle class essential worker, sorry... Think fine times. Well, going like Biden presidency liked Trump, far that's concerned. becomes employers liability work comp issue though. insurance companies going pay unless state requires so. wages shit compared work done vast majority healthcare fields, there‚Äôs artificial cap production nurses designed boost wages. There's nationalism (localism?) lilt it. People area board 'hoax' train threatening freedoms. cancelled several major events bring lot commerce area garnered support imagined, mostly people want exposure densely populated areas brought small town. Whatever works, necessarily wrong even though virus come neighbors well. pleasantly surprised see driveways packed cars yesterday opposed previous years. Either everyone around gathered somewhere else, people really take recommendations reduce spread seriously. rocket man needs lose weight. bet ultra high risk group chance survival even best medicine Covid finds him. !remindme 2 weeks You‚Äôre allowed get tested want. employer pays symptoms personal problem. transportation hospital, much cough upset stomach, they'll us tested. want us out, we're also short staffed right now.

But test positive, either use vacation sick time, go without pay. I'm willing it, gonna fucking suck. close family mean nepotism. I‚Äôll take ‚Äúideas could never possibly work‚Äù $500 Alex aggregate, certainly. there's supply/demand issue. 4,000,000 teachers country 3,000,000 nurses. comparison, fewer 20,000 professional athletes. vast majority minor-leaguers make pennies; average salary athlete less $100K/year. referring anything Borderlands 3 boss I'll pass. referring Borderlands 3 boss, killer.

Thanks sharing that, makes feel better, daughter must feel awful  recently hospital eating wrong bag mushrooms kitchen (making sandwich forgot bag magic shrooms back *someone* put next food shrooms) heard 2 nurses talking they'll never get new vaccine ""you can't trust *new* vaccines anything!!"" Oh I'm saying good, I'm saying happening. Probably colchicine Right?! doesn‚Äôt even say tried get tested couldn‚Äôt, hadn‚Äôt given one employer

Tests available hasn‚Äôt really thing like 6 months Nurses create lot inherent value society. Sports replaced form entertainment. principle public school impossibly difficult stressful job. 100k nowhere near enough money home filled children need borrow one. 

Your assessment spot on. ridiculous advice. worse buying groceries?

pumping gas alone paying pump exactly high risk. sense moisture comes okay healthcare setting? Mine goes right mouth open air filtration etc. I‚Äôve seen similar masks w outlet valve get banned airplanes places, might work. love mine woodworking dust mgmt. Covid Icu nurse . Never tested latter. exposed they're laid told everyone stay home earlier avoid catching COVID outdoors dust Gobi desert. Anyone leaving house wear mask protect virus-laden sand coming 1,000 miles fishermen salt workers stay home seems like same. quit bedside care work m-f office (its still RN position). 

I COVID time take, even though still wanted work home, wasnt pulled sick days.

Hospitals LTC facilities dont care you. paid 1k year union dues didnt shit. Taking job pay cut sense Im salaried/no OT. Buuutttt quality life much better Im happier person. It‚Äôs proverbial invisible hand free market economy. Clapton gone even estimation that‚Äôs even possible point Countries Europe going focused going EU, happens far away United Sates. random country Africa, Asia, Middle East, etc., would even less interested America. foreigners care probably Canadians Mexicans since want spillover effects countries. make less ludacris need prioritize next election cycle then. Frontline workers deserve compensation healthcare subsidised government bc reason country still running point, Cyberpunk wont ever come out, social experiment see long people wait still excited. estimate heard vaccination would show effect next **1621:** ""As Americans prepare gather Thanksgiving, world watches dread disbelief"" culled? work massive hospital major metropolitan area. Nobody know tested. angry. People telling us things can't do. presumptuous. ""Weak student"" designation lazy.

It's business. work voluntary. way anyone really care? low level inmates provided PPE pay job. Good making something working. Hopefully whatever mistakes made land jail past helps find work they‚Äôre set free. Stupid assholes huge fenced backyard one back there. 10+ people inside beautiful day. 

Oh went outside front smoke shoot bottle rocket went right roof.

I mean can't people look say ""wow we're overweight mountain dew chugging cigarettes smoking yokals fly blue line flags pick-ups maybe we're baddies""? huge football fan. I've lost voice many times cheering yelling. Cooked meals made events around weekend games. Pros college. watched one single game year. gross me. kids going school 2 days week. hours got cut work business slow. games practices gatherings ignore everything else bothers me. chose watch. know matter anyone else watch affect anyone. me, peace mind, care football right pay athletes doctors firemen emergency personell, really surprising? Wow, needed reason avoid place Nba Hell know. None complicated, people act like rocket surgery. honestly think failing human mind. We're watching world crack fear threat can't see understand causing behave irrationally. really. Several models would concur. aunt finishing RN like 2 weeks, works facility they‚Äôve outbreak covid, pt‚Äôs staff alike. text conversation went covid created lab china, saying PPE doesn‚Äôt work all, quarantine protocols aren‚Äôt working, somehow brought back around somehow Obama‚Äôs fault. there‚Äôs whole reality bit right there. also planned big thanksgiving thing, NYE thing. Back like April, explain respritory viruses get passed, masks work (information explained MD friend), told take microbiology class she‚Äôd listen me. People like exist, refuse listen anything doesn‚Äôt align beliefs. mean friend speech therapist covid ward refuse ever test her. There‚Äôs another anecdote ya good point. Mildly related idea learning shared historical cultural experiences: family fled governmental persecution refugees country, traveling radar hoping someone would take whatever meager belongings could bring. denied US accepted Canada successfully put roots service workers, business owners, professionals. They, refugees worked experience, live little differently freer belongings-based anxiety opulence become accustomed large homes uncomfortably packed perceivably important things. try pare belongings thinking convenience vs would run back fire salvage, cousins ran country leaving behind much order save lives. impact histories definitely shape experience space. Many states mandated testing nursing homes, that‚Äôs reason get tested. wife works nursing home gets tested weekly, work hospital tested once. bread circuses Oh absolutely know, mother control freak! love one side nothing massive almost never ending stretch civilization feels big understand people would never leave america. measuring hamburgers per freedoms. used ft ""stay 6 feet away"" social distance. would anyone share vaccine anyone? wrong us. share data? needs stolen hacked? remember too. Incredibly frustrating There's enough ICU nurses go around everybody vent. says sports leagues better administration healthcare system. One responsible other. Hell, afford both. disaster making many ways.

We've known years, decades, we've running hospitals skeleton crews rely people working 80 hour weeks. knew sufficiently large crisis could break health system. single person team unexpectedly puts 80 hours worth work remaining team. member exponentially likely burn get sick they're overworked, increasingly diminishing pool available staff.

And worst part? takes least 4 years change training propogate impact staff force. could double medical schools (and residency spots them) night extra doctors four years. attendings longer. Previously US relied able always pull foreign workers needed, picking whoever wanted, global crisis model suddenly flounders.

We've numbers whole time nothing done despite repeated concerns raised public health specialists, epidemiologists, pretty much anyone bit math. failure could've mitigated cost would've al working hours medical staff appropriate staffing levels rely betting one gets sick hospital. list disappointments related pandemic continues grow. OP yeah dude sucks Russias using two adenoviruses help avoid resistance. probably vaccine higher efficacy Oxford's. Yes! That‚Äôs great news even take couple months (or less) immunity. It‚Äôs huge progress. sound kind angry. hope find peace harmony this. I‚Äôve heard South Dakota offering travelers 7500 week.. diagnosed large DVT 11/10. risk factors. active. went ER thought torn calf muscle tendon. Eliquis least 3 months. dealing anxiety possible PE's 

All told I've clot ""for while"" Covid months ago. anyone perfect situations like bit fuck lead outbreak lockdown. Federal Government offered Defence Force guards hotel quarantine states used Andrews opted untrained subcontractor security guards. guards sex patients quarantine otherwise didn‚Äôt follow safety guidelines. lead huge outbreak surprisingly one Andrew‚Äôs state government say who‚Äôs responsible hiring guards. It‚Äôs covering fuckup almost worse fuckup itself. ""hardship""

It's even hardship. Wearing mask public barely inconvenience. forget free room board! Headline says state law I'm sure athletes vilified this. tests free leverage make employers pay keep safe. That's bad thing. 

If remember correctly, NFL trying keep testing like week rather twice something like save 15k month costs budge get season started. okay? seems pretty wordly phrased context then. even though biden taken job power anything regard situation... already saying nominated someone else hopes would election somehow guaranteed solve it.

haha okay! hot take! agree also we‚Äôre running low nurses is. We‚Äôre seeing/going see decline quality care unless something drastic changes fair, Founding Fathers give everyone right vote. beginning, males 25 owned land. Everything else came later. They'd heart attack saw hoi polloi voting power property owners.

Ohhhh see. use exact graphics nbc owned &amp; operated, I‚Äôve never seen Sinclair before! Deceptive :/ 56% morning - experts already stated community vaccination rates would need far hight take COVID. Im telling - ignore concerns peril. Nope Lol alright little buddy. exposed, stayed home 3 weeks. symptoms. I‚Äôm problem. myself, world shouldn‚Äôt shut down. harm good. common sense, live life. Take care. Yeah like sure hospitals testing people. nothing athletes tested  course, North Korea also execute failing show enough enthusiasm saluting portrait Dear Leader. think getting free test?  get it, MIL FIL flew plane Texas visit 90 year old parents. wear masks forced think overblown. infuriating. 

HOWEVER know lots people socially isolated wearing masks working home chose see family taking similar measures think that's worst thing  *This America* Exactly this. took someone actually getting realize getting together. Honestly even know Uncle survive this. scary. already health issues obese. heard he's got bad. Hopefully take dying understand. Hope family alright. healthcare worker stay home test positive use personal leave it? covered sick pay? worries, wrote mask quarantine, never safe. People HK agree you. left?  stopping getting one yourself? curious periodically serology combined death numbers estimate IFR. Nothing's even close value.

That's great.

Can provide link one studies, please? I'm genuinely curious see it. Except influence everywhere, ranking social metrics, matter citizens foreigners - despite dropping last decades erase position decades that. military might alone puts us top literally every country regard. 

I mean get saying, kind weak gotcha imo. hard understand people still pay attention America. company it. I've potential COVID exposure. use PTO else able pay bills. But...wasnt right tho? Majority people wearing correctly, actually increasing risk catching virus also increasing spread always touch mask washing hands touching doors, food whatever. Couple weeks ago watched news France even police wearing wrong. f***kd.. 

One thing understand giving free masks everyone.. live price increased 10x ~February..now ""only"" 7x used cost..guess important someone earning good money protecting people.. reason I'm glad never got suckered fan/gained interest sports teams organizations. Nurses/Doctors organize strike. Average people organize boycott sports organizations. probably they're bored. I've fight urge go grocery shopping every day like used to. There's much Netflix/Puzzles/Books read become bored skull. Obviously, given in, I'm sure there's plenty people going ""Juuuust little trip Target/Kohl's/Best Buy... chances?"". *Insert sigh here* It‚Äôs perfectly reasonable wiling sacrifice freedom also said least could do.  government pay people stay home quarantine? wonder keeps spreading like crazy Yeah, important remember Clapton extremely racist fairly reactionary throughout career, smoked weed played guitar great hippies loved him. Spending weekend Sydney boyfriend seen almost six months. Feels good man. Dude shareholders? heartless. /s  PCR test much reliable. Welcome America, even homeless tent cities fly American flags. person wrote load crap ""sense purpose"" things *more* things take care helpful knows absolutely jack shit depression. like actively chose wrong, done much better this! shut alcohol purchases? Bars obviously problem comes spread. Sure, Europe ""the rest world"" either. get tested outside work. wife went cvs results came back positive showed HR. got 2 week paid covid sick leave. That‚Äôs available awhile. stop returning.

No, can't.

The government can't prevent Canadian citizen entering Canada.

It's part something called Constitution. *Ron Swanson entered chat* case need go back normal let run course learn live die it. can't live forever. lightbulb on!

Now light, imagine getting car accident seen anyone every resource used COVID. people saying mistake arent?

Whatever well vaccine works, isnt inspire confidence. wife nurse places around least put front line prioritize getting test results back. took like day think. got tested took like four. ever said would 2 weeks March. said people stayed home kept social distance, could flatten curve spread overwhelm medical system.

And everywhere around world that, cases/complications/deaths extremely low. Pizza party! think doctors make cost money then? whole healthcare infrastructure based around value generated care provided nurses doctors. 

I‚Äôm shitting point, also think doctors actual money makers ‚Äòcure‚Äô you. Nurses essentially ‚Äòhands‚Äô doctors though modern medicine. Yes $$$$. Trust pulling (or potential pull down) 7, 8 figures company would flying around country too, covid damned. Purposely gonna read assume said Think good shit silver linings,like least you‚Äôre still alive, lots weed Xans. Many heart procedures elective. Others delayed. Standalone, privately held surgicenters often Yeah company shit. don‚Äôt use automatically donate charity PTO bank cut check. family still mourning loss sister due hospital incompetence OU. bit difficult enjoy stay separated.

In 2020? Nothing. become president 2021. Ill slave pinata make LeBron makes. day Headline weeks: 
As thousands athletes get coronavirus **vaccines**, nurses wonder: us? None occurring. brother even refuses wear mask. Covid flu, dontchaknow ""It's possible could within days, goal make sure certainly within weeks.‚Äù Wow country get paid work quarantine. Also got covid tests, work use sick time. Trump screw up? know sucks. want give impression monster. get it. I'm saying much public leaders get it. things greatly prolonging pandemic. fear country going go thru 4, 5 weeks. Chinese grandparents whole ‚Äònother breed. dont Sure specifically said unpaid Sounds illegal Why, shouldn‚Äôt tested weekly also? Heart disease kills 500k year America - Every year.

What corona taught take Heart disease serious, corona virus Fad Yeah man, fuck country. I‚Äôve worked minimum wage pretty much entire adult life, it‚Äôs amazing entitled bosses been. Yea article behind paywall first thought tests limited given athletes instead healthcare professionals. 


But it‚Äôs actually hospitals wanting test staff, prioritizing tests professional sports. It‚Äôs good thing athletes getting lots COVID testing supply isn‚Äôt issue case every single group project college? fact Azn friends said preferred partnering Asians least knew others would fair share. No. seriously. Socks. Save money. Sad reality many hospitals collapse. basically pipeline already, Americans watching horror next weeks/month going look like. Actors athletes problem, really convenient distraction though look incentives. dont like it, incentivize something else want see family, ffs. thought warnings!

-The owner probably. I‚Äôm geographical idiot. Thank you. :)  I'm so, sorry.

This one big fears. could lose grandmother even without covid - quite elderly health issues. attending funeral make family pariah, comforting mother person break hearts.

Thankfully, undiscovered heart issue found recently serious round hospital. treated, seems better years.

How supposed work?

Shouldn't critical workers first? First you‚Äôre missing point OP making 2nd it‚Äôs lot hitting genetic lottery done much better US, get lot less flack obvious deceit mismanagement there.

That's partially true, think media tends focus America's missteps that's pulls ratings. People seem gravitate towards news shows America bad light. Probably conservative, cuz ya know they‚Äôre ones still wearing masks point.
